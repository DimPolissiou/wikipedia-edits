{"title_page": "Go equipment", "text_new": "{{GoBoardGame}}\n'''Go equipment''' consists of the objects that are necessary in order to play the game of '''[[Go (game)|Go]]''' which originated in China. Although the equipment is simple, there is a varying degree of quality and material used in making the equipment, from the economical to the extremely valuable.\n\n==History==\nThe oldest known surviving Go equipment is a board carved from rock that dates from the [[Han Dynasty]] in [[China]]. Other examples of ancient equipment can be found in museums in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].\n\n==Equipment==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Go handicaps]] -->\n\n===Board===\n[[Image:Blank Go board.svg|thumb|An empty go board, with the 19x19 intersecting lines]]\n\nThe Go board, called the ''[https://sentego.net/go-board/ goban]'' {{nihongo2|\u7881\u76e4}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is the playing surface on which to place the stones. The standard board is marked with a 19\u00d719 grid.  Smaller boards include a 13\u00d713 grid and a 9\u00d79 grid used for shorter games that are often used to teach beginners. Some 19\u00d719 boards have a 13\u00d713 grid on the reverse side. 17\u00d717 was used in historical times. Chinese boards are generally square; Japanese and Korean boards are slightly longer than wide, so that they [[foreshortening|appear square]] when viewed from a normal playing position. In Asian go parlors, the tables are slightly lower than the typical game table so that the players can clearly see the positions of the stones.\n\nTraditional Japanese ''goban'' usually follow the dimensions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! mm !! inch !! [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]]\n|-\n| Board width                || 424.2 || {{frac|16|23|32}} || 1.4 ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' {{nihongo2|\u5c3a}}\n|-\n| Board length               || 454.5 || {{frac|17|29|32}} || 1.5 ''shaku'' {{nihongo2|\u5c3a}}\n|-\n| Board thickness            || 151.5 ||  {{frac|5|31|32}} || 0.5 ''shaku'' {{nihongo2|\u5c3a}}\n|-\n| Line spacing width-wise    || 22    ||     {{frac|7|8}}  || 7.26 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Line spacing length-wise   || 23.7  ||    {{frac|15|16}} || 7.82 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Line thickness             || 1     ||     {{frac|1|32}} || 0.3 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Star point marker diameter || 4     ||     {{frac|5|32}} || 1.2 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Stone diameter             || 22.5  ||    {{frac|29|32}} || 7.5 bu {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|}\n(1&nbsp;inch = 25.4&nbsp;mm; 1 shaku = 100 bu = 303&nbsp;mm)\n\nGo boards fall into several types or styles.\n*Economical boards comprise paper, plastic, or laminate, which can easily be folded away and stored. They are often used by beginners or for when one does not have a proper set available. A board can be hand-drawn on a stiff piece of cardboard for the super-economical.\n*Boards that comprise fabric, paper, or plastic may be rolled into a tube and easily carried along with stones to make a portable set. Some materials hold strongly onto the warp though and need to be weighted at the corners to make the board usable when unrolled.\n*Magnetic sets are also available, which comprise metal boards and stones that include magnets. They are useful for traveling.  Large magnetic boards are also available for demonstration purposes, during lectures and other presentations.\n*Wooden boards, one to two inches thick, are commonly used. They are known as \"table boards\" because they are placed on tables (compare \"floor board\" below.) The wood grain is pleasing to the eye, and the stones make a nice sound when placed firmly on the board. Portable boards can be made with hinges or slots.  Some have grids on the reverse.  Boards have been made from almost every type of wood, which includes [[particle board]] with or without [[Wood veneer|veneer]].  Wood, such as [[spruce]] or [[Cercidiphyllum|katsura]] {{nihongo2|\u6842}}, that has a light color with a fine grain that does not compete with the grid lines is considered most suitable.   The most valued boards are made from [[Torreya nucifera|kaya]], which is a mellow yellow. Also available are [[bamboo]] boards. The tensile strength of bamboo is comparable to that of steel<ref>[http://www.discovermagazine.com/1996/jun/thebamboosolutio784 The Bamboo Solution], ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''</ref> making it very durable but also heavier than other wooden boards of the same size.\n*A wooden floor board with legs is the most traditional, elegant, and expensive of all boards. Historically, to play on these boards, the Japanese would sit on [[tatami]] mats.  The legs are carved to resemble [[gardenias]].  These boards are still used for important tournament games in Asia. Chinese versions of floor boards are not always made from blocks of wood, and more closely resemble a small table with an inlaid go board. The legs raise the board to the correct height. The board can range from 14\u201321&nbsp;cm high. The thickest boards are the most elegant. The undersides often have a square recesses (''heso'') to prevent warping and to amplify the sounds of the stones hitting the surface. The best boards are made from Miyazaki kaya, which is rare. These are classified according to the quality of the wood grain. ''Itame'' refers to a bent or irregular grain; ''masame'' refers to consistent grain that runs straight across the top of the board. ''Masame'' boards are further classified as ''tenmasa'' (the top grain is straight, but grain along the cut end is curved, as in the illustration), and most-prized ''tenchimasa'' (grain is straight along the cut end as well as on top.)  Prices of kaya boards range from US$1,000 to $20,000 plus. Boards made of other woods, such as [[Picea sitchensis|Alaskan spruce]], [[Agathis]], or katsura are cheaper, around $500 to $2,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n====Taking care of boards====\n{{Manual|date=August 2011}}\nMaintaining wooden boards requires that they be properly stored in a humidity and temperature controlled environment to prevent discoloration, warping, cracking, [[woodworm]], [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and other serious wear.  Prolonged exposure to sunlight can bleach the board. Boards transported between climates with significantly differing humidity levels may be subjected to warping or cracking due to rapidly changing moisture content in the wood.\n\n===Stones===\n[[File:Stones go.jpg|thumb|Glass Go stones]]\nGo stones, or ''go-ishi'' {{nihongo2|\u7881\u77f3,\u68cb\u5b50}}, are round objects placed on the board.  They are colored either black or white, for each player, and normally number 181 for black and 180 for white (or sometimes 180 for each).\n\nThere are two styles or shapes of stones depending on where a player obtains them from:\n*The Japanese and Korean style, which is lens shaped (i.e. biconvex). This is the most popular style.\n*The Chinese style, called ''[[yunzi]]'' {{lang|zh|\u96f2\u5b50,\u4e91\u5b50}}, or 'cloud' also abbreviation for \"[[Yunnan]] pebble\", because they are normally flat underneath and convex on top. This style is less common outside of China. Flat bottom stones can be useful for post-game analysis; by placing stones upside down, players can easily keep track of which stones were part of the original game. However, they are harder to pick up when clearing them from the board. Yunzi is also available in double convex shape.\n\nThe material varies. Some stones are made out of [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[porcelain]] or [[marble]], but the traditional Japanese and Korean stones are made out of [[slate]] for black and [[clam]]shell for white. Chinese style stones can be made of glass, but to be considered true [[yunzi]] they must be [[Sintering|sintered]]. The exact method of creation is a well-kept secret and was in fact lost for a time in the early 20th century due to instability within the country.\n\n====Stone dimensions====\n\nStone thickness can also vary, from as low as 4 millimeters or as high as 12.8 millimeters, with most between 7.0&nbsp;mm and 10.1&nbsp;mm for biconvex and 5\u20137&nbsp;mm for single convex. Thick slate and shell stones can last for generations, slowly becoming thinner from handling, and gradually acquiring an ivory-like patina. The diameter of the stones is standardized to around 22&nbsp;mm \u00b11&nbsp;mm, which can fit almost all Go boards. Black stones are slightly larger in diameter to compensate for optical illusion of the white stones appearing larger when placed with black stones of the same diameter. This mostly applies to Korean and Japanese stones \u2013 Chinese stones tend to be sometimes larger in diameter, but they do come in different standard sizes. A Chinese \"large\" size is about 23&nbsp;mm in diameter while \"medium\" is about 22&nbsp;mm. Chinese board dimensions are also accordingly larger to accommodate them. See also some comparative measurements of various go stone sets.<ref>[http://www.godiscussions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3353 Comparative measurements of go stones]</ref>\n\nFor the most expensive clamshell and slate Go stones, stone thickness is carefully controlled and ranked according to size. Typical stone sizes are size 25 (7.0&nbsp;mm thick) to size 37 (10.4&nbsp;mm), and even thicker stones are available for a correspondingly much higher price. Commonly used shell and slate Go stone thicknesses are size 32 (8.8&nbsp;mm) and size 33 (9.2&nbsp;mm) for most individuals and size 36 (10.1&nbsp;mm) for professionals. Stones thicker than 10.1&nbsp;mm are difficult to place on the board, while many Go players prefer stones that are 8.8 and 9.2&nbsp;mm thick, considering these the optimum thickness for aesthetic and practical reasons.\n\n====Plastic stones====\nGenerally, these are the cheapest stones available. They range from flat, counter shaped to the typical lens shape. Price ranges from around $5\u2013$30.\n\nOne specific type of plastic stone is called the Ing stone, manufactured by the Ing Chang-ki Wei-chi Education Foundation. These are the official stones of the Ing Foundation and have some extra weight to them due to metal inserted in the middle of the stone. They are 10&nbsp;mm thick and sometimes come in an Ing Bowl, which is specially designed to count them (Ing rules require each player to start with exactly 180 stones).\n\nStones can also be made from [[Melamine resin]]. This is a stable [[Chemical compound|compound]] used in making countertops and other kitchenware and is considered safe.\n\n====Porcelain stones====\nPorcelain stones are the least common material for stones.\n\n====Glass stones====\nThe most widely used and most economical. They range from thinner flat-bottomed style, to a symmetrical lens shape. Glass stones have the correct weight and can be grasped with ease. White stones are polished and black ones are buffed to a matte finish, giving a feel somewhat like slate and clam stones. Price ranges from US$15 to $80 for glass stones with bowls. Glass 'gems' at an arts and crafts store are an inexpensive alternative.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==== Slate and clamshell stones ====\nThese are usually the most expensive stones one can get, since each stone is handmade using mechanical grinding and polishing equipment. The black stones are made of [[slate]], while the white stones are made from [[Bivalve shell|clamshell]]s. Due to a single clam shell yielding only a limited number of stones (around three), white stones are expensive to produce. The clamshells used to make the white stones used to be farmed from Japan, but since the supply is dwindling, most clamshells are harvested from [[Baja California]] in Mexico. These stones have three grades, depending on the stripe or grain pattern of the white stones. All grades use the same uniform black slate stones. Shell stones may also rarely be made out of the [[giant clam]] (shako in Japanese) shell, as well as a clam shell that has a slight purple tint. Clamshell stones are cut as cylinders using a diamond coring drill, then professionally ground, sanded, shaped, and polished into the final product. Shell and slate stones are natural products that provide the ultimate in Go stone aesthetics, and even the lowest grade are far more expensive than the common plastic, glass, and ceramic stones. The price for a set of shell and slate stones ranges from US$200 to over $5,000 according to grade, thicker stones by large costing progressively more within each grade, especially within the Yuki grade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n*Jitsuyo (practical, standard, or utility-grade) are stones with a coarse grain across the stone, with 7 or 8 wide stripes. The stones are cut near the joint of the shell.\n*Tsuki (moon-grade) are stones with a finer grain pattern, with more and thinner stripes covering about 70% of the stone. They are cut around the middle of the shell. These are considered the 'in-between' quality.\n*Yuki (snow-grade) are stones with a uniform, fine, straight grain across the stone, with many fine stripes covering at least 80% of the stone. They are cut from near the edge of the shell. These are considered the best by Japanese tastes, and are the most expensive, considering it is difficult to cut a stone with a great deal of thickness since the edge of the shell is mostly thin. The price ranges from $200 to over $35,000, the thicker stones costing more.\n\n====Yunzi stones====\n{{Main|Yunzi}}\nYunzi is a style of stone first produced in the Tang Dynasty in China by sintering a trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds including agate (resulting in the slightly yellow-green hue of traditional yunzi stones). The term \"yunzi\" traditionally applies to stones made of this material, but can refer to any single-convex stone of average Chinese dimensions (slightly larger than a Japanese stone). The process of making Yunzi was lost in the 1920s when the Chinese Civil War spread to Yunnan province, but in the late 1960s it was rediscovered by the now state-managed Yunzi Company. The Yunzi company claims their stones have an advantage of a pleasant sound when placed on the board. Yunzi are delicately made with a jade-like luster yet are neither brittle nor slippery. The black and white pieces each have their special qualities. The white pieces are opaque with a tint of yellow or green. The black pieces are dark, and when held to the light a translucent green hue. With new technology, Yunzi stones can now be made pure white without any discolorations.\n\n====Stone etiquette====\nWhen not making a move, one should leave one's stones in the bowl. During the opponent's turn, it is considered rude for players to rattle stones in the bowl.  It is also considered improper to hold a handful of stones. The \"correct\" procedure is to decide upon one's move, then remove one stone from the bowl and place it on the board. This produces the minimal amount of distraction for one's opponent.\n\nWhen removing a stone from its bowl to make a move, place a flat hand on the edge of the bowl, with the fingers gently entering the bowl. Pick up a stone [[Chopsticks|chopstick]]-style with the index and middle fingers, holding the stone between the index fingernail and the middle fingertip.  The fingers extend almost straight, and the thumb is not tucked in.\n\nWhen placing the stone, take care that long [[sleeve]]s are brushed up to avoid knocking stones already played. To place the stone on the board, as soon as the fingertip of index finger is about to reach the surface of the board, it slips to the side, allowing the middle finger to aim the stone down towards the surface and connect (the other fingers and thumb naturally spread outwards). With a little practice a stone can be placed gracefully and forcefully and with a big click. The keys to a loud click are the force of the middle finger and the late release of the stone. Once the stone has been placed, the middle finger and hand slowly lifts off the stone (trying to avoid wobbling the stone) and gently retreats back to the player.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?HowToHoldAndPlayAGoStone How to hold and play a go stone]</ref>\n\nAlthough it is permissible to place one's stone at times with a loud, satisfying \"thwack\", one who does so with every move would be considered crude or vulgar. For instance, when submitting to an opponent's threat, a quiet placement is more in keeping with circumstances; probing moves or clever responses may be slid slyly into place. The ability to express oneself in the manner of making a move explains why one of the names for the game is \"hand talk\" (\"''shudan''\" in Japanese, \"''shoutan''\" in Chinese).\n\n====Taking care of stones====\n{{Manual|date=August 2011}}\nNew stones (of any variety except slate and clamshell) should be washed in warm (soapy) water to remove any oils or chalk by-products of their manufacture or storage protection, then dried thoroughly. Do not use soap when cleaning clamshell stones; new clamshell stones should not need cleaning. New slate stones should be cleaned of excess mineral oil with a cotton cloth. When using stones, one should not slap the stones down too hard. When finished, they should be either kept in their bowls or original packaging and stored away from sunlight and heat. Placing a soft cloth in the bottom of the bowl can help to minimize chipping of stones.\n\n===Bowls===\n[[File:Meijin Sen 1.jpg|thumb|Wooden Go bowls on a Japanese-style floor board]]\nGo bowls, or ''go-ke'' are the containers for the stones. Although not strictly needed to play Go, bowls nevertheless play an important role in storing the stones, and captured stones can be placed on the lids. Bowls are identical, with one holding the white stones and one holding the black stones.\n\nA bowl's lid is usually rather loose and not tightly fit.  A player traditionally places the lid upside down next to the open bowl and keeps stones there that they have captured from the opponent. The lid is placed so it's easily visible by the opponent, so each player knows how many prisoners the opponent has that are physically removed from the playing board.\n\nThe Go bowl can be made of several different materials.\n*[[Plastic]]: Very cheap, they can be cylinder shaped or square shaped. The price is around US$5. Quart size plastic food storage containers can also be used.\n*[[Straw]]: Mostly used by the Chinese. They are made of woven straw. The price is around US$10\u201325.\n*[[Wood]]: The most common material used to make bowls. The type of [[wood]] used affects the price considerably. [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry]] is one of the most striking and expensive. Intermediate woods are [[quince]] (karin in Japanese), [[Torreya nucifera|kaya]], [[cherry]], [[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]], and [[rosewood]]. Cheaper ones are made out of [[beech]] or [[chestnut]]. [[Bamboo]] also makes for a nice, low-cost bowl. The bowl can be polished. The best bowls are carved from a single piece of wood and have their grains highlighted. The price range varies from $50 to thousands of dollars.\n\nNot all bowls can fit a full set of stones. Most can only hold stones with a thickness of up to 10&nbsp;mm. Larger and more expensive bowls hold stones of thickness of up to 12&nbsp;mm since one would buy thicker and more expensive stones to match the quality of the bowl.\n\nThe bowls of highest quality and price are traditionally used only for the best shell and slate stones, of Yuki (snow-grade) quality. Lesser quality wood bowls likewise are used for Jitsuyo (standard-grade) and Tsuki (moon-grade) shell and slate stones, and glass stones are traditionally stored in the least expensive wood bowls or in plastic bowls. A list of woods used in Japanese Go bowls with photographs is available.<ref>[http://www.cybercomputing.com/go/go-bowls/index.htm Woods Used in Japanese Go Bowls]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Games played with Go equipment]]\n* [[Go (game)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Go equipment}}\n*[https://www.usgo.org/buying-go-equipment-and-supplies Buying Go Equipment and Supplies], [[American Go Association]]\n*[http://senseis.xmp.net/?MakingYourOwnEquipment Making Your Own Equipment and taking care of it], [[Sensei's Library]]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Go Equipment}}\n[[Category:Go (game)]]\n[[Category:Game equipment]]\n", "text_old": "{{GoBoardGame}}\n'''Go equipment''' consists of the objects that are necessary in order to play the game of '''[[Go (game)|Go]]''' which originated in China. Although the equipment is simple, there is a varying degree of quality and material used in making the equipment, from the economical to the extremely valuable.\n\n==History==\nThe oldest known surviving Go equipment is a board carved from rock that dates from the [[Han Dynasty]] in [[China]]. Other examples of ancient equipment can be found in museums in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].\n\n==Equipment==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Go handicaps]] -->\n\n===Board===\n[[Image:Blank Go board.svg|thumb|An empty go board, with the 19x19 intersecting lines]]\n\nThe Go board, called the ''[https://sentego.net/go-board/ goban]'' {{nihongo2|\u7881\u76e4}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is the playing surface on which to place the stones. The standard board is marked with a 19\u00d719 grid.  Smaller boards include a 13\u00d713 grid and a 9\u00d79 grid used for shorter games that are often used to teach beginners. Some 19\u00d719 boards have a 13\u00d713 grid on the reverse side. 17\u00d717 was used in historical times. Chinese boards are generally square; Japanese and Korean boards are slightly longer than wide, so that they [[foreshortening|appear square]] when viewed from a normal playing position. In Asian go parlors, the tables are slightly lower than the typical game table so that the players can clearly see the positions of the stones.\n\nTraditional Japanese ''goban'' usually follow the dimensions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! mm !! inch !! [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]]\n|-\n| Board width                || 424.2 || {{frac|16|23|32}} || 1.4 ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' {{nihongo2|\u5c3a}}\n|-\n| Board length               || 454.5 || {{frac|17|29|32}} || 1.5 ''shaku'' {{nihongo2|\u5c3a}}\n|-\n| Board thickness            || 151.5 ||  {{frac|5|31|32}} || 0.5 ''shaku'' {{nihongo2|\u5c3a}}\n|-\n| Line spacing width-wise    || 22    ||     {{frac|7|8}}  || 7.26 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Line spacing length-wise   || 23.7  ||    {{frac|15|16}} || 7.82 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Line thickness             || 1     ||     {{frac|1|32}} || 0.3 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Star point marker diameter || 4     ||     {{frac|5|32}} || 1.2 ''bu'' {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|-\n| Stone diameter             || 22.5  ||    {{frac|29|32}} || 7.5 bu {{nihongo2|\u5206}}\n|}\n(1&nbsp;inch = 25.4&nbsp;mm; 1 shaku = 100 bu = 303&nbsp;mm)\n\nGo boards fall into several types or styles.\n*Economical boards comprise paper, plastic, or laminate, which can easily be folded away and stored. They are often used by beginners or for when one does not have a proper set available. A board can be hand-drawn on a stiff piece of cardboard for the super-economical.\n*Boards that comprise fabric, paper, or plastic may be rolled into a tube and easily carried along with stones to make a portable set. Some materials hold strongly onto the warp though and need to be weighted at the corners to make the board usable when unrolled.\n*Magnetic sets are also available, which comprise metal boards and stones that include magnets. They are useful for traveling.  Large magnetic boards are also available for demonstration purposes, during lectures and other presentations.\n*Wooden boards, one to two inches thick, are commonly used. They are known as \"table boards\" because they are placed on tables (compare \"floor board\" below.) The wood grain is pleasing to the eye, and the stones make a nice sound when placed firmly on the board. Portable boards can be made with hinges or slots.  Some have grids on the reverse.  Boards have been made from almost every type of wood, which includes [[particle board]] with or without [[Wood veneer|veneer]].  Wood, such as [[spruce]] or [[Cercidiphyllum|katsura]] {{nihongo2|\u6842}}, that has a light color with a fine grain that does not compete with the grid lines is considered most suitable.   The most valued boards are made from [[Torreya nucifera|kaya]], which is a mellow yellow. Also available are [[bamboo]] boards. The tensile strength of bamboo is comparable to that of steel<ref>[http://www.discovermagazine.com/1996/jun/thebamboosolutio784 The Bamboo Solution], ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''</ref> making it very durable but also heavier than other wooden boards of the same size.\n*A wooden floor board with legs is the most traditional, elegant, and expensive of all boards. Historically, to play on these boards, the Japanese would sit on [[tatami]] mats.  The legs are carved to resemble [[gardenias]].  These boards are still used for important tournament games in Asia. Chinese versions of floor boards are not always made from blocks of wood, and more closely resemble a small table with an inlaid go board. The legs raise the board to the correct height. The board can range from 14\u201321&nbsp;cm high. The thickest boards are the most elegant. The undersides often have a square recesses (''heso'') to prevent warping and to amplify the sounds of the stones hitting the surface. The best boards are made from Miyazaki kaya, which is rare. These are classified according to the quality of the wood grain. ''Itame'' refers to a bent or irregular grain; ''masame'' refers to consistent grain that runs straight across the top of the board. ''Masame'' boards are further classified as ''tenmasa'' (the top grain is straight, but grain along the cut end is curved, as in the illustration), and most-prized ''tenchimasa'' (grain is straight along the cut end as well as on top.)  Prices of kaya boards range from US$1,000 to $20,000 plus. Boards made of other woods, such as [[Picea sitchensis|Alaskan spruce]], [[Agathis]], or katsura are cheaper, around $500 to $2,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n====Taking care of boards====\n{{Manual|date=August 2011}}\nMaintaining wooden boards requires that they be properly stored in a humidity and temperature controlled environment to prevent discoloration, warping, cracking, [[woodworm]], [[mold]] and other serious wear.  Prolonged exposure to sunlight can bleach the board. Boards transported between climates with significantly differing humidity levels may be subjected to warping or cracking due to rapidly changing moisture content in the wood.\n\n===Stones===\n[[File:Stones go.jpg|thumb|Glass Go stones]]\nGo stones, or ''go-ishi'' {{nihongo2|\u7881\u77f3,\u68cb\u5b50}}, are round objects placed on the board.  They are colored either black or white, for each player, and normally number 181 for black and 180 for white (or sometimes 180 for each).\n\nThere are two styles or shapes of stones depending on where a player obtains them from:\n*The Japanese and Korean style, which is lens shaped (i.e. biconvex). This is the most popular style.\n*The Chinese style, called ''[[yunzi]]'' {{lang|zh|\u96f2\u5b50,\u4e91\u5b50}}, or 'cloud' also abbreviation for \"[[Yunnan]] pebble\", because they are normally flat underneath and convex on top. This style is less common outside of China. Flat bottom stones can be useful for post-game analysis; by placing stones upside down, players can easily keep track of which stones were part of the original game. However, they are harder to pick up when clearing them from the board. Yunzi is also available in double convex shape.\n\nThe material varies. Some stones are made out of [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[porcelain]] or [[marble]], but the traditional Japanese and Korean stones are made out of [[slate]] for black and [[clam]]shell for white. Chinese style stones can be made of glass, but to be considered true [[yunzi]] they must be [[Sintering|sintered]]. The exact method of creation is a well-kept secret and was in fact lost for a time in the early 20th century due to instability within the country.\n\n====Stone dimensions====\n\nStone thickness can also vary, from as low as 4 millimeters or as high as 12.8 millimeters, with most between 7.0&nbsp;mm and 10.1&nbsp;mm for biconvex and 5\u20137&nbsp;mm for single convex. Thick slate and shell stones can last for generations, slowly becoming thinner from handling, and gradually acquiring an ivory-like patina. The diameter of the stones is standardized to around 22&nbsp;mm \u00b11&nbsp;mm, which can fit almost all Go boards. Black stones are slightly larger in diameter to compensate for optical illusion of the white stones appearing larger when placed with black stones of the same diameter. This mostly applies to Korean and Japanese stones \u2013 Chinese stones tend to be sometimes larger in diameter, but they do come in different standard sizes. A Chinese \"large\" size is about 23&nbsp;mm in diameter while \"medium\" is about 22&nbsp;mm. Chinese board dimensions are also accordingly larger to accommodate them. See also some comparative measurements of various go stone sets.<ref>[http://www.godiscussions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3353 Comparative measurements of go stones]</ref>\n\nFor the most expensive clamshell and slate Go stones, stone thickness is carefully controlled and ranked according to size. Typical stone sizes are size 25 (7.0&nbsp;mm thick) to size 37 (10.4&nbsp;mm), and even thicker stones are available for a correspondingly much higher price. Commonly used shell and slate Go stone thicknesses are size 32 (8.8&nbsp;mm) and size 33 (9.2&nbsp;mm) for most individuals and size 36 (10.1&nbsp;mm) for professionals. Stones thicker than 10.1&nbsp;mm are difficult to place on the board, while many Go players prefer stones that are 8.8 and 9.2&nbsp;mm thick, considering these the optimum thickness for aesthetic and practical reasons.\n\n====Plastic stones====\nGenerally, these are the cheapest stones available. They range from flat, counter shaped to the typical lens shape. Price ranges from around $5\u2013$30.\n\nOne specific type of plastic stone is called the Ing stone, manufactured by the Ing Chang-ki Wei-chi Education Foundation. These are the official stones of the Ing Foundation and have some extra weight to them due to metal inserted in the middle of the stone. They are 10&nbsp;mm thick and sometimes come in an Ing Bowl, which is specially designed to count them (Ing rules require each player to start with exactly 180 stones).\n\nStones can also be made from [[Melamine resin]]. This is a stable [[Chemical compound|compound]] used in making countertops and other kitchenware and is considered safe.\n\n====Porcelain stones====\nPorcelain stones are the least common material for stones.\n\n====Glass stones====\nThe most widely used and most economical. They range from thinner flat-bottomed style, to a symmetrical lens shape. Glass stones have the correct weight and can be grasped with ease. White stones are polished and black ones are buffed to a matte finish, giving a feel somewhat like slate and clam stones. Price ranges from US$15 to $80 for glass stones with bowls. Glass 'gems' at an arts and crafts store are an inexpensive alternative.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==== Slate and clamshell stones ====\nThese are usually the most expensive stones one can get, since each stone is handmade using mechanical grinding and polishing equipment. The black stones are made of [[slate]], while the white stones are made from [[Bivalve shell|clamshell]]s. Due to a single clam shell yielding only a limited number of stones (around three), white stones are expensive to produce. The clamshells used to make the white stones used to be farmed from Japan, but since the supply is dwindling, most clamshells are harvested from [[Baja California]] in Mexico. These stones have three grades, depending on the stripe or grain pattern of the white stones. All grades use the same uniform black slate stones. Shell stones may also rarely be made out of the [[giant clam]] (shako in Japanese) shell, as well as a clam shell that has a slight purple tint. Clamshell stones are cut as cylinders using a diamond coring drill, then professionally ground, sanded, shaped, and polished into the final product. Shell and slate stones are natural products that provide the ultimate in Go stone aesthetics, and even the lowest grade are far more expensive than the common plastic, glass, and ceramic stones. The price for a set of shell and slate stones ranges from US$200 to over $5,000 according to grade, thicker stones by large costing progressively more within each grade, especially within the Yuki grade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n*Jitsuyo (practical, standard, or utility-grade) are stones with a coarse grain across the stone, with 7 or 8 wide stripes.

One significant tornado occurred in communities south and east of [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] The F4  tornado killed 11 people and injured more than 125 others. It was the strongest tornado to hit the state of Alabama in the month of December since 1950.\n\n==Tuscaloosa tornado event==\n[[Image:Tuscaloosa map.gif|thumb|The tornado's track]]\nThe tornado touched down just before 1:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT near the [[Black Warrior River]] in southern [[Tuscaloosa County]] and proceeded northeastward for 18 miles (28.8&nbsp;km) across the communities of Englewood, Hinton Place, Hillcrest Meadows,  Bear Creek and Woodland Forest. A [[tornado emergency]] was issued for the area before it lifted near Cottondale east of Tuscaloosa near [[Interstate 20]]. At its peak intensity, the tornado was about 750 yards wide. The worst damage was located near the Bear Creek and Hillcrest Meadows areas where F4 damage occurred and homes were completely leveled.

The [[wet season]] ends during the summer when the [[subtropical ridge]] becomes strong enough to push this front north of the region. These weather systems can produce heavy rainfall and flooding.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"plum rain\" was a Chinese term for the rain in the fourth and fifth lunar month.<ref name=owdf/><ref name=lu-piya>Lu Dian's ''[[Piya]]'' (published in the Song dynasty).

The front and the formation of [[extratropical cyclone|frontal depressions]] along it brings precipitation to Primorsky Krai, Japan, Korea, eastern China, and Taiwan. As the front moves back and forth depending on the strength of cool and warm air masses, there is often prolonged precipitation and sometimes flooding in eastern [[China]]. However, in the years that it does not rain as much as usual, a drought might result. The rainy season ends when the warm air mass associated with the subtropical ridge is strong enough to push the front north and away.\n\n==Effects==\nThe high [[humidity]] in the air during this season encourages the formation of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[Decomposition|rot]] not only on food but on fabrics as well.\nEnvironmentally, heavy rains encourage [[mudslides]] and flooding in all areas affected. The most rain in a one-hour period as recorded in Japan was in [[Nagasaki]] in 1982 with 153&nbsp;mm. The highest overall recorded rainfall during the rainy season in Japan was in 2003 when [[Miyazaki Prefecture]] recorded rains of 8670&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Japan===\nIn Japan, the rainy season is called ''Tsuyu'' (\u6885\u96e8) and lasts from early June to mid-July for most of the country (on the main island of [[Honshu|Honsh\u016b]] and the islands of [[Kyushu|Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and [[Shikoku]]), approximately June 7 to July 20 for the main [[Kansai region|Kansai]] and [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] regions.<ref name=\"jg\">[http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2277.html Rainy Season (Tsuyu)], japan-guide.com</ref> It comes a month earlier to Okinawa in the south (early May through mid-June), but [[Hokkaido|Hokkaid\u014d]] in the north is largely unaffected. The season is occasionally called {{nihongo||\u4e94\u6708\u96e8|Samidare|literally \"May Rain (in [[Lunisolar calendar|Japanese traditional calendar]])\"; corresponds roughly to June in modern calendar}} on account of this timing. The pop artist [[Eiichi Ohtaki]] produced a popular song by this name, and a WW2 [[Japanese destroyer Samidare (1935)|Japanese naval ship]] was also given this name.\n\nThe rains in the middle of November - early December are sometimes called the ''Sazanka Tsuyu'', literally \"rainy season of the [[Camellia sasanqua|Camellia]]\" on account of the timing with the blossoming of the seasonal flower.\n\nThis period is generally avoided for tourism, but some sights are considered particularly atmospheric in the rain and fog, particularly mountain forests, notably [[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range]] (including [[Mount K\u014dya]]).<ref name=\"jg\" /> Vegetation, especially moss, is also rather lush at this time, and hence sights known for their moss, such as [[Saih\u014d-ji (Kyoto)|Saih\u014d-ji]] (the moss temple) are also popular at this time of year.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Korea===\nThe rainy season is between June and mid-July. It is caused by hot and humid high pressure forming in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] due to the North Pacific anticyclone combining with Asiatic continental high pressure. When the two meteorological events meet they form a long ''jangmajeonseon'' ([[Hanja]]: \uc7a5\ub9c8\u524d\u7dda). Beginning in late-May, the North Pacific high pressure forces the weaker continental anticyclone south of the island of [[Okinawa]]. This fall to the south then reverses and gradually strengthens as it moves northwards back towards the Korean peninsula. On landfall, heavy monsoon rains lead to torrential downpours and flooding.

The [[wet season]] ends during the summer when the [[subtropical ridge]] becomes strong enough to push this front north of the region.

The front and the formation of [[extratropical cyclone|frontal depressions]] along it brings precipitation to Primorsky Krai, Japan, Korea, eastern China, and Taiwan. As the front moves back and forth depending on the strength of cool and warm air masses, there is often prolonged precipitation and sometimes flooding in eastern [[China]]. However, in the years that it does not rain as much as usual, a drought might result. The rainy season ends when the warm air mass associated with the subtropical ridge is strong enough to push the front north and away.\n\n==Effects==\nThe high [[humidity]] in the air during this season encourages the formation of [[mold]] and [[Decomposition|rot]] not only on food but on fabrics as well.\nEnvironmentally, heavy rains encourage [[mudslides]] and flooding in all areas affected. The most rain in a one-hour period as recorded in Japan was in [[Nagasaki]] in 1982 with 153&nbsp;mm. The highest overall recorded rainfall during the rainy season in Japan was in 2003 when [[Miyazaki Prefecture]] recorded rains of 8670&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Japan===\nIn Japan, the rainy season is called ''Tsuyu'' (\u6885\u96e8) and lasts from early June to mid-July for most of the country (on the main island of [[Honshu|Honsh\u016b]] and the islands of [[Kyushu|Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and [[Shikoku]]), approximately June 7 to July 20 for the main [[Kansai region|Kansai]] and [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] regions.<ref name=\"jg\">[http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2277.html Rainy Season (Tsuyu)], japan-guide.com</ref> It comes a month earlier to Okinawa in the south (early May through mid-June), but [[Hokkaido|Hokkaid\u014d]] in the north is largely unaffected. The season is occasionally called {{nihongo||\u4e94\u6708\u96e8|Samidare|literally \"May Rain (in [[Lunisolar calendar|Japanese traditional calendar]])\"; corresponds roughly to June in modern calendar}} on account of this timing. The pop artist [[Eiichi Ohtaki]] produced a popular song by this name, and a WW2 [[Japanese destroyer Samidare (1935)|Japanese naval ship]] was also given this name.\n\nThe rains in the middle of November - early December are sometimes called the ''Sazanka Tsuyu'', literally \"rainy season of the [[Camellia sasanqua|Camellia]]\" on account of the timing with the blossoming of the seasonal flower.\n\nThis period is generally avoided for tourism, but some sights are considered particularly atmospheric in the rain and fog, particularly mountain forests, notably [[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range]] (including [[Mount K\u014dya]]).<ref name=\"jg\" /> Vegetation, especially moss, is also rather lush at this time, and hence sights known for their moss, such as [[Saih\u014d-ji (Kyoto)|Saih\u014d-ji]] (the moss temple) are also popular at this time of year.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Korea===\nThe rainy season is between June and mid-July. It is caused by hot and humid high pressure forming in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] due to the North Pacific anticyclone combining with Asiatic continental high pressure. When the two meteorological events meet they form a long ''jangmajeonseon'' ([[Hanja]]: \uc7a5\ub9c8\u524d\u7dda). Beginning in late-May, the North Pacific high pressure forces the weaker continental anticyclone south of the island of [[Okinawa]]. This fall to the south then reverses and gradually strengthens as it moves northwards back towards the Korean peninsula. On landfall, heavy monsoon rains lead to torrential downpours and flooding. By August the system has weakened as the southern systems retreat towards the Filipino archipelago.\n\nBy early autumn, the North Pacific high-pressure system is pushed away as Asiatic continental cold high pressure moves southwards. This produces inclement weather although not on the scale of the summer monsoons. Korea can, however, be struck by typhoons during this period.\n\n== Timing ==\nIn some years, the rainy season's actual beginning and end are under debate. For example, in 2005, the subtropical ridge moved quickly northward in late June/early July. The weather front skipped the [[Yangtze River|Chang Jiang]] region and there was no rainy season there. Then, the ridge retreated southward and there was significant rainfall in the region.

Electrical resistance can only be used for heating; when space cooling is also required, hydronic systems must be used. Other applications for which either electric or hydronic systems are suited include [[Snowmelt system|snow/ice melting]] for walks, driveways and landing pads, turf conditioning of football and soccer fields and frost prevention in freezers and skating rinks.

They can also be placed under the floor covering (\"dry system\") or attached directly to a wood sub floor (\"sub floor system\" or \"dry system\").\n\nSome commercial buildings are designed to take advantage of [[thermal mass]] which is heated or cooled during off peak hours when utility rates are lower. With the heating/cooling system turned off during the day, the concrete mass and room temperature drift up or down within the desired comfort range. Such systems are known as thermally activated building systems or TABS.<ref>Kolarik, J., Yang, L., Thermal mass activation (Chpt.5) with Expert Guide Part 2, IEA ECBSC Annex 44, Integrating environmentally responsive elements in buildings, 2009</ref><ref>Lehmann, B., Dorer, V., Koschenz, M., Application range of thermally activated building systems tabs, Energy and Buildings, 39:593\u2013598, 2007</ref>\n\n=== Hydronic systems ===\nHydronic systems use water or a mix of water and anti-freeze such as [[propylene glycol]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lowex.org/downloads/lowex-cases%20broshure.pdf|title=Low Temperature Heating Systems, Increased Energy Efficiency and Improved Comfort, Annex 37, International Energy Association|website=lowex.org}}</ref> as the heat transfer fluid in a \"closed loop\" that is recirculated between the floor and the boiler.\n\nVarious types of pipes are available specifically for hydronic underfloor heating and cooling systems and are generally made from [[polyethylene]] including [[PEX]], PEX-Al-PEX and PERT. Older materials such as [[Polybutylene]] (PB) and copper or steel pipe are still used in some locales or for specialized applications.\n\nHydronic systems require skilled designers and tradespeople familiar with boilers, circulators, controls, fluid pressures and temperature. The use of modern factory assembled sub-stations, used primarily in [[district heating and cooling]], can greatly simplify design requirements and reduce the installation and commissioning time of hydronic systems.\n\nHydronic systems can use a single source or combination of energy sources to help manage energy costs. Hydronic system '''energy source''' options are:\n*Boilers (heaters) including [[Combined heat and power plant]]s<ref group=notes>(CHP) (see also [[Micro combined heat and power|micro CHP]] and [[Home fuel cell|fuel cell]]</ref> heated by:\n**[[Natural gas]] or \"methane\" industry-wide is considered the cleanest and most efficient method of heating water, depending on availability.

Due to their low profile they can be installed in a [[thermal mass]] or directly under floor finishes. Electric systems can also take advantage of [[Electricity meter|time-of-use electricity metering]] and are frequently used as carpet heaters, portable under area rug heaters, under laminate floor heaters, under tile heating, under wood floor heating, and floor warming systems, including under shower floor and seat heating. Large electric systems also require skilled designers and tradespeople but this is less so for small floor warming systems. Electric systems use fewer components and are simpler to install and commission than hydronic systems. Some electric systems use line voltage technology while others use low voltage technology. Power consumption of an electric system is not based on voltage but rather wattage output produced by the heating element.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Thermal comfort quality===\nAs defined by [[ASHRAE 55|ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55]] \u2013 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, [[thermal comfort]] is, \"that condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation.\" Relating specifically to underfloor heating, thermal comfort is influenced by floor surface temperature and associated elements such as radiant asymmetry, [[mean radiant temperature]] and [[operative temperature]]. Research by Nevins, Rohles, Gagge, [[P. Ole Fanger]] et al. show that humans at rest with clothing typical of light office and home wear, exchange over 50% of their [[sensible heat]] via [[radiation]].\n\nUnderfloor heating influences the radiant exchange by warming the interior surfaces. The heating of the surfaces suppresses body heat loss resulting in a perception of heating comfort. This general sensation of comfort is further enhanced through [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]] (feet on floor) and through [[convection]] by the surface's influence on air [[density]]. Underfloor cooling works by absorbing both [[Shortwave radiation|short wave]] and long wave radiation resulting in cool interior surfaces. These cool surfaces encourage the loss of body heat resulting in a perception of cooling comfort. Localized discomfort due to cold and warm floors wearing normal foot wear and stocking feet is addressed in the ISO 7730 and ASHRAE 55 standards and ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbooks and can be corrected or regulated with floor heating and cooling systems.\n\n===Indoor air quality===\nUnderfloor heating can have a positive effect on the [[Indoor air quality|quality of indoor air]] by facilitating the choice of otherwise perceived [[Flooring#Hard flooring|cold flooring materials]] such as tile, slate, terrazzo and concrete. These masonry surfaces typically have very low VOC emissions ([[volatile organic compounds]]) in comparison to other [[flooring]] options. In conjunction with [[moisture]] control, floor heating also establishes temperature conditions that are less favorable in supporting [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], [[bacteria]], [[viruses]] and [[dust mites]].<ref>Boerstra A., Op \u00b4t Veld P., Eijdems H.

As with all FEA simulations, they depict a snap shot in time for a specific assembly and may not be representative of all floor assemblies nor for system that have been operative for considerable time in a steady state condition. The practical application of FEA for the engineer is being able to assess each design for fluid temperature, back losses and surface temperature quality. Through several iterations it is possible to optimize the design for the lowest fluid temperature in heating and the highest fluid temperature in cooling which enables combustion and compression equipment to achieve its maximum rated efficiency performance.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Modelling radiant tube patterns.png|Thermal diffusions and surface temperature quality (efficacy) of various piping layouts\nFile:FEA Output Screen Shots.png|Typical FEA output screen shots of wire mesh, thermal isotherms and color-coded mapping\n</gallery>\n\n==Economics==\nThere is a wide range of pricing for underfloor systems based on regional differences, materials, application and project complexity. It is widely adopted in the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]], [[Asia]]n and [[Europe]]an communities. Consequently, the market is more mature and systems relatively more affordable than less developed markets such as [[North America]] where market share for fluid based systems remains between 3% to 7% of HVAC systems (ref. [[Statistics Canada]] and [[United States Census Bureau]]).\n\nIn energy efficiency buildings such as [[Passive House]], [[R-2000 program|R-2000]] or [[Zero-energy building|Net Zero Energy]], simple [[thermostatic radiator valve]]s can be installed along with a single compact circulator and small condensing heater controlled without or with basic [[hot water reset]]<ref>Butcher, T., Hydronic baseboard thermal distribution system with outdoor reset control to enable the use of a condensing boiler, Brookhaven National Laboratory, (for) Office of Buildings Technology U.S. Department of Energy, October, 2004</ref> control. Economical electric resistance based systems also are useful in small zones such as bathrooms and kitchens, but also for entire buildings where heating loads are very low. Larger structures will need more [[Hydronics|sophisticated systems]] to deal with cooling and heating needs, and often require [[Building management system|building management control systems]] to regulate the energy use and control the overall indoor environment.\n\nLow temperature radiant heating and high temperature radiant cooling systems lend themselves well to [[District heating|district energy]] systems (community based systems) due to the temperature differentials between the plant and the buildings which allow small diameter insulated distribution networks and low pumping power requirements. The low return temperatures in heating and high return temperatures in cooling enable the district energy plant to achieve maximum efficiency.

For example, carpeting has a greater [[Thermal conductivity|resistance]] or lower [[Thermal conductivity|conductance]] than tile. Thus carpeted floors need to operate at higher internal temperatures than tile which can create lower efficiencies for boilers and heat pumps. However, when the floor covering is known at the time the system is installed, then the internal floor temperature required for a given covering can be achieved through proper tube spacing without sacrificing plant efficiency (though the higher internal floor temperatures may result in increased heat loss from the non-room surfaces of the floor).<ref>Fig. 9 Design Graph for Heating and Cooling with Floor and Ceiling Panels, Panel Heating and Cooling, 2000 ASHRAE Systems and Equipment Handbook</ref>\n\nThe [[emissivity]], [[reflectivity]] and [[absorbance|absorptivity]] of a floor surface are critical determinants of its heat exchange with the occupants and room. Unpolished flooring surface materials and treatments have very high emissivity's (0.85 to 0.95) and therefore make good [[Radiator (heating)|heat radiators]].<ref>Pedersen, C.O., Fisher, D.E., Lindstrom, P.C. (March, 1997), Impact of Surface Characteristics on Radiant Panel Output, ASHRAE 876 TRP</ref>\n\nWith underfloor heating and cooling (\"reversible floors\") flooring surfaces with high [[absorbance]] and [[emissivity]] and low [[reflectivity]] are most desirable.\n\n===Thermographic evaluation===\n[[File:Thermography low temperature radiant heating.png|thumb|Thermographic images of a room heated with low temperature radiant heating shortly after starting up the system]]\n[[Thermography]] is a useful tool to see the actual thermal efficacy of an underfloor system from its start up (as shown) to its operating conditions. In a startup it is easy to identify the tube location but less so as the system moves into a [[steady state]] condition. It is important to interpret thermographic images correctly. As is the case with finite element analysis (FEA), what is seen, reflects the conditions at the time of the image and may not represent the steady conditions. For example, the surfaces viewed in the images shown, may appear \u2018hot\u2019, but in reality are actually below the nominal temperature of the [[Normal human body temperature|skin and core temperatures of the human body]] and the ability to \u2018see\u2019 the pipes does not equate to \u2018feel\u2019 the pipes. Thermography can also point out flaws in the building enclosures (left image, corner intersection detail), thermal bridging (right image, studs) and the heat losses associated with exterior doors (center image).\n\n==Global examples of large modern buildings using radiant heating and cooling==\n* [[41 Cooper Square]], United States\n* [[Akron Art Museum]], United States\n* [[BMW Welt]], Germany\n* [[California Academy of Science]], United States\n* [[Copenhagen Opera House]], Denmark\n* [[Ewha Womans University]], South Korea\n* [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]], New York City, United States\n* [[Manitoba Hydro Place]], Canada\n* [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] Research Support Facility, United States\n* [[Pearl River Tower]], China\n* [[Post Tower]], Germany\n* [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]],<ref>Simmonds, P., Gaw, W., Holst, S., Reuss, S., Using radiant cooled floors to condition large spaces and maintain comfort conditions, ASHRAE Transactions, vol. 106(1):695-701, 2000</ref> Bangkok\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]]\n*[[Electric heating]]\n*[[Hydronics]]\n*[[Gloria (heating system)]]\n*[[Heater]] (types of heaters)\n*[[Hypocaust]]\n*[[Kang bed-stove]]\n*[[Psychrometrics]]\n*[[Ondol]]\n*[[Renewable heat]]\n*[[Room air distribution|Underfloor air distribution]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n{{HVAC}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Underfloor Heating}}\n[[Category:Residential heating]]\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n[[Category:Ancient inventions]]\n", "text_old": "'''Underfloor heating and cooling''' is a form of [[central heating and cooling]] which achieves [[indoor climate control]] for [[thermal comfort]] using [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]], [[radiation]] and [[convection]].

With the heating/cooling system turned off during the day, the concrete mass and room temperature drift up or down within the desired comfort range. Such systems are known as thermally activated building systems or TABS.<ref>Kolarik, J., Yang, L., Thermal mass activation (Chpt.5) with Expert Guide Part 2, IEA ECBSC Annex 44, Integrating environmentally responsive elements in buildings, 2009</ref><ref>Lehmann, B., Dorer, V., Koschenz, M., Application range of thermally activated building systems tabs, Energy and Buildings, 39:593\u2013598, 2007</ref>\n\n=== Hydronic systems ===\nHydronic systems use water or a mix of water and anti-freeze such as [[propylene glycol]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lowex.org/downloads/lowex-cases%20broshure.pdf|title=Low Temperature Heating Systems, Increased Energy Efficiency and Improved Comfort, Annex 37, International Energy Association|website=lowex.org}}</ref> as the heat transfer fluid in a \"closed loop\" that is recirculated between the floor and the boiler.\n\nVarious types of pipes are available specifically for hydronic underfloor heating and cooling systems and are generally made from [[polyethylene]] including [[PEX]], PEX-Al-PEX and PERT.

Due to their low profile they can be installed in a [[thermal mass]] or directly under floor finishes. Electric systems can also take advantage of [[Electricity meter|time-of-use electricity metering]] and are frequently used as carpet heaters, portable under area rug heaters, under laminate floor heaters, under tile heating, under wood floor heating, and floor warming systems, including under shower floor and seat heating. Large electric systems also require skilled designers and tradespeople but this is less so for small floor warming systems. Electric systems use fewer components and are simpler to install and commission than hydronic systems. Some electric systems use line voltage technology while others use low voltage technology. Power consumption of an electric system is not based on voltage but rather wattage output produced by the heating element.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Thermal comfort quality===\nAs defined by [[ASHRAE 55|ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55]] \u2013 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, [[thermal comfort]] is, \"that condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation.\" Relating specifically to underfloor heating, thermal comfort is influenced by floor surface temperature and associated elements such as radiant asymmetry, [[mean radiant temperature]] and [[operative temperature]]. Research by Nevins, Rohles, Gagge, [[P. Ole Fanger]] et al. show that humans at rest with clothing typical of light office and home wear, exchange over 50% of their [[sensible heat]] via [[radiation]].\n\nUnderfloor heating influences the radiant exchange by warming the interior surfaces. The heating of the surfaces suppresses body heat loss resulting in a perception of heating comfort. This general sensation of comfort is further enhanced through [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]] (feet on floor) and through [[convection]] by the surface's influence on air [[density]]. Underfloor cooling works by absorbing both [[Shortwave radiation|short wave]] and long wave radiation resulting in cool interior surfaces. These cool surfaces encourage the loss of body heat resulting in a perception of cooling comfort. Localized discomfort due to cold and warm floors wearing normal foot wear and stocking feet is addressed in the ISO 7730 and ASHRAE 55 standards and ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbooks and can be corrected or regulated with floor heating and cooling systems.\n\n===Indoor air quality===\nUnderfloor heating can have a positive effect on the [[Indoor air quality|quality of indoor air]] by facilitating the choice of otherwise perceived [[Flooring#Hard flooring|cold flooring materials]] such as tile, slate, terrazzo and concrete. These masonry surfaces typically have very low VOC emissions ([[volatile organic compounds]]) in comparison to other [[flooring]] options.

The performance of the model (left image below) and image to the right are useful to gain an understanding in relationships between flooring resistances, conductivities of surrounding mass, tube spacings, depths and fluid temperatures. As with all FEA simulations, they depict a snap shot in time for a specific assembly and may not be representative of all floor assemblies nor for system that have been operative for considerable time in a steady state condition. The practical application of FEA for the engineer is being able to assess each design for fluid temperature, back losses and surface temperature quality. Through several iterations it is possible to optimize the design for the lowest fluid temperature in heating and the highest fluid temperature in cooling which enables combustion and compression equipment to achieve its maximum rated efficiency performance.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Modelling radiant tube patterns.png|Thermal diffusions and surface temperature quality (efficacy) of various piping layouts\nFile:FEA Output Screen Shots.png|Typical FEA output screen shots of wire mesh, thermal isotherms and color-coded mapping\n</gallery>\n\n==Economics==\nThere is a wide range of pricing for underfloor systems based on regional differences, materials, application and project complexity. It is widely adopted in the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]], [[Asia]]n and [[Europe]]an communities. Consequently, the market is more mature and systems relatively more affordable than less developed markets such as [[North America]] where market share for fluid based systems remains between 3% to 7% of HVAC systems (ref. [[Statistics Canada]] and [[United States Census Bureau]]).\n\nIn energy efficiency buildings such as [[Passive House]], [[R-2000 program|R-2000]] or [[Zero-energy building|Net Zero Energy]], simple [[thermostatic radiator valve]]s can be installed along with a single compact circulator and small condensing heater controlled without or with basic [[hot water reset]]<ref>Butcher, T., Hydronic baseboard thermal distribution system with outdoor reset control to enable the use of a condensing boiler, Brookhaven National Laboratory, (for) Office of Buildings Technology U.S. Department of Energy, October, 2004</ref> control. Economical electric resistance based systems also are useful in small zones such as bathrooms and kitchens, but also for entire buildings where heating loads are very low. Larger structures will need more [[Hydronics|sophisticated systems]] to deal with cooling and heating needs, and often require [[Building management system|building management control systems]] to regulate the energy use and control the overall indoor environment.\n\nLow temperature radiant heating and high temperature radiant cooling systems lend themselves well to [[District heating|district energy]] systems (community based systems) due to the temperature differentials between the plant and the buildings which allow small diameter insulated distribution networks and low pumping power requirements. The low return temperatures in heating and high return temperatures in cooling enable the district energy plant to achieve maximum efficiency. The principles behind district energy with underfloor systems can also be applied to stand alone multi story buildings with the same benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doas-radiant.psu.edu/vert_intg_doas_radiant.pdf|title=Olesen, B., Simmonds, P., Doran, T., Bean, R., Vertically Integrated Systems in Standalone Multi Story Buildings, ASHRAE Journal Vol. 47, 6, June 2005, |website=psu.edu}}</ref> Additionally, underfloor radiant systems are ideally suited to [[renewable energy]] sources including [[geothermal]] and [[solar thermal]] systems or any system where waste heat is recoverable.\n\nIn the global drive for [[sustainability]], long term economics supports the need to eliminate where possible, [[Gas compressor|compression]] for cooling and [[combustion]] for heating. {{clarify-span|It will then be necessary to use low quality heat sources for which radiant underfloor heating and cooling is well suited.|date=March 2020}}{{source?|date=March 2020}}\n\n===System efficiency===\nSystem efficiency and energy use analysis takes into account building enclosure performance, efficiency of the heating and cooling plant, system controls and the conductivities, surface characteristics, tube/element spacing and depth of the radiant panel, operating fluid temperatures and wire to water efficiency of the circulators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fashionpk.pk/top-7-tankless-water-heaters-for-2018/|title=Heater, 7 Tankless Water Heaters, Mian Yousaf, Dec,2019|website=fashionpk.pk}}</ref> The efficiency in electric systems is analyzed by similar processes and includes the efficiency of [[electricity generation]].\n\nThough the efficiency of radiant systems is under constant debate with no shortage of [[anecdotal]] claims and scientific papers presenting both sides, the low return fluid temperatures in heating and high return fluid temperatures in cooling enable condensing boilers,<ref>Fig. 5 Effect of Inlet Water Temperature on Efficiency of Condensing Boilers, Chapter 27, Boilers, 2000 ASHRAE Systems and Equipment Handbook</ref> [[chiller]]s<ref>Thornton, B.A., Wang, W., Lane, M.D., Rosenberg, M.I., Liu, B., (September 2009), Technical Support Document: 50% Energy Savings Design Technology Packages for Medium Office Buildings, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy, DE-AC05-76RL01830</ref> and [[heat pump]]s<ref>Jiang, W., Winiarski, D.W., Katipamula, S., Armstrong, P.R., Cost-effective integration of efficient low-lift base-load cooling equipment (Final Report), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Federal Energy Management Program, December, 2007</ref> to operate at or near their [[Thermal efficiency|maximum engineered performance]].<ref>Fitzgerald, D.

For example, carpeting has a greater [[Thermal conductivity|resistance]] or lower [[Thermal conductivity|conductance]] than tile. Thus carpeted floors need to operate at higher internal temperatures than tile which can create lower efficiencies for boilers and heat pumps. However, when the floor covering is known at the time the system is installed, then the internal floor temperature required for a given covering can be achieved through proper tube spacing without sacrificing plant efficiency (though the higher internal floor temperatures may result in increased heat loss from the non-room surfaces of the floor).<ref>Fig. 9 Design Graph for Heating and Cooling with Floor and Ceiling Panels, Panel Heating and Cooling, 2000 ASHRAE Systems and Equipment Handbook</ref>\n\nThe [[emissivity]], [[reflectivity]] and [[absorbance|absorptivity]] of a floor surface are critical determinants of its heat exchange with the occupants and room. Unpolished flooring surface materials and treatments have very high emissivity's (0.85 to 0.95) and therefore make good [[Radiator (heating)|heat radiators]].<ref>Pedersen, C.O., Fisher, D.E., Lindstrom, P.C. (March, 1997), Impact of Surface Characteristics on Radiant Panel Output, ASHRAE 876 TRP</ref>\n\nWith underfloor heating and cooling (\"reversible floors\") flooring surfaces with high [[absorbance]] and [[emissivity]] and low [[reflectivity]] are most desirable.\n\n===Thermographic evaluation===\n[[File:Thermography low temperature radiant heating.png|thumb|Thermographic images of a room heated with low temperature radiant heating shortly after starting up the system]]\n[[Thermography]] is a useful tool to see the actual thermal efficacy of an underfloor system from its start up (as shown) to its operating conditions. In a startup it is easy to identify the tube location but less so as the system moves into a [[steady state]] condition. It is important to interpret thermographic images correctly. As is the case with finite element analysis (FEA), what is seen, reflects the conditions at the time of the image and may not represent the steady conditions. For example, the surfaces viewed in the images shown, may appear \u2018hot\u2019, but in reality are actually below the nominal temperature of the [[Normal human body temperature|skin and core temperatures of the human body]] and the ability to \u2018see\u2019 the pipes does not equate to \u2018feel\u2019 the pipes. Thermography can also point out flaws in the building enclosures (left image, corner intersection detail), thermal bridging (right image, studs) and the heat losses associated with exterior doors (center image).\n\n==Global examples of large modern buildings using radiant heating and cooling==\n* [[41 Cooper Square]], United States\n* [[Akron Art Museum]], United States\n* [[BMW Welt]], Germany\n* [[California Academy of Science]], United States\n* [[Copenhagen Opera House]], Denmark\n* [[Ewha Womans University]], South Korea\n* [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]], New York City, United States\n* [[Manitoba Hydro Place]], Canada\n* [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] Research Support Facility, United States\n* [[Pearl River Tower]], China\n* [[Post Tower]], Germany\n* [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]],<ref>Simmonds, P., Gaw, W., Holst, S., Reuss, S., Using radiant cooled floors to condition large spaces and maintain comfort conditions, ASHRAE Transactions, vol. 106(1):695-701, 2000</ref> Bangkok\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]]\n*[[Electric heating]]\n*[[Hydronics]]\n*[[Gloria (heating system)]]\n*[[Heater]] (types of heaters)\n*[[Hypocaust]]\n*[[Kang bed-stove]]\n*[[Psychrometrics]]\n*[[Ondol]]\n*[[Renewable heat]]\n*[[Room air distribution|Underfloor air distribution]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n{{HVAC}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Underfloor Heating}}\n[[Category:Residential heating]]\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n[[Category:Ancient inventions]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfloor_heating"}
