It was built in fields between [[Andreas, Isle of Man|Andreas]] and [[Bride, Isle of Man|Bride]]. As was common practice, the station was named after the parish in which it was situated.<ref name=\"CT\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]], in October 1940, began to attack British cities under the cover of darkness, the North West of England with its industrial centres and ports came within easy reach of German aircraft operating from [[occupied France]].  The first fighter squadron had arrived on the [[Isle of Man]] at nearby [[RAF Jurby]] in November 1940, and came under the control of the newly formed [[No. 9 Group RAF]], [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]].  Group Control was positioned at [[RAF Barton Hall]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], and its sectors covered [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]].  Andreas was to be a separate sector with responsibility for the Irish Sea and its surrounds.  The new wing of [[Ramsey Grammar School]] was commissioned as Control Centre for the sector and was hastily prepared before the arrival of the new fighters at Jurby.  The Control Centre was linked to [[Chain Home|the three radar stations at Dalby, Scarlett and Bride]].<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p51\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=51.}}</ref>\n\nThe siting of a fighter airfield in the location of Andreas had been chosen because of its central location with regard to [[Liverpool]], [[Belfast]] and [[Glasgow]], as it was in an excellent position to provide protection to the vital shipping arriving at these ports. Finally, with the relevant compensation payments agreed, work on the construction of RAF Andreas began in earnest by the end of June 1940. A total of {{convert|500|acre}} of farmland was earmarked, {{convert|200|acre}} coming from both Ballaghaue Farm and Braust Farm, and a small portion of land was acquired which stretched into the adjacent parish of Bride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturevannin.im/video_story_411491.html |title=World War Two (02) Defending the Island |publisher=[[Culture Vannin]] |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref>\n[[File:Andreas Church (reduced tower).jpeg|thumb|left|[[St Andrew's Church, Andreas, Isle of Man|St Andrew's Church, Andreas]]. The tower was reduced on the request of the [[Air Ministry]] as it was seen as a danger to operations from the base.]]\nBy the spring of 1941 the airfield, to be built to the full specification of an operational fighter station, was beginning to take shape.  The main NE/SW runway was {{convert|1100|yd}} long and {{convert|50|yd}} wide and was obviously meant to take larger aircraft than fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forgottenairfields.com/united-kingdom/man/andreas-s961.html |title=Abandoned, Forgotten & Little Known Airfields in Europe: Andreas |website=forgottenairfields.com |author=Ronald V. |date=7 November 2010 |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref>  From the perimeter track there was access to the flight dispersals in which a total of 24 blast pens (or E pens) were built, half to provide protection for the fighters while larger ones were for twin-engined aircraft.  Considerable thought had also gone into the airfield's defences, with the whole area being surrounded by {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} roller concertina barbed wire, with gaps located at the main entrance and crash gates<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p52\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=52.}}</ref> and by a [[tarmacadam]]ed perimeter track over three miles in distance.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ramsey Courier, Friday, September 14, 1945; Page: 3</ref>\n\nRAF Andreas was designed as a dispersed airfield with many components of the base encompassed into the village of Andreas. The consequence of this was such that the domestic side and living quarters were a considerable distance from the technical side. There was also a dance and entertainments hall in the village and a farm on the Station.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1941 the first RAF personnel arrived at Andreas.  This mainly consisted of a flight of [[Royal Air Force Police]], whose first duties were guarding the stores of supplies kept in the completed hangars.  Others arriving at that time included MT drivers and soldiers of the [[Wiltshire Regiment]], under the command of Major G.K. Wait [[Military Cross|MC]], who arrived to man the airfield's defences, along with the first of many [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]]s whose duties were to staff the administration offices and operations rooms.

These were badly needed to re-house families living in condemned properties in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] and to relieve the general housing shortage on the Island as a consequence of the war. Every effort was made to convert the brick-built huts into acceptable two-and three-bedroom homes with electrically heated living rooms and kitchens. Each had a toilet installed, but bathrooms had to be shared. During 1947, a total of 81 families were accommodated as a temporary measure pending the construction of new housing estates.

It was built in fields between [[Andreas, Isle of Man|Andreas]] and [[Bride, Isle of Man|Bride]]. As was common practice, the station was named after the parish in which it was situated.<ref name=\"CT\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]], in October 1940, began to attack British cities under the cover of darkness, the North West of England with its industrial centres and ports came within easy reach of German aircraft operating from [[occupied France]].  The first fighter squadron had arrived on the [[Isle of Man]] at nearby [[RAF Jurby]] in November 1940, and came under the control of the newly formed [[No. 9 Group RAF]], [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]].  Group Control was positioned at [[RAF Barton Hall]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], and its sectors covered [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]].  Andreas was to be a separate sector with responsibility for the Irish Sea and its surrounds.  The new wing of [[Ramsey Grammar School]] was commissioned as Control Centre for the sector and was hastily prepared before the arrival of the new fighters at Jurby.  The Control Centre was linked to [[Chain Home|the three radar stations at Dalby, Scarlett and Bride]].<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p51\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=51.}}</ref>\n\nThe siting of a fighter airfield in the location of Andreas had been chosen because of its central location with regard to [[Liverpool]], [[Belfast]] and [[Glasgow]], as it was in an excellent position to provide protection to the vital shipping arriving at these ports. Finally, with the relevant compensation payments agreed, work on the construction of RAF Andreas began in earnest by the end of June 1940. A total of {{convert|500|acre}} of farmland was earmarked, {{convert|200|acre}} coming from both Ballaghaue Farm and Braust Farm, and a small portion of land was acquired which stretched into the adjacent parish of Bride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturevannin.im/video_story_411491.html |title=World War Two (02) Defending the Island |publisher=[[Culture Vannin]] |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref>\n[[File:Andreas Church (reduced tower).jpeg|thumb|left|[[St Andrew's Church, Andreas, Isle of Man|St Andrew's Church, Andreas]].

The main NE/SW runway was {{convert|1100|yd}} long and {{convert|50|yd}} wide and was obviously meant to take larger aircraft than fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forgottenairfields.com/united-kingdom/man/andreas-s961.html |title=Abandoned, Forgotten & Little Known Airfields in Europe: Andreas |website=forgottenairfields.com |author=Ronald V. |date=7 November 2010 |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref>  From the perimeter track there was access to the flight dispersals in which a total of 24 blast pens (or E pens) were built, half to provide protection for the fighters while larger ones were for twin-engined aircraft.  Considerable thought had also gone into the airfield's defences, with the whole area being surrounded by {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} roller concertina barbed wire, with gaps located at the main entrance and crash gates<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p52\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=52.}}</ref> and by a [[tarmacadam]]ed perimeter track over three miles in distance.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ramsey Courier, Friday, September 14, 1945; Page: 3</ref>\n\nRAF Andreas was designed as a dispersed airfield with many components of the base encompassed into the village of Andreas. The consequence of this was such that the domestic side and living quarters were a considerable distance from the technical side. There was also a dance and entertainments hall in the village and a farm on the Station.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1941 the first RAF personnel arrived at Andreas.  This mainly consisted of a flight of [[Royal Air Force Police]], whose first duties were guarding the stores of supplies kept in the completed hangars.  Others arriving at that time included MT drivers and soldiers of the [[Wiltshire Regiment]], under the command of Major G.K. Wait [[Military Cross|MC]], who arrived to man the airfield's defences, along with the first of many [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]]s whose duties were to staff the administration offices and operations rooms.

These were badly needed to re-house families living in condemned properties in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] and to relieve the general housing shortage on the Island as a consequence of the war. Every effort was made to convert the brick-built huts into acceptable two-and three-bedroom homes with electrically heated living rooms and kitchens. Each had a toilet installed, but bathrooms had to be shared. During 1947, a total of 81 families were accommodated as a temporary measure pending the construction of new housing estates. It was to be several years before such new housing was ready, and upon their completion, this temporary housing by now badly affected by damp, was demolished. One structure to survive, was the old gymnasium which still stands, and continues to provide the [[Andreas, Isle of Man|village of Andreas]] with a very useful Parish Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justabouttravel.net/2013/02/01/andreas-parish-hall-isle-of-man-england-isle-of-man-canine-society-dog-show/ |title=Andreas Parish Hall , Isle of Man, England \u2013 Isle of Man Canine Society Dog Show |access-date=16 May 2017 |website=justabouttravel.net }}</ref><ref>''Mona's Herald'', 17 December 1946.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations between the Manx Government and the [[Air Ministry]] were proceeding as to the future of the airfield.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in colour marking of German Wasps ''Vespula germanica'' (F.) and Common Wasps ''Vespula vulgaris'' (L.)

It has [[aposematic]] colors of black and yellow; yellow pronotal bands which are almost parallel to each other and black dots and rings on its abdomen. The queens and females appear very similar to ''[[Vespula germanica]]''), except when they are seen head on, as the ''V. vulgaris'' face lacks the three black dots of ''V. germanica''. Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its ''clypeus'' can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to ''V. germanica''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStill more difficult to distinguish between species are the males. Almost undetectable with the naked eye, the only confident identification of ''V. vulgaris'' males is to seek the distinct ''[[aedeagus]]'' tip shapes and lateral processes of their [[genitalia]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''V. vulgaris'' is a [[Palearctic]] species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/> It was discovered in a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and China. It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force. The queen is now a nurse and egg producer. There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

It is generally made of brittle tan coloured paper. It has open cells and a cylindrical column known as a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] attaching the nest to the substrate. The wasps produce a chemical which repels ants and secrete it around the base of the petiole, to avoid ant predation.<ref name=\"doc\" />\n\nMany variations are seen in the characteristics of the nests within the species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

''Vespula germanica'' generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500\u20139000 larvae in one colony cycle) than ''Vespula vulgaris'' (3000\u20138000 larvae in one colony cycle).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and three species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it directly predates native insects and competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates that these wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures.

It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings.

Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force.

Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

It is generally made of brittle tan coloured paper. It has open cells and a cylindrical column known as a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] attaching the nest to the substrate. The wasps produce a chemical which repels ants and secrete it around the base of the petiole, to avoid ant predation.<ref name=\"doc\" />\n\nMany variations are seen in the characteristics of the nests within the species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

''Vespula germanica'' generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500\u20139000 larvae in one colony cycle) than ''Vespula vulgaris'' (3000\u20138000 larvae in one colony cycle).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and three species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it directly predates native insects and competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates that these wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2016 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 13 April 2016. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.

The bill must then be edited by a committee to ensure that the bill contains correct and systematic language. It can then be approved or rejected by the Assembly.<ref>Park 2010, p. 27.</ref>\n\n=== Committees===\nThere are 17 standing committees which examine bills and petitions falling under their respective jurisdictions, and perform other duties as prescribed by relevant laws.\n\n* House Steering Committee\n* Legislation and Judiciary Committee\n* National Policy Committee\n* Strategy and Finance Committee\n* Science, ICT, Future Planning, Broadcasting and Communications Committee\n* Education Committee\n* Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee\n* Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee\n* National Defense Committee\n* Security and Public Administration Committee\n* Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee\n* Trade, Industry and Energy Committee\n* Health and Welfare Committee\n* Environment and Labor Committee\n* Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee\n* Intelligence Committee\n* Gender Equality and Family Committee\n\n===Election===\n{{see also|Legislative elections in South Korea}}\nSince the promulgation of the March 1988 electoral law, the assembly has been elected every four years through a [[parallel voting|Supplementary Member]] system, meaning that some of the members are elected from constituencies according to the system of [[first past the post]], while others are elected at a national level through [[proportional representation]].<ref>[[Aurel S. Croissant]], \"Electoral Politics of South Korea\", in Croissant ''et al.'' (2002) ''Electoral Politics in Southeast and East Asia.'' Friedrich Ebert Foundation, p. 257.</ref> As of 2016, 253 members represent constituencies, while 47 were elected from PR lists.

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2016 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 13 April 2016. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.
