According to AEI, it \"emphasizes the need to design environmental policies that protect not only nature but also democratic institutions and human liberty\".<ref name=\"Highlight\" /> When the Kyoto Protocol was approaching, AEI was hesitant to encourage the U.S. to join. In an essay from the AEI outlook series of 2007, the authors discuss the Kyoto Protocol and state that the United States \"should be wary of joining an international emissions-trading regime\". To back this statement, they point out that committing to the Kyoto emissions goal would be a significant and unrealistic obligation for the United States. In addition, they state that the Kyoto regulations would have an impact not only on governmental policies, but also the private sector through expanding government control over investment decisions. AEI staff said that \"dilution of sovereignty\" would be the result if the U.S. signed the treaty.<ref name=\"aei\">{{cite web | url=http://www.aei.org/article/energy-and-the-environment/climate-change-caps-vs-taxes/ | title=Climate Change: Caps vs. Taxes | last=Hassett | first=Kevin A. | date=1 June 2007 | website=American Enterprise Institute | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825050345/http://www.aei.org/article/energy-and-the-environment/climate-change-caps-vs-taxes/ | archive-date=25 August 2013 | accessdate=17 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\nAEI has promoted [[carbon tax]]ation as an alternative to [[cap-and-trade]] regimes. \"Most economists believe a carbon tax (a tax on the quantity of CO2 emitted when using energy) would be a superior policy alternative to an emissions-trading regime,\" wrote [[Kenneth P.

Hayward]]. \"In fact, the irony is that there is a broad consensus in favor of a carbon tax everywhere except on Capitol Hill, where the 'T word' is anathema.\"<ref name=\"Caps-vs-Taxes\">AEI also backs the carbon taxation policy due to an incentive to reduce the use of carbon-intensive energy that would result. \"The increased costs of energy would flow through the economy, ultimately giving consumers incentives to reduce their use of electricity, transportation fuels, home heating oil, and so forth\". Along with consumers reducing their use of carbon-energy, they will be inclined to buy more efficient appliances, cars, and homes that apply \"more attention to energy conservation\".{{cite news|last=Green|first=Kenneth P.|author-link=Kenneth P.

During the [[Korean War]], she was involved in raids up and down the [[North Korea]]n coast, after which she was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the \"mothball fleet\". She was briefly reactivated in 1968 and sent to Vietnam to support US troops before returning to the mothball fleet in 1969.  Reactivated once more in the 1980s as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] program, ''New Jersey'' was modernized to carry missiles and recommissioned for service. In 1983, she participated in US operations during the [[Lebanese Civil War]].\n\n''New Jersey'' was decommissioned for the last time in 1991 (after serving a total of 21 years in the active fleet), having earned a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for service in Vietnam and 19 battle and campaign stars for combat operations during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Lebanese Civil War, and service in the [[Persian Gulf]].

With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers, so ''New Jersey'' was fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] [[anti-aircraft artillery|anti-aircraft guns]]. When reactivated in 1968, ''New Jersey'' had her 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm AA guns removed and was tailored for use as a heavy bombardment ship.

On 7 January 1944 she passed through the [[Panama Canal]] war-bound for [[Funafuti]], [[Ellice Islands]]. She reported there 22 January for duty with the [[United States Fifth Fleet]], and three days later rendezvoused with [[Task Group 58.2]] for the [[Marshall Islands campaign|assault on the Marshall Islands]].  ''New Jersey'' screened the [[aircraft carrier]]s from [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] attack as planes from Task Group 58.2 flew strikes against [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] 29 January&nbsp;\u2013 2 February, softening up the latter for its invasion and supporting the troops who landed on 31 January.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' began her career as a [[flagship]] 4 February in [[Majuro]] Lagoon when [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Raymond A. Spruance]], commanding the 5th Fleet, broke his flag from her main. Her first action as a flagship was in [[Operation Hailstone]], a two-day surface and air strike by her task force against the major Japanese fleet base on [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. This attack was coordinated with the assault on Kwajalein, and effectively interdicted the Japanese naval retaliation to the conquest of the Marshalls. On 17 and 18 February, the task force accounted for two Japanese [[light cruiser]]s, four [[destroyer]]s, three [[auxiliary cruiser]]s, two [[submarine tender]]s, two [[submarine chaser]]s, an [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]], a plane ferry, and 23 other auxiliaries, not including small craft. ''New Jersey'' destroyed a trawler and, with other ships, sank the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}. ''New Jersey'' also fired on an enemy aircraft that attacked her formation. The task force returned to the Marshalls 19 February.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 17 March and 10 April, ''New Jersey'' first sailed with [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Marc A. Mitscher]]'s flagship {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}} for an air and surface bombardment of [[Mili Atoll|Mille]], then rejoined Task Group 58.2 for a strike against shipping in the [[Palau]]s, and bombarded [[Woleai]]. Upon his return to Majuro, Admiral Spruance transferred his flag to {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}}.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s next war cruise, 13 April&nbsp;\u2013 4 May 1944, began and ended at Majuro. She screened the carrier striking force which gave air support to the invasion of [[Aitape]], [[Tanahmerah Bay]] and [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]], [[New Guinea]], 22 April, then shelled shipping and shore installations at Truk 29 April&nbsp;\u2013 30 April. ''New Jersey'' and her formation shot down two enemy [[torpedo bomber]]s at Truk. Her 16-inch salvos pounded [[Pohnpei|Ponape]] 1 May, destroying [[fuel tank]]s, badly damaging the [[airfield]], and demolishing a headquarters building.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAfter rehearsing in the Marshalls for the invasion of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], ''New Jersey'' put to sea 6 June in the screening and bombardment group of Admiral Mitscher's Task Force. On the second day of preinvasion air strikes, 12 June, ''New Jersey'' shot down an enemy torpedo bomber, and during the next two days her heavy guns battered [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]], in advance of the marine landings on 15 June.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nThe Japanese response to the Marianas operation was an order to its main surface fleet to attack and annihilate the American invasion force. Shadowing American [[submarine]]s tracked the Japanese fleet into the [[Philippine Sea]] as Admiral Spruance joined his task force with Admiral Mitscher's to meet the enemy. ''New Jersey'' took station in the protective screen around the carriers on 19 June 1944 as American and Japanese pilots dueled in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. That day and the next would cripple Japanese naval aviation; in what would become known as the \"Marianas Turkey Shoot\", the Japanese lost some 400 planes for less than two dozen American aircraft in return. This loss of trained pilots and aircraft was equaled in disaster by the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taih\u014d||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}} by the submarines {{USS|Albacore|SS-218|2}} and {{USS|Cavalla|SS-244|2}}, respectively, and the loss of {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiy\u014d||2}} to aircraft launched from the light aircraft carrier {{USS|Belleau Wood|CVL-24|2}}. In addition to these losses, Allied forces succeeded in damaging two Japanese carriers and a battleship. The anti-aircraft fire of ''New Jersey'' and the other screening ships proved virtually impenetrable; two American ships were slightly damaged during the battle. Only 17 American planes were lost in combat.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Service with the 3rd Fleet, Admiral Halsey===\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s final contribution to the conquest of the Marianas was in strikes on Guam and the Palaus from which she sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]], arriving 9 August. Here she broke the flag of Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]],<ref>William F. Halsey held the rank of a four star Admiral throughout the Second World War.

On 30 August ''New Jersey'' set sail from Pearl Harbor, and for the next eight months was based at [[Ulithi]] to lend support to Allied forces operating in the Philippines. In this span of the Pacific War, fast carrier task forces ranged the waters off the Philippines, Okinawa, and [[Taiwan|Formosa]], making repeated strikes at airfields, shipping, shore bases, and invasion beaches.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nIn September the targets were in the [[Visayas]] and the southern Philippines, then [[Manila]] and [[Cavite]], [[Panay Island|Panay]], [[Negros Island|Negros]], [[Leyte Island|Leyte]], and [[Cebu Island|Cebu]]. Early in October raids to destroy enemy air power based on Okinawa and Formosa were begun in preparation for the Leyte landings of 20 October 1944.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nThis invasion brought on the last great [[sortie]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Its plan for the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] included a [[feint]] by a northern force of planeless heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the [[Leyte Gulf order of battle#Japanese Forces 2|Japanese Center Force]] to enter the gulf through [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At the opening of the battle planes from the carriers guarded by ''New Jersey'' struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23 October. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while ''New Jersey'' steamed south at [[flank speed]] to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It had been [[Battle off Samar|turned back in a stunning defeat]] when she arrived.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:USS Intrepid CV-11 kamikaze strike.jpg|thumb|left|A crewman assigned to one of ''New Jersey''{{'}}s anti-aircraft guns watches helplessly as a Japanese kamikaze pilot prepares to strike {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}.]]\n''New Jersey'' rejoined her fast carriers near San Bernardino 27 October 1944 for strikes on central and southern [[Luzon]]. Two days later, the force came under suicide attack. In a melee of anti-aircraft fire from the ships and combat air patrol, ''New Jersey'' shot down a plane whose pilot maneuvered it into the port gun galleries of {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, while machine gun fire from ''Intrepid'' wounded three of ''New Jersey's'' men. During a similar action 25 November three Japanese planes were shot down by the combined fire of the force, part of one flaming onto the flight deck of {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}. ''Intrepid'' was again attacked; she shot down one would-be kamikaze aircraft, but was crashed by another despite hits scored on the attacker by ''New Jersey'' gunners. ''New Jersey'' shot down a plane diving on {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|2}} and hit another plane which smashed into ''Cabot''{{'}}s port bow.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 18 December 1944 the ships of [[Fast Carrier Task Force|Task Force 38]] unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force\u2014 seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers\u2014 during their attempt to refuel at sea.

Kosco, a graduate of the aerology course at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who had also studied hurricanes in the [[West Indies]]; despite this, none of these individuals or staffs were able to give Third Fleet due warning of the impending typhoon.<ref name=\"Cobra\"/> On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds.

During the next two days, Okinawa was attacked from the air by the same striking force.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' was directly engaged in the conquest of Okinawa from 14 March until 16 April. As the carriers prepared for the invasion with strikes there and on [[Honsh\u016b]], ''New Jersey'' fought off air raids, used her [[seaplane]]s to rescue downed pilots, defended the carriers from suicide planes, shooting down at least three and assisting in the destruction of others. On 24 March 1945 she again carried out the role of heavy bombardment, preparing the invasion beaches for the assault a week later.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nDuring the final months of the war, ''New Jersey'' was overhauled at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], from which she sailed 4 July for [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], Pearl Harbor, and Eniwetok bound for Guam. Here on 14 August she once again became flagship of the 5th Fleet under Admiral Spruance. Brief stays at Manila and Okinawa preceded her arrival in [[Tokyo Bay]] 17 September, where she served as flagship for the successive commanders of Naval Forces in Japanese waters until relieved 28 January 1946 by {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}} (BB-61). As part of the ongoing [[Operation Magic Carpet]] ''New Jersey'' took aboard nearly a thousand homeward-bound troops, with whom she arrived at San Francisco 10 February.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n==Post World War II (1946\u20131950)==\n[[File:New Jesery Mothballed (1948).jpg|thumb|right|''New Jersey'' photographed shortly after her 1948 decommissioning.

Present were Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, former Governor Walter E. Edge and other dignitaries.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 7 June and 26 August, ''New Jersey'' formed part of the first training squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand [[United States Naval Academy]] and [[NROTC]] midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in ''New Jersey'' at [[Rosyth]], Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at [[Oslo]], where King [[Haakon VII of Norway]] inspected the crew 2 July, and at [[Portsmouth]], England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAfter serving at New York as flagship for Rear Admiral Heber H. McLean, Commander, Battleship Division 1, 12 September&nbsp;\u2013 18 October, ''New Jersey'' was inactivated at the [[New York Naval Shipyard]]. She was decommissioned at Bayonne 30 June 1948 and assigned to the New York Group, [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n==The Korean War (1950\u20131953)==\nIn 1950 [[North Korea]] invaded South Korea, prompting the United States to intervene in the name of the United Nations. President [[Harry S. Truman]] was caught off guard when the invasion struck,<ref>American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] had told Congress on 20 June that no war was likely.</ref> but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization ''New Jersey'' was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. ''New Jersey'' was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the [[Korean War]]. She sailed from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], placed his flag in ''New Jersey'' for the next six months.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s guns opened the first shore bombardment of her Korean career at [[Wonsan]] 20 May. During her two tours of duty in Korean waters, she was again and again to play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, ''New Jersey'' used her 16-inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another, and at the same time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a [[artillery battery|shore battery]] on her number one turret and received a near miss [[aft]] to port.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:New Jersey in Korea.jpg|thumb|left|''New Jersey'' opening fire upon North Korean targets near the [[38th parallel north#Korea|38th parallel]].]]\nBetween 23 and 27 May and again 30 May 1951, ''New Jersey'' pounded targets near [[Yangyang County|Yangyang]] and [[Kansong]], dispersing troop concentrations, dropping a [[Span (architecture)|bridge span]], and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned at the end of this action, while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24 May, she lost one of her [[helicopter]]s after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nWith Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, and Vice Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], Commander Naval Forces Far East aboard, ''New Jersey'' bombarded targets at Wonsan 4 June. At Kansong two days later she fired her main battery at an artillery regiment and truck encampment, with 7th Fleet aircraft spotting targets and reporting successes. On 28 July off Wonsan the battleship was again taken under fire by shore batteries. Several near misses splashed to port, but ''New Jersey''{{'}}s precision fire silenced the enemy and destroyed several gun emplacements.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 4 and 12 July, ''New Jersey'' supported a United Nations push in the Kansong area, firing at enemy buildup and reorganization positions. As the [[Republic of Korea]]'s First Division hurled itself on the enemy, shore fire control observers saw ''New Jersey''{{'}}s salvos hit directly on enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] emplacements, supply and ammunition dumps, and personnel concentrations. ''New Jersey'' returned to Wonsan 18 July for an exhibition of perfect firing: five gun emplacements demolished with five direct hits.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' sailed to the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August, returning to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the [[Changjon]] area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAside from a brief break in firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the {{ship|Korean frigate|Apnok|PF-62}}, damaged by gunfire, ''New Jersey'' was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, supporting the movement of the [[U.S. X Corps]]. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es, [[bunker]]s, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 1 October 1951, General [[Omar Bradley]], Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and General [[Matthew B. Ridgeway]], Commander in Chief Far East, came on board to confer with Admiral Martin.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 1 and 6 October ''New Jersey'' was in action daily at Kansong, [[Hamhung]], [[Hungnam]], [[Tanchon]], and [[Songjin]]. Enemy bunkers and supply concentrations provided the majority of the targets at Kansong; at the others ''New Jersey'' fired on railroads, tunnels, bridges, an [[oil refinery]], trains, and shore batteries. She also engaged an enemy gun emplacement with her five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) gun mounts, which ''New Jersey'' successfully destroyed. The Kojo area was her target 16 October as she sailed in company with {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}}, pilots from {{HMAS|Sydney|1944|6}} spotting. The operation was well-planned and coordinated, and excellent results were obtained.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAnother highly satisfactory day was 16 October, when the spotter over the Kansong area reported \"beautiful shooting every shot on target-most beautiful shooting I have seen in five years.\" This five-hour bombardment leveled ten [[artillery]] positions, and in smashing [[trench]]es and bunkers inflicted some 500 enemy casualties.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' dashed up the North Korean coast raiding transportation facilities from 1 to 6 November. She struck at bridges, road, and rail installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, Tanchon, [[Iowon]], Songjin, and Chongjin, leaving four bridges destroyed, others badly damaged, two marshaling yards badly torn up, and many feet of track destroyed. With renewed attacks on Kansong and near the [[Chang-San-Got Peninsula]] 11 and 13 November, ''New Jersey'' completed her first tour of duty in Korea.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nRelieved as flagship by {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}, ''New Jersey'' cleared [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]] for Hawaii, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the Panama Canal, and returned to Norfolk 20 December for a six-month overhaul. Between 19 July 1952 and 5 September, she sailed as flagship for Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, who commanded the NROTC midshipman training cruise to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], Lisbon, and the Caribbean. Now ''New Jersey'' prepared and trained for her second Korean tour, for which she sailed from Norfolk 5 March 1953.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:New Jersey in Korea II.jpg|thumb|right|''New Jersey'' in Japanese waters, 1953]]\nShaping her course via the Panama Canal, Long Beach, and Hawaii, New Jersey reached Yokosuka 5 April, and next day relieved {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} as flagship of Vice Admiral Joseph H. Clark, Commander 7th Fleet. On 12 April ''New Jersey'' returned to action by shelling Chongjin; in seven minutes she scored seven direct hits, blowing away half the main communications building there. At [[Pusan]] two days later, ''New Jersey'' manned her rails to welcome the [[President of South Korea|President of the Republic of Korea]] and Madame Rhee, and American Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' fired on coastal batteries and buildings at Kojo 16 April; on railway track and tunnels near Hungnam 18 April; and on gun emplacements around [[Wonsan Harbor]] 20 April, silencing them in five areas after she had herself taken several near misses. Songjin provided targets 23 April. Here ''New Jersey'' scored six direct 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) hits on a railroad tunnel and knocked out two rail bridges.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' provided artillery support for a major air and surface strike on Wonsan 1 May, as 7th Fleet planes both attacked the enemy and spotted for the battleship. She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day, and four days later destroyed the key observation post on the island of [[Hodo Pando]], commanding the harbor. Two days later [[Kalmagak]] at Wonsan was her target.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s tenth birthday, 23 May 1953, was celebrated at [[Incheon]] with President and Madame Rhee, Lieutenant General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], and other dignitaries on board. Two days later ''New Jersey'' returned to action along the west coast at [[Chinampo]] to knock out harbor defense positions.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:USS New Jersey BB-62 salvo Jan 1953.jpeg|thumb|left|''New Jersey'' fires a six gun salvo of 16 in shells into an enemy troop concentration near [[Kaesong]], Korea.]]\nThe battleship was under fire at Wonsan 27 May&nbsp;\u2013 29 May, but her five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns silenced the counter-fire, and her 16-inch shells destroyed five gun emplacements and four gun caves. She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly: either a [[oil depot|fuel storage area]] or an [[ammunition dump]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' returned to the key task of direct support to troops at [[Kosong]] 7 June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches, then stood by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day she returned to troop support at Kosong, her assignment until 10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAt Wonsan 11 July&nbsp;\u2013 12 July, ''New Jersey'' fired one of the most concentrated bombardments of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven the second, her guns opened fire on gun positions and bunkers on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves and tunnels sealed. ''New Jersey'' smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo 13 July, and was once more on the east coast bombline 22 July&nbsp;\u2013 24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong. These days found her gunners at their most accurate: A large cave, housing an important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a month-long United Nations effort, and a great many bunkers, artillery areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were destroyed.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAt sunrise on 25 July 1953 ''New Jersey'' was off the key port, rail and communications center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a [[whaleboat]] in an attempt to spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Post Korean War (1953\u20131967)===\n''New Jersey's'' mission at Wonsan, the next day, was her last. Here she destroyed large-caliber guns, bunkers, caves and trenches. Two days later, she learned of the truce. Her crew celebrated during a seven-day visit at Hong Kong, where she anchored 20 August. Operations around Japan and off Formosa were carried out for the remainder of her tour, which was highlighted by a visit to Pusan. Here president Rhee came aboard on 16 September to present the [[Presidential Unit Citation (Korea)|Korean Presidential Unit Citation]] to the 7th Fleet.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nRelieved as flagship at Yokosuka by ''Wisconsin'' 14 October, ''New Jersey'' was homeward bound the next day, reaching Norfolk on 14 November. During the next two summers she crossed the Atlantic with [[midshipmen]] on board for training, and during the rest of the year sharpened her skills with exercises and training maneuvers along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' stood out of Norfolk 7 September 1955 for her first tour of duty with the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] in the [[Mediterranean]]. Her ports of call included [[Gibraltar]], [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], [[Cannes]], [[Istanbul]], [[Souda Bay]]; and [[Barcelona]]. She returned to Norfolk 7 January 1956 for the spring program of training operations. That summer she again carried midshipmen to Northern Europe for training, bringing them home to [[Annapolis]] 31 July. ''New Jersey'' sailed for Europe once more 27 August as flagship of Vice Admiral Charles Wellborn, Jr., Commander [[United States Second Fleet]]. She called at Lisbon, participated in [[NATO]] exercises off Scotland, and paid an official visit to Norway where Crown Prince [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]] was a guest. She returned to Norfolk 15 October, and 14 December arrived at New York Naval Shipyard for inactivation. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bayonne 21 August 1957.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n==The Vietnam War (1967\u20131969)==\nDue to heavy loss rates of U.S. aircraft (commencing with [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] in 1965), studies were conducted on ways of alleviating those air losses while at the same time delivering the ordnance payloads required by the escalation of the war. On 31 May 1967 the Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] authorized a study aimed at determining what would be required to get ''New Jersey'' reactivated in her present condition, and when the results of the submitted study proved favorable toward the reactivation he took action.<ref name=\"BAW\">{{cite book |last=Frick |first=Martin P. |editor=Lightbody, Andy |editor2=Blaine, Taylor |title=Battleships at War: America's Century Long Romance with the Big Guns of the Fleet |publisher=Challenge Publications, Inc |location=Canoga Park, CA |pages=64, 65, 86\u201389 |chapter=The Big Guns: America's Century Long Romance with the Battleship |year=1991}}</ref> In August 1967 the Secretary of Defense made the decision to recommission a battleship \"for employment in the Pacific Fleet to augment the naval gunfire support force in Southeast Asia\".<ref name=\"vets\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ussnewjersey.org/1968_narrative.htm |title=Narrative 1968 History of USS New Jersey (BB-62) |accessdate=2005-05-26 |publisher=USS New Jersey Veteran's, INC}}</ref> ''New Jersey'' was selected for this task because she was in better material condition than her sisters, having received an extensive overhaul prior to decommissioning. Upon her reactivation she underwent a period of modernization during which the 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns on the battleship were removed, and she received improved electronic warfare systems and improvements to her radar. Armed as such ''New Jersey'' was formally recommissioned 6 April 1968 at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], Captain [[J. Edward Snyder]] in command.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/> During sea trials following her modernization, ''New Jersey'' set the battleship world speed record by achieving a speed of 35.2 knots (62.5 km/h; 40.5&nbsp;mph), maintaining this speed for six hours.<ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-speed-recorded-for-a-battleship/ Fastest speed recorded for a battleship | Guinness World Records<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n''New Jersey'', then the world's only active battleship, departed Philadelphia 16 May, calling at Norfolk and transiting the Panama Canal 4 June before arriving at her new home port of Long Beach, California, 11 June. Further training off Southern California followed. On 24 July ''New Jersey'' received 16&nbsp;inch shells and powder tanks from {{USS|Mount Katmai|AE-16|2}} by conventional highline transfer and by helicopter lift, the first time heavy battleship ammunition had been transferred by helicopter at sea (now known as [[vertical replenishment]]).<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:New Jersey Underway.jpg|thumb|left|''New Jersey'' off [[Oahu]] in September 1968, prior to departure on her first WESTPAC cruise following recommissioning for service in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].]]\nDeparting Long Beach 2 September, ''New Jersey'' touched at Pearl Harbor and [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] before sailing 25 September for her first tour on the ''[[wikt:gun line|gun line]]''<ref name=\"Polmar, p. 129\">Polmar, p. 129</ref> along the Vietnamese coast. Near the 17th parallel on 30 September, the battleship fired her first shots in battle in over sixteen years, expending a total of 29 sixteen inch rounds against [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) targets in and near the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) at the 17th parallel.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' took up station off [[C\u1ed3n C\u1ecf District|Tiger Island]] 1 October and fired at targets north of the DMZ before moving south that afternoon to engage [[Viet Cong]] targets. She accounted for six bunkers, a supply truck and an anti-aircraft site that day; additionally, she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti-aircraft fire. On 3 October ''New Jersey'' fired on targets south of Tiger Island, and on 4 October the battleship fired on a Communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers. On the evening of 7 October ''New Jersey'' received reports that a number of waterborne logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River. ''New Jersey'' responded by closing on the formation, and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 11 October ''New Jersey'' engaged a coastal installation with her guns; however, she shifted her fire when a recon plane spotting for the battleship reported an enemy truck concentration north of Nha Ky. ''New Jersey'' gunners quickly retrained the battleship's big guns and managed to inflict heavy damage on six of the vehicles.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nEarly on the morning of 12 October ''New Jersey'' trained her guns in anticipation of shelling the heavily fortified and well protected Vinh caves. For the next three days ''New Jersey'' pounded the area with her 16&nbsp;in shells in an effort to eliminate the Viet Cong presence in the region. Aided by spotter aircraft from the aircraft carrier {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, ''New Jersey'' engaged enemy targets, setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave. On 14 October ''New Jersey'' shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island, destroying one battery on the island.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 16 October ''New Jersey'' took up station in support of the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|U.S. 3rd Marine Division]]. Using both the 16&nbsp;in and 5&nbsp;in guns ''New Jersey'' engaged and destroyed 13&nbsp;structures and an artillery site, in the process halting an enemy platoon moving through the DMZ. ''New Jersey'' continued to lend firepower support on the 17th until departing to lend her gunfire to the First Field Force. Foul weather prevented spotter aircraft from flying until 20 October; however, ''New Jersey'' quickly made up for lost time on the gun line by destroying a Viet Cong command post and nine bunkers in support of the [[173d Airborne Brigade (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]], who were operating about {{convert|50|mi|km|-1}} north of Nha Trang. The next day ''New Jersey'' maneuvered into the waters of the Baie de Van Fong to fire at Viet Cong command posts, but poor visibility of the target area prevented any damage estimates.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn the night of 23 October ''New Jersey'' steamed north to rearm before taking up position in support of the 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day ''New Jersey'' engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at ''New Jersey'' with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at ''New Jersey''; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information ''New Jersey'' fired five 16&nbsp;inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 28 October ''New Jersey'' steamed south to engage Communist targets. During the shelling aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft fire to the extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, ''New Jersey'' altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day ''New Jersey'' leveled 30&nbsp;structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. ''New Jersey'' responded by firing six 16&nbsp;inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nUpon completion of this mission ''New Jersey'' steamed south, taking a position off [[Da Nang]] and Point DeDe to lend naval gunfire support to the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Marine Division]] operating in the area. On 2 November ''New Jersey'' commenced firing operations against nine positions, but the heavy foliage in the area prevented spotters from seeing the results of the shelling.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 4 November ''New Jersey'' received orders to reinforce southern [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] near [[Phan Thi\u1ebft]]; she arrived on station later that night.

On 14 February the battleship steamed south of the DMZ to provide support for the 3rd Marine Division, in the process destroying an anti-aircraft site with her big guns. The next day ''New Jersey'' fired on an enemy rocket site northeast of [[Con Thien]], destroying the facility, then trained her guns on known Communist positions to harass PAVN forces. On 22 February ''New Jersey'' responded to an urgent request for fire support from the besieged [[Ocean View, Viet Nam|Oceanview observation post]] near the DMZ.

During the [[Korean War]], she was involved in raids up and down the [[North Korea]]n coast, after which she was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the \"mothball fleet\". She was briefly reactivated in 1968 and sent to Vietnam to support US troops before returning to the mothball fleet in 1969.  Reactivated once more in the 1980s as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] program, ''New Jersey'' was modernized to carry missiles and recommissioned for service. In 1983, she participated in US operations during the [[Lebanese Civil War]].\n\n''New Jersey'' was decommissioned for the last time in 1991 (after serving a total of 21 years in the active fleet), having earned a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for service in Vietnam and 19 battle and campaign stars for combat operations during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Lebanese Civil War, and service in the [[Persian Gulf]].

Her secondary battery consisted of twenty [[5\"/38 caliber gun]]s mounted in twin-gun [[dual purpose gun|dual purpose]] (DP) turrets, which could hit targets up to 9 miles (16.7 km) away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers, so ''New Jersey'' was fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] [[anti-aircraft artillery|anti-aircraft guns]].

On 7 January 1944 she passed through the [[Panama Canal]] war-bound for [[Funafuti]], [[Ellice Islands]]. She reported there 22 January for duty with the [[United States Fifth Fleet]], and three days later rendezvoused with [[Task Group 58.2]] for the [[Marshall Islands campaign|assault on the Marshall Islands]].  ''New Jersey'' screened the [[aircraft carrier]]s from [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] attack as planes from Task Group 58.2 flew strikes against [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] 29 January&nbsp;\u2013 2 February, softening up the latter for its invasion and supporting the troops who landed on 31 January.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' began her career as a [[flagship]] 4 February in [[Majuro]] Lagoon when [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Raymond A. Spruance]], commanding the 5th Fleet, broke his flag from her main. Her first action as a flagship was in [[Operation Hailstone]], a two-day surface and air strike by her task force against the major Japanese fleet base on [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. This attack was coordinated with the assault on Kwajalein, and effectively interdicted the Japanese naval retaliation to the conquest of the Marshalls. On 17 and 18 February, the task force accounted for two Japanese [[light cruiser]]s, four [[destroyer]]s, three [[auxiliary cruiser]]s, two [[submarine tender]]s, two [[submarine chaser]]s, an [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]], a plane ferry, and 23 other auxiliaries, not including small craft. ''New Jersey'' destroyed a trawler and, with other ships, sank the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}. ''New Jersey'' also fired on an enemy aircraft that attacked her formation. The task force returned to the Marshalls 19 February.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 17 March and 10 April, ''New Jersey'' first sailed with [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Marc A. Mitscher]]'s flagship {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}} for an air and surface bombardment of [[Mili Atoll|Mille]], then rejoined Task Group 58.2 for a strike against shipping in the [[Palau]]s, and bombarded [[Woleai]]. Upon his return to Majuro, Admiral Spruance transferred his flag to {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}}.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s next war cruise, 13 April&nbsp;\u2013 4 May 1944, began and ended at Majuro. She screened the carrier striking force which gave air support to the invasion of [[Aitape]], [[Tanahmerah Bay]] and [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]], [[New Guinea]], 22 April, then shelled shipping and shore installations at Truk 29 April&nbsp;\u2013 30 April. ''New Jersey'' and her formation shot down two enemy [[torpedo bomber]]s at Truk. Her 16-inch salvos pounded [[Pohnpei|Ponape]] 1 May, destroying [[fuel tank]]s, badly damaging the [[airfield]], and demolishing a headquarters building.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAfter rehearsing in the Marshalls for the invasion of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], ''New Jersey'' put to sea 6 June in the screening and bombardment group of Admiral Mitscher's Task Force. On the second day of preinvasion air strikes, 12 June, ''New Jersey'' shot down an enemy torpedo bomber, and during the next two days her heavy guns battered [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]], in advance of the marine landings on 15 June.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nThe Japanese response to the Marianas operation was an order to its main surface fleet to attack and annihilate the American invasion force. Shadowing American [[submarine]]s tracked the Japanese fleet into the [[Philippine Sea]] as Admiral Spruance joined his task force with Admiral Mitscher's to meet the enemy. ''New Jersey'' took station in the protective screen around the carriers on 19 June 1944 as American and Japanese pilots dueled in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. That day and the next would cripple Japanese naval aviation; in what would become known as the \"Marianas Turkey Shoot\", the Japanese lost some 400 planes for less than two dozen American aircraft in return. This loss of trained pilots and aircraft was equaled in disaster by the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taih\u014d||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}} by the submarines {{USS|Albacore|SS-218|2}} and {{USS|Cavalla|SS-244|2}}, respectively, and the loss of {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiy\u014d||2}} to aircraft launched from the light aircraft carrier {{USS|Belleau Wood|CVL-24|2}}. In addition to these losses, Allied forces succeeded in damaging two Japanese carriers and a battleship. The anti-aircraft fire of ''New Jersey'' and the other screening ships proved virtually impenetrable; two American ships were slightly damaged during the battle. Only 17 American planes were lost in combat.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Service with the 3rd Fleet, Admiral Halsey===\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s final contribution to the conquest of the Marianas was in strikes on Guam and the Palaus from which she sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]], arriving 9 August. Here she broke the flag of Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]],<ref>William F. Halsey held the rank of a four star Admiral throughout the Second World War. In December 1945, four months after the official surrender of the Japanese, he was promoted to the rank of [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] and awarded his fifth star. {{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title=Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey, Jr. |publisher=Naval Historical Center |date=2 June 1996 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207125512/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |archivedate= 7 December 2006 |df= }}</ref> 24 August, becoming flagship of the [[United States Third Fleet]]. On 30 August ''New Jersey'' set sail from Pearl Harbor, and for the next eight months was based at [[Ulithi]] to lend support to Allied forces operating in the Philippines. In this span of the Pacific War, fast carrier task forces ranged the waters off the Philippines, Okinawa, and [[Taiwan|Formosa]], making repeated strikes at airfields, shipping, shore bases, and invasion beaches.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nIn September the targets were in the [[Visayas]] and the southern Philippines, then [[Manila]] and [[Cavite]], [[Panay Island|Panay]], [[Negros Island|Negros]], [[Leyte Island|Leyte]], and [[Cebu Island|Cebu]]. Early in October raids to destroy enemy air power based on Okinawa and Formosa were begun in preparation for the Leyte landings of 20 October 1944.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nThis invasion brought on the last great [[sortie]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Its plan for the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] included a [[feint]] by a northern force of planeless heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the [[Leyte Gulf order of battle#Japanese Forces 2|Japanese Center Force]] to enter the gulf through [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At the opening of the battle planes from the carriers guarded by ''New Jersey'' struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23 October. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while ''New Jersey'' steamed south at [[flank speed]] to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It had been [[Battle off Samar|turned back in a stunning defeat]] when she arrived.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:USS Intrepid CV-11 kamikaze strike.jpg|thumb|left|A crewman assigned to one of ''New Jersey''{{'}}s anti-aircraft guns watches helplessly as a Japanese kamikaze pilot prepares to strike {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}.]]\n''New Jersey'' rejoined her fast carriers near San Bernardino 27 October 1944 for strikes on central and southern [[Luzon]]. Two days later, the force came under suicide attack. In a melee of anti-aircraft fire from the ships and combat air patrol, ''New Jersey'' shot down a plane whose pilot maneuvered it into the port gun galleries of {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, while machine gun fire from ''Intrepid'' wounded three of ''New Jersey's'' men. During a similar action 25 November three Japanese planes were shot down by the combined fire of the force, part of one flaming onto the flight deck of {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}. ''Intrepid'' was again attacked; she shot down one would-be kamikaze aircraft, but was crashed by another despite hits scored on the attacker by ''New Jersey'' gunners. ''New Jersey'' shot down a plane diving on {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|2}} and hit another plane which smashed into ''Cabot''{{'}}s port bow.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 18 December 1944 the ships of [[Fast Carrier Task Force|Task Force 38]] unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force\u2014 seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers\u2014 during their attempt to refuel at sea.

Each of the carriers in the Third Fleet had a weatherman aboard, and as the fleet flagship ''New Jersey'' had a highly experienced weatherman: Commander G. F. Kosco, a graduate of the aerology course at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who had also studied hurricanes in the [[West Indies]]; despite this, none of these individuals or staffs were able to give Third Fleet due warning of the impending typhoon.<ref name=\"Cobra\"/> On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers\u2014{{USS|Hull|DD-350|2}}, {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|2}} and {{USS|Spence|DD-512|2}}\u2014capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.<ref name=\"PT\"/> Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars, and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires, impact damage, or by being swept overboard.<ref name=\"Cobra\"/> As with the other battleships of TF 38, skillful seamanship brought ''New Jersey'' through the storm largely unscathed. She returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve to be met by Fleet Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n[[File:Battleship Conning Tower, or Battle Conn.jpg|thumb|Located in the center of the USS ''New Jersey''{{'}}s bridge, the conning tower, AKA \"battle conn\", contained the equipment required to \"conn\" the ship.

She guarded the carriers in their strikes on Formosa, Okinawa, and Luzon, on the coast of [[Indo-China]], Hong Kong, [[Shantou|Swatow]] and [[Amoy]], and again on Formosa and Okinawa. At Ulithi 27 January Admiral Halsey lowered his flag in ''New Jersey'', but it was replaced two days later by that of Rear Admiral [[Oscar C. Badger II]] commanding [[Battleship Division 7]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nIn support of the assault on [[Iwo Jima]], ''New Jersey'' screened the {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}} group in air attacks on the island 19 February&nbsp;\u2013 21 February, and gave the same crucial service for the first major carrier raid on Tokyo 25 February, a raid aimed specifically at aircraft production. During the next two days, Okinawa was attacked from the air by the same striking force.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' was directly engaged in the conquest of Okinawa from 14 March until 16 April. As the carriers prepared for the invasion with strikes there and on [[Honsh\u016b]], ''New Jersey'' fought off air raids, used her [[seaplane]]s to rescue downed pilots, defended the carriers from suicide planes, shooting down at least three and assisting in the destruction of others. On 24 March 1945 she again carried out the role of heavy bombardment, preparing the invasion beaches for the assault a week later.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nDuring the final months of the war, ''New Jersey'' was overhauled at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], from which she sailed 4 July for [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], Pearl Harbor, and Eniwetok bound for Guam. Here on 14 August she once again became flagship of the 5th Fleet under Admiral Spruance. Brief stays at Manila and Okinawa preceded her arrival in [[Tokyo Bay]] 17 September, where she served as flagship for the successive commanders of Naval Forces in Japanese waters until relieved 28 January 1946 by {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}} (BB-61). As part of the ongoing [[Operation Magic Carpet]] ''New Jersey'' took aboard nearly a thousand homeward-bound troops, with whom she arrived at San Francisco 10 February.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n==Post World War II (1946\u20131950)==\n[[File:New Jesery Mothballed (1948).jpg|thumb|right|''New Jersey'' photographed shortly after her 1948 decommissioning.

Present were Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, former Governor Walter E. Edge and other dignitaries.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 7 June and 26 August, ''New Jersey'' formed part of the first training squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand [[United States Naval Academy]] and [[NROTC]] midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in ''New Jersey'' at [[Rosyth]], Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at [[Oslo]], where King [[Haakon VII of Norway]] inspected the crew 2 July, and at [[Portsmouth]], England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAfter serving at New York as flagship for Rear Admiral Heber H. McLean, Commander, Battleship Division 1, 12 September&nbsp;\u2013 18 October, ''New Jersey'' was inactivated at the [[New York Naval Shipyard]]. She was decommissioned at Bayonne 30 June 1948 and assigned to the New York Group, [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n==The Korean War (1950\u20131953)==\nIn 1950 [[North Korea]] invaded South Korea, prompting the United States to intervene in the name of the United Nations. President [[Harry S. Truman]] was caught off guard when the invasion struck,<ref>American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] had told Congress on 20 June that no war was likely.</ref> but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization ''New Jersey'' was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. ''New Jersey'' was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the [[Korean War]]. She sailed from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], placed his flag in ''New Jersey'' for the next six months.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s guns opened the first shore bombardment of her Korean career at [[Wonsan]] 20 May. During her two tours of duty in Korean waters, she was again and again to play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, ''New Jersey'' used her 16-inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another, and at the same time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a [[artillery battery|shore battery]] on her number one turret and received a near miss [[aft]] to port.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:New Jersey in Korea.jpg|thumb|left|''New Jersey'' opening fire upon North Korean targets near the [[38th parallel north#Korea|38th parallel]].]]\nBetween 23 and 27 May and again 30 May 1951, ''New Jersey'' pounded targets near [[Yangyang County|Yangyang]] and [[Kansong]], dispersing troop concentrations, dropping a [[Span (architecture)|bridge span]], and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned at the end of this action, while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24 May, she lost one of her [[helicopter]]s after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nWith Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, and Vice Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], Commander Naval Forces Far East aboard, ''New Jersey'' bombarded targets at Wonsan 4 June. At Kansong two days later she fired her main battery at an artillery regiment and truck encampment, with 7th Fleet aircraft spotting targets and reporting successes. On 28 July off Wonsan the battleship was again taken under fire by shore batteries. Several near misses splashed to port, but ''New Jersey''{{'}}s precision fire silenced the enemy and destroyed several gun emplacements.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 4 and 12 July, ''New Jersey'' supported a United Nations push in the Kansong area, firing at enemy buildup and reorganization positions. As the [[Republic of Korea]]'s First Division hurled itself on the enemy, shore fire control observers saw ''New Jersey''{{'}}s salvos hit directly on enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] emplacements, supply and ammunition dumps, and personnel concentrations. ''New Jersey'' returned to Wonsan 18 July for an exhibition of perfect firing: five gun emplacements demolished with five direct hits.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' sailed to the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August, returning to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the [[Changjon]] area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAside from a brief break in firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the {{ship|Korean frigate|Apnok|PF-62}}, damaged by gunfire, ''New Jersey'' was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, supporting the movement of the [[U.S. X Corps]]. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es, [[bunker]]s, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 1 October 1951, General [[Omar Bradley]], Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and General [[Matthew B. Ridgeway]], Commander in Chief Far East, came on board to confer with Admiral Martin.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBetween 1 and 6 October ''New Jersey'' was in action daily at Kansong, [[Hamhung]], [[Hungnam]], [[Tanchon]], and [[Songjin]]. Enemy bunkers and supply concentrations provided the majority of the targets at Kansong; at the others ''New Jersey'' fired on railroads, tunnels, bridges, an [[oil refinery]], trains, and shore batteries. She also engaged an enemy gun emplacement with her five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) gun mounts, which ''New Jersey'' successfully destroyed. The Kojo area was her target 16 October as she sailed in company with {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}}, pilots from {{HMAS|Sydney|1944|6}} spotting. The operation was well-planned and coordinated, and excellent results were obtained.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAnother highly satisfactory day was 16 October, when the spotter over the Kansong area reported \"beautiful shooting every shot on target-most beautiful shooting I have seen in five years.\" This five-hour bombardment leveled ten [[artillery]] positions, and in smashing [[trench]]es and bunkers inflicted some 500 enemy casualties.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' dashed up the North Korean coast raiding transportation facilities from 1 to 6 November. She struck at bridges, road, and rail installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, Tanchon, [[Iowon]], Songjin, and Chongjin, leaving four bridges destroyed, others badly damaged, two marshaling yards badly torn up, and many feet of track destroyed. With renewed attacks on Kansong and near the [[Chang-San-Got Peninsula]] 11 and 13 November, ''New Jersey'' completed her first tour of duty in Korea.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nRelieved as flagship by {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}, ''New Jersey'' cleared [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]] for Hawaii, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the Panama Canal, and returned to Norfolk 20 December for a six-month overhaul. Between 19 July 1952 and 5 September, she sailed as flagship for Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, who commanded the NROTC midshipman training cruise to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], Lisbon, and the Caribbean. Now ''New Jersey'' prepared and trained for her second Korean tour, for which she sailed from Norfolk 5 March 1953.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:New Jersey in Korea II.jpg|thumb|right|''New Jersey'' in Japanese waters, 1953]]\nShaping her course via the Panama Canal, Long Beach, and Hawaii, New Jersey reached Yokosuka 5 April, and next day relieved {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} as flagship of Vice Admiral Joseph H. Clark, Commander 7th Fleet. On 12 April ''New Jersey'' returned to action by shelling Chongjin; in seven minutes she scored seven direct hits, blowing away half the main communications building there. At [[Pusan]] two days later, ''New Jersey'' manned her rails to welcome the [[President of South Korea|President of the Republic of Korea]] and Madame Rhee, and American Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' fired on coastal batteries and buildings at Kojo 16 April; on railway track and tunnels near Hungnam 18 April; and on gun emplacements around [[Wonsan Harbor]] 20 April, silencing them in five areas after she had herself taken several near misses. Songjin provided targets 23 April. Here ''New Jersey'' scored six direct 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) hits on a railroad tunnel and knocked out two rail bridges.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' provided artillery support for a major air and surface strike on Wonsan 1 May, as 7th Fleet planes both attacked the enemy and spotted for the battleship. She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day, and four days later destroyed the key observation post on the island of [[Hodo Pando]], commanding the harbor. Two days later [[Kalmagak]] at Wonsan was her target.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey''{{'}}s tenth birthday, 23 May 1953, was celebrated at [[Incheon]] with President and Madame Rhee, Lieutenant General [[Maxwell D.

Two days later ''New Jersey'' returned to action along the west coast at [[Chinampo]] to knock out harbor defense positions.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:USS New Jersey BB-62 salvo Jan 1953.jpeg|thumb|left|''New Jersey'' fires a six gun salvo of 16 in shells into an enemy troop concentration near [[Kaesong]], Korea.]]\nThe battleship was under fire at Wonsan 27 May&nbsp;\u2013 29 May, but her five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns silenced the counter-fire, and her 16-inch shells destroyed five gun emplacements and four gun caves. She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly: either a [[oil depot|fuel storage area]] or an [[ammunition dump]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' returned to the key task of direct support to troops at [[Kosong]] 7 June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches, then stood by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day she returned to troop support at Kosong, her assignment until 10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAt Wonsan 11 July&nbsp;\u2013 12 July, ''New Jersey'' fired one of the most concentrated bombardments of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven the second, her guns opened fire on gun positions and bunkers on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves and tunnels sealed. ''New Jersey'' smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo 13 July, and was once more on the east coast bombline 22 July&nbsp;\u2013 24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong. These days found her gunners at their most accurate: A large cave, housing an important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a month-long United Nations effort, and a great many bunkers, artillery areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were destroyed.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAt sunrise on 25 July 1953 ''New Jersey'' was off the key port, rail and communications center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a [[whaleboat]] in an attempt to spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Post Korean War (1953\u20131967)===\n''New Jersey's'' mission at Wonsan, the next day, was her last. Here she destroyed large-caliber guns, bunkers, caves and trenches. Two days later, she learned of the truce. Her crew celebrated during a seven-day visit at Hong Kong, where she anchored 20 August. Operations around Japan and off Formosa were carried out for the remainder of her tour, which was highlighted by a visit to Pusan. Here president Rhee came aboard on 16 September to present the [[Presidential Unit Citation (Korea)|Korean Presidential Unit Citation]] to the 7th Fleet.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nRelieved as flagship at Yokosuka by ''Wisconsin'' 14 October, ''New Jersey'' was homeward bound the next day, reaching Norfolk on 14 November. During the next two summers she crossed the Atlantic with [[midshipmen]] on board for training, and during the rest of the year sharpened her skills with exercises and training maneuvers along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' stood out of Norfolk 7 September 1955 for her first tour of duty with the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] in the [[Mediterranean]]. Her ports of call included [[Gibraltar]], [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], [[Cannes]], [[Istanbul]], [[Souda Bay]]; and [[Barcelona]]. She returned to Norfolk 7 January 1956 for the spring program of training operations. That summer she again carried midshipmen to Northern Europe for training, bringing them home to [[Annapolis]] 31 July. ''New Jersey'' sailed for Europe once more 27 August as flagship of Vice Admiral Charles Wellborn, Jr., Commander [[United States Second Fleet]]. She called at Lisbon, participated in [[NATO]] exercises off Scotland, and paid an official visit to Norway where Crown Prince [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]] was a guest. She returned to Norfolk 15 October, and 14 December arrived at New York Naval Shipyard for inactivation. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bayonne 21 August 1957.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n==The Vietnam War (1967\u20131969)==\nDue to heavy loss rates of U.S. aircraft (commencing with [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] in 1965), studies were conducted on ways of alleviating those air losses while at the same time delivering the ordnance payloads required by the escalation of the war. On 31 May 1967 the Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] authorized a study aimed at determining what would be required to get ''New Jersey'' reactivated in her present condition, and when the results of the submitted study proved favorable toward the reactivation he took action.<ref name=\"BAW\">{{cite book |last=Frick |first=Martin P. |editor=Lightbody, Andy |editor2=Blaine, Taylor |title=Battleships at War: America's Century Long Romance with the Big Guns of the Fleet |publisher=Challenge Publications, Inc |location=Canoga Park, CA |pages=64, 65, 86\u201389 |chapter=The Big Guns: America's Century Long Romance with the Battleship |year=1991}}</ref> In August 1967 the Secretary of Defense made the decision to recommission a battleship \"for employment in the Pacific Fleet to augment the naval gunfire support force in Southeast Asia\".<ref name=\"vets\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ussnewjersey.org/1968_narrative.htm |title=Narrative 1968 History of USS New Jersey (BB-62) |accessdate=2005-05-26 |publisher=USS New Jersey Veteran's, INC}}</ref> ''New Jersey'' was selected for this task because she was in better material condition than her sisters, having received an extensive overhaul prior to decommissioning. Upon her reactivation she underwent a period of modernization during which the 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns on the battleship were removed, and she received improved electronic warfare systems and improvements to her radar.

Further training off Southern California followed. On 24 July ''New Jersey'' received 16&nbsp;inch shells and powder tanks from {{USS|Mount Katmai|AE-16|2}} by conventional highline transfer and by helicopter lift, the first time heavy battleship ammunition had been transferred by helicopter at sea (now known as [[vertical replenishment]]).<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[File:New Jersey Underway.jpg|thumb|left|''New Jersey'' off [[Oahu]] in September 1968, prior to departure on her first WESTPAC cruise following recommissioning for service in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].]]\nDeparting Long Beach 2 September, ''New Jersey'' touched at Pearl Harbor and [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] before sailing 25 September for her first tour on the ''[[wikt:gun line|gun line]]''<ref name=\"Polmar, p. 129\">Polmar, p. 129</ref> along the Vietnamese coast. Near the 17th parallel on 30 September, the battleship fired her first shots in battle in over sixteen years, expending a total of 29 sixteen inch rounds against [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) targets in and near the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) at the 17th parallel.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\n''New Jersey'' took up station off [[C\u1ed3n C\u1ecf District|Tiger Island]] 1 October and fired at targets north of the DMZ before moving south that afternoon to engage [[Viet Cong]] targets. She accounted for six bunkers, a supply truck and an anti-aircraft site that day; additionally, she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti-aircraft fire. On 3 October ''New Jersey'' fired on targets south of Tiger Island, and on 4 October the battleship fired on a Communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers. On the evening of 7 October ''New Jersey'' received reports that a number of waterborne logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River. ''New Jersey'' responded by closing on the formation, and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 11 October ''New Jersey'' engaged a coastal installation with her guns; however, she shifted her fire when a recon plane spotting for the battleship reported an enemy truck concentration north of Nha Ky. ''New Jersey'' gunners quickly retrained the battleship's big guns and managed to inflict heavy damage on six of the vehicles.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nEarly on the morning of 12 October ''New Jersey'' trained her guns in anticipation of shelling the heavily fortified and well protected Vinh caves. For the next three days ''New Jersey'' pounded the area with her 16&nbsp;in shells in an effort to eliminate the Viet Cong presence in the region. Aided by spotter aircraft from the aircraft carrier {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, ''New Jersey'' engaged enemy targets, setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave. On 14 October ''New Jersey'' shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island, destroying one battery on the island.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 16 October ''New Jersey'' took up station in support of the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|U.S. 3rd Marine Division]]. Using both the 16&nbsp;in and 5&nbsp;in guns ''New Jersey'' engaged and destroyed 13&nbsp;structures and an artillery site, in the process halting an enemy platoon moving through the DMZ. ''New Jersey'' continued to lend firepower support on the 17th until departing to lend her gunfire to the First Field Force. Foul weather prevented spotter aircraft from flying until 20 October; however, ''New Jersey'' quickly made up for lost time on the gun line by destroying a Viet Cong command post and nine bunkers in support of the [[173d Airborne Brigade (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]], who were operating about {{convert|50|mi|km|-1}} north of Nha Trang. The next day ''New Jersey'' maneuvered into the waters of the Baie de Van Fong to fire at Viet Cong command posts, but poor visibility of the target area prevented any damage estimates.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn the night of 23 October ''New Jersey'' steamed north to rearm before taking up position in support of the 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day ''New Jersey'' engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at ''New Jersey'' with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at ''New Jersey''; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information ''New Jersey'' fired five 16&nbsp;inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 28 October ''New Jersey'' steamed south to engage Communist targets. During the shelling aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft fire to the extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, ''New Jersey'' altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day ''New Jersey'' leveled 30&nbsp;structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. ''New Jersey'' responded by firing six 16&nbsp;inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nUpon completion of this mission ''New Jersey'' steamed south, taking a position off [[Da Nang]] and Point DeDe to lend naval gunfire support to the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Marine Division]] operating in the area. On 2 November ''New Jersey'' commenced firing operations against nine positions, but the heavy foliage in the area prevented spotters from seeing the results of the shelling.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 4 November ''New Jersey'' received orders to reinforce southern [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] near [[Phan Thi\u1ebft]]; she arrived on station later that night. The next day she answered eight call for fire support missions from the 173rd Airborne Brigade, in the process destroying eight Viet Cong bunkers and five structures. On 11 November ''New Jersey'' departed Vietnamese waters to replenish; she returned to the gunline 23 November and relieved {{USS|Galveston|CLG-3|6}}, taking up position in support of the U.S. Army's [[Americal Division]]. That afternoon ''New Jersey''{{'}}s 5&nbsp;inch guns shelled enemy buildings, destroying 15&nbsp;structures and inflicted heavy damage on 29&nbsp;others.<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nOn 25 November ''New Jersey'' launched the most destructive shore bombardment of her Vietnam tour. For the next two days the battleship concentrated her fire at Viet Cong storage areas near [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i]], destroying 182&nbsp;structures and 54&nbsp;bunkers, inflicting heavy damage to 93&nbsp;structures, and demolishing several tunnel complexes before departing for Point Betsy near Hue 27 November to support the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]].<ref name=\"vets\"/>\n\nBetween 2 and 8 December ''New Jersey'' returned to aid the 3rd Marine Division, shelling Viet Cong bunker complexes for the Marines operating around the Da Nang area before departing for Singapore 9 December. On 26 December ''New Jersey'' returned to the gunline, taking up station off [[Tuy H\u00f2a]] in support of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] 47th Regiment. For the next three days ''New Jersey'' fired her guns to support the II Corps, in the process destroying Viet Cong bunkers and supply depots and neutralizing enemy cave posts.

The battleship's target was a suspected subterranean staging area for a Viet Cong regiment. ''New Jersey''{{'}}s big guns went to work on the complex, firing 16&nbsp;inch shells into tunnels and bunkers to aid the ground troops. On 14 February the battleship steamed south of the DMZ to provide support for the 3rd Marine Division, in the process destroying an anti-aircraft site with her big guns. The next day ''New Jersey'' fired on an enemy rocket site northeast of [[Con Thien]], destroying the facility, then trained her guns on known Communist positions to harass PAVN forces. On 22 February ''New Jersey'' responded to an urgent request for fire support from the besieged [[Ocean View, Viet Nam|Oceanview observation post]] near the DMZ.

She arrived at Yokosuka for a two-day visit, sailing for the United States 9 April. Her homecoming, however, was to be delayed. On the 15th, while ''New Jersey'' was still at sea, North Korean jet fighters [[EC-121 shootdown incident|shot down]] an unarmed [[EC-121 Constellation]] electronic surveillance plane over the [[Sea of Japan]], killing its entire crew. A carrier task force was formed and sent to the Sea of Japan, while ''New Jersey'' was ordered to come about and steam toward Japan. On the 22nd she arrived once more at Yokosuka, and immediately put to sea in readiness for what might befall.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAs the crisis eased, ''New Jersey'' was released to continue her interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, ''New Jersey''{{'}}s crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] released a list of names of ships to be inactivated; at the top of the list was ''New Jersey''.<ref>Persistent rumors have suggested that the real reason that ''New Jersey'' was decommissioned had to do with the [[Paris Peace Talks]], some source suggest that the Vietnamese would not meet with U.S. representatives unless ''New Jersey'' was removed from the gunline, other sources suggest that the Vietnamese offered to meet with representatives of the United States if ''New Jersey'' was returned to the states.

He is Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], associate member of Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Program and member of the Committee for Philosophy and the Sciences.\n\n==Education==\nBefore he moved to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 2001, Carruthers was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]] where he founded and directed the Hang Seng Centre for Cognitive Studies and prior to that was a lecturer at [[University of Essex]], [[Queen's University of Belfast]], [[University of St. Andrews]], and [[University of Oxford]]. He was educated at the [[University of Leeds]] before studying for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] at [[University of Oxford]] under [[Michael Dummett]].\n\n==Philosophical work==\nCarruthers' primary research interests are in [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of psychology]], and [[cognitive science]]. He has worked especially on theories of consciousness, the role of [[natural language]] in human cognition, and [[modularity of mind]], but has also published on such issues as: the mentality of animals; the nature and status of our [[folk psychology]]; nativism (innateness); human creativity; theories of [[intentional content]]; and defence of a notion of narrow content for psychological explanation. He is presently working on a book project, tentatively entitled [[Telepathy|Mind-reading]] and [[Meta-cognition]], which examines the cognitive basis of our understanding of the minds of others and its relationship to our access to our own minds.  He has also written a book in applied ethics, arguing that animals do not have moral rights.\n\n===Notable ideas===\n;The role of language in cognition\nThere is a spectrum of opinions on the role of language in cognition. At one extreme, philosophers like [[Michael Dummett]] have argued that thought is impossible in the absence of language; and social scientists influenced by [[Benjamin Whorf]] have believed that the natural languages that people grow up speaking will have a profound influence on the character of their thoughts. At the other extreme, philosophers like [[Jerry Fodor]], together with most cognitive scientists, have believed that language is but an input/output device for cognition, playing no significant role in thought itself. Peter Carruthers has steered a path in between these two extremes. In his 1996 book,<ref>''Language, Thought and Consciousness: an essay in philosophical psychology'' (1996). Cambridge University Press.\n[http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/Faculty/pcarruthers/Blurb-LTC.htm]</ref> he allowed that much thought can and does occur in the absence of language, while arguing for a constitutive role for language in conscious thinking, conducted in \"[[inner speech]]\". In his 2006 book,<ref name=\"philosophy.umd.edu\">''The Architecture of the Mind: massive modularity and the flexibility of thought'' (2006). Oxford University Press. [http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/Faculty/pcarruthers/Blurb-AoM.htm]</ref> this position is broadened and deepened. Following [[Antonio Damasio]], he argues that mental rehearsals of action issue in imagery that plays a profound role in human practical reasoning, with inner speech now being seen as a subset of action rehearsal. Carruthers now argues that the serial use of these rehearsals can issue in a whole new ''level'' of thinking and reasoning, serving to realize the \"dual systems\" that psychologists like [[Daniel Kahneman]] believe to be involved in human reasoning processes.\n\n;Massive modularity of the human mind\n[[Evolutionary psychologist]]s like [[Leda Cosmides]], [[John Tooby]], and [[Steven Pinker]] have claimed that the mind consists of a great many distinct functionally specialized systems, or modules. [[Jerry Fodor]] has argued, in contrast, that the \"central\" processes of the mind (judging, reasoning, deciding, and so forth) ''cannot'' be modular. In his 2006 book,<ref name=\"philosophy.umd.edu\"/> Peter Carruthers lays out the main case supporting massive modularity, shows how the notion of \"module\" in this context should properly be understood, and takes up Fodor's challenge by showing how the distinctive flexibility, creativity, and rationality of the human mind can result from the interactions of massive numbers of modules.\n\n;Dispositional higher-order thought theory of consciousness\nAmongst philosophers who think that [[consciousness]] admits of explanation, the most popular approach has been some or other variety of [[representationalism]]. Representationalists hold that the distinctive features of consciousness can be explained by appeal to the representational contents (together with the causal roles) of experience. First-order representationalists like [[Fred Dretske]] and [[Michael Tye (philosopher)]] believe that the relevant contents are world-directed ones (colors, sounds, and so forth) of a distinctive sort (non-conceptual, analog, or fine-grained). Higher-order representationalists like [[William Lycan]], [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]], and Peter Carruthers, in contrast, maintain that we need to be aware of undergoing these first-order experiences in order for the latter to qualify as conscious. On Carruthers' view, the awareness in question is dispositional. By virtue of an experience being available to higher-order thought, it is claimed to acquire a higher-order non-conceptual content. Hence, conscious experiences have a dual content: while representing the world to us, they also represent themselves to us. Conscious experiences are thus held to be self-representational ones.\n\n;The denial of introspection for thoughts\nMost people (philosophers and non-philosophers alike) assume that they have direct introspective access to their own propositional attitude events of judging, deciding, and so forth.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} We think of ourselves as knowing our own thought processes immediately, without having to interpret ourselves (in the way that we ''do'' need to interpret the behavior and circumstances of other people if we are to know what ''they'' are thinking). In a series of recent papers Peter Carruthers has argued that this introspective intuition is illusory. While allowing that we do have introspective access to our own experiences, including imagistic experiences of the sort that occur during \"inner speech\", he draws on evidence from across the cognitive sciences to argue that our knowledge of our own judgments and decisions results from us turning our interpretative skills upon ourselves. He also argues that while inner speech plays important roles in human cognition, it never plays the right ''sort'' of role to constitute a judgment, or a decision. The latter processes always occur below the surface of consciousness, Carruthers claims.\n\n==Selected publications==\n* ''The Animals Issue. Moral Theory in Practice'' (1992).

At Liverpool, Keegan won three [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles, the [[UEFA Cup]] twice, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He also gained his first England cap in 1972, and moved to West German club Hamburger SV in the summer of 1977. At Hamburg, he was named [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] in 1978 and 1979, won the [[Bundesliga]] title in 1978\u201379, and reached the European Cup final in 1980. Keegan moved to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] that summer, and spent two seasons at the club before a transfer to Newcastle United in the English [[Football League Division Two|second division]] in 1982. He helped Newcastle to promotion in his second season, and retired from football in 1984, having been capped 63&nbsp;times for England, scoring 21&nbsp;goals.\n\nHe moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, winning promotion as First Division champions. Newcastle then finished second in the [[Premier League]] in 1995\u201396, after leading for most of the season. After a spell at Fulham, he took charge of the England team in February 1999, but resigned in October 2000, following a 1\u20130 loss against Germany in qualification for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 9|2002 FIFA World Cup]]. He then became manager of Manchester City in 2001 and spent four years at the club before resigning in 2005. He had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle United for a second spell as manager in January 2008. This spell lasted only eight months, as Keegan resigned on 4 September 2008 following speculation regarding a dispute with the club's directors.<ref name=quit>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7593683.stm|title= Keegan resigns as Newcastle boss |accessdate=4 September 2008|publisher=BBC  | date=4 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:FrankKeegan1909.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Keegan's grandfather Frank Keegan]]His ancestors arrived in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] from Ireland.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Location 380\u2013381}} In 1909, his grandfather Frank, an inspector, heroically saved lives in the [[West Stanley Pit disaster]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Location 362\u2013380}} His father Joe and uncle Frank were Newcastle United fans.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Location 311\u2013317}} His father was a man who liked a bet and a pint of beer, and his favourite Newcastle footballers were [[Hughie Gallacher]] and [[Jackie Milburn]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 312}} His father Joe though, never saw Keegan play for Newcastle.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=(Kindle Locations 325\u2013326)}} His father Joe moved to Armthorpe in Doncaster to work in a colliery.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Location 381\u2013382}} His father would marry Doris{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 324}} and they would go on to have three children, Mary who was two years Keegan's senior,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 407}} Kevin Keegan, and Mike.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}}\n\nKeegan was born in [[Armthorpe]] in [[Doncaster]]. He was born at his auntie Nellie's house at 32 Elm place, Armthorpe.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=(Kindle Locations 385\u2013386)}} His aunt's house was chosen as she had electricity that made it safer for childbirth.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=(Kindle Locations 385\u2013386)}} Keegan attended his local school, St. Peter's High School,<ref name = FATS>{{cite book |last1=Chalk |first1=Gary|last2=Holley|first2=Duncan |last3=Bull|first3=David |title=All the Saints: A Complete Players' Who's Who of Southampton FC|year=2013|location=Southampton|publisher=Hagiology Publishing| isbn=978-0-9926-8640-6|p=367}}</ref> in nearby Cantley.\n\nKeegan was given his first football by his uncle Frank.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 315}} Keegan's first pair of football boots were bought by his father after he had a win on the horses.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 316}} They were a second-hand pair of Winit boots bought from the former Doncaster Rovers centre forward, [[Ray Harrison]]'s sports shop.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 316}} Keegan would play football at Hyde Park using his baby brother, Michael in his pushchair as a goal post.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 460}} As a boy he supported Doncaster Rovers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 272\u2013280}} His favourite player was [[Alick Jeffrey]],{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 272\u2013280}} a player, once described by Matt Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy as the ''English Pele'',{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 272\u2013280}} and once described by Jackie Milburn as ''the best young player he had ever seen''.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 272\u2013280}} Though Jeffrey had the misfortune of breaking his leg at a young age just before a big move from Doncaster was mooted, and in his second spell at Doncaster had put on a bit too much weight to be a footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 272\u2013280}} As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], under manager [[Jimmy Hill]]. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back [[Brian Joy]] who also went onto have a 15-year career in football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 492\u2013513}} Keegan also had a trial with his local football club Doncaster Rovers. The trial was arranged by his father but when Keegan arrived for a trial he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 486}}\n\nKeegan was in to sports, such as cross country running, rugby, football, and even captaining his schools poor cricket team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 508\u2013509}} He also boxed at his local boxing club run by the former British Heavyweight champion boxer [[Bruce Woodcock (boxer)|Bruce Woodcock]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1345}} At age 15 Keegan, with two friends, ran a 50-mile run from [[Nottingham]] to [[Doncaster]]. After completing this run Keegan claimed he would never hit a psychological brick wall again with regards to running. In his autobiography Keegan claimed this run prepared him physically and psychologically for any running he had to do in any future pre-season training or football matches.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 636\u2013650}} Keegan, distracted by sport, would leave school with [['O'Level]]s in History and Art.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 511}}\n\nAt the age of 15 Keegan started work at [[Pegler Yorkshire|Pegler Brass Works]] as an office clerk; though Keegan admitted he was more of a tea boy and a messenger than an office clerk.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 512}} Whilst working at Pegler, Keegan continued playing Saturday afternoon football for his local youth club Enfield House and playing Sunday morning football for the Lonsdale Hotel.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 518}} It was whilst he was at Pegler that a colleague of Keegan, named Harry Holland, asked Keegan if he fancied a go at playing for the Peglers Works reserves on a Saturday morning; down beaten Keegan accepted the offer to play for the reserve team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 521}} His chance at professional football did not come at Pegler Works reserves, but came when he was playing Sunday morning league football. When Keegan was playing for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966, Keegan was marked by an older player, in his mid 30s, called Bob Nellis. After playing against Keegan, Nellis became impressed by the ability of Keegan. Nellis had some contacts at Scunthorpe United, and in turn offered Keegan a trial at [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth division]] [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] \u2013 one of just two professional sides in the division. This trial would lead to the Scunthorpe manager [[Ron Ashman]] giving Keegan his first contract in professional football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 530\u2013543}}<ref name=\"bbcsport\"/>{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\n==Playing career==\n===Scunthorpe United (1966\u20131971)===\nScunthorpe United could not afford a set of football nets and trained on a rugby pitch at [[Quibell Park Stadium|Quibell Park]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 582}} They also, risking injury, had five-a-side training sessions on the Old Showground concrete car park.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 586}} Still though, at Scunthorpe Keegan would take his training very seriously. Twice a week, after training, Keegan would train with a teammate named Derek Hemstead and they would train by doing weighted [[farmers walk]]s up and down the cantilever stand at the [[Old Showground]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 657}} A trait Keegan had was his running ability. In running drills at Scunthorpe Keegan liked trying to finish first and Keegan was told by Jack Brownsword that one thing he has going for him is that he is a one hundred percenter and he should never lose that.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 652}} Though this will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior pro's such as Liverpool's [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]]{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 650}} and Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 649}}\n\nScunthorpe, a club with little money, did not have a full-time driver to drive them to away games and Keegan, with other the other younger players, such as Nigel Jackson, would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 578}} Young Keegan, fellow driver Nigel Jackson and fellow young professionals Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson, once borrowed coach [[Jack Brownsword]]'s stop watch and had timed rallies around the Old Showground with the clubs vintage tractor.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} On Keegan's turn the tractor crashed and the tractor's axle went through the engine.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} The crash was very expensive to fix and the five were given a rollicking by manager Ron Ashman.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} Keegan made his debut against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] at the age of 17, making 29 league starts in his first season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 660}} He became a regular in the first team by the [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370 season]], playing all 46 league games for the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} This season saw the team reach the fifth-round of the [[FA Cup]], beating [[Football League First Division]] side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] along the way. Keegan then missed only one game in his last season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} Earning a pittance, meant Keegan each summer had to find summer jobs; and each summer he would do jobs such as plate-laying at the [[Scunthorpe Steelworks|Appleby Frodingham Steelworks]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 600}}\n\n{{external media | float = right | width = 300px | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_KSWseOaaE?start=32&end=127 Keegan interviewed in 1969-70]}} Keegan played regularly in a [[playmaker|creative]] [[right midfield]] role for the Scunthorpe United first team despite his age \u2013 he scored 18 goals in 124 games for the club. After his first season he started attracting interest from higher division clubs. In one rare television interview of Keegan at Scunthorpe in 1969\u201370, Keegan tried to play down the interest, stating: \"I'm getting first-team football here. Should think if I went First Division, I'd struggle a bit.\"{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 665}} Not long after this interview, Keegan, noting other players had moved on to a higher level, began to feel impatient about moving on and Keegan even considered packing the game in and getting a full-time job if he did not get a move to a higher level.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 667\u2013672}} Higher division clubs such as Preston, Birmingham City, Notts County, Millwall and Arsenal all showed interest but nothing came of it.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 677}}\n\nIn 1971, he attracted the attention of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s head scout [[Geoff Twentyman]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/08/07/liverpool-fc-super-scout-geoff-twentyman-s-secret-diary-revealed-100252-24338468/|title=Liverpool FC super-scout Geoff Twentyman's secret diary revealed| first= Tony |last = Barret| date = 7 August 2009|accessdate=29 April 2011|newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Secret Diary of a Liverpool Scout| first=Simon |last=Hughes| date = 6 August 2009|publisher=Trinity Mirror Sport Media}}</ref> whose opinion was held in high regard by manager [[Bill Shankly]]. After Twentyman's recommendation, Liverpool made an offer for Keegan and this offer was accepted by Scunthorpe United. After Scunthorpe had agreed to the fee Keegan was driven the 4 hours to Bill Shankly's office by manager Ron Ashman who was determined to get a cash influx for Scunthorpe United.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 729\u2013737}} Prior to the journey Keegan's father prompted Keegan to not sell himself cheap.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 738}} Keegan then haggled a contract worth \u00a350 a week from Shankly, after Shankly had originally offered him \u00a345.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 729\u2013737}} Ashman, sensing a cash windfall may fall through, was at one stage aghast at Keegan's negotiation game.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 729\u2013737}} On the drive back to Scunthorpe Ashman was critical at Keegan's bluff that he was almost earning \u00a345 a week at a fourth division football club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 729\u2013737}} After the negotiation Keegan was transferred to Liverpool for \u00a333,000{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 701}} in 1971, at the age of 20.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-fans-info.com/kevin-keegan.html|title=Kevin Keegan Biography|accessdate=28 July 2008|publisher=soccer-fans-info.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916201600/http://www.soccer-fans-info.com/kevin-keegan.html|archivedate=16 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Playing upfront===\nLiverpool bought Keegan as a midfielder, but Shankly soon decided to move Keegan upfront alongside Toshack. In a reserve match against [[Tranmere Rovers]] Keegan, playing right midfield, and after playing a game with an attacking philosophy he was strongly warned by [[Ronnie Moran]] that he was ''\"playing too free and easy,\"'' and ''\"nearly playing up front.\"''{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 793\u2013799}} At one stage Keegan took Moran's criticism on board, took the criticism as a slight, and for a period perceived that Moran strongly had it in for him.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 800}} As a result of young Keegan's lack of positional discipline, Keegan was then tested upfront in a preseason reserve match against Southport.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 802}} Keegan scored both goals in a 2\u20131 victory.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 802}} This match was watched by Shankly.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 802}} Liverpool then tried Keegan in attack at Melwood in a game between the first team and the reserves.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 803}} Keegan played for the first team and scored 4 in a 7\u20130 victory.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 806}} His attacking play and ability prompted manager Bill Shankly to stop playing Keegan at right midfield and instead Shankly decided Keegan would be more effective upfront.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 793\u2013815}} After his first preseason at Liverpool Keegan was immediately deployed as the new strike partner for [[John Toshack]].<ref name=lfc>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-players/kevin-keegan|title=Past Player Profile: Kevin Keegan|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=Liverpool F.C.}}</ref>\n\nThough Keegan did like Toshack as a teammate, Keegan never socialised with him off the pitch and Keegan maintained it was almost spooky how much they instantaneously could read each other's little and large game.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 869\u2013875}} In his career Keegan explained that the only player who reached that level of footballing understanding with him was England international [[Trevor Brooking]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 869\u2013875}}\n\n===Liverpool (1971\u20131977)===\nOn 14 August 1971, Keegan made his Liverpool debut against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[Anfield]], scoring after 12 minutes.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=83\u2013118}} Keegan made his debut at under-23 level later in 1971. His full debut in a World Cup qualifier against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Ninian Park]]. Keegan's first goal for his country also came in a game against Wales in Cardiff. This time it was a [[British Home Championship]] match that England won 2\u20130 on 11 May 1974, his third full cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/england/News/2007/kevin_keegan|title=Legends: Kevin Keegan|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> Shankly had told Keegan he would play for England 18 month before it happened.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 750\u2013755}}\n\nEarly on at Liverpool, Keegan stopped acknowledging his first name Joseph on his autograph and just signed it ''Kevin Keegan'', instead of the ''JK Keegan'' that he scribbled at Scunthorpe.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 835}}\n\nIn [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]], Keegan won his first major honours. [[Don Revie]]'s Leeds United visited Anfield on [[Easter Monday]] for a showdown involving two of the three League challengers. The game turned on a few minutes either side of half time. First Leeds' [[Peter Lorimer]] missed an open goal. Two minutes after the break [[Peter Cormack]] took his chance to put Liverpool ahead. Keegan added a late second to seal the win. With Arsenal dropping a point at Southampton, Liverpool duly closed out the title with a final game 0\u20130 draw against [[Leicester City]].

The [[1973 UEFA Cup Final]] first leg at Anfield was abandoned due to a downpour after 27 minutes and rescheduled to be played again the next day. The 27 minutes that had been played had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]]'s defensive vulnerability in the air.

Liverpool, however, progressed to the FA Cup final. Their campaign in the competition had started with a tie against the club which had rejected Keegan, Doncaster Rovers, and it was Keegan who scored both Liverpool goals in a 2\u20132 draw. Liverpool won the replay and Keegan scored twice more on the way to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], including a lob-volley over the head of England colleague [[Peter Shilton]] in the semi-final against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at [[Villa Park]].\n\nIn the [[1974 FA Cup Final|1974 final]], Liverpool played Newcastle United.

Leeds had decided to niggle at Liverpool, and in particular Keegan, in the match. In one instance [[Johnny Giles]] punched the unsuspecting Keegan and was reprieved after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Giles, after escaping a red card, then later lunged two-footed at Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Upon Keegan's outraged reaction [[Billy Bremner]] challenged Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Keegan then exploded and punched Bremner.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Bremner punched back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They were sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan visibly shaken by the decision.

There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]]. Keegan scored in both legs of the UEFA Cup final against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]], having only scored once previously during Liverpool's run in the competition.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\nIn [[1976\u201377 Liverpool F.C. season|1976\u201377]], Keegan helped Liverpool get close to an unprecedented \"[[treble (association football)|treble]]\" of League championship, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], although midway through the season he announced his intention to leave in the summer to play abroad. Nevertheless, Keegan was irrepressible as Liverpool clinched the title and reached the finals of both Cup competitions. Keegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil saw Liverpool lose the FA Cup final to bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], ending the possibility of the treble.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} The European Cup final in [[Rome]] against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by [[Berti Vogts]]. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by [[Phil Neal]], sealing a 3\u20131 win. In this season, on the 4 December 1976, Keegan's father, who had been suffering from cancer, died at the age of 71.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}}\n\nAfter 323 appearances and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had been made offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join [[Hamburger SV]] in the West German [[Bundesliga]] for \u00a3500,000. Liverpool replaced him with [[Kenny Dalglish]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, \"The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Kop]].

In training he would not receive the ball after he made a run.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1248-1253}} Rules also stated that no club was allowed more than two foreign players, and unknowingly to Keegan he had also upset some of his new teammates as his move had indirectly moved out the three times European Cup winner [[Horst Blankenburg]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} Blankenburg was a very popular member of the squad.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} There was also a belief and a resentment amongst the players that the previous coach, who the players liked and did not think needed replacing, was replaced by Krohn, to accommodate Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1263-1267}} It was not until Keegan had moved out of temporary accommodation and moved to a bungalow in the little village of [[Itzstedt]] that Keegan began to feel he could make inroads and make a go of football and life in Germany.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1278}}\n\nIn one early interview Keegan mentioned how he was settling in. He explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg fans then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1321-1324}} There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1314}}\n\nHe scored in pre-season friendlies against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and former club Liverpool, but the club suffered defeat in the [[European Super Cup]] against the [[Merseyside]]rs. Keegan's time in Hamburg got off to a bad start. Keegan's first league match was against Duisburg and Hamburg lost 5-2.

Although the club finished tenth in the league in [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|1977\u201378]], Keegan's 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour, the ''[[France Football]]'' [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award for 1978.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}}<ref name=FF>{{cite web|url=http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|title=Ballon d'or|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=France Football|language=French|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204919/http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHamburg appointed [[Branko Zebec]], a Yugoslav as a new coach.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec was a man who was known to work players to the max.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec's squad did a lot of running and Keegan claimed he had never been worked as hard in his life.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1386}} The [[1978\u201379 Bundesliga|1978\u201379 season]] saw a vast improvement on the club's 1978 finish.

In February in the 1979-80 season, Keegan announced he was leaving after his contract was up. One of the reasons for leaving was Zebec's training regime. Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} though Keegan also reasoned that Zebec's extreme fitness regime philosophy was flawed for the modern-day footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan even told Zebec that his training regime would burn himself out as a footballer and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan's critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} At Hamburg Keegan even doodled with a pen and paper what he thought of the training regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} Keegan, as the metaphorical prisoner, drew a cartoon picture of Zebec in sunglasses, with he and his teammates doing press-ups, and then scribed Roman numerals conveying Keegan was counting down to his freedom. These drawings were left in his training ground locker. The drawings and Keegan's personal locker are now held in the Hamburg museum under the title 'HSV Legenden'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}}\n\nHamburg's [[1979\u201380 European Cup|European campaign of 1979\u201380]] saw Keegan score two goals to help Hamburg past [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], Soviet champions who had beaten Liverpool to reach the latter stages.

Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of \u00a3500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 1980.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=173\u2013191}}\n\n===Southampton (1980\u20131982)===\nOn 11 February 1980, [[Lawrie McMenemy]] called a press conference at the Potters Heron hotel, [[Ampfield]] to announce that the European Footballer of the Year would be joining Southampton in the forthcoming summer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of [[Southampton]], as Southampton were a relatively small club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The club were beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be, especially when Keegan captained England in the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] in Italy.\n\nKeegan had a clause inserted into his contract when he joined Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1562}} Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause when he returned to England three years later. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, \"I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, 'No, we won't be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'\" It was, therefore, Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy who snapped him up for \u00a3420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at [[Lansdowne Road]] in a pre-season friendly against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 23 July 1980.\n\nKeegan's two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], [[Phil Boyer]], [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1557-1559}} In [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] Saints scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}}\n\nIn the following season, Keegan was able to produce some of his best form and at the beginning of April 1982 Southampton sat at the top of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} but a run of only three wins from the end of February meant a seventh-place finish,<ref>{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk | title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=167| isbn= }}</ref> 21 points off 1st place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} Despite this, Keegan was voted the [[PFA Player of the Year]] and awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to Association Football.

Keegan who had stated that he would never enter football management, did carry out occasional work as a football pundit for British television.\n\n==International career==\nKeegan made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1\u20130 World Cup qualifying win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Keegan appeared in only the two matches against Wales during this campaign as England failed to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=ES>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=557|title=Kevin Keegan|accessdate=30 July 2008|publisher=englandstats.com}}</ref>\n\nHe scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He was given the captaincy by manager [[Don Revie]] in 1976 after [[Gerry Francis]] fell victim to a long term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].\n\nKeegan captained England at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 Euros]]. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.\n\nHe managed only one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1978]] tournaments. He finally reached a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1982]] when England got to the finals in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in all of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not be around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a [[medical specialist|specialist]] he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final second-round game against hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. During this time he missed a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0\u20130 and were eliminated from the competition.\n\nFollowing the successful start to the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager [[Bobby Robson]] did not select Keegan for his first squad,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TvFtlOSX_g | title = Match of the 80s \u2013 Season 82\u201383 (Part 1 of 4) | publisher = YouTube | date = 13 July 2007 | accessdate =27 August 2011}}</ref> a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself. Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He had won a total of 63 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 21 goals.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to football as manager of Newcastle United. They had been relegated from the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], but in 1991 they had failed to make the playoffs and at several stages in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], they had temporarily occupied bottom place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Following the dismissal of previous manager [[Ossie Ardiles]], Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]] of [[Football in England|English football]] for the first time. Keegan joined a club that still had participants from the old board room battles that had been going on at the club for decades.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} It has been argued the internal struggles from the former regime had held the club back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Though John Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} The board members belonging to the former regime were only told by John Hall, one hour before Keegan\u2019s first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Keegan had only watched two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991 and the other being a Newcastle United 0-0 draw against Blackburn; as such, calls were made that suggested Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2323-2341}} \n\nWhen Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan would pay for the clean up of the training ground with his own money,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} with the cleaning work being done in one weekend.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan felt this clean up work was an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} In five-a-sides he and Terry Mcdermott, both in their 40s, with their inferior fitness, were two of the stand out players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], [[Steve Watson]], [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] and [[Robbie Elliott]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997. Keegan\u2019s first match was at home, against Bristol City, and Newcastle won 3-0 in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nKeegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]] also promised Keegan millions of pounds to spend on new players after Keegan almost walked out on the club after a match, in the 1991\u201392 season, at home to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] which was played on the 14 March 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Turnbull|first1=Simon|title=Welcome to the North-east...

Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] striker [[Andy Cole]] in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Rob Lee]] bolstered the midfield in the autumn.\n\nNewcastle were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions.\n\nTop scorer [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and influential midfielder [[Gavin Peacock]] were both sold during the close season, and Keegan brought striker [[Peter Beardsley]] back to Newcastle from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\n[[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Andy Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals from 40 games, and managed a club record total of 41 goals in all competitions.\n\nKeegan then strengthened his side by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss]] [[FIFA World Cup 1994|World Cup]] defender [[Marc Hottiger]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium's]] defensive midfielder [[Philippe Albert]], while [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s quick winger [[Ruel Fox]] had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994.\n\nNewcastle won their first six games of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. But the shock departure of Andy Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and finished the season sixth place in the final table; not enough for even another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing [[Paul Kitson]] partnered Beardsley in attack.\n\nKeegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s French winger [[David Ginola]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender [[Warren Barton]]. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at \u00a36 million, while the \u00a34 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.\n\nNewcastle excelled in the first half of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]], going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's [[Liverpool F.C. 4\u20133 Newcastle United F.C. (1996)|4\u20133 defeat]] to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1300229/Premier-League-games-Ten-greatest.html|title=Ten of the greatest: Premier League games}}</ref> to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as [[Les Ferdinand]], [[Darren Peacock]], [[David Ginola]], [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Rob Lee]] would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies.<ref name=etainers042018>{{cite web | url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-could-won-couple-more-14476551 | title = 'We could have won a couple more titles' \u2013 Kevin Keegan discusses Newcastle's Entertainers | last = McCormick | first = Sean | date = 2 April 2018 | work = Chronicle | location = Newcastle-upon-Tyne| access-date = 2 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the race for the 1995\u201396 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], during a post-match interview live on [[Sky Sports]].

A club statement following his resignation read:\n\n<blockquote>Newcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.</blockquote>\n\nKeegan left the club with a short statement reading:<blockquote>It was my decision and my decision alone to resign.

The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had [[constructive dismissal|constructively dismissed]] him by insisting on the signing of midfielder [[Ignacio Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez|Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez]] on loan (which was against his wishes) to replace [[James Milner]] following his move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and a bid for Bayern Munich's [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] being rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/incredible-story-newcastle-trying-sign-12813690|title = The incredible story of Newcastle trying to sign Schweinsteiger on the cheap \u2013 and Keegan quitting|first=Mark | last=Douglas |work=Evening Chronicle|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ruling<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128060800/http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html| archivedate=28 November 2010| title=KK v NUFC \u2013 the verdict|publisher=nufc.com|date=2 October 2009|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> was based around seven issues. The panel declared that Keegan had been misled to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth that he did not or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of Gonz\u00e1lez meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While Gonz\u00e1lez was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club until the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded \u00a32&nbsp;million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, but he stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8286967.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Keegan wins \u00a32m Newcastle damages | date=2 October 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their fans. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and [[Derek Llambias]], had publicly claimed that Keegan had \"the final word\"; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just \"PR\". It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez by watching him \"on [[YouTube]]\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's \"defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5642081,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Magpies must pay Keegan costs | date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nKeegan stated after the hearing he still wants to manage in the top flight of football, and would consider returning to his position at the club, but feels the fans may be exhausted from his last tenure and would prefer him not to.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5608630,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Keegan wants to manage again | date = 5 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012 | first = Richard | last = Bailey}}</ref> In June 2013, Keegan stated he would only consider a return should owner Mike Ashley leave the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/kevin-keegan-labels-return-to-newcastle-as-an-absolute-living-nightmare-8648184.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Kevin Keegan labels return to Newcastle as 'an absolute living nightmare' | date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Keegan has continued to criticise Ashley, accusing him of a lack of respect for the fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-united-news-kevin-keegan-3492049 | work=Daily Mirror | title=Kevin Keegan slams Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for showing 'a total lack of respect' to supporters | date = 3 May 2014 | accessdate =16 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan resurfaced after being confirmed as the lead pundit on [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/24/espn-premiership-kevin-keegan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=ESPN signs Kevin Keegan to front its Premier League coverage | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> During the course of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Keegan featured as a pundit for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] broadcasts.

A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he played for several clubs, including [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Hamburger SV]]. He went on to manage Newcastle United, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], winning promotion as champions in his first full season at all three clubs, and also the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nAs a player in the 1970s and 1980s, he has been described as \"arguably the first superstar English player to attract the modern media spotlight\".<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1315446/Rooneys-blame-Manchester-United-star-Wayne-shot-pieces-fault-blasts-Kevin-Keegan.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]|date = 27 September 2010 | location=London|first=Matt|last=Lawton|title=Rooney's to blame: Manchester United star Wayne is shot to pieces and it's all his fault, blasts Kevin Keegan}}</ref> He began his playing career at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in 1968, before moving to Liverpool in 1971. At Liverpool, Keegan won three [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles, the [[UEFA Cup]] twice, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He also gained his first England cap in 1972, and moved to West German club Hamburger SV in the summer of 1977. At Hamburg, he was named [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] in 1978 and 1979, won the [[Bundesliga]] title in 1978\u201379, and reached the European Cup final in 1980. Keegan moved to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] that summer, and spent two seasons at the club before a transfer to Newcastle United in the English [[Football League Division Two|second division]] in 1982. He helped Newcastle to promotion in his second season, and retired from football in 1984, having been capped 63&nbsp;times for England, scoring 21&nbsp;goals.\n\nHe moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, winning promotion as First Division champions. Newcastle then finished second in the [[Premier League]] in 1995\u201396, after leading for most of the season. After a spell at Fulham, he took charge of the England team in February 1999, but resigned in October 2000, following a 1\u20130 loss against Germany in qualification for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 9|2002 FIFA World Cup]]. He then became manager of Manchester City in 2001 and spent four years at the club before resigning in 2005.

When Keegan was playing for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966, Keegan was marked by an older player, in his mid 30s, called Bob Nellis. After playing against Keegan, Nellis became impressed by the ability of Keegan. Nellis had some contacts at Scunthorpe United, and in turn offered Keegan a trial at [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth division]] [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] \u2013 one of just two professional sides in the division.

On first sight, his wife thought it was hilarious, his agent jokingly tried to disown him in public.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1283-1298}} Soon though, players such as Bryan Robson, Charlie George, Phil Neale, Terry Mcdermott also had 1980s perms.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1283-1298}} Later, when Keegan was at Newcastle United as a manager, he and Terry McDermott would joke about the perm on a national kit supplier advert.<ref name=natKitCommercial>{{Citation | first = Kevin| last = Keegan | first2 = Terry| last2 = McDermott | first3 = Alan |last3 = Shearer | year = 1996 | title = Newcastle United - Adidas kit supplier commercials | place = United Kingdom| publisher = Adidas }}</ref> Keegan, who was [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg's]] best-paid player and had been intensely billed as the superstar signing from England who would transform an average German team by the clubs business manager Dr Peter Krohn,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1245}} was not immediately accepted by his new teammates.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1244}} Keegan picked up little things that highlighted he was not immediately accepted. In training he would not receive the ball after he made a run.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1248-1253}} Rules also stated that no club was allowed more than two foreign players, and unknowingly to Keegan he had also upset some of his new teammates as his move had indirectly moved out the three times European Cup winner [[Horst Blankenburg]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} Blankenburg was a very popular member of the squad.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} There was also a belief and a resentment amongst the players that the previous coach, who the players liked and did not think needed replacing, was replaced by Krohn, to accommodate Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1263-1267}} It was not until Keegan had moved out of temporary accommodation and moved to a bungalow in the little village of [[Itzstedt]] that Keegan began to feel he could make inroads and make a go of football and life in Germany.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1278}}\n\nIn one early interview Keegan mentioned how he was settling in. He explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg fans then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1321-1324}} There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1314}}\n\nHe scored in pre-season friendlies against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and former club Liverpool, but the club suffered defeat in the [[European Super Cup]] against the [[Merseyside]]rs. Keegan's time in Hamburg got off to a bad start. Keegan's first league match was against Duisburg and Hamburg lost 5-2. Rudi Gutendorf, the manager some believe was appointed for Keegan, would last until October.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1299-1305}}\n\nKeegan was sent off in a mid-season friendly against [[VfB L\u00fcbeck]] after knocking out an opposition player with a punch.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}} In the winter break of his first season, and being isolated by the clique in the dressing room, frustrated Keegan played a friendly against lower league club L\u00fcbeck.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332-1368}} A player in the match decided to target Keegan. After the third time being smashed, Keegan walked to the goading L\u00fcbeck player and punched him.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332-1368}} Keegan who knew he was going to be sent off, walked off the pitch prior to any decision by the referee.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332-1368}} Keegan maintains this was the lowest ebb of his time in Germany and following this moment Keegan then decided to master the German language and be in a position to fully integrate in order to be in a strong position to ask the players why they were not passing to him, and to show the players in the training ground caf\u00e9, he too loved the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332-1368}}\n\nKeegan was suspended for 8 weeks and in those 8 weeks Keegan and the squad made efforts to integrate.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1376-1378}} Keegan knew the dressing room was turning, when he was getting invited to the squad nights out, when one player told him he could get cheap meat for his dogs and when the full back [[Peter Hidien]] even got a perm.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1376-1378}} An unhappy first few months at the club gave way to a more successful season. Although the club finished tenth in the league in [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|1977\u201378]], Keegan's 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour, the ''[[France Football]]'' [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award for 1978.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}}<ref name=FF>{{cite web|url=http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|title=Ballon d'or|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=France Football|language=French|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204919/http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHamburg appointed [[Branko Zebec]], a Yugoslav as a new coach.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec was a man who was known to work players to the max.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec's squad did a lot of running and Keegan claimed he had never been worked as hard in his life.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1386}} The [[1978\u201379 Bundesliga|1978\u201379 season]] saw a vast improvement on the club's 1978 finish. With new manager Branko Zebec imposing a tough training regime, and Keegan's increasing grasp of the [[German language]], coupled with the newly imposed discipline meant that Hamburg finished as league champions for the first time in nineteen years.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}} The club's success also translated into individual recognition for Keegan, who picked up the European Footballer of the Year award for a second consecutive year at the club.<ref name=FF/> The European Footballer of the Year award had been running since 1956 and by 1979 only Keegan, [[Alfredo di Stefano]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Johan Cruyff]] had won the award two or more times.<ref name=fballerYear1979>{{cite news | last =Guardian staff | title = Previous winners of the European Footballer of the Year | newspaper = theguardian.com| location = United Kingdom| pages = | language = English| publisher = The Guardian| date = 16 December 2002| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/dec/16/newsstory.sport10| access-date = 22 May 2019}}</ref> By 2017 Keegan was amongst ten players who had won the award two or more times since 1956.<ref name=fballerYear2017>{{cite news | last =Telegraph staff\n| title = Ballon d'Or winners list| newspaper = telegraph.co.uk| location = United Kingdom| pages = | language = English| publisher = Telegraph| date = 8 December 2017| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/12/07/ballon-dor-winners-list1 | access-date = 22 May 2019}}</ref> After the 1978-79 season, [[Juventus]], [[Real Madrid]] and the [[Washington Diplomats]] tried to sign Keegan offering good terms, but Keegan decided to see out his contract at Hamburg and to try and win the European Cup.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1432-1438}} In 1979 Keegan was given the nickname ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' from the Hamburg fans.<ref name=mouse/> This nickname came from a popular cartoon superhero from the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=mouse>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jun/25/kevin-keegan-footballer-manager-liverpool|title=The Saturday interview: Kevin Keegan|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|newspaper=Guardian|date=25 June 2011|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter training Keegan would be exhausted, and only have enough energy to sleep. In February in the 1979-80 season, Keegan announced he was leaving after his contract was up. One of the reasons for leaving was Zebec's training regime. Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} though Keegan also reasoned that Zebec's extreme fitness regime philosophy was flawed for the modern-day footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan even told Zebec that his training regime would burn himself out as a footballer and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan's critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} At Hamburg Keegan even doodled with a pen and paper what he thought of the training regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} Keegan, as the metaphorical prisoner, drew a cartoon picture of Zebec in sunglasses, with he and his teammates doing press-ups, and then scribed Roman numerals conveying Keegan was counting down to his freedom. These drawings were left in his training ground locker. The drawings and Keegan's personal locker are now held in the Hamburg museum under the title 'HSV Legenden'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}}\n\nHamburg's [[1979\u201380 European Cup|European campaign of 1979\u201380]] saw Keegan score two goals to help Hamburg past [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], Soviet champions who had beaten Liverpool to reach the latter stages. On the run Hamburg beat, Dinamo Tbilisi, [[Valur]], [[Hajduk Split]] and [[Real Madrid]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1471-1497}} In the first leg against Real Madrid they were comfortably beaten 2-0 and most football pundits then predicted Hamburg were probably out.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1471-1497}} Hamburg then upset the apple-cart by winning the return leg 5-1.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1471-1497}} Keegan regarded this as one of the most outstanding team performances he had the fortune to be a part of.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1471-1497}} In the final they played Nottingham Forest. Forest played with 11 men behind the ball, and won the game 1-0 with a goal from [[John Robertson (footballer, born 1953)|John Robertson]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1471-1497}} This cup final defeat was coupled domestically with being beaten to the [[1979\u201380 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title by [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of \u00a3500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 1980.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=173\u2013191}}\n\n===Southampton (1980\u20131982)===\nOn 11 February 1980, [[Lawrie McMenemy]] called a press conference at the Potters Heron hotel, [[Ampfield]] to announce that the European Footballer of the Year would be joining Southampton in the forthcoming summer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of [[Southampton]], as Southampton were a relatively small club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The club were beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be, especially when Keegan captained England in the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] in Italy.\n\nKeegan had a clause inserted into his contract when he joined Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1562}} Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause when he returned to England three years later. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, \"I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, 'No, we won't be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'\" It was, therefore, Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy who snapped him up for \u00a3420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at [[Lansdowne Road]] in a pre-season friendly against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 23 July 1980.\n\nKeegan's two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], [[Phil Boyer]], [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1557-1559}} In [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] Saints scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}}\n\nIn the following season, Keegan was able to produce some of his best form and at the beginning of April 1982 Southampton sat at the top of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} but a run of only three wins from the end of February meant a seventh-place finish,<ref>{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk | title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=167| isbn= }}</ref> 21 points off 1st place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} Despite this, Keegan was voted the [[PFA Player of the Year]] and awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to Association Football. Keegan had scored 26 of the team's 72 goals and was voted the club's Player of the Year.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1647-1648}} This second season was the most prolific of his career and he, in total scored 30 goals and he won the golden boot.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1647-1648}}\n\nKeegan had fallen out with McMenemy over the manager's failure to strengthen Southampton's defence (which conceded 67 goals in 1981\u201382) while the team was at the top of the table.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jeremy |last=Wilson | title=Southampton's Cult Heroes| publisher=Know The Score Books | year=2006|pages=150\u2013151| isbn= 1-905449-01-1}}</ref> There were also rumours that McMenemy had charged the whole team of cheating after a 3\u20130 defeat by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in April 1982 to which Keegan took great exception.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1663-1673}} Although Keegan joined Saints' next pre\u2013season tour, he had already decided to move. In 2019 Lawrie McMenemy explained that prior to the start of the 1982-83 season, Keegan believed that Southampton did not match his footballing ambitions and therefore Keegan had made up his mind and demanded to leave, and there was nothing the club could do about it.<ref name=KeeganLeavesSouthampton82>{{cite news | last = McMenemy | first = Lawrie| title = Kevin Keegan reunion rekindled 1980s memories| newspaper = Daily Echo | publisher = dailyecho.co.uk|location = Hampshire | date = 9 June 2019| url = https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/17694061.kevin-keegan-reunion-rekindled-1980s-memories/}}</ref> A few days before the start of the 1982\u201383 season he signed for Newcastle United<ref name=KeeganLeavesSouthampton82/> for a fee of \u00a3100,000.\n\n===Newcastle United (1982\u20131984)===\nKeegan joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and spent two seasons there, during which time he was extremely popular with the supporters. Keegan's first press conference, to announce his signing, was held in the Gosforth Park Hotel.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=1941}} Upon signing the twice European footballer of the year in the second division, a local newspapers main headline was simply, 'Here he is!'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1943}}\n\nKeegan always felt at one stage in his career he would play for Newcastle United.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1951}} As a child Keegan's father would tell him football stories about Milburn and Gallagher.

After scoring, Keegan done something he had never done before, Keegan instinctively, and famously, threw himself into the crowd to 'show the fans he was one of them,'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1952-1965}} and explained to the press afterwards that 'I just wanted to stay there for ever...'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1965-1967}} Keegan had a fear of letting the fans down, constantly telling himself 'You can't let them down.'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1976}}\n\nKeegan at Newcastle was the senior pro. Keegan, along with Terry McDermott, Jeff Clark and David McCreery, now had a senior status.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}} As a senior pro, his manager, Arthur Cox, who would later join many of Keegan's coaching teams when Keegan would later become a manager, had a different relationship to Keegan than with other players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}} Cox would ask Keegan his opinion on players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}}\n\nTo Keegan, Cox was a task master,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2036}} with a good sense of humour.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2036}} Cox would condition the players like commandos by having Keegan and his teammates running up and down the hills in Gateshead.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2047-2051}}\n\nIn his first season Newcastle finished fifth.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2042}} and Keegan maintained that after a faltering season, this position was a flattering league position.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2042}} Keegan, finished this season with 21 goals in 37 appearances and won North East Player of the Year.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2045}}\n\nIn September 1983, Keegan answered a phone call at 1:00 am from Arthur Cox.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} In the phone call Cox explained to Keegan, sharply, he had signed a player called [[Peter Beardsley]] from [[Vancouver Whitecaps]] and explained to Keegan that he'd like him; after giving Keegan the message, Cox immediately put the phone down...{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} A few days later Keegan met Beardsley at Benwell.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} Keegan and his teammates, at first sight, thought Beardsley was just a lad who had won the competition to train with the first team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} It was only when they seen him in action that they knew he had something about him.

This through ball had caught all the defenders flat-footed, left the defenders out of the equation, and left Keegan one on one with the keeper Bruce Grobbelaar.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan thought this was his moment to put Newcastle 1-0 up in front of the thousands of Newcastle fans behind the goal.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan who had been in a one on one with the goal keeper many times in training, and in football matches, felt, with his pace, with his experience in this position, it was second nature to finish the move.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan though was intercepted by the recovering [[Mark Lawrenson]]. As Keegan was moving towards goal with his pace, Lawrenson caught up to Keegan and stole the ball off him from the side. At this precise moment, it occurred to Keegan he had now lost his yard of pace.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} At the end of the game a frustrated Keegan, whilst clapping off the fans, had decided this would be his last season as a footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}}\n\nKeegan felt if he had have extended his career at Newcastle in the first division he would have had to adjust his game and move from the attacking role he had built his footballing identity on over the last 15 years of his career.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2137-2142}} Keegan did not want to extend his career by moving back into midfield in the first division with Newcastle.

Keegan appeared in only the two matches against Wales during this campaign as England failed to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=ES>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=557|title=Kevin Keegan|accessdate=30 July 2008|publisher=englandstats.com}}</ref>\n\nHe scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He was given the captaincy by manager [[Don Revie]] in 1976 after [[Gerry Francis]] fell victim to a long term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].\n\nKeegan captained England at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 Euros]]. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.\n\nHe managed only one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1978]] tournaments. He finally reached a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1982]] when England got to the finals in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in all of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not be around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a [[medical specialist|specialist]] he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final second-round game against hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. During this time he missed a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0\u20130 and were eliminated from the competition.\n\nFollowing the successful start to the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager [[Bobby Robson]] did not select Keegan for his first squad,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TvFtlOSX_g | title = Match of the 80s \u2013 Season 82\u201383 (Part 1 of 4) | publisher = YouTube | date = 13 July 2007 | accessdate =27 August 2011}}</ref> a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself. Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He had won a total of 63 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 21 goals.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to football as manager of Newcastle United. They had been relegated from the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], but in 1991 they had failed to make the playoffs and at several stages in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], they had temporarily occupied bottom place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Following the dismissal of previous manager [[Ossie Ardiles]], Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]] of [[Football in England|English football]] for the first time. Keegan joined a club that still had participants from the old board room battles that had been going on at the club for decades.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} It has been argued the internal struggles from the former regime had held the club back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Though John Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} The board members belonging to the former regime were only told by John Hall, one hour before Keegan\u2019s first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Keegan had also only watched only two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991 and the other being a Newcastle United 0-0 draw against Blackburn; as such, calls were made that suggested Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2323-2341}} \n\nWhen Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan would pay for the clean up of the training ground with his own money,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} with the cleaning work being done in one weekend.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan felt this clean up work was an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} In five-a-sides he and Terry Mcdermott, both in their 40s, with their inferior fitness, were two of the stand out players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], [[Steve Watson]], [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] and [[Robbie Elliott]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997. Keegan\u2019s first match was at home, against Bristol City, and Newcastle won 3-0 in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nKeegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]] also promised Keegan millions of pounds to spend on new players after Keegan almost walked out on the club after a match, in the 1991\u201392 season, at home to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] which was played on the 14 March 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Turnbull|first1=Simon|title=Welcome to the North-east...

Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] striker [[Andy Cole]] in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Rob Lee]] bolstered the midfield in the autumn.\n\nNewcastle were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions.\n\nTop scorer [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and influential midfielder [[Gavin Peacock]] were both sold during the close season, and Keegan brought striker [[Peter Beardsley]] back to Newcastle from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\n[[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Andy Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals from 40 games, and managed a club record total of 41 goals in all competitions.\n\nKeegan then strengthened his side by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss]] [[FIFA World Cup 1994|World Cup]] defender [[Marc Hottiger]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium's]] defensive midfielder [[Philippe Albert]], while [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s quick winger [[Ruel Fox]] had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994.\n\nNewcastle won their first six games of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. But the shock departure of Andy Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and finished the season sixth place in the final table; not enough for even another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing [[Paul Kitson]] partnered Beardsley in attack.\n\nKeegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s French winger [[David Ginola]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender [[Warren Barton]]. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at \u00a36 million, while the \u00a34 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.\n\nNewcastle excelled in the first half of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]], going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's [[Liverpool F.C. 4\u20133 Newcastle United F.C. (1996)|4\u20133 defeat]] to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1300229/Premier-League-games-Ten-greatest.html|title=Ten of the greatest: Premier League games}}</ref> to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as [[Les Ferdinand]], [[Darren Peacock]], [[David Ginola]], [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Rob Lee]] would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies.<ref name=etainers042018>{{cite web | url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-could-won-couple-more-14476551 | title = 'We could have won a couple more titles' \u2013 Kevin Keegan discusses Newcastle's Entertainers | last = McCormick | first = Sean | date = 2 April 2018 | work = Chronicle | location = Newcastle-upon-Tyne| access-date = 2 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the race for the 1995\u201396 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], during a post-match interview live on [[Sky Sports]].

A club statement following his resignation read:\n\n<blockquote>Newcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.</blockquote>\n\nKeegan left the club with a short statement reading:<blockquote>It was my decision and my decision alone to resign. I feel I have taken the club as far as I can, and that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now. I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.</blockquote>\n\nOn the Newcastle United DVD ''Magpie Magic'', it is said that chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|Sir John Hall]] asked for a long term commitment as manager from him which he was unwilling to give, while it also states that many still rumour that the pressure and criticism of selling Andy Cole and the failed title challenge in 1995\u201396 took its toll on him.<ref>{{cite video|title= Newcastle United Magpie Magic|publisher=ITV DVD}}</ref>\n\nHe was succeeded by Kenny Dalglish, the same man who had replaced him as a player at Liverpool 20 years earlier, but Newcastle were unable to win the title and finished second place in the same season, and in the following season finished outside the top ten in the Premier League, although they were FA Cup runners-up. They did not return to the top five of the Premier League until the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302 season]], when they finished fourth under Bobby Robson.\n\nIt was during this period that Keegan gained the nickname \"King Kev\" from Newcastle fans.\n\n===Fulham===\nKeegan returned to football on 25 September 1997 as \"chief operating officer\" (a similar role to a [[director of football]]) at [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], with [[Ray Wilkins]] as head coach. Fulham finished sixth in the final table, but Wilkins was sacked just before the first leg of the playoff semi-final and Keegan took over as manager.\n\nHis appointment came a few months after the takeover of the club by [[Harrods]] owner [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], who gave Keegan \u00a310 million to spend on players that season as the first part of a \u00a340 million attempt to deliver Premier League football to the [[Craven Cottage]] club, who had been outside the top flight since 1968 and had not even played in the league's second tier since 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEV%27S+pounds+40m+SPREE%253b+Fulham+to+buy+place+at+the+top.-a061069826 | title = KEV'S pounds 40m SPREE; Fulham to buy place at the top | publisher = The Mirror | work = thefreelibrary.com | date = 25 September 1997 | accessdate = 19 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nKeegan was unable to inspire Fulham to overcome [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in the playoffs, but good form in [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] \u2013 helped by the acquisition of more players who would normally have been signed by Premier League or Division one clubs \u2013 clinched them the Division Two title and promotion to Division One, but Keegan left at the end of the season to concentrate on his duties as England manager, having succeeded [[Glenn Hoddle]] in February 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-keegan-leaves-with-flea-in-his-ear-1092405.html|title=Keegan leaves with flea in his ear|work=The Independent (London)|date=9 May 1999|accessdate=10 August 2014|first=Steve|last=Tongue}}</ref>\n\nFulham replaced Keegan with [[Paul Bracewell]] and reached the Premier League two years later under Bracewell's successor [[Jean Tigana]], with a squad still featuring many of the players bought by Keegan or Wilkins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bracewell-in-the-fulham-frame-1090562.html|title=Bracewell in the Fulham frame|work=The Independent (London)|date=30 April 1999|accessdate=10 August 2014|first=Szreter|last=Adam}}</ref>\n\n===England===\n[[File:Azzopardi keegan.jpg|thumb|Keegan as England manager with a Newcastle United fan in [[Malta]]]]\nAfter weeks of speculation,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/280387.stm|title=Keegan poised for England job|work=BBC News |date=16 February 1999|accessdate=25 January 2009}}</ref> Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-21444561.html|title=Keegan appointed for England s Euro 2000 campaign|date=18 February 1999|accessdate=25 January 2009|publisher=AAP Sports News (Australia)|first=Trevor|last=Marshallsea}}{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Keegan in charge \u2013 for now |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/281172.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 February 1999 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> He led the team to a winning start with 3\u20131 victory over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] to reignite England's [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] qualifying campaign,<ref>{{cite news |title=Scholes gives Keegan winning start |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/305631.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 March 1999 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> and they entered the qualification playoff with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].

The panel declared that Keegan had been misled to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth that he did not or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of Gonz\u00e1lez meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While Gonz\u00e1lez was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club until the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded \u00a32&nbsp;million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, but he stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8286967.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Keegan wins \u00a32m Newcastle damages | date=2 October 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their fans.

It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez by watching him \"on [[YouTube]]\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal.
