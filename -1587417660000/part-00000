He directed more than 20 campaigns in which he conquered 32 nations and won 65 [[pitched battle]]s, during which he conquered or overran more territory than any other commander in history.<ref>Ch 1 Great Captains Unveiled Liddell Hart {{ISBN|0-8369-0618-7}}</ref> He gained victory by means of imaginative and sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that were hundreds of kilometers away from each other. He is also remembered for devising the campaign that destroyed the armies of [[First Mongol invasion of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Poland]] within two days of each other, by forces over 500 kilometers apart. Subutai is well known for his expedition from central Asia to the Russian steppe and into Europe. \n\n==Early life==\nHistorians believe Subutai was born in the year 1175,<ref>Gabriel, Richard. \"Genghis Khan's Greatest General Subotai the Valiant\". University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 6.</ref> probably just west of the upper [[Onon River]] in what is now [[Mongolia]]. He belonged to the [[Uriankhai]] clan, known as the reindeer people, a group of Siberian forest-dwellers who did not live like the plains Mongols to their south. As a result of his upbringing, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.<ref>Gabriel, 6-8.</ref> Subutai's family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai's great-great grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai's father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai's elder brother [[Jelme]] also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from [[Jebe]], then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca'urqan) is mentioned in the [[The Secret History of the Mongols|Secret History of the Mongols]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsendiin Damdins\u00fcren |first= |year=1970 |title=\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0446 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0447\u043e\u043e |edition=1st |language=Mongolian |trans-title=[[The Secret History of the Mongols]] |chapter=120 (III)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Subutai's biography in the [[History of Yuan]]Subutai's father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai's brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father's difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor's station.<ref>Yuanshi, 121, 1a-5a</ref>\n\nDespite this close family association, some consider Subutai's career proof that the [[Mongol Empire]] was a [[meritocracy]]. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a [[blacksmith]]. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin's army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis.<ref>Gabriel 2004, pp. 1, 3.</ref>  Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe's death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his \"dogs of war,\" who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'':<ref>Cummins, Joseph. ''History's Great Untold Stories: Larger Than Life Characters & Dramatic Events That Changed the World.'' 2006. Washington D.C.: National Geographic Society, 2006. Print.</ref>\n\n{{quote|They are the Four Dogs of Temujin.

These four dogs are [[Jebe]], and Kublai (different than [[Kublai Khan]]), [[Jelme]], and Subotai.|The Secret History of the Mongols}}\n\nSubutai seems to have been identified from early on by Temujin as special, and given rare opportunities for growth. Appointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan's ger (yurt) door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to [[Genghis Khan]], \"I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind.\"<ref name=Saunders>Saunders, J. J. (1971). ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. {{ISBN|0-8122-1766-7}}</ref> This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties.<ref>Gabriel, 10</ref> Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite [[Jebe]] (1211\u201312, 1213\u201314, 1219\u201323) and [[Muqali]] (1213\u201314), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219).\n\nSubutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the [[Merkit]], when he was just 22 years old. This boon occurred during the war against Genghis Khan's most hated enemy, the [[Merkit]]. Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals.<ref>Gabriel, 12-13.</ref> This is evidence that even in his formative years, Subutai was a highly unorthodox general who found innovative ways to cheaply solve problems with few casualties. He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia.\n\n==As a general==\nSubutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances.  Subutai's maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and [[Scorched earth|devastated the surrounded agriculture]] so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.<ref>Gabriel, Chapter 8; Carl Svedrup, Sube`etei Ba`atur, Anonymous Strategist.</ref>\n\nDue to his long tenure of service, Subutai had the opportunity to face off against elite armies of all types from west to east, and emerged triumphant in every campaign. The horse archers of other great steppe confederacies, the elite [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jurchen]] cavalry of China in the 1230s, the seasoned Qangli Turk cavalry of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezm]], fresh from conquering their own Empire, and the heavily armored knights of Georgia, Poland, and Hungary were all powerless against Subutai's armies. In contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the [[battle of Carrhae]] or the [[battle of Manzikert]], Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the [[battle of the Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.<ref>Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015), 157-159.</ref>\n\nSubutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in [[siege warfare]]. Even in field battles he made use of [[siege engine]]s. In the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge [[Lithobolos|stonethrower]]<nowiki/>s to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the [[Barrage (artillery)|creeping barrage]] of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.<ref>Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War.</ref> \n\nLike Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity.  \n\n==Central Asian campaigns (1217\u20131220)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Central Asia}}\nIn 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated [[Merkit]]s and their allies, the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak confederation]], in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the [[Chu River]] in 1217 and again in 1219 in [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchak]] territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children's toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai's army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture of all the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2975-76.</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Mohammad II]] of [[Khwarizm]] attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan's elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed's confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 370\u2013371.</ref> Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the [[Kara-Khitai]] Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars.\n\nGenghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade [[Khwarazm|Khwarizm]] as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically inferior to the forces of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarizim Empire]], but through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan's Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan's army through the deadly [[Kyzylkum Desert]] to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 373\u2013385.</ref> After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammad attempted to save himself by fleeing into central [[Persia]], but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan's main army.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'',  375\u2013410.</ref> Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the 'Second Alexander'.\n\n==Great Cavalry Raid (1220\u20131223)==\nSubutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in [[Azerbaijan]] and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] \"which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated\": 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the [[Caspian Sea]] through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]].<ref>''In the Service of the Khans'', 19.</ref>\n\nAfter destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Though the Georgian king was reluctant to actually commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated a powerful Georgian army with many thousands of knights at the [[Battle of Caucasus Mountain|Battle of the Caucasus Mountains]], by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men in front parade crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.<ref>Kirakos Gandzaketsi, History of the Armenians, 166\u2013167.</ref> This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the [[Fifth Crusade]]. Instead, King George's sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated.<ref>Oliver of Paderborn, \"The Capture of Damietta\", trans. Joseph J. Gavigan, ''Christian Society and the Crusades, 1198\u20131229'', ed. Edward Peters (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 90, 123\u2013124.</ref> Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer.\n\nAfter ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] during the winter to get around the [[Derbent]] Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a [[Wikt:perilous#Adjective|perilous]] route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the [[Alans]], [[Circassians]], and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. After 9 days of pursuit, Jebe and Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and [[Cuman]] army at the [[Battle of the Kalka River|Kalka]] (31 May 1223). The Volga Bulgars claimed that they had ambushed Subutai's army, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 607\u2013613.</ref>\n\n==Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin Chinese (1207, 1209, 1211\u20131215, 1226\u201327)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nIn the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe's army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming [[Great Wall]]). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic [[battle of Yehuling]]. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter's daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.<ref>''In the Service of the Khan'', Paul Buell, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nSubutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of [[Xi Xia]] in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis's main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] districts along the upper [[Wei River]], and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet.<ref>Buell, 20.</ref> Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] in 1229.\n\n===Conquest of Jin China (1231\u20131235)===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nAfter a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230\u20131231, \u00d6gedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central [[China]]) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229,<ref>Rashid al-Din, ''Annals of Ogedei Khan'', 33.</ref> but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229\u20131230 after the Mongolian general Dolqolqu suffered a major defeat.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31.</ref> Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them.\n\nSubutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai's main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of [[Henan]] ended in failure after Subutai's advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch\u2019e-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 1231\u20131232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and [[Tolui]], invading the [[Song Empire]] and attacking Henan from the more exposed south.<ref>Atwood, 34.</ref> The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides.<ref>Yuan Shi, 115.2885-6.</ref> This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south.\n\nThe main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai's army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin's attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube'etei Ba'atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nWith part of his force harassing the Jin army's foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin's line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai's army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army's food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the [[battle of Sanfeng Mountain]] (9 February 1232), capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T\u2019iehling (1 March 1232).<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube`etei Ba`atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\n The heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of [[Wikt:circumvallate#Verb|circumvallation]] that had a perimeter stretching {{convert|54|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called \"Thunder Crash Bombs\", which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, [[mangonel]]<nowiki/>s, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their [[Wikt:intransigence|intransigence]] and extremely long resistance. However, \u00d6gedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly. <ref>McLynn, 407\u2013410.</ref>  With assistance from the Song Dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234.\n\nHowever, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized [[Kaifeng]] and [[Luoyang]] during the summer of 1234 during Subutai's absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them , and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai's victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward.\n\n==Conquest of Russia (1236\u20131240)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'}}\n\u00d6gedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchaks]] and [[Bulgars]]. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince [[Batu Khan|Batu]]). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: \u00d6gedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died.<ref>McLynn, 435.</ref> In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains.<ref>Svedrup, 43\u201344.</ref> After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader [[Bachman Khan|Bachman]] on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had [[Wikt:ensconce|ensconced]] himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the 'net'.<ref>McLynn, 436\u2013437.</ref>\n\nUnlike in 1222\u201323 when the majority of the Rus' states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Russians were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked [[Ryazan]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the [[Black Sea]]. In 1239, the Rus' state of [[Chernigov]] was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer [[Novgorod]] when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.<ref>Frank McLynn, 434\u2013441.</ref>\n\nThe most notable encounter of the campaign was the [[battle of the Sit River]] in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated.<ref>''The Chronicle of Novgorod'' (1914), 83.</ref> The Mongols had made a treaty with Galich-Vladimir, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. [[Kiev]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and other cities were quickly taken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Invasion of Central Europe (1241\u20131242)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of [[Jochi]], was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against [[Kievan Rus']]. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates.\n\nThough the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, [[Bela IV]], was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to.<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat''.</ref> Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories [[Baidar]] and [[Kadan]] regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the [[Battle of Legnica]], right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]]'s army triumphed in [[Transylvania]], a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King [[Bela IV]] had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai's force still managed an astonishing pace of {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela's obstacles.<ref>McLynn, 465\u2013466.</ref>\n\nOnly one day after the smaller Mongol army in [[Poland]] had won the [[Battle of Legnica]], Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the [[Battle of Mohi]] during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so [[catapult]]s were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2978.</ref> Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled.\n\nThe result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the [[Mongols]] left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this 'hole' in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men.<ref>Denis Sinor, ''[http://deremilitari.org/2014/07/the-mongols-in-the-west/ The Mongols in the West]'' (1999).</ref> In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong [[Baghatur|ba'aaturs]] (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.<ref>Yuan Shi, 121, 1a\u20135a</ref>\n\n===Mongol subjugation of Hungary===\n{{Main|First Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\nThe after battle tensions reached its climax at a very argumentative feast. One unique feature of this campaign, due to the large number of princes, was that in addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preempetively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|Guyuk]] and [[B\u00fcri|Buri]].<ref>Hodong Kim, ''A Reappraisal of G\u00fcy\u00fcg Khan'', 319\u2013320.</ref> Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to \u00d6gedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.<ref>Urgunge Onon, ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', 270.</ref>\n\nDespite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary.  From Rogerius' writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy. According to Rogerius, The Mongols would sack a town and pretend to depart, only to hide and return shortly thereafter to kill everyone who had been hiding under rubble or in the forests. he also claims that in other instances they enlisted willing Hungarians to organize their brethren to work at Mongol direction, or spread false word of a general amnesty being ordained.<ref>McLynn, 472\u2013479; Thomas of Spalato, ''Historia''; Rogerius of Apulia, ''Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaro''.</ref>\n\nIn order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at [[Oradea]], the castle of [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]] of [[Pannonia]], and the capital [[Esztergom]], though the latter's stone citadel held out, though not all sieges proved successful. In the west, Kadan's army was unable to catch Bela, and lacking siege equipment, he could not forcibly capture the Adriatic cities. However, Bela, hiding on the island of [[Trogir]] in [[Croatia]], was also unable to effectively rally his people due to his flight, which meant that for the time being Hungary was at the total mercy of the main Mongol army.\n\nBy early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the [[Holy Roman Empire]], when news came of the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, ''The Story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars''.</ref> Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. It should be noted however that this account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan's death after they had already begun the withdrawal. Furthermore, the campaign had become bogged down in a series of unprofitable sieges at Klist and other fortified strongholds. The Mongols always practiced a \"tsunami strategy\" of temporarily retreating from the furthest outlying provinces they had won to avoid overextension, only to return shortly after their closer conquests were properly solidified.<ref>Timothy May, ''The Mongol Art of War and the Tsunami Strategy''.</ref> However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary's population may have died from the invasion.<ref>McLynn, 479; ''Carmen Miserabile''.</ref> A Bavarian monk tersely recorded in 1241 that \"In this year, after existing for 350 years, the kingdom of Hungary was annihilated by the Tatars.\"<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat'', 49.</ref> Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to [[Pope Innocent IV]] that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.<ref>King Belas IV's letter to the Pope, 310.</ref>{{full citation needed|reason=What's the source for this letter?|date=May 2019}} It has been noted however that the level of within Hungary was quite unevenly distributed, with archaeological evidence of destruction heavily concentrated east of the Danube, in the Great Hungarian Plain. It has also been pointed out that, given that Bela IV was able to recover his territories from Frederick II Babenburg of Austria almost immediately after the Mongols left, the damage done to his military structure can hardly have been as severe as Rogerius and Thomas of Split claimed.<ref>Laszlovszky, J\u00f3zsef & Pow, Stephen & Romh\u00e1nyi, Beatrix & Ferenczi, Laszlo & Pinke, Zsolt.

In 1 The Mongol Invasion and Its Aftermath, (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2016)</ref>\n\nOn the way out of Europe, the Mongols plundered the yet untouched lands of Bulgaria and encountered the army of [[Baldwin II, Latin Emperor]] of Constantinople. Though Baldwin defeated a small skirmishing force, he was apparently lured into overconfidence and suffered a severe defeat.<ref>McLynn, 479.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter subduing a [[Cumans|Cuman]] revolt in what is now Russia, another possible reason for departing Hungary so suddenly, Subutai turned towards Mongolia. Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] was elected after three years, with Subutai's support. G\u00fcy\u00fck had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge at the age of 71 of the campaign against the [[Song dynasty]] for 1246\u20131247. The Papal envoy [[Plano Carpini]] saw him when he was in [[Karakorum]], Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the rest of his life at his home in the vicinity of the [[Tuul River]] (near modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), dying there at the age of 72.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the [[Danube|Danube river]].<ref name=\"weatherford\">{{cite book |title=Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |publisher=Penguin |year=2017 |isbn=0735221170 |page=286}}</ref>\n\nSubutai's descendants such as [[Uriyangkhadai]] and [[Aju]] would serve the [[Great Khans]] for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], invade [[Dai Viet]] and obtain their submission, and achieve great success invading the Song from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the [[battle of Xiangyang]], which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote|\"No Mongol general played a greater role than Subotei Ba'atur in establishing and maintaining the early Mongol Empire.

Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 110.</ref> As a result, after adding onto the innovations of Genghis Khan, Subutai's armies fought unlike any force in history until the Germans and Russians in World War II,{{Dubious |reason=The kind of tactic described was formulated and put to use in World War 1.|date=November 2019}} seven hundred years later. They did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3\u20135 axes of approach, often 500\u20131000&nbsp;km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail. However, unlike Napoleon, the Mongols retained the flexibility to dispatch armies to the widely separate fronts, through inhospitable terrain or during the most unexpected times of year, often using some armies purely as means of fixing enemy attention and fomenting division in their enemies greater than any other army in history. Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state's will to fight, not merely to defeat their armies and hope they surrendered, as Napoleon had.<ref>Gabriel, 113.</ref> Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.<ref>LTC Sean Slappy, ''Command and Control Began with Subotai Bahadur'' (2010).</ref>\n\nThough unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai's exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book ''Great Captains Unveiled'' after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise.  In particular, [[Erwin Rommel]] and [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] were avid students of Mongol campaigns.<ref>James C. Bradford, ed., ''International Encyclopedia of Military History''.</ref>\n\n==='Deep Battle' theory===\n{{Main|Deep Battle}}\nRussia derived the most use out of a careful study of the Mongol campaigns. Their closer proximity to the steppe gave them greater interest and access to the Mongolian campaigns, first analyzed by the Russian General [[Mikhail Ivanin]] in the 19th century, which became a recommended text in the Russian military academies up until the mid 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 111.</ref> Ivanin's work became used in the [[Deep Battle]] doctrine developed by Soviet Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Mikhail Frunze]], and [[G.

Deep Battle doctrine bore a heavy resemblance to Mongol strategic methods, substituting tanks, motorized troop carriers, artillery, and airplanes for Mongol horse archers, lancers, and field artillery.

He directed more than 20 campaigns in which he conquered 32 nations and won 65 [[pitched battle]]s, during which he conquered or overran more territory than any other commander in history.<ref>Ch 1 Great Captains Unveiled Liddell Hart {{ISBN|0-8369-0618-7}}</ref> He gained victory by means of imaginative and sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that were hundreds of kilometers away from each other. He is also remembered for devising the campaign that destroyed the armies of [[First Mongol invasion of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Poland]] within two days of each other, by forces over 500 kilometers apart. Subutai is well known for his expedition from central Asia to the Russian steppe and into Europe. \n\n==Early life==\nHistorians believe Subutai was born in the year 1175,<ref>Gabriel, Richard. \"Genghis Khan's Greatest General Subotai the Valiant\". University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 6.</ref> probably just west of the upper [[Onon River]] in what is now [[Mongolia]]. He belonged to the [[Uriankhai]] clan, known as the reindeer people, a group of Siberian forest-dwellers who did not live like the plains Mongols to their south. As a result of his upbringing, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.<ref>Gabriel, 6-8.</ref> Subutai's family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai's great-great grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai's father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai's elder brother [[Jelme]] also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from [[Jebe]], then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca'urqan) is mentioned in the [[The Secret History of the Mongols|Secret History of the Mongols]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsendiin Damdins\u00fcren |first= |year=1970 |title=\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0446 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0447\u043e\u043e |edition=1st |language=Mongolian |trans-title=[[The Secret History of the Mongols]] |chapter=120 (III)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Subutai's biography in the [[History of Yuan]]Subutai's father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai's brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father's difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor's station.<ref>Yuanshi, 121, 1a-5a</ref>\n\nDespite this close family association, some consider Subutai's career proof that the [[Mongol Empire]] was a [[meritocracy]]. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a [[blacksmith]]. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin's army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis.<ref>Gabriel 2004, pp. 1, 3.</ref>  Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe's death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his \"dogs of war,\" who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'':<ref>Cummins, Joseph. ''History's Great Untold Stories: Larger Than Life Characters & Dramatic Events That Changed the World.'' 2006. Washington D.C.: National Geographic Society, 2006. Print.</ref>\n\n{{quote|They are the Four Dogs of Temujin.

These four dogs are [[Jebe]], and Kublai (different than [[Kublai Khan]]), [[Jelme]], and Subotai.|The Secret History of the Mongols}}\n\nSubutai seems to have been identified from early on by Temujin as special, and given rare opportunities for growth. Appointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan's ger (yurt) door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to [[Genghis Khan]], \"I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind.\"<ref name=Saunders>Saunders, J. J. (1971). ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. {{ISBN|0-8122-1766-7}}</ref> This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties.<ref>Gabriel, 10</ref> Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite [[Jebe]] (1211\u201312, 1213\u201314, 1219\u201323) and [[Muqali]] (1213\u201314), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219).\n\nSubutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the [[Merkit]], when he was just 22 years old. This boon occurred during the war against Genghis Khan's most hated enemy, the [[Merkit]]. Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals.<ref>Gabriel, 12-13.</ref> This is evidence that even in his formative years, Subutai was a highly unorthodox general who found innovative ways to cheaply solve problems with few casualties. He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia.\n\n==As a general==\nSubutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances.  Subutai's maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and [[Scorched earth|devastated the surrounded agriculture]] so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.<ref>Gabriel, Chapter 8; Carl Svedrup, Sube`etei Ba`atur, Anonymous Strategist.</ref>\n\nDue to his long tenure of service, Subutai had the opportunity to face off against elite armies of all types from west to east, and emerged triumphant in every campaign. The horse archers of other great steppe confederacies, the elite [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jurchen]] cavalry of China in the 1230s, the seasoned Qangli Turk cavalry of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezm]], fresh from conquering their own Empire, and the heavily armored knights of Georgia, Poland, and Hungary were all powerless against Subutai's armies. In contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the [[battle of Carrhae]] or the [[battle of Manzikert]], Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the [[battle of the Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.<ref>Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015), 157-159.</ref>\n\nSubutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in [[siege warfare]]. Even in field battles he made use of [[siege engine]]s. In the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge [[Lithobolos|stonethrower]]<nowiki/>s to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the [[Barrage (artillery)|creeping barrage]] of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.<ref>Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War.</ref> \n\nLike Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity.  \n\n==Central Asian campaigns (1217\u20131220)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Central Asia}}\nIn 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated [[Merkit]]s and their allies, the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak confederation]], in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the [[Chu River]] in 1217 and again in 1219 in [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchak]] territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children's toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai's army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture of all the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2975-76.</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Mohammad II]] of [[Khwarizm]] attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan's elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed's confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 370\u2013371.</ref> Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the [[Kara-Khitai]] Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars.\n\nGenghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade [[Khwarazm|Khwarizm]] as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically inferior to the forces of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarizim Empire]], but through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan's Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan's army through the deadly [[Kyzylkum Desert]] to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 373\u2013385.</ref> After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammad attempted to save himself by fleeing into central [[Persia]], but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan's main army.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'',  375\u2013410.</ref> Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the 'Second Alexander'.\n\n==Great Cavalry Raid (1220\u20131223)==\nSubutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in [[Azerbaijan]] and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] \"which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated\": 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the [[Caspian Sea]] through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]].<ref>''In the Service of the Khans'', 19.</ref>\n\nAfter destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Though the Georgian king was reluctant to actually commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated a powerful Georgian army with many thousands of knights at the [[Battle of Caucasus Mountain|Battle of the Caucasus Mountains]], by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men in front parade crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.<ref>Kirakos Gandzaketsi, History of the Armenians, 166\u2013167.</ref> This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the [[Fifth Crusade]]. Instead, King George's sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated.<ref>Oliver of Paderborn, \"The Capture of Damietta\", trans. Joseph J. Gavigan, ''Christian Society and the Crusades, 1198\u20131229'', ed. Edward Peters (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 90, 123\u2013124.</ref> Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer.\n\nAfter ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] during the winter to get around the [[Derbent]] Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a [[Wikt:perilous#Adjective|perilous]] route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the [[Alans]], [[Circassians]], and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. After 9 days of pursuit, Jebe and Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and [[Cuman]] army at the [[Battle of the Kalka River|Kalka]] (31 May 1223). The Volga Bulgars claimed that they had ambushed Subutai's army, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 607\u2013613.</ref>\n\n==Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin Chinese (1207, 1209, 1211\u20131215, 1226\u201327)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nIn the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe's army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming [[Great Wall]]). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic [[battle of Yehuling]]. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter's daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.<ref>''In the Service of the Khan'', Paul Buell, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nSubutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of [[Xi Xia]] in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis's main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] districts along the upper [[Wei River]], and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet.<ref>Buell, 20.</ref> Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] in 1229.\n\n===Conquest of Jin China (1231\u20131235)===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nAfter a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230\u20131231, \u00d6gedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central [[China]]) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229,<ref>Rashid al-Din, ''Annals of Ogedei Khan'', 33.</ref> but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229\u20131230 after the Mongolian general Dolqolqu suffered a major defeat.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31.</ref> Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them.\n\n Subutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai's main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of [[Henan]] ended in failure after Subutai's advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch\u2019e-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 1231\u20131232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and [[Tolui]], invading the [[Song Empire]] and attacking Henan from the more exposed south.<ref>Atwood, 34.</ref> The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides.<ref>Yuan Shi, 115.2885-6.</ref> This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south.\n\nThe main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai's army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin's attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube'etei Ba'atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nWith part of his force harassing the Jin army's foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin's line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai's army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army's food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the [[battle of Sanfeng Mountain]] (9 February 1232), capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T\u2019iehling (1 March 1232).<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube`etei Ba`atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\n The heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of [[Wikt:circumvallate#Verb|circumvallation]] that had a perimeter stretching {{convert|54|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called \"Thunder Crash Bombs\", which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, [[mangonel]]<nowiki/>s, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their [[Wikt:intransigence|intransigence]] and extremely long resistance. However, \u00d6gedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly. <ref>McLynn, 407\u2013410.</ref>  With assistance from the Song Dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234.\n\nHowever, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized [[Kaifeng]] and [[Luoyang]] during the summer of 1234 during Subutai's absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them , and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai's victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward.\n\n==Conquest of Russia (1236\u20131240)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'}}\n\u00d6gedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchaks]] and [[Bulgars]]. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince [[Batu Khan|Batu]]). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: \u00d6gedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died.<ref>McLynn, 435.</ref> In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains.<ref>Svedrup, 43\u201344.</ref> After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader [[Bachman Khan|Bachman]] on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had [[Wikt:ensconce|ensconced]] himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the 'net'.<ref>McLynn, 436\u2013437.</ref>\n\nUnlike in 1222\u201323 when the majority of the Rus' states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Russians were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked [[Ryazan]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the [[Black Sea]]. In 1239, the Rus' state of [[Chernigov]] was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer [[Novgorod]] when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.<ref>Frank McLynn, 434\u2013441.</ref>\n\nThe most notable encounter of the campaign was the [[battle of the Sit River]] in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated.<ref>''The Chronicle of Novgorod'' (1914), 83.</ref> The Mongols had made a treaty with Galich-Vladimir, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. [[Kiev]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and other cities were quickly taken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Invasion of Central Europe (1241\u20131242)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of [[Jochi]], was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against [[Kievan Rus']]. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates.\n\nThough the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, [[Bela IV]], was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to.<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat''.</ref> Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories [[Baidar]] and [[Kadan]] regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the [[Battle of Legnica]], right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]]'s army triumphed in [[Transylvania]], a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King [[Bela IV]] had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai's force still managed an astonishing pace of {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela's obstacles.<ref>McLynn, 465\u2013466.</ref>\n\nOnly one day after the smaller Mongol army in [[Poland]] had won the [[Battle of Legnica]], Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the [[Battle of Mohi]] during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so [[catapult]]s were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2978.</ref> Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled.\n\nThe result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the [[Mongols]] left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this 'hole' in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men.<ref>Denis Sinor, ''[http://deremilitari.org/2014/07/the-mongols-in-the-west/ The Mongols in the West]'' (1999).</ref> In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong [[Baghatur|ba'aaturs]] (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.<ref>Yuan Shi, 121, 1a\u20135a</ref>\n\n===Mongol subjugation of Hungary===\n{{Main|First Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\nThe after battle tensions reached its climax at a very argumentative feast. One unique feature of this campaign, due to the large number of princes, was that in addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preempetively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|Guyuk]] and [[B\u00fcri|Buri]].<ref>Hodong Kim, ''A Reappraisal of G\u00fcy\u00fcg Khan'', 319\u2013320.</ref> Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to \u00d6gedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.<ref>Urgunge Onon, ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', 270.</ref>\n\nDespite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary.  From Rogerius' writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy. According to Rogerius, The Mongols would sack a town and pretend to depart, only to hide and return shortly thereafter to kill everyone who had been hiding under rubble or in the forests. he also claims that in other instances they enlisted willing Hungarians to organize their brethren to work at Mongol direction, or spread false word of a general amnesty being ordained.<ref>McLynn, 472\u2013479; Thomas of Spalato, ''Historia''; Rogerius of Apulia, ''Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaro''.</ref>\n\nIn order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at [[Oradea]], the castle of [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]] of [[Pannonia]], and the capital [[Esztergom]], though the latter's stone citadel held out, though not all sieges proved successful. In the west, Kadan's army was unable to catch Bela, and lacking siege equipment, he could not forcibly capture the Adriatic cities. However, Bela, hiding on the island of [[Trogir]] in [[Croatia]], was also unable to effectively rally his people due to his flight, which meant that for the time being Hungary was at the total mercy of the main Mongol army.\n\nBy early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the [[Holy Roman Empire]], when news came of the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, ''The Story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars''.</ref> Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. It should be noted however that this account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan's death after they had already begun the withdrawal. Furthermore, the campaign had become bogged down in a series of unprofitable sieges at Klist and other fortified strongholds. The Mongols always practiced a \"tsunami strategy\" of temporarily retreating from the furthest outlying provinces they had won to avoid overextension, only to return shortly after their closer conquests were properly solidified.<ref>Timothy May, ''The Mongol Art of War and the Tsunami Strategy''.</ref> However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary's population may have died from the invasion.<ref>McLynn, 479; ''Carmen Miserabile''.</ref> A Bavarian monk tersely recorded in 1241 that \"In this year, after existing for 350 years, the kingdom of Hungary was annihilated by the Tatars.\"<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat'', 49.</ref> Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to [[Pope Innocent IV]] that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.<ref>King Belas IV's letter to the Pope, 310.</ref>{{full citation needed|reason=What's the source for this letter?|date=May 2019}} It has been noted however that the level of within Hungary was quite unevenly distributed, with archaeological evidence of destruction heavily concentrated east of the Danube, in the Great Hungarian Plain. It has also been pointed out that, given that Bela IV was able to recover his territories from Frederick II Babenburg of Austria almost immediately after the Mongols left, the damage done to his military structure can hardly have been as severe as Rogerius and Thomas of Split claimed.<ref>Laszlovszky, J\u00f3zsef & Pow, Stephen & Romh\u00e1nyi, Beatrix & Ferenczi, Laszlo & Pinke, Zsolt.

In 1 The Mongol Invasion and Its Aftermath, (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2016)</ref>\n\nOn the way out of Europe, the Mongols plundered the yet untouched lands of Bulgaria and encountered the army of [[Baldwin II, Latin Emperor]] of Constantinople. Though Baldwin defeated a small skirmishing force, he was apparently lured into overconfidence and suffered a severe defeat.<ref>McLynn, 479.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter subduing a [[Cumans|Cuman]] revolt in what is now Russia, another possible reason for departing Hungary so suddenly, Subutai turned towards Mongolia. Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] was elected after three years, with Subutai's support. G\u00fcy\u00fck had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge at the age of 71 of the campaign against the [[Song dynasty]] for 1246\u20131247. The Papal envoy [[Plano Carpini]] saw him when he was in [[Karakorum]], Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the rest of his life at his home in the vicinity of the [[Tuul River]] (near modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), dying there at the age of 72.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the [[Danube|Danube river]].<ref name=\"weatherford\">{{cite book |title=Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |publisher=Penguin |year=2017 |isbn=0735221170 |page=286}}</ref>\n\nSubutai's descendants such as [[Uriyangkhadai]] and [[Aju]] would serve the [[Great Khans]] for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], invade [[Dai Viet]] and obtain their submission, and achieve great success invading the Song from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the [[battle of Xiangyang]], which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote|\"No Mongol general played a greater role than Subotei Ba'atur in establishing and maintaining the early Mongol Empire.

When he first entered the service of Temujin, the later Cinggis Qan, the realm of that minor Mongol chieftain comprised only a few families.

Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 110.</ref> As a result, after adding onto the innovations of Genghis Khan, Subutai's armies fought unlike any force in history until the Germans and Russians in World War II,{{Dubious |reason=The kind of tactic described was formulated and put to use in World War 1.|date=November 2019}} seven hundred years later. They did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3\u20135 axes of approach, often 500\u20131000&nbsp;km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail. However, unlike Napoleon, the Mongols retained the flexibility to dispatch armies to the widely separate fronts, through inhospitable terrain or during the most unexpected times of year, often using some armies purely as means of fixing enemy attention and fomenting division in their enemies greater than any other army in history. Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state's will to fight, not merely to defeat their armies and hope they surrendered, as Napoleon had.<ref>Gabriel, 113.</ref> Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.<ref>LTC Sean Slappy, ''Command and Control Began with Subotai Bahadur'' (2010).</ref>\n\nThough unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai's exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book ''Great Captains Unveiled'' after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise.  In particular, [[Erwin Rommel]] and [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] were avid students of Mongol campaigns.<ref>James C. Bradford, ed., ''International Encyclopedia of Military History''.</ref>\n\n==='Deep Battle' theory===\n{{Main|Deep Battle}}\nRussia derived the most use out of a careful study of the Mongol campaigns. Their closer proximity to the steppe gave them greater interest and access to the Mongolian campaigns, first analyzed by the Russian General [[Mikhail Ivanin]] in the 19th century, which became a recommended text in the Russian military academies up until the mid 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 111.</ref> Ivanin's work became used in the [[Deep Battle]] doctrine developed by Soviet Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Mikhail Frunze]], and [[G.

Deep Battle doctrine bore a heavy resemblance to Mongol strategic methods, substituting tanks, motorized troop carriers, artillery, and airplanes for Mongol horse archers, lancers, and field artillery. The Red Army even went so far as to copy Subutai's use of smokescreens on the battlefield to cover troop movements.<ref>Gabriel, 112\u2013118.</ref> Later in the 20th century, American military theorist [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] and some of his followers used Genghis Khan and Subutai's campaigns as examples of maneuver warfare.<ref>LTC Joe E.

The incident has since become legendary.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/kanadehon/Index.htm | title = Kanadehon | publisher = Columbia University}}</ref>\n\nThe story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' (feudal lord) [[Asano Naganori]] was compelled to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named [[Kira Yoshinaka]], whose title was ''[[K\u014dzuke Province|K\u014dzuke]] no [[Kokushi (official)|suke]]''. After waiting and planning for a year, the ''r\u014dnin'' avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. They were then themselves obliged to commit ''seppuku'' for the crime of [[murder]]. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should display in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era, during which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.\n\nFictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r\u014dnin are known as ''[[Ch\u016bshingura]]''. The story was popularized in numerous plays, including in the genres of ''[[bunraku]]'' and ''[[kabuki]]''. Because of the [[censorship]] laws of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in the ''[[Genroku]]'' [[Japanese era name|era]], which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some,{{who|date=March 2014}} the first ''Ch\u016bshingura'' was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the ''Ch\u016bshingura'' survive.\n\nThe ''bakufu'''s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years after the events in question in the late 18th century when Japanologist [[Isaac Titsingh]] first recorded the story of the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' as one of the significant events of the ''Genroku'' era.<ref name=\"s91\">Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan'', p. 91.</ref> To this day, the story remains popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, [[Sengaku-ji|Sengakuji Temple]], where Asano Naganori and the ''r\u014dnin'' are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.\n\n==Name==\nThe event is known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''Ak\u014d incident''|\u8d64\u7a42\u4e8b\u4ef6|Ak\u014d jiken}}, sometimes also referred to as the ''Ak\u014d vendetta''. The participants in the revenge are called the {{nihongo|Ak\u014d-r\u014dshi|\u8d64\u7a42\u6d6a\u58eb}} or {{nihongo|Shi-j\u016b-shichi-shi|\u56db\u5341\u4e03\u58eb}} in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the \"forty-seven r\u014dnin\" or \"forty-seven leaderless samurai\" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the {{nihongo|''Ch\u016bshingura''|\u5fe0\u81e3\u8535|The Treasury of Loyal Retainers}}.\n\n==Story==\nFor many years, the version of events retold by [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|A. B. Mitford]] in ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' (1871) was generally considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the [[Western world|West]]. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the forty-seven r\u014dnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned.<ref name=smith1>[http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/retelling/Mitford.htm#Analysis Analysis of Mitford's story] by [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/ Dr. Henry Smith], [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/index.htm Chushinguranew website], Columbia University</ref> Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.<ref name=smith1/>\n\nWhether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:\n{{quote |In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in [[Takanawa]], a suburb of Yedo, is hidden Sengakuji, or the Spring-hill Temple, renowned throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery, which contains the graves of the forty-seven r\u00f4nin, famous in Japanese history, heroes of Japanese drama, ''the tale of whose deed I am about to transcribe''. | Mitford, A. B.<ref>(1871). ''Tales of Old Japan,'' pp. 5\u20136.</ref> [emphasis added]}}\n\nMitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as \"proofs\" authenticating the factual basis of his story.<ref>Mitford, pp. 28\u201334.</ref> These documents were:\n# ...the receipt given by the retainers of Kira K\u014dtsuk\u0113 no Suk\u0113's son in return for the head of their lord's father, which the priests restored to the family.<ref name=\"Mitford, p. 30\">Mitford, p. 30.</ref>\n# ...a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men, dated in the 15th year of Genroku, 12th month.<ref>Mitford, p. 31.</ref>\n# ...a paper which the Forty-seven R\u014dnin laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira K\u00f4tsuk\u00e9 no Suk\u00e9.<ref>Mitford, p. 32.</ref>\n\n(See ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' for the widely known, yet significantly fictional narrative.)\n\n===Genesis of a tragedy===\n[[File:Chushingura Matsu no Oroka.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ukiyo-e]] print depicting Asano Naganori's assault on Kira Yoshinaka in the ''Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka'' of Edo Castle]]\n[[File:MatsuNoORoka.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the ''Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka'' (Great Corridor of Pines) in [[Edo Castle]], where Asano attacked Kira]]\nIn 1701, two ''[[daimy\u014d]]'', [[Asano Naganori|Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori]], the young ''daimy\u014d'' of the [[Ak\u014d Domain]] (a small [[fiefdom]] in western [[Honsh\u016b]]), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the [[Tsuwano Domain]], were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of [[Emperor Higashiyama|the Emperor]] at [[Edo Castle]], during their ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' service to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''.<ref>Mitford, A. B. (1871). ''Tales of Old Japan'', p. 7.</ref>\n\nAsano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]]'s shogunate. He allegedly became upset at them, either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly [[moral]] [[Confucian]]. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific ''[[bakufu]]'' duties,<ref>Mitford, p. 7.</ref> offence was taken.<ref name = \"s91\" />\n\nInitially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.<ref>Mitford, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nHowever, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the ''[[Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka]]'', the main grand corridor that interconnects the ''Shiro-[[shoin]]'' (\u767d\u66f8\u9662) and the ''\u014chiroma'' of the ''Honmaru Goten'' (\u672c\u4e38\u5fa1\u6bbf) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.<ref>Mitford, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nKira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a [[katana]], was completely forbidden in [[Edo Castle]].<ref>Mitford, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> The ''daimy\u014d'' of Ak\u014d had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by ''[[seppuku]]''.<ref name = \"s91\" /> Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' (leaderless).\n\nThis news was carried to [[\u014cishi Yoshio|\u014cishi Kuranosuke Yoshio]], Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with ''bakufu'' orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.\n\n===The ''r\u014dnin'' plot revenge===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Utagawa Kunisada-c1850-Horibe Yahei-Horibe Yasubei.jpg|thumb|Two of the r\u014dnin: Horibe Yahei and his adopted son, Horibe Yasubei.

They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.\n\nKira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The ''r\u014dnin'' saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.\n\n\u014cishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.\n\nOne day, as \u014cishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai&mdash;by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour&mdash;that he abused and insulted \u014cishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.\n\nNot too long after, \u014cishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the ''r\u014dnin'' took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.\n\n\u014cishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly [[Ichiriki Chaya]]), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. \u014cishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid \u014cishi of his spies.\n\nKira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his \"retirement\", he then reluctantly let down his guard.\n\nThe rest of the faithful ''r\u014dnin'' now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to \u014cishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.\n\n===The attack===\n[[File:Akoroshi in assault equipments 20101213.jpg|thumb|Modern day reenactment of a samurai armed for the attack]]\n[[File:HokusaiChushingura.jpg|thumb|The ''r\u014dnin'' attack the principal gate of Kira's mansion]]\nAfter two years, when \u014cishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard,<ref>Mitford, p. 16.</ref> and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.\n\nIn {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 15,  (1702) 14 December|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u56db\u65e5|}},<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\">[http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm Tsuchihashi conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014735/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, \u014cishi and the other ''r\u014dnin'' attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by \u014cishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, \u014cishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.<ref>Mitford, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nOnce Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death.<ref>Mitford, p. 17</ref> All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which \u014cishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.<ref>Mitford, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there.<ref>Mitford, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the ''r\u014dnin'' climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge ([[Revenge#History|katakiuchi]], \u6575\u8a0e\u3061). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.<ref>Mitford, p. 19.</ref>\n\nAfter posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, \u014cishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but \u014cishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.<ref>Mitford, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nKira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.<ref>Mitford, p. 20.</ref>\n\nEventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the ''r\u014dnin'' killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but \u014cishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.<ref>Mitford, p. 22.</ref>\n\n===The death of Kira===\nA renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.<ref>Mitford, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHe refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The ''r\u014dnin'' gathered, and \u014cishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira\u2014as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.<ref>Mitford, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nAt that, \u014cishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. \u014cishi indicated he personally would act as a ''[[kaishakunin]]'' (\"second\", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.<ref>Mitford, p. 24.</ref>\n\nHowever, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, \u014cishi ordered the other ''r\u014dnin'' to pin him down, and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger.\n\nThey then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.<ref>Mitford, pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nOne of the ''r\u014dnin'', the ''[[ashigaru]]'' Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Ak\u014d and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the ''r\u014dnin'' turned themselves in.)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Henry D.

The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.<ref>Mitford, pp. 25\u201326.</ref>\n\nOn arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 ''r\u014dnin'' (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different ''daimy\u014d''.<ref>Mitford, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, two of Kira's friends came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.<ref name=\"Mitford, p. 30\"/>\n\nThe shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the ''sh\u014dgun'' received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the ''r\u014dnin''. As expected, the ''r\u014dnin'' were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the ''sh\u014dgun'' finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit ''seppuku'' instead of having them executed as criminals.<ref name = \"Mitford 28\">Mitford, p. 28.</ref> It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion.<ref name = \"s91\" /> \u014cishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed ''seppuku''.\n\nEach of the 46 ''r\u014dnin'' killed himself in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 16, on the 4th day of the 2nd month|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u516d\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\u56db\u65e5||February 4, 1703}}.<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\"/> This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the \"forty-six r\u014dnin\"; this refers to the group put to death by the ''sh\u014dgun'', while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh ''r\u014dnin'', identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the ''sh\u014dgun'' (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades.

The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era.<ref name = \"s91\" /> One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on \u014cishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that \u014cishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the ''r\u014dnin''.<ref name = \"Mitford 28\" />\n\n===Re-establishment of the Asano clan's lordship===\nThough the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and find a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the ''r\u014dnin'' had been sentenced to their honorable end.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAsano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Honjomatsuzakacho park entrance ryogoku sumida 2009.JPG|thumb|Part of the Remains of Former Kira Residence, currently Honjo Matsuzaka-cho Park]]\n\n===Members===\nBelow are the names of the 47 ''r\u014dnin'' in the following form: family name - pseudonym (''[[kemy\u014d]]'') - real name (''[[imina]]'').

It was [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], author of the ''[[Hagakure]]'', who asked the well known question: \"What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?\" His answer was that the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards\u2014bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the ''r\u014dnin'' to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The ''r\u014dnin'' would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time\u2014but this was unimportant.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\">[[Yamamoto Tsunetomo|Yamamoto, T.]] (Kodansha, 1979). ''[[Hagakure]]'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n{{Main|Ch\u016bshingura}}\n[[File:Kuranosuke Harakiri no zu.jpg|thumb|260px|Painting of [[\u014cishi Yoshio]] committing seppuku]]\nThe tragedy of the forty-seven r\u014dnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.\n\nImmediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the ''r\u014dnin'' had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.\n\n===Plays===\nThe incident immediately inspired a succession of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' plays; the first, ''The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga'', appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as [[Manila]], to spread the story to the rest of Asia.\n\nThe most successful of the adaptations was a ''[[bunraku]]'' [[puppet]] play called ''[[Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura]]'' (now simply called ''Ch\u016bshingura'', or \"Treasury of Loyal Retainers\"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a ''kabuki'' play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.\n\nIn the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Ashikaga Takauji]]. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became [[K\u014d no Moronao]] and \u014cishi became \u014cboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the ''r\u014dnin'' were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the ''r\u014dnin'' dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).\n\n===Opera===\nThe story was turned into an opera, ''Ch\u016bshingura'', by [[Shigeaki Saegusa]] in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Cinema and television===\nThe play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan,<ref name=\"child2007\">Child, Ben.

It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying ''[[benshi]]'' narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], who would later direct ''[[Ugetsu]]'', to make ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|Genroku Ch\u016bshingura]]''. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar ''rekishi geki'' (\"historical drama\") of ''The Loyal 47 Ronin''. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source ''Mayama Ch\u016bshingura'', a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0297/02077.html | title = Movies | newspaper = Chicago Reader}}</ref>\n\nThe 1962 film version directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki|Ch\u016bshingura]]'', is most familiar to Western audiences.<ref name=\"child2007\"/> In it, [[Toshir\u014d Mifune]] appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series ''[[Daich\u016bshingura]]'' as \u014cishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic ''[[Swords of Vengeance]]'' (''Ak\u014d-j\u014d danzetsu'').\n\nMany Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as ''Daich\u016bshingura'' and the more recent NHK [[Taiga drama]] ''Genroku Ry\u014dran'', recount the events. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the ''Ch\u016bshingura'', while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, ''[[gaiden]]'' dramatize events and characters not in the ''Ch\u016bshingura''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed [[47 Ronin (1994 film)|another version]] in 1994. In 2004, [[K\u014dsei Sait\u014d|Mitsumasa Sait\u014d]] directed a nine-episode mini-series starring [[Ken Matsudaira]], who had also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the ''Ch\u016bshingura'' entitled ''Genroku Ry\u014dran''. In [[Hirokazu Koreeda]]'s 2006 film ''[[Hana (film)|Hana yori mo nao]]'', the story was used as a backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.\n\nMost recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie titled ''[[47 Ronin (2013 film)|47 Ronin]]'', starring [[Keanu Reeves]], and then again into a more stylized 2015 version titled ''[[Last Knights]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/01/freeman-owen-casualties-of-bloody-bad-last-knights/|title=Freeman, Owen casualties of bloody bad 'Last Knights'|first=Sara|last=Stewart|date=1 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Woodblock prints===\nThe forty-seven r\u014dnin is one of the most popular themes in [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], or ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors.

incident'''|\u8d64\u7a42\u4e8b\u4ef6|Ak\u014d jiken}} or ''Ak\u014d vendetta'', is an 18th-century historical event in Japan in which a band of ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' (leaderless [[samurai]]) avenged the death of their master. The incident has since become legendary.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/kanadehon/Index.htm | title = Kanadehon | publisher = Columbia University}}</ref>\n\nThe story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' (feudal lord) [[Asano Naganori]] was compelled to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named [[Kira Yoshinaka]], whose title was ''[[K\u014dzuke Province|K\u014dzuke]] no [[Kokushi (official)|suke]]''. After waiting and planning for a year, the ''r\u014dnin'' avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. They were then themselves obliged to commit ''seppuku'' for the crime of [[murder]]. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should display in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era, during which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.\n\nFictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r\u014dnin are known as ''[[Ch\u016bshingura]]''. The story was popularized in numerous plays, including in the genres of ''[[bunraku]]'' and ''[[kabuki]]''. Because of the [[censorship]] laws of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in the ''[[Genroku]]'' [[Japanese era name|era]], which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some,{{who|date=March 2014}} the first ''Ch\u016bshingura'' was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the ''Ch\u016bshingura'' survive.\n\nThe ''bakufu'''s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years after the events in question in the late 18th century when Japanologist [[Isaac Titsingh]] first recorded the story of the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' as one of the significant events of the ''Genroku'' era.<ref name=\"s91\">Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan'', p. 91.</ref> To this day, the story remains popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, [[Sengaku-ji|Sengakuji Temple]], where Asano Naganori and the ''r\u014dnin'' are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.\n\n==Name==\nThe event is known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''Ak\u014d incident''|\u8d64\u7a42\u4e8b\u4ef6|Ak\u014d jiken}}, sometimes also referred to as the ''Ak\u014d vendetta''. The participants in the revenge are called the {{nihongo|Ak\u014d-r\u014dshi|\u8d64\u7a42\u6d6a\u58eb}} or {{nihongo|Shi-j\u016b-shichi-shi|\u56db\u5341\u4e03\u58eb}} in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the \"forty-seven r\u014dnin\" or \"forty-seven leaderless samurai\" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the {{nihongo|''Ch\u016bshingura''|\u5fe0\u81e3\u8535|The Treasury of Loyal Retainers}}.\n\n==Story==\nFor many years, the version of events retold by [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|A. B. Mitford]] in ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' (1871) was generally considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the [[Western world|West]]. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the forty-seven r\u014dnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned.<ref name=smith1>[http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/retelling/Mitford.htm#Analysis Analysis of Mitford's story] by [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/ Dr. Henry Smith], [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/index.htm Chushinguranew website], Columbia University</ref> Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.<ref name=smith1/>\n\nWhether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:\n{{quote |In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in [[Takanawa]], a suburb of Yedo, is hidden Sengakuji, or the Spring-hill Temple, renowned throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery, which contains the graves of the forty-seven r\u00f4nin, famous in Japanese history, heroes of Japanese drama, ''the tale of whose deed I am about to transcribe''. | Mitford, A.

''Tales of Old Japan'', p. 7.</ref>\n\nAsano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]]'s shogunate. He allegedly became upset at them, either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly [[moral]] [[Confucian]]. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific ''[[bakufu]]'' duties,<ref>Mitford, p. 7.</ref> offence was taken.<ref name = \"s91\" />\n\nInitially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.<ref>Mitford, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nHowever, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the ''[[Matsu no \u014cr\u014dka]]'', the main grand corridor that interconnects the ''Shiro-[[shoin]]'' (\u767d\u66f8\u9662) and the ''\u014chiroma'' of the ''Honmaru Goten'' (\u672c\u4e38\u5fa1\u6bbf) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.<ref>Mitford, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nKira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a [[katana]], was completely forbidden in [[Edo Castle]].<ref>Mitford, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> The ''daimy\u014d'' of Ak\u014d had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by ''[[seppuku]]''.<ref name = \"s91\" /> Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' (leaderless).\n\nThis news was carried to [[\u014cishi Yoshio|\u014cishi Kuranosuke Yoshio]], Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with ''bakufu'' orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.\n\n===The ''r\u014dnin'' plot revenge===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Utagawa Kunisada-c1850-Horibe Yahei-Horibe Yasubei.jpg|thumb|Two of the r\u014dnin: Horibe Yahei and his adopted son, Horibe Yasubei. Yasubei is holding an [[\u014dtsuchi]].]]\nOf Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader \u014cishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.\n\nKira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The ''r\u014dnin'' saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.\n\n\u014cishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.\n\nOne day, as \u014cishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai&mdash;by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour&mdash;that he abused and insulted \u014cishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.\n\nNot too long after, \u014cishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the ''r\u014dnin'' took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.\n\n\u014cishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly [[Ichiriki Chaya]]), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. \u014cishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid \u014cishi of his spies.\n\nKira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his \"retirement\", he then reluctantly let down his guard.\n\nThe rest of the faithful ''r\u014dnin'' now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to \u014cishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.\n\n===The attack===\n[[File:Akoroshi in assault equipments 20101213.jpg|thumb|Modern day reenactment of a samurai armed for the attack]]\n[[File:HokusaiChushingura.jpg|thumb|The ''r\u014dnin'' attack the principal gate of Kira's mansion]]\nAfter two years, when \u014cishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard,<ref>Mitford, p. 16.</ref> and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.\n\nIn {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 15,  (1702) 14 December|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u56db\u65e5|}},<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\">[http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm Tsuchihashi conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014735/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, \u014cishi and the other ''r\u014dnin'' attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by \u014cishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, \u014cishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.<ref>Mitford, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nOnce Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death.<ref>Mitford, p. 17</ref> All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which \u014cishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.<ref>Mitford, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there.<ref>Mitford, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the ''r\u014dnin'' climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge ([[Revenge#History|katakiuchi]], \u6575\u8a0e\u3061). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.<ref>Mitford, p. 19.</ref>\n\nAfter posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, \u014cishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but \u014cishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.<ref>Mitford, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nKira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.<ref>Mitford, p. 20.</ref>\n\nEventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the ''r\u014dnin'' killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but \u014cishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.<ref>Mitford, p. 22.</ref>\n\n===The death of Kira===\nA renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.<ref>Mitford, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHe refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The ''r\u014dnin'' gathered, and \u014cishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira\u2014as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.<ref>Mitford, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nAt that, \u014cishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. \u014cishi indicated he personally would act as a ''[[kaishakunin]]'' (\"second\", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.<ref>Mitford, p. 24.</ref>\n\nHowever, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, \u014cishi ordered the other ''r\u014dnin'' to pin him down, and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger.\n\nThey then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.<ref>Mitford, pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nOne of the ''r\u014dnin'', the ''[[ashigaru]]'' Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Ak\u014d and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the ''r\u014dnin'' turned themselves in.)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Henry D.

The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.<ref>Mitford, pp. 25\u201326.</ref>\n\nOn arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 ''r\u014dnin'' (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different ''daimy\u014d''.<ref>Mitford, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, two of Kira's friends came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.<ref name=\"Mitford, p. 30\"/>\n\nThe shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the ''sh\u014dgun'' received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the ''r\u014dnin''. As expected, the ''r\u014dnin'' were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the ''sh\u014dgun'' finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit ''seppuku'' instead of having them executed as criminals.<ref name = \"Mitford 28\">Mitford, p. 28.</ref> It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion.<ref name = \"s91\" /> \u014cishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed ''seppuku''.\n\nEach of the 46 ''r\u014dnin'' killed himself in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 16, on the 4th day of the 2nd month|\u5143\u7984\u5341\u516d\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\u56db\u65e5||February 4, 1703}}.<ref name=\"Tsuchihashi conversion\"/> This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the \"forty-six r\u014dnin\"; this refers to the group put to death by the ''sh\u014dgun'', while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh ''r\u014dnin'', identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the ''sh\u014dgun'' (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades.

The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era.<ref name = \"s91\" /> One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on \u014cishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that \u014cishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the ''r\u014dnin''.<ref name = \"Mitford 28\" />\n\n===Re-establishment of the Asano clan's lordship===\nThough the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and finding a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet.

It was [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], author of the ''[[Hagakure]]'', who asked the well known question: \"What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?\" His answer was that the forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'' would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards\u2014bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the ''r\u014dnin'' to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The ''r\u014dnin'' would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time\u2014but this was unimportant.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\">[[Yamamoto Tsunetomo|Yamamoto, T.]] (Kodansha, 1979). ''[[Hagakure]]'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n\u014cishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.<ref name=\"Yamamoto, T 1979\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n{{Main|Ch\u016bshingura}}\n[[File:Kuranosuke Harakiri no zu.jpg|thumb|260px|Painting of [[\u014cishi Yoshio]] committing seppuku]]\nThe tragedy of the forty-seven r\u014dnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.\n\nImmediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the ''r\u014dnin'' had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.\n\n===Plays===\nThe incident immediately inspired a succession of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' plays; the first, ''The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga'', appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as [[Manila]], to spread the story to the rest of Asia.\n\nThe most successful of the adaptations was a ''[[bunraku]]'' [[puppet]] play called ''[[Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura]]'' (now simply called ''Ch\u016bshingura'', or \"Treasury of Loyal Retainers\"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a ''kabuki'' play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.\n\nIn the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Ashikaga Takauji]]. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became [[K\u014d no Moronao]] and \u014cishi became \u014cboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the ''r\u014dnin'' were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the ''r\u014dnin'' dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).\n\n===Opera===\nThe story was turned into an opera, ''Ch\u016bshingura'', by [[Shigeaki Saegusa]] in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Cinema and television===\nThe play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan,<ref name=\"child2007\">Child, Ben.

It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying ''[[benshi]]'' narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], who would later direct ''[[Ugetsu]]'', to make ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|Genroku Ch\u016bshingura]]''. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar ''rekishi geki'' (\"historical drama\") of ''The Loyal 47 Ronin''. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source ''Mayama Ch\u016bshingura'', a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0297/02077.html | title = Movies | newspaper = Chicago Reader}}</ref>\n\nThe 1962 film version directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki|Ch\u016bshingura]]'', is most familiar to Western audiences.<ref name=\"child2007\"/> In it, [[Toshir\u014d Mifune]] appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series ''[[Daich\u016bshingura]]'' as \u014cishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic ''[[Swords of Vengeance]]'' (''Ak\u014d-j\u014d danzetsu'').\n\nMany Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as ''Daich\u016bshingura'' and the more recent NHK [[Taiga drama]] ''Genroku Ry\u014dran'', recount the events. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the ''Ch\u016bshingura'', while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, ''[[gaiden]]'' dramatize events and characters not in the ''Ch\u016bshingura''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed [[47 Ronin (1994 film)|another version]] in 1994. In 2004, [[K\u014dsei Sait\u014d|Mitsumasa Sait\u014d]] directed a nine-episode mini-series starring [[Ken Matsudaira]], who had also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the ''Ch\u016bshingura'' entitled ''Genroku Ry\u014dran''. In [[Hirokazu Koreeda]]'s 2006 film ''[[Hana (film)|Hana yori mo nao]]'', the story was used as a backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.\n\nMost recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie titled ''[[47 Ronin (2013 film)|47 Ronin]]'', starring [[Keanu Reeves]], and then again into a more stylized 2015 version titled ''[[Last Knights]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/01/freeman-owen-casualties-of-bloody-bad-last-knights/|title=Freeman, Owen casualties of bloody bad 'Last Knights'|first=Sara|last=Stewart|date=1 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Woodblock prints===\nThe forty-seven r\u014dnin is one of the most popular themes in [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], or ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel.
