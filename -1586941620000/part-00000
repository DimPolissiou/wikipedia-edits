Posnansky conducted further investigations at Bigo with the intent to \"make as complete a survey as possible ... to establish the cultural sequence [of the site] and to obtain charcoal samples for [[Carbon-14 dating|Carbon 14 dating]].\"<ref name=\":3\" /> During his investigation of Bigo, Posnansky spent over 7 weeks excavating more than 20 trenches (with a total volume of 781 cubic feet) at four locations (three within the main enclosure area and one at the outer ditch). From these trenches Posnansky prepared sidewall illustrations characterizing the site's soils and exposing the construction history of the mounds and ditches. Also recovered from the trenches were four charcoal samples that were submitted for radiometric dating and over 4,200 pottery [[sherd]]s.\n\n== Layout ==\nBigo is situated on the south shore of the Katonga River and is composed of an arcing, branched ditch and bank alignment encompassing both a smaller collection of enclosure as well as a crossing of the Katonga River.The outer ditches have a maximum width of more than 10 meters, range in depth from 1.5 to 4 meters, and altogether, contain approximately 20 breaks. Combined, the outer ditches run for more than 6 kilometers and encompass over 300 [[hectare]]s<ref name=\":2\" /> with [[topography]] ranging from lowlands to a hilly area rising more than 4,000 feet.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSituated on high ground within the outer boundary are four connected enclosures (1-4). Enclosures 1 and 2 are the largest of the group and share a northwest-southeast aligned ditch having two openings and that is only partially banked on the north side. Enclosures 3 and 4 are smaller and connected to the eastern ends of 1 and 2 (respectively) with a single opening between the large and small enclosures. Enclosures 1, 2, and 4 each have two external openings, while enclosure 3 only has one external opening. When measured from the base of the ditch to the top of the adjacent bank, the inner enclosures measure from 4 to 7 meters high. Three mounds, ranging from 2 to 3 meters tall, are found within (Mounds I and II) and adjacent to Enclosure 2 (Mound III). Of note, Mound III is positioned such that the western ditch of Enclosure 2 was constructed to avoid it.<ref name=\":3\" /> The lack of an embankment for much of the ditch between Enclosures 1 and 2 suggests the upcast soil was used to create one or more of the mounds.\n\nA single ditch and bank originating at the northwest corner of Enclosure 2 runs in a northeasterly direction and terminates at the Katonga River.\n\n== Function ==\nBeginning in the [[Colonialism|colonial]] period when they were first discovered by Europeans and continuing through to the 1960s, the Bigo earthworks have been interpreted as defensive fortifications constructed to protect from invasion; however this interpretation most likely resulted from the experiences of war stemming from the [[Bunyoro]]-[[Buganda]] conflicts of the 1800s, British forts constructed elsewhere in western Uganda, and [[World War I]].<ref name=\":4\" /> This functional interpretation was also supported by Bunyoro [[oral tradition]] from the colonial period in which claims were made that the [[Bacwezi]] and Babito dynasties invaded the region from the north. A number of factors contradict the interpretation that the earthworks were constructed to protect from human invaders, foremost among them is the fact that the overall great length of the outer ditch system is such that it would be logistically impossible to guard. Rather than protect from human invaders,  it has been suggested that Bigo's outer earthworks were constructed to keep elephants from damaging agricultural crops, while the central earthworks were constructed to protect the site's rulers from attack, while serving as places where trade goods were redistributed, as well as being demonstrations of organizational skills and having a [[Symbolic capital|symbolic]] function related to the power associated with those who lived within the earthworks.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Artifacts ==\nThe 1960 excavations at Bigo recovered more than 4,200 pottery sherds from both jars and pots, as well as six [[hearth]] kerbs, one pottery [[bead]], and iron artifacts consisting of a tanged [[arrowhead]], part of a bracelet, a [[spear]] [[ferrule]], and a broken [[knife]] most likely used for [[Harvest|reaping]] grain.<ref name=\":3\" /> The pottery is noteworthy for decorative styling consisting of knotted grass roulette band on or just below the rims while some vessels were also painted using a red [[ochre]] slip.

{"title_page": "Ames room", "text_new": "[[File:Ames room.svg|thumb|A diagram of the true and apparent position of a person in an Ames room, and the shape of that room]]\n[[File:Ames room.ogv|thumb|A video of a man walking in an Ames room]]\n\nAn '''Ames room''' is a distorted room that creates an [[optical illusion]]. Likely influenced by the writings of [[Hermann Helmholtz]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}, it was invented by American scientist [[Adelbert Ames, Jr.]] in 1946,<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.psychologie.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/ames_room.html |title=Ames Room |first= |last= |work=psychologie.tu-dresden.de |year=2001  |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> and constructed in the following year.\n\nAn Ames room is viewed with one eye through a [[peephole]]. Through the peephole the room appears to be an ordinary [[Cuboid|rectangular cuboid]], with a back wall that is vertical and at right angles to an observer's line of sight, two vertical side walls parallel to each other, and a horizontal floor and ceiling. The true shape of the room, however, is that of a six-sided [[Convex polytope|convex polyhedron]]: depending on the design of the room, all surfaces can be regular or irregular [[quadrilateral]]s so that one corner of the room is farther from an observer than the other.\n\n== Explanation ==\n\nThe illusion of an ordinary room is because most information about the true shape of the room does not reach the observer's eye.\nThe geometry of the room is carefully designed, using [[perspective (visual)|perspective]], so that, from the peephole, the image projected onto the retina of the observer's eye is the same as that of an ordinary room. Once the observer is prevented from perceiving the real locations of the parts of the room, the illusion that it is an ordinary room occurs.\n\nOne key aspect of preventing the observer from perceiving the true shape of the room is the peephole. It has at least three consequences:\n# It forces the observer to be at the location where the image projected into his eye is of an ordinary room. From any other location, the observer would see the room's true shape.\n# It forces the observer to use one eye to look into the room, preventing him from getting any information about the real shape the room from [[stereopsis]], which requires two eyes.\n# It prevents the observer from moving his eye to a different location, preventing him from getting any information about real shape of the room from [[motion parallax]].\n\nOther sources of information about the true shape of the room are also removed by its designer. For example, by strategic lighting, the true far corner is as bright as the true near corner. For another example, patterns on the walls (such as windows) and floor (such as a black-and-white chequerboard of tiles) can be made consistent with its illusory geometry.\n\nThe illusion is powerful enough to overcome other information about the true locations of objects in the room, such as familiar size. For example, although the observer knows that adults are all about the same size, an adult standing in the true near corner appears to be a giant, while another adult standing in the true far appears to be a dwarf. For another example, although the observer knows that an adult cannot change size, he sees an adult who walks back and forth between the true far and true near corners appear to grow and shrink.\n\nStudies have shown that the illusion can be created without using walls and a ceiling;{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} it is sufficient to create an apparent horizon (which in reality will not be horizontal) against an appropriate background, and the eye relies on the apparent relative height of an object above that horizon.\n\n== Predecessors ==\n\nThe Ames room has as a predecessor, from as early as the 15th century, the movement in [[art]] called [[Trompe-l'\u0153il]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Day RH |title=The Ames room from another viewpoint |journal= Perception |volume=22 |year=1993 |pages= 1007\u20131011 |doi=10.1068/p221007}}</ref> in which the artist creates the illusion of three-dimensional space, usually on a flat surface.\n\n== \"Anti-gravity\" illusion and \"magnetic mountains\" ==\n\nAmes's original design also contained a groove that was positioned such that a ball in it appears to roll uphill, against gravity.<ref name=Gregory1994>>{{Cite book |last=Gregory |first=Richard L. |title=Even odder perceptions |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-06106-3}}</ref> [[Richard Gregory]] regarded this apparent \"anti-gravity\" effect as more amazing than the apparent size changes, although today it is often not shown when an Ames room is exhibited.\n\nGregory speculated that \"[[Gravity hill|magnetic hills]]\" (also known as \"gravity hills\") can be explained by this principle. For a magic mountain in [[Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]] (known as the [[Electric Brae]]), he found that a row of trees form a background similar to the setting of an Ames room, making the water in a creek appear to flow uphill.<ref name=Gregory1994 />\n\nFor Gregory, this observation raised particularly interesting questions about how different principles for understanding the world compete in our perception. The \"anti-gravity effect\" is a much stronger paradox than the \"size change\" effect, because it seems to negate the law of gravity which is a fundamental feature of the world. In contrast, the apparent size change is not such a strong paradox, because we do have the experience that objects can change size to a certain degree (for example, people and animals can appear to become smaller or larger by crouching or stretching).\n\n== Honi phenomenon ==\n\nA type of selective perceptual distortion known as the Honi phenomenon causes some married persons to perceive less size distortion of the spouse than a stranger in an Ames room.\n\nThe effect was related to the strength of love, liking, and trust of the spouse being viewed.

Likely influenced by the writings of [[Hermann Helmholtz]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}, it was invented by American scientist [[Adelbert Ames, Jr.]] in 1946,<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.psychologie.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/ames_room.html |title=Ames Room |first= |last= |work=psychologie.tu-dresden.de |year=2001  |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> and constructed in the following year.\n\nAn Ames room is viewed with one eye through a [[peephole]]. Through the peephole the room appears to be an ordinary [[Cuboid|rectangular cuboid]], with a back wall that is vertical and at right angles to an observer's line of sight, two vertical side walls parallel to each other, and a horizontal floor and ceiling. The true shape of the room, however, is that of a six-sided [[Convex polytope|convex polyhedron]]: depending on the design of the room, all surfaces can be regular or irregular [[quadrilateral]]s so that one corner of the room is farther from an observer than the other.\n\n== Explanation ==\n\nThe illusion of an ordinary room is because most information about the true shape of the room does not reach the observer's eye.\nThe geometry of the room is carefully designed, using [[perspective (visual)|perspective]], so that, from the peephole, the image projected onto the retina of the observer's eye is the same as that of an ordinary room. Once the observer is prevented from perceiving the real locations of the parts of the room, the illusion that it is an ordinary room occurs.\n\nOne key aspect of preventing the observer from perceiving the true shape of the room is the peephole. It has at least three consequences:\n# It forces the observer to be at the location where the image projected into his eye is of an ordinary room. From any other location, the observer would see the room's true shape.\n# It forces the observer to use one eye to look into the room, preventing him from getting any information about the real shape the room from [[stereopsis]], which requires two eyes.\n# It prevents the observer from moving his eye to a different location, preventing him from getting any information about real shape of the room from [[motion parallax]].\n\nOther sources of information about the true shape of the room are also removed by its designer. For example, by strategic lighting, the true far corner is as bright as the true near corner. For another example, patterns on the walls (such as windows) and floor (such as a black-and-white chequerboard of tiles) can be made consistent with its illusory geometry.\n\nThe illusion is powerful enough to overcome other information about the true locations of objects in the room, such as familiar size. For example, although the observer knows that adults are all about the same size, an adult standing in the true near corner appears to be a giant, while another adult standing in the true far appears to be a dwarf. For another example, although the observer knows that an adult cannot change size, he sees an adult who walks back and forth between the true far and true near corners appear to grow and shrink.\n\nStudies have shown that the illusion can be created without using walls and a ceiling;{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} it is sufficient to create an apparent horizon (which in reality will not be horizontal) against an appropriate background, and the eye relies on the apparent relative height of an object above that horizon.\n\n== Predecessors ==\n\nThe Ames room has as a predecessor, from as early as the 15th century, the movement in [[art]] called [[Trompe-l'\u0153il]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Day RH |title=The Ames room from another viewpoint |journal= Perception |volume=22 |year=1993 |pages= 1007\u20131011 |doi=10.1068/p221007}}</ref> in which the artist creates the illusion of three-dimensional space, usually on a flat surface.\n\n== \"Anti-gravity\" illusion and \"magnetic mountains\" ==\n\nAmes's original design also contained a groove that was positioned such that a ball in it appears to roll uphill, against gravity.<ref name=Gregory1994>>{{Cite book |last=Gregory |first=Richard L. |title=Even odder perceptions |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-06106-3}}</ref> [[Richard Gregory]] regarded this apparent \"anti-gravity\" effect as more amazing than the apparent size changes, although today it is often not shown when an Ames room is exhibited.\n\nGregory speculated that \"[[Gravity hill|magnetic hills]]\" (also known as \"gravity hills\") can be explained by this principle. For a magic mountain in [[Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]] (known as the [[Electric Brae]]), he found that a row of trees form a background similar to the setting of an Ames room, making the water in a creek appear to flow uphill.<ref name=Gregory1994 />\n\nFor Gregory, this observation raised particularly interesting questions about how different principles for understanding the world compete in our perception. The \"anti-gravity effect\" is a much stronger paradox than the \"size change\" effect, because it seems to negate the law of gravity which is a fundamental feature of the world. In contrast, the apparent size change is not such a strong paradox, because we do have the experience that objects can change size to a certain degree (for example, people and animals can appear to become smaller or larger by crouching or stretching).\n\n== Honi phenomenon ==\n\nA type of selective perceptual distortion known as the Honi phenomenon causes some married persons to perceive less size distortion of the spouse than a stranger in an Ames room.\n\nThe effect was related to the strength of love, liking, and trust of the spouse being viewed. Women who were high positive in this area perceived strangers as being more distorted than their partners. Size judgments by men did not seem to be influenced by the strength of their feeling toward their spouse.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors =Dion KL, Dion KK |title=The Honi phenomenon revisited: factors underlying the resistance to perceptual distortion of one's partner |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=33 |issue=2 |year=1976 |pages=170\u20137 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.33.2.170 |pmid=1271208}}</ref>\n\nFurther study has concluded that the Honi phenomenon does not reliably exist as first thought, but may be explained as sex difference influencing perception, with women interpreting a larger reading as a more meaningful or valuable perception of things than men's.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors =Ong J, Luck WJ, Olson HA |title=Reliability, sex difference, and Honi phenomenon in a distorted room |journal= Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=51 |issue=3 Pt 1 |year=1980 |pages=956\u20138 |pmid=7208243 |doi=10.2466/pms.1980.51.3.956}}</ref>\n\n== In media ==\n\nThe Ames room principle has been used widely in TV and movie productions for [[special effects]] when it was necessary to show actors in giant size next to actors in small size.
