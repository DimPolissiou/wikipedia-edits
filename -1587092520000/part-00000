She was also offered a contract to join the Kiev Ballet as principal.  She subsequently joined Kiev Ballet in November 1998, believing she would gain greater experience as a principal dancer.  She stayed for one season, dancing a variety of roles.\n\nWhilst dancing with Kiev Ballet, Cojocaru re-applied to the Royal Ballet in London, but was only invited to audition for the corps de ballet.  She attended an audition for the company whilst on leave from Kiev Ballet and was offered a contract.  Doubtful of development opportunities elsewhere, she accepted the contract and joined the company in November 1999.  She was subsequently promoted to principal dancer in 2001. In 2004, she received the [[Prix Benois de la Danse]] for her portrayal of ''[[Cinderella (Ashton)|Cinderella]]''.\n\nCojocaru's early appearances with the company included performing in the opening gala for the refurbished [[Royal Opera House]], plus appearances with the corps de ballet in the Kingdom of the Shades from ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'', as a snowflake in ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' and as a doll in ''[[Copp\u00e9lia]]''.\n\nOne of the highlights of her career is her partnership with Danish principal dancer, [[Johan Kobborg]]. The partnership began in 2001 when they danced together in ''Romeo and Juliet'' after Cojocaru filled in for an injured [[Miyako Yoshida]]. Since then, Kobborg and Cojocaru's partnership has been named one of the greatest in the history of ballet, and they have danced together at Covent Garden and worldwide.\n\nIn 2012, Cojocaru became the first ballerina to receive the [[Prix Benois de la Danse]] twice, this time for [[John Neumeier]]'s ''Liliom'' with the [[Hamburg Ballet]]. The lead role of ''Julie'' also marked the first time a full-length ballet was created around Cojocaru.\n\nIn June 2013, she announced that she and Kobborg would leave The Royal Ballet at the end of 2012/13 season. Their last performance in London was in ''[[Mayerling (ballet)|Mayerling]]'' on 5 June, followed by scheduled performances on 10 and 12 July with the company in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.roh.org.uk/news/alina-cojocaru-and-johan-kobborg-to-leave-the-royal-ballet-at-the-end-of-201213-season\n|title=Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg to leave The Royal Ballet at the end of 2012/13 season\n|website=Roh.org.uk\n|date=3 June 2013\n|accessdate=2013-06-04\n}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, following her departure from the Royal Ballet, Cojocaru joined the [[English National Ballet]] as a principal dancer.

The [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|eighth and last leader]] of the [[Soviet Union]], he was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1985 until 1991. He was also the country's head of state from 1988 until 1991, serving as the chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] from 1988 to 1989, chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] from 1989 to 1990, and [[president of the Soviet Union]] from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically, he initially adhered to [[Marxism-Leninism]] although by the early 1990s had moved toward [[social democracy]].\n\nOf mixed Russian and Ukrainian heritage, Gorbachev was born in [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]] to a poor peasant family. Growing up under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], in his youth he operated [[combine harvester]]s on a [[collective farm]] before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a [[one-party state]] according to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. While studying at [[Moscow State University]], he married fellow student [[Raisa Gorbacheva|Raisa Titarenko]] in 1953 prior to receiving his law degree in 1955. Moving to [[Stavropol]], he worked for the [[Komsomol]] youth organisation and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the [[de-Stalinization]] reforms of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee in 1970, in which position he oversaw construction of the [[Great Stavropol Canal]]. In 1978 he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and in 1979 joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Within three years of the death of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], following the brief regimes of [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the Politburo elected Gorbachev as General Secretary, the ''de facto'' head of government, in 1985.\n\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and to its [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform was necessary, particularly after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He withdrew from the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] and embarked on summits with United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] to limit [[nuclear weapon]]s and end the [[Cold War]]. Domestically, his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") allowed for enhanced [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of press|press]], while his ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") sought to decentralise economic decision making to improve efficiency. His [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] measures and formation of the elected [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various [[Eastern Bloc]] countries abandoned Marxist-Leninist governance in 1989\u201390. Internally, growing [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist-Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] against Gorbachev in 1991. In the wake of this, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] against Gorbachev's wishes and he resigned. After leaving office, he launched his [[The Gorbachev Foundation|Gorbachev Foundation]], became a vocal critic of Russian Presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement.\n\nWidely considered one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century, Gorbachev remains the subject of controversy. The recipient of a wide range of awards\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014he was widely praised for his pivotal role in ending the Cold War, curtailing human rights abuses in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Marxist\u2013Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe]] and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Conversely, in Russia he is often derided for not stopping the Soviet collapse, an event which brought a decline in Russia's global influence and precipitated an economic crisis.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]], then in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1p=22|2a1=Doder|2a2=Branson|2y=1990|2p=1|3a1=McCauley|3y=1998|3p=15|4a1=Taubman|4y=2017|4p=7}} At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=10}} Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from [[Voronezh]] several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from [[Chernigov]].{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=10}}\nHis parents named him Victor, but at the insistence of his mother\u2014a devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]\u2014he had a secret [[baptism]], where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=4|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=15|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=7}} His relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=8\u20139}} His parents were poor,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=9}} and lived as peasants.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=22}} They had married as teenagers in 1928,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=16}} and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergei's father's house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=16, 17}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Gorbachev and his [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] maternal grandparents, late 1930s]]\n\nThe Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and during Gorbachev's childhood was under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Stalin had initiated a project of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|mass rural collectivisation]] which, in keeping with his [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideas, he believed would help convert the country into a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=1|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=7}} Gorbachev's maternal grandfather joined the Communist Party and helped form the village's first [[kolkhoz]] (collective farm) in 1929, becoming its chair.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=12\u201313}} This farm was {{convert|12|mi|km|order=flip}} outside Privolnoye village and when he was three years old, Gorbachev left his parental home and moved into the kolkhoz with his maternal grandparents.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=14}}\n\nThe country was then experiencing the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]], in which two of Gorbachev's paternal uncles and an aunt died.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=16|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=7}} This was followed by the [[Great Purge]], in which individuals accused of being \"[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]\"\u2014including those sympathetic to rival interpretations of [[Marxism]] like [[Trotskyism]]\u2014were arrested and interned in labour camps, if not executed. Both of Gorbachev's grandfathers were arrested\u2014his maternal in 1934 and his paternal in 1937\u2014and both spent time in [[Gulag]] labour camps prior to being released.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1pp=15\u201316|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=7, 8}} After his December 1938 release, Gorbachev's maternal grandfather discussed having been tortured by [[Joint State Political Directorate|the secret police]], an account that influenced the young boy.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nFollowing on from the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, in June 1941 the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] invaded the Soviet Union.

It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=312}} That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the [[Supreme Soviet]] passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=239|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=313}} Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=434\u2013435, 449\u2013450}} These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=450}}\n\nBy 1987, the ethos of glasnost had spread through Soviet society: journalists were writing increasingly openly,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} many economic problems were being publicly revealed,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=338\u2013339}} and studies appeared that critically reassessed Soviet history.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=317}} Gorbachev was broadly supportive, describing glasnost as \"the crucial, irreplaceable weapon of perestroika\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} He nevertheless insisted that people should use the newfound freedom responsibly, stating that journalists and writers should avoid \"sensationalism\" and be \"completely objective\" in their reporting.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=315}} Nearly two hundred previously restricted Soviet films were publicly released, and a range of Western films were also made available.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=151|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=341}} In 1989, Soviet responsibility  for the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was finally revealed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=131}}\n\nIn September 1987, the government stopped jamming the signal of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Voice of America]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=217|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=397}} The reforms also included greater tolerance of religion;{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=74|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} an [[Easter]] service was broadcast on Soviet television for the first time and the millennium celebrations of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were given media attention.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=290|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} Independent organisations appeared, most supportive of Gorbachev, although the largest, [[Pamyat]], was ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic in nature.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|pp=186\u2013187}} Gorbachev also announced that Soviet Jews wishing to migrate to Israel would be allowed to do so, something previously prohibited.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=195}}\n\nIn August 1987, he holidayed in [[Nizhniaia Oreanda]], Ukraine, there writing ''Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and Our World'' at the suggestion of U.S. publishers.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=246|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=319}} For the 70th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917\u2014which brought Lenin and the Communist Party to power\u2014Gorbachev produced a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\".

It criticised elements of Gorbachev's reforms, attacking what she regarded as the denigration of the Stalinist era and arguing that a reformer clique\u2014whom she implied were mostly Jews and ethnic minorities\u2014were to blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1pp=305\u2013306|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2pp=93\u201394|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=342}} Over 900 Soviet newspapers reprinted it and anti-reformists rallied around it; many reformers panicked, fearing a backlash against perestroika.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=345\u2013346}} On returning from Yugoslavia, Gorbachev called a Politburo meeting to discuss the letter, at which he confronted those hardliners supporting its sentiment.

Gorbachev (close-up).jpg|thumb|left|Gorbachev in 1987]]\n\nGorbachev's political outlook was shaped by the 23 years he served as a party official in Stavropol.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}} Doder and Branson thought that throughout most of his political career prior to becoming General Secretary, \"his publicly expressed views almost certainly reflected a politician's understanding of what should be said, rather than his personal philosophy. Otherwise he could not have survived politically.\"{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=9}} \nLike many Russians, Gorbachev sometimes thought of the Soviet Union as being largely synonymous with Russia and in various speeches described it as \"Russia\"; in one incident he had to correct himself after calling the USSR \"Russia\" while giving a speech in Kiev, Ukraine.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}}\n\nMcCauley noted that perestroika was \"an elusive concept\", one which \"evolved and eventually meant something radically different over time.\"{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=262\u2013263}} McCauley stated that the concept originally referred to \"radical reform of the economic and political system\" as part of Gorbachev's attempt to motivate the labour force and make management more effective.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} It was only after initial measures to achieve this proved unsuccessful that Gorbachev began to consider market mechanisms and co-operatives, albeit with the state sector remaining dominant.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} The political scientist John Gooding suggested that had the perestroika reforms succeeded, the Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\".{{sfn|Gooding|1990|p=195}} With perestroika, Gorbachev had wanted to improve the existing Marxist-Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying it.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=265}} In this, he brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.{{sfn|Bunce|1992|p=205}}\n\nTaubman nevertheless thought Gorbachev remained a socialist.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He described Gorbachev as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He added that \"until the end, Gorbachev reiterated his belief in socialism, insisting that it wasn't worthy of the name unless it was truly democratic.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\nAs Soviet leader, Gorbachev believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation;{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} he later referred to this as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, his thought underwent a \"radical evolution\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=386}} Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, Gorbachev had transformed into a social democrat.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=678}} McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 Gorbachev was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated himself\" from Marxism-Leninism.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=220}} After the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=259}} However, in 2006, he expressed his continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"I trusted him then and I still do\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} Taubman believed that Gorbachev identified with Lenin on a psychological level.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Gorbachev Party

Gorbachev displayed \"great tactical skill\" in manoeuvring successfully between hardline Marxist-Leninists and liberalisers for most of his time as leader, although added that he was \"much more skilled at tactical, short-term policy than strategic, long-term thinking\", in part because he was \"given to making policy on the hoof\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\nDoder and Branson

1980s.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=391}} In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=267}} For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=396}} and to build a form of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=410}} Taubman characterised Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world\u2014though neither as much as he wished.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional... as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=687}} McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism-Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something

Ideologically, he initially adhered to [[Marxism-Leninism]] although by the early 1990s had moved toward [[social democracy]].\n\nOf mixed Russian and Ukrainian heritage, Gorbachev was born in [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]] to a poor peasant family. Growing up under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], in his youth he operated [[combine harvester]]s on a [[collective farm]] before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a [[one-party state]] according to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. While studying at [[Moscow State University]], he married fellow student [[Raisa Gorbacheva|Raisa Titarenko]] in 1953 prior to receiving his law degree in 1955. Moving to [[Stavropol]], he worked for the [[Komsomol]] youth organisation and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the [[de-Stalinization]] reforms of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee in 1970, in which position he oversaw construction of the [[Great Stavropol Canal]]. In 1978 he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and in 1979 joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Within three years of the death of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], following the brief regimes of [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the Politburo elected Gorbachev as General Secretary, the ''de facto'' head of government, in 1985.\n\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and to its [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform was necessary, particularly after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He withdrew from the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] and embarked on summits with United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] to limit [[nuclear weapon]]s and end the [[Cold War]]. Domestically, his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") allowed for enhanced [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of press|press]], while his ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") sought to decentralise economic decision making to improve efficiency. His [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] measures and formation of the elected [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various [[Eastern Bloc]] countries abandoned Marxist-Leninist governance in 1989\u201390. Internally, growing [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist-Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] against Gorbachev in 1991. In the wake of this, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] against Gorbachev's wishes and he resigned. After leaving office, he launched his [[The Gorbachev Foundation|Gorbachev Foundation]], became a vocal critic of Russian Presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement.\n\nWidely considered one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century, Gorbachev remains the subject of controversy. The recipient of a wide range of awards\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014he was widely praised for his pivotal role in ending the Cold War, curtailing human rights abuses in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Marxist\u2013Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe]] and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Conversely, in Russia he is often derided for not stopping the Soviet collapse, an event which brought a decline in Russia's global influence and precipitated an economic crisis.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]], then in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1p=22|2a1=Doder|2a2=Branson|2y=1990|2p=1|3a1=McCauley|3y=1998|3p=15|4a1=Taubman|4y=2017|4p=7}} At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=10}} Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from [[Voronezh]] several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from [[Chernigov]].{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=10}}\nHis parents named him Victor, but at the insistence of his mother\u2014a devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]\u2014he had a secret [[baptism]], where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=4|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=15|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=7}} His relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=8\u20139}} His parents were poor,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=9}} and lived as peasants.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=22}} They had married as teenagers in 1928,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=16}} and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergei's father's house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=16, 17}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Gorbachev and his [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] maternal grandparents, late 1930s]]\n\nThe Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and during Gorbachev's childhood was under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]].

It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=312}} That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the [[Supreme Soviet]] passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=239|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=313}} Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=434\u2013435, 449\u2013450}} These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=450}}\n\nBy 1987, the ethos of glasnost had spread through Soviet society: journalists were writing increasingly openly,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} many economic problems were being publicly revealed,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=338\u2013339}} and studies appeared that critically reassessed Soviet history.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=317}} Gorbachev was broadly supportive, describing glasnost as \"the crucial, irreplaceable weapon of perestroika\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} He nevertheless insisted that people should use the newfound freedom responsibly, stating that journalists and writers should avoid \"sensationalism\" and be \"completely objective\" in their reporting.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=315}} Nearly two hundred previously restricted Soviet films were publicly released, and a range of Western films were also made available.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=151|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=341}} In 1989, Soviet responsibility  for the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was finally revealed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=131}}\n\nIn September 1987, the government stopped jamming the signal of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Voice of America]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=217|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=397}} The reforms also included greater tolerance of religion;{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=74|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} an [[Easter]] service was broadcast on Soviet television for the first time and the millennium celebrations of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were given media attention.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=290|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} Independent organisations appeared, most supportive of Gorbachev, although the largest, [[Pamyat]], was ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic in nature.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|pp=186\u2013187}} Gorbachev also announced that Soviet Jews wishing to migrate to Israel would be allowed to do so, something previously prohibited.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=195}}\n\nIn August 1987, he holidayed in [[Nizhniaia Oreanda]], Ukraine, there writing ''Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and Our World'' at the suggestion of U.S. publishers.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=246|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=319}} For the 70th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917\u2014which brought Lenin and the Communist Party to power\u2014Gorbachev produced a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\".

While the soviets had become largely powerless bodies that rubber-stamped Politburo policies, he wanted them to become year-round legislatures. He proposed the formation of a new institution, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]], whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=336|2a1=Steele|2y=1996|2pp=144\u2013145|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=353}} This congress would in turn elect a [[USSR Supreme Soviet]], which would do most of the legislating.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=105|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=353\u2013354}}\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 28133 Gorbachev with spouse in Poland.jpg|thumb|left|Gorbachev and his wife Raisa on a trip to Poland in 1988]]\n\nThese proposals reflected Gorbachev's desire for more democracy; however, in his view there was a major impediment in that the Soviet people had developed a \"slave psychology\" after centuries of Tsarist autocracy and Marxist-Leninist authoritarianism.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=352}} Held at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, the conference brought together 5,000 delegates and featured arguments between hardliners and liberalisers.

Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\".{{sfn|Gooding|1990|p=195}} With perestroika, Gorbachev had wanted to improve the existing Marxist-Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying it.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=265}} In this, he brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.{{sfn|Bunce|1992|p=205}}\n\nTaubman nevertheless thought Gorbachev remained a socialist.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He described Gorbachev as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He added that \"until the end, Gorbachev reiterated his belief in socialism, insisting that it wasn't worthy of the name unless it was truly democratic.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\nAs Soviet leader, Gorbachev believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation;{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} he later referred to this as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, his thought underwent a \"radical evolution\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=386}} Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, Gorbachev had transformed into a social democrat.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=678}} McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 Gorbachev was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated himself\" from Marxism-Leninism.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=220}} After the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=259}} However, in 2006, he expressed his continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"I trusted him then and I still do\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} Taubman believed that Gorbachev identified with Lenin on a psychological level.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Gorbachev Party

self-conscious\",{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=16}} noting that unlike most Russian intelligentsia, Gorbachev was not closely connected \"to the world of science, culture, the arts, or education\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=150}}  When living in Stavropol he and his wife collected hundreds of books.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=114\u2013115}} Among his favourite authors were [[Arthur

Trotsky]].{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=43}} Medvedev also considered Gorbachev \"a charismatic leader\", something Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko had not been.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=165}} Doder and Branson called him \"a charmer capable of intellectually seducing doubters, always trying to co-opt them, or at least blunt the edge of their criticism\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=287}} McCauley thought Gorbachev displayed \"great tactical skill\" in manoeuvring successfully between hardline Marxist-Leninists and liberalisers for most of his time as leader, although added that he was \"much more skilled at tactical, short-term policy than strategic, long-term thinking\", in part because he was \"given to making policy on the hoof\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\nDoder and Branson thought Gorbachev \"a Russian to the core, intensely patriotic as only people living in the border regions can be.\"{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}} \nTaubman also noted that the former Soviet leader has a \"sense of self-importance and self-righteousness\" as well as a \"need for attention and admiration\" which grated on some of his colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=134}} He was sensitive to personal criticism and easily took offense.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=161|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=134, 135}} Colleagues were often frustrated that he would leave tasks unfinished,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=117}} and sometimes also felt underappreciated and discarded by him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=273}} Biographers Doder and Branson thought that Gorbachev was \"a puritan\" with \"a proclivity for order in his personal life\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=14}} Taubman noted that he was \"capable of blowing up for calculated effect\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=516}} He also thought that by 1990, when his domestic popularity was waning, Gorbachev become \"psychologically dependent on being lionized abroad\", a trait for which he was criticised in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=541}} McCauley was of the view that \"one of his weaknesses was an inability to foresee the consequences of his actions\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=161}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nOpinions on Gorbachev are deeply divided.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=1}} Many, particularly in Western countries, see him as the greatest statesman of the second half of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=1, 539}} U.S. press referred to the presence of \"Gorbymania\" in Western countries during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as represented by large crowds that turned out to greet his visits,{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=286|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=138}} with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine naming him its \"Man of the Decade\" in the 1980s.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=391}} In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=267}} For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=396}} and to build a form of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=410}} Taubman characterised Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world\u2014though neither as much as he wished.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional... as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=687}} McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism-Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something precious, the right to think and manage their lives for themselves\", with all the uncertainty and risk that that entailed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=278\u2013279}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Gorbachev succeeded in destroying what was left of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union; he brought freedom of speech, of assembly, and of conscience to people who had never known it, except perhaps for a few chaotic months in 1917. By introducing free elections and creating parliamentary institutions, he laid the groundwork for democracy. It is more the fault of the raw material he worked with than of his own real shortcomings and mistakes that Russian democracy will take much longer to build than he thought.\n| source=\u2014 Gorbachev biographer William Taubman, 2017{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}}\n| align = left\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nGorbachev's negotiations with the U.S. helped bring an end to the Cold War and reduced the threat of nuclear conflict.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} His decision to allow the Eastern Bloc to break apart prevented significant bloodshed in Central and Eastern Europe; as Taubman noted, this meant that the \"[[Soviet Empire]]\" ended in a far more peaceful manner than the [[British Empire]] several decades before.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Similarly, under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union broke apart without falling into civil war, as happened during the breakup of Yugoslavia at the same time.{{sfnm|1a1=Bunce|1y=1992|1p=205|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=275}} McCauley noted that in facilitating the merger of East and West Germany, Gorbachev was \"a co-father of German unification\", assuring him long-term popularity among the German people.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=197}}\n\nHe also faced domestic criticism during his rule. During his career, Gorbachev attracted the admiration of some colleagues, but others came to hate him.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=134}} Across society more broadly, his inability to reverse the decline in the Soviet economy brought discontent.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=388}} Liberals thought he lacked the radicalism to really break from Marxism-Leninism and establish a free market liberal democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=416|2a1=Steele|2y=1996|2p=145}} Conversely, many of his Communist Party critics thought his reforms were reckless and threatened the survival of Soviet socialism;{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=324}} some believed he should have followed the example of China's Communist Party and restricted himself to economic rather than governmental reforms.{{sfn|Steele|1996|p=145}} Many Russians saw his emphasis on persuasion rather than force as a sign of weakness.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\n\nFor much of the Communist Party nomenklatura, the Soviet Union's dissolution was disastrous as it resulted in their loss of power.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=276}} In Russia, he is widely despised for his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic collapse.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=1}} General Varennikov, one of those who orchestrated the 1991 coup attempt against Gorbachev, for instance called him \"a renegade and traitor to your own people\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=659}} Many of his critics attacked him for allowing the Marxist-Leninist governments across Eastern Europe to fall,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=268}} and for allowing a reunited Germany to join NATO, something they deem to be contrary to Russia's national interest.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=691}}\n\nThe historian Mark Galeotti stressed the connection between Gorbachev and his predecessor, Andropov. In Galeotti's view, Andropov was \"the godfather of the Gorbachev revolution\", because\u2014as a former head of the KGB\u2014he was able to put forward the case for reform without having his loyalty to the Soviet cause questioned, an approach that Gorbachev was able to build on and follow through with.{{sfn|Galeotti|1997|p=35}} According to McCauley, Gorbachev \"set reforms in motion without understanding where they could lead.
