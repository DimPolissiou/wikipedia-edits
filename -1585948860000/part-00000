The airport is a technical base and focus city for [[Air Greenland]], the [[flag carrier]] airline of Greenland, linking the capital with several towns in western and south-western part of the country, including the airline hub at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]]. With connections to [[Iceland]], Nuuk Airport is also one of six international airports in Greenland but serves only destinations within Greenland and Iceland. International connections are made with flights to either [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport]] in Iceland or Kangerlussuaq Airport.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[seaplane]]s of the newly established Air Greenland landed in [[Nuuk Port and Harbour|Nuuk Port]]. In 1965, the airline invested in developing a more robust fleet based on the large [[Sikorsky S-61]] helicopter, which continued to serve the town for the next four decades, even after the construction of an airport in Nuuk capable of serving the [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] aircraft, which dominated at the airport since the 1970s.\n\nThe airport was constructed to serve the largest town in Greenland, yet due to space constraints at the location in a mountainous area and problems with the weather, it is unable to service large [[airliner]]s or flights reaching Denmark or other countries. In connection with events are chartered aircraft or VIP flights unable to reach Nuuk. A change to a small local aircraft (normally at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]]) is always needed. A large expansion of the airport has been controversial due to the approach near the urbanized area of the outlying districts of Nuuk, although the issue continues to be a subject of internal debate in Greenland.\n\nA new international airport is slated for completion in 2023.<ref>https://politiken.dk/indland/art7331116/Nye-lufthavne-i-Gr%C3%B8nland-bliver-realitet-i-urolig-tid</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Seaplane era===\nIn the early 1960s, after the establishment of [[Air Greenland]] on 7 November 1960 as '''Gr\u00f8nlandsfly''',<ref name=\"anni60\">{{cite web |url=http://50.airgreenland.dk/60'erne/ |title=Greenlandair 1960\u201369 |publisher=Air Greenland |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> Nuuk was served exclusively by the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]], with the aircraft using the waterways of the [[Nuuk Port and Harbour|Nuuk Port]] as a landing site.<ref name=\"anni60\"/> In 1962 a PBY Catalina crashed near the port, killing 15 people on board.<ref name=\"anni60\"/>\n\n===Helicopter era===\n[[File:Air-Greenland-sikorsky-s61n-ilulissat-airport.jpg|thumb|The [[Sikorsky S-61]]N helicopter connected Nuuk with smaller towns for more than four decades.]]\nThe tragedy was one of the factors leading to the decision to invest in a helicopter fleet.

The airport is a technical base and focus city for [[Air Greenland]], the [[flag carrier]] airline of Greenland, linking the capital with several towns in western and south-western part of the country, including the airline hub at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]]. With connections to [[Iceland]], Nuuk Airport is also one of six international airports in Greenland but serves only destinations within Greenland and Iceland. International connections are made with flights to either [[Keflav\u00edk International Airport]] in Iceland or Kangerlussuaq Airport.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[seaplane]]s of the newly established Air Greenland landed in [[Nuuk Port and Harbour|Nuuk Port]]. In 1965, the airline invested in developing a more robust fleet based on the large [[Sikorsky S-61]] helicopter, which continued to serve the town for the next four decades, even after the construction of an airport in Nuuk capable of serving the [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] aircraft, which dominated at the airport since the 1970s.\n\nThe airport was constructed to serve the largest town in Greenland, yet due to space constraints at the location in a mountainous area and problems with the weather, it is unable to service large [[airliner]]s or flights reaching Denmark or other countries.

In general the short runway is a problem for large events in Nuuk. Charter and extra flights from outside Greenland can not land in Nuuk (or any other city of Greenland), so Air Greenland need to shuttle passengers between Kangerlussuaq and Nuuk, using planes much smaller than the charter planes, often requiring a hotel night in Kangerlussuaq.<ref>[http://www.mit.gl/stor-tilfredshed-med-indsatsen-i-forbindelse-med-arctic-winter-games/ Stor tilfredshed med indsatsen i forbindelse med Arctic Winter Games] (17 March 2016, in Danish)</ref>\n\n===Runway expansion===\nNuuk airport has one asphalt runway (05/23) {{convert|950|x|30|m|abbr=on|0}} {{convert|283|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> The airport terminal and apron are built on a levelled platform on an undulating slope under the Quassussuaq mountain, with the runway platform artificially elevated to compensate for the scarp immediately to the west.

After 2010 there are no aircraft that can be purchased, which have more than 30 seats and can use short runways like Nuuk.

An often-discussed extension of the runway<ref name=\"extend\"/><ref name=\"sayno\"/> in the other direction would have brought the endpoint close to [[Qinngorput]], the newest district of Nuuk, rapidly expanding in the late 2000s. Also an expansion should not obstruct ongoing traffic since there is no other runway or airport reachable by road.\n\nSuggestions were extend it from {{convert|950|m|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|1199|m|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.knr.gl/index.php?id=183&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=45110&cHash=8379ea778c |title=Seri\u00f8se planer om at udvide lufthavnen i Nuuk |work=[[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa]] |language=Danish |date=24 May 2009|accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> to {{convert|1700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} (the longest possible) the latter which would allow direct flights to Denmark, but only with medium-size jet aircraft such as the [[Boeing 737]] or [[Airbus A320]] instead of the large [[Airbus A330]] used at present.

Set in 1985, the film revolves around six New Yorkers whose lives intersect. At its core, it is the fantastical story of Prior Walter, a gay man living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is visited by an angel. The film explores a wide variety of themes, including [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]] politics, the spreading [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|AIDS epidemic]], and a rapidly changing social and political climate.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/299769/Angels-in-America/overview Angels in America:Overview] [[The New York Times]]</ref>\n\nHBO broadcast the film in various formats: two 3-hour chunks that correspond to ''Millennium Approaches'' and ''Perestroika'', further divided into six 1-hour \"chapters\" that roughly correspond to an act or two of each of these plays; the first three chapters (\"Bad News,\" \"In Vitro,\" and \"The Messenger\") were initially broadcast on December 7, 2003, to international acclaim, with the final three chapters (\"Stop Moving!\" \"Beyond Nelly,\" and \"Heaven, I'm in Heaven\") following.\n\n''Angels in America'' was the most-watched [[Television film|made-for-cable film]] in 2003, and earned much critical acclaim and numerous accolades: at the [[56th Primetime Emmy Awards]], it became the first (and currently only) program in Emmy history to win in every major eligible category, and won all four acting categories. It also won in all five eligible categories at the [[61st Golden Globe Awards]]. In 2006, ''[[ The Seattle Times]]'' listed the series among \"Best of the filmed AIDS portrayals\" on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of [[AIDS]].<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003079432_filmaids25.html An AIDS anniversary: 25 years in the arts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622010444/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003079432_filmaids25.html |date=June 22, 2011 }} [[Seattle Times]], June 25, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===Millennium Approaches===\nIt is 1985, [[Ronald Reagan]] is in the [[White House]], and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] is causing mass death in the Americas. In [[Manhattan]], Prior Walter tells Louis, his lover of four years, that he has AIDS; Louis, unable to handle it, leaves him. As disease and loneliness ravage Prior, guilt invades Louis. Joe Pitt, a Mormon and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] attorney, is pushed by [[right-wing]] [[Wiktionary:fixer|fixer]] [[Roy Cohn]] toward a job at the [[US Department of Justice]]. Both Pitt and Cohn are in [[closeted|the closet]]: Pitt out of shame and religious turmoil, Cohn to preserve his power and image. Pitt's wife Harper is strung out on [[Diazepam|Valium]], causing her to hallucinate constantly (sometimes jointly with Prior during his fever dreams) and she longs to escape from her [[sexless marriage]]. An angel with ulterior motives commands Prior to become a prophet.\n\n===Perestroika===\nPrior is helped in his decision by Joe's mother, Hannah, and Belize, a close friend and [[drag queen]]. Joe leaves his wife and goes to live with Louis, but the relationship does not work out because of ideological differences. Roy is diagnosed with AIDS early on, and as his life comes to a close, he is haunted by the ghost of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Ethel Rosenberg]]. As the film continues, the lost souls come together to create bonds of love, loss, and loneliness and, in the end, discover forgiveness and overcome abandonment.<ref>[http://www.film4.com/reviews/2003/angels-in-america-part-one Part one] [[Film4]]</ref><ref>[http://www.film4.com/reviews/2003/angels-in-america-part-two Part two] [[Film4]].</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Roy Cohn]]\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Hannah Pitt / [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Ethel Rosenberg]] / The Rabbi / The Angel Australia\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Joe Pitt\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Harper Pitt\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Nurse Emily / Homeless woman / The Angel America\n* [[Justin Kirk]] as Prior Walter / Leatherman in park\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Mr. Lies / Norman \"Belize\" Ariaga / Homeless man / The Angel Europa \n* [[Ben Shenkman]] as Louis Ironson / The Angel Oceania\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Martin Heller\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Henry, Roy's doctor\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Prior Walter Ancestor No. 1\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Prior Walter Ancestor No. 2\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main article|Music from the HBO Film: Angels in America}}\nThe [[Music from the HBO Film: Angels in America|soundtrack]] of the series by [[Thomas Newman]] was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/thomas-newman|title=Thomas Newman|website=Grammy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308182733/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/thomas-newman|archive-date=8 March 2019|url-status=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Bethesda Fountain-vipeldo.jpg|right|140px|thumb|[[Bethesda Fountain]] at the [[Bethesda Terrace]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], where many scenes were shot]]\n[[File:Morning view under Bethesda Terrace, Central Park, NYC.jpg|120px|left|thumb|Below [[Bethesda Terrace]], Central Park, where final scene was shot]]\nCary Brokaw, [[executive producer]] of the series, worked for over ten years to bring the 1991 [[Angels in America|stage production]] to television, having first read it in 1989, before its first production. In 1993, [[Al Pacino]] committed to playing the role of [[Roy Cohn]]. In the meantime, a number of directors, including [[Robert Altman]], were part of the project. Altman worked on the project in 1993 and 1994, before budget constraints forced him to move out, as few studios could risk producing two successive 150-minute movies at the cost of $40 million. Subsequently, Kushner tried squeezing the play into a feature film, at which he eventually failed, realizing there was \"literally too much plot,\" and settling for the TV [[miniseries]] format. While Kushner continued adapting the play until the late 1990s, [[HBO Films]] stepped in as producer, allocating a budget of $60 million.<ref name=hb>{{cite book |title=The essential HBO reader|last=Edgerton|first=Gary Richard|authorlink= |author2=Jeffrey P.

Set in 1985, the film revolves around six New Yorkers whose lives intersect. At its core, it is the fantastical story of Prior Walter, a gay man living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is visited by an angel. The film explores a wide variety of themes, including [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]] politics, the spreading [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|AIDS epidemic]], and a rapidly changing social and political climate.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/299769/Angels-in-America/overview Angels in America:Overview] [[The New York Times]]</ref>\n\nHBO broadcast the film in various formats: two 3-hour chunks that correspond to ''Millennium Approaches'' and ''Perestroika'', further divided into six 1-hour \"chapters\" that roughly correspond to an act or two of each of these plays; the first three chapters (\"Bad News,\" \"In Vitro,\" and \"The Messenger\") were initially broadcast on December 7, 2003, to international acclaim, with the final three chapters (\"Stop Moving!\" \"Beyond Nelly,\" and \"Heaven, I'm in Heaven\") following.\n\n''Angels in America'' was the most-watched [[Television film|made-for-cable film]] in 2003, and earned much critical acclaim and numerous accolades: at the [[56th Primetime Emmy Awards]], it became the first (and currently only) program in Emmy history to win in every major eligible category, and won all four acting categories. It also won in all five eligible categories at the [[61st Golden Globe Awards]]. In 2006, ''[[ The Seattle Times]]'' listed the series among \"Best of the filmed AIDS portrayals\" on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of [[AIDS]].<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003079432_filmaids25.html An AIDS anniversary: 25 years in the arts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622010444/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003079432_filmaids25.html |date=June 22, 2011 }} [[Seattle Times]], June 25, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===Millennium Approaches===\nIt is 1985, [[Ronald Reagan]] is in the [[White House]], and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] is causing mass death in the Americas. In [[Manhattan]], Prior Walter tells Louis, his lover of four years, that he has AIDS; Louis, unable to handle it, leaves him. As disease and loneliness ravage Prior, guilt invades Louis. Joe Pitt, a Mormon and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] attorney, is pushed by [[right-wing]] [[Wiktionary:fixer|fixer]] [[Roy Cohn]] toward a job at the [[US Department of Justice]]. Both Pitt and Cohn are in [[closeted|the closet]]: Pitt out of shame and religious turmoil, Cohn to preserve his power and image. Pitt's wife Harper is strung out on [[Diazepam|Valium]], causing her to hallucinate constantly (sometimes jointly with Prior during his fever dreams) and she longs to escape from her [[sexless marriage]]. An angel with ulterior motives commands Prior to become a prophet.\n\n===Perestroika===\nPrior is helped in his decision by Joe\u2019s mother, Hannah, and Belize, a close friend and [[drag queen]]. Joe leaves his wife and goes to live with Louis, but the relationship does not work out because of ideological differences. Roy is diagnosed with AIDS early on, and as his life comes to a close, he is haunted by the ghost of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Ethel Rosenberg]]. As the film continues, the lost souls come together to create bonds of love, loss, and loneliness and, in the end, discover forgiveness and overcome abandonment.<ref>[http://www.film4.com/reviews/2003/angels-in-america-part-one Part one] [[Film4]]</ref><ref>[http://www.film4.com/reviews/2003/angels-in-america-part-two Part two] [[Film4]].</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Roy Cohn]]\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Hannah Pitt / [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Ethel Rosenberg]] / The Rabbi / The Angel Australia\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Joe Pitt\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Harper Pitt\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Nurse Emily / Homeless woman / The Angel America\n* [[Justin Kirk]] as Prior Walter / Leatherman in park\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Mr. Lies / Norman \"Belize\" Ariaga / Homeless man / The Angel Europa \n* [[Ben Shenkman]] as Louis Ironson / The Angel Oceania\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Martin Heller\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Henry, Roy's doctor\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Prior Walter Ancestor No. 1\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Prior Walter Ancestor No. 2\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main article|Music from the HBO Film: Angels in America}}\nThe [[Music from the HBO Film: Angels in America|soundtrack]] of the series by [[Thomas Newman]] was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/thomas-newman|title=Thomas Newman|website=Grammy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308182733/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/thomas-newman|archive-date=8 March 2019|url-status=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Bethesda Fountain-vipeldo.jpg|right|140px|thumb|[[Bethesda Fountain]] at the [[Bethesda Terrace]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], where many scenes were shot]]\n[[File:Morning view under Bethesda Terrace, Central Park, NYC.jpg|120px|left|thumb|Below [[Bethesda Terrace]], Central Park, where final scene was shot]]\nCary Brokaw, [[executive producer]] of the series, worked for over ten years to bring the 1991 [[Angels in America|stage production]] to television, having first read it in 1989, before its first production. In 1993, [[Al Pacino]] committed to playing the role of [[Roy Cohn]]. In the meantime, a number of directors, including [[Robert Altman]], were part of the project. Altman worked on the project in 1993 and 1994, before budget constraints forced him to move out, as few studios could risk producing two successive 150-minute movies at the cost of $40 million. Subsequently, Kushner tried squeezing the play into a feature film, at which he eventually failed, realizing there was \"literally too much plot,\" and settling for the TV [[miniseries]] format. While Kushner continued adapting the play until the late 1990s, [[HBO Films]] stepped in as producer, allocating a budget of $60 million.<ref name=hb>{{cite book |title=The essential HBO reader|last=Edgerton|first=Gary Richard|authorlink= |author2=Jeffrey P.

With TESS, it is possible to study the mass, size, density and orbit of a large cohort of small planets, including a sample of [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zones]] of their host stars. TESS will provide prime targets for further characterization by the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], as well as other large ground-based and space-based telescopes of the future. While previous sky surveys with ground-based telescopes have mainly detected giant exoplanets and the [[Kepler space telescope]] has mostly found planets around distant stars that are too faint for characterisation, TESS will find many small planets around the nearest stars in the sky.

The highly elliptical orbit has a {{cvt|232000|mi|km|order=flip}} [[apogee]], timed to be positioned approximately 90\u00b0 away from the position of the Moon to minimize its [[Perturbation (astronomy)|destabilizing effect]].  This orbit should remain stable for decades and will keep TESS's cameras in a stable temperature range. The orbit is entirely outside the [[Van Allen belts]] to avoid radiation damage to TESS, and most of the orbit is spent far outside the belts. Every 13.7 days at its [[perigee]] of {{cvt|67000|mi|km|order=flip}}, TESS will [[downlink]] to Earth  over a period of approximately 3 hours the data it has collected during the just finished orbit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/new-explorer-mission-chooses-the-just-right-orbit/ |title=New Explorer Mission Chooses the 'Just-Right' Orbit |publisher=NASA |first=Lori |last=Keesey |date=July 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Science objectives ===\n[[File:TESS-FirstLight20180807-Released20180917.jpg|thumb|left|200px|TESS \u2013 [[First light (astronomy)|first light]]<br>(August 7, 2018)<ref name=\"NYT-20180920\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20180917a\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20180917b\" />]] \n[[File:TESS science sector suddivision.jpg|thumb|400px|The 26 observation sectors of the sky planned for TESS]]\nTESS's two-year all-sky survey will focus on nearby [[G-type main-sequence star|G]]-, [[K-type main-sequence star|K]]-, and [[Red dwarf|M]]-[[spectral type|type]] [[star]]s with [[apparent magnitude]]s brighter than magnitude 12.<ref name=\"seager-2011\">{{cite web |url=http://seagerexoplanets.mit.edu/exoplanet.htm |title=Exoplanet Space Missions |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |first=Sara |last=Seager |date=2011 |accessdate=April 7, 2013}}</ref> Approximately 200,000 stars will be studied, including the 1,000 closest [[red dwarf]]s across the whole sky,<ref name=\"tess-nasa-faq\"/><ref name=\"skytel20130530\">{{cite news |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/exoplanets-after-kepler-whats-next/ |title=Exoplanets After Kepler: What's next? |work=[[Sky & Telescope]] |first=Mark |last=Zastrow |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref> an area 400 times larger than that covered by the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' mission.<ref name=\"tess-nasa-faq\"/> TESS is expected to discover more than 20,000 transiting exoplanets, including 500 to 1000 [[terrestrial planet|Earth-sized]] planets and [[super-Earth]]s.<ref name=\"astrobio.net\">{{cite web |url=https://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/the-astrobiology-magazine-guide-to-tess/ |title=The Astrobiology Magazine Guide to TESS |first=Keith |last=Cooper |date=April 13, 2018 |accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref> Of those discoveries, an estimated 20 could be super-Earths located in the [[habitable zone]] around a star.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2015/sept/14-super-earths |title=Super-Earths Might Be Our Best Bet For Finding Alien Life |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Adam |last=Hadhazy |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref> The stated goal of the mission is to determine the masses of at least 50 Earth-sized planets (at most 4 times earth radii).<ref>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/primary-science.html</ref>  Most detected exoplanets are expected to be between 30 and 300 light-years away. \n\nThe survey is broken up into 26 observation sectors, each sector being {{nowrap|24\u00b0 \u00d7 96\u00b0}}, with an overlap of sectors at the ecliptic poles to allow additional sensitivity toward smaller and longer-period exoplanets in that region of the celestial sphere.

TOI 1338 b is around 6.9 times larger than Earth, or between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn. It lies in a system 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Pictor. The stars in the system make an eclipsing binary, which occurs when the stellar companions circle each other in our plane of view. One is about 10% more massive than our Sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only one-third the Sun's mass. TOI 1338b's transits are irregular, between every 93 and 95 days, and vary in depth and duration thanks to the orbital motion of its stars. TESS only sees the transits crossing the larger star \u2014 the transits of the smaller star are too faint to detect. Although the planet transits irregularly, its orbit is stable for at least the next 10 million years. The orbit's angle to us, however, changes enough that the planet transit will cease after November 2023 and resume eight years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-mission-uncovers-its-1st-world-with-two-stars|title=TESS Discovers Its 1st Planet Orbiting 2 Stars|last=Reddy|first=Francis|date=January 6, 2020|website=NASA|access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ARIEL]], 2028 exoplanet atmospheres observatory\n* [[CHEOPS]], 2019 exoplanet observatory\n* [[COROT]], 2006\u20132012 exoplanet observatory\n* ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'', 2009\u20132018 exoplanet observatory\n* [[MOST (satellite)|MOST]], 2003\u20132019 asteroseismology and exoplanet observatory\n* [[PLATO (spacecraft)|PLATO]], 2026 exoplanet observatory\n* [[Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search|SWEEPS]], 2006 [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] exoplanet survey\n* [[List of transiting exoplanets]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite |journal=Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems |first1=George R. |last1=Ricker |first2=Joshua N. |last2=Winn |first3=Roland |last3=Vanderspek |first4=David W. |last4=Latham |first5=G\u00e1sp\u00e1r \u00c1. |last5=Bakos |first6=Jacob L. |last6=Bean |first7=Zachory K. |last7=Berta-Thompson |first8=Timothy M. |last8=Brown |first9=Lars |last9=Buchhave |first10=Nathaniel R. |last10=Butler |first11=R.

The highly elliptical orbit has a {{cvt|232000|mi|km|order=flip}} [[apogee]], timed to be positioned approximately 90\u00b0 away from the position of the Moon to minimize its [[Perturbation (astronomy)|destabilizing effect]].

TOI 1338 b is around 6.9 times larger than Earth, or between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn. It lies in a system 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Pictor. The stars in the system make an eclipsing binary, which occurs when the stellar companions circle each other in our plane of view. One is about 10% more massive than our Sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only one-third the Sun's mass. TOI 1338b's transits are irregular, between every 93 and 95 days, and vary in depth and duration thanks to the orbital motion of its stars. TESS only sees the transits crossing the larger star \u2014 the transits of the smaller star are too faint to detect. Although the planet transits irregularly, its orbit is stable for at least the next 10 million years. The orbit's angle to us, however, changes enough that the planet transit will cease after November 2023 and resume eight years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-mission-uncovers-its-1st-world-with-two-stars|title=TESS Discovers Its 1st Planet Orbiting 2 Stars|last=Reddy|first=Francis|date=January 6, 2020|website=NASA|access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ARIEL]], 2028 exoplanet atmospheres observatory\n* [[CHEOPS]], 2019 exoplanet observatory\n* [[COROT]], 2006\u20132012 exoplanet observatory\n* ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'', 2009\u20132018 exoplanet observatory\n* [[MOST (satellite)|MOST]], 2003\u20132019 asteroseismology and exoplanet observatory\n* [[PLATO (spacecraft)|PLATO]], 2026 exoplanet observatory\n* [[Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search|SWEEPS]], 2006 [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] exoplanet survey\n* [[List of transiting exoplanets]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite |journal=Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems |first1=George R. |last1=Ricker |first2=Joshua N. |last2=Winn |first3=Roland |last3=Vanderspek |first4=David W. |last4=Latham |first5=G\u00e1sp\u00e1r \u00c1. |last5=Bakos |first6=Jacob L. |last6=Bean |first7=Zachory K. |last7=Berta-Thompson |first8=Timothy M. |last8=Brown |first9=Lars |last9=Buchhave |first10=Nathaniel R. |last10=Butler |first11=R.
