The festival is a three-day-long celebration that combines sumptuous feasts as well as rigid fasting. Teej is celebrated by women, for the long life of her husband and long and firm relationship between them in this life and all the lives to come.\n\nThe folk music and dances add more flavor to traditional values of Teej. Women in red dance and sing in the street, going to temple in holy and fasting mood. Teej is also called Haritalika Teej. This festival is celebrated by Nepali Hindu women all across the world.\n\n===Day One===\n[[File:Queue at Pashupatinath01.JPG|thumb|Nepalese Women lined up to making offerings to Parvati and Shiva at [[Pashupatinath Temple]]]]\n\nThe first day of Teej is called ''Dar Khane Din''. On this day the women assemble at one place in their finest attire and start dancing and singing devotional songs. Amidst all this, the grand feast takes place. What is unusual about this day is that the feast is hosted by men. Women, who work hard throughout the year, do not have to do anything that day. That is the day for them to embellish themselves in ''sorha singaar'' \u2014 dressing up and using make up to the full extent, indulge in good food, and dance. Oftentimes, because women are invited by multiple brothers for the feast, they try to dance off some food before they are ready to eat more. The food served is supposed to be rich and abundant.\n\nThis is probably the only day in a year that allows women full freedom of expression. Consequently, women have traditionally used this occasion to express their pains and pang in the songs they sing while dancing. With the advancement of communication and awareness, women these days use this occasion to voice their concerns about social issues and discrimination against women. The jollity often goes on till midnight, after which the 24-hour fast starts.\n\n===Day Two===\nThe second day is the day of fasting. Some women don't eat or drink food and water while others drink liquids and eat fruit. The fasting is observed by married and unmarried women. Married women abstain strictly from food and drinks with a belief that their devotion to the gods will be blessed with longevity, peace and prosperity of their husband and family. Unmarried women observe the fast with a hope of being blessed with a good husband.\n\nThey dress gaily and visit a nearby [[Shiva]] temple singing and dancing on the way. The [[Pashupatinath Temple]] gets the highest number of devotees. At the temple, women circumambulate the [[Shiva Lingam]], which symbolizes Lord Shiva, offers the praying with flowers, sweets and coins. The main puja (religious ceremony) takes place with offerings of flowers, fruits, etc., made to Shiva and his wife goddess [[Parvati]], beseeching them to grant their blessing upon the husband and family. The important part of the puja is the oil lamp which should be alight throughout the night. It is believed that by the light of an oil lamp all night will bring peace and prosperity to the husband and family.\n\n===Day Three===\nThe third day of the festival is [[Rishi Panchami]]. After the completion of the previous day's ''puja'', women pay homage to seven saints or sages, offer prayers to deities, and bathe with red mud found on the roots of the sacred datiwan bush, along with its leaves. This act of purification is the final ritual of Teej, after which women are considered absolved from all their sins.

The food served is supposed to be rich and abundant.\n\nThis is probably the only day in a year that allows women full freedom of expression. Consequently, women have traditionally used this occasion to express their pains and pang in the songs they sing while dancing. With the advancement of communication and awareness, women these days use this occasion to voice their concerns about social issues and discrimination against women. The jollity often goes on till midnight, after which the 24-hour fast starts.\n\n===Day Two===\nThe second day is the day of fasting. Some women don't eat or drink food and water while others drink liquids and eat fruit. The fasting is observed by married and unmarried women. Married women abstain strictly from food and drinks with a belief that their devotion to the gods will be blessed with longevity, peace and prosperity of their husband and family. Unmarried women observe the fast with a hope of being blessed with a good husband.\n\nThey dress gaily and visit a nearby [[Shiva]] temple singing and dancing on the way. The [[Pashupatinath Temple]] gets the highest number of devotees. At the temple, women circumambulate the [[Shiva Lingam]], which symbolizes Lord Shiva, offers the praying with flowers, sweets and coins. The main puja (religious ceremony) takes place with offerings of flowers, fruits, etc., made to Shiva and his wife goddess [[Parvati]], beseeching them to grant their blessing upon the husband and family. The important part of the puja is the oil lamp which should be alight throughout the night. It is believed that by the light of an oil lamp all night will bring peace and prosperity to the husband and family.\n\n===Day Three===\nThe third day of the festival is [[Rishi Panchami]]. After the completion of the previous day's ''puja'', women pay homage to seven saints or sages, offer prayers to deities, and bathe with red mud found on the roots of the sacred datiwan bush, along with its leaves. This act of purification is the final ritual of Teej, after which women are considered absolved from all their sins. Recent years have witnessed an alteration in the rituals, especially concerning the severity, but its essence remains the same.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Sindh==\n[[File:Sattu prepared for Teejdi (or Teej) festival in Tharparkar, Sindh.jpg|alt=Sattu prepared for Teejdi festival in Tharparkar, Sindh|thumb|[[Sattu]] prepared for [[Teejri|Teejdi]] festival in [[Tharparkar]], [[Sindh]]]]\nThe [[Sindhi people|Sindhi community]] in India and Pakistan celebrate Teej which is known as [[Teejdi]].

James V however argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King's own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Ralph compared the captured letters with Beaton's copies, and found a discrepancy. James V thanked Sadler and his uncle [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] but would not find fault in the Cardinal's actions.<ref>Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 25-28, 42-44.</ref>\n\n===Messages to France===\nAlexander Crichton remained in the Cardinal's favour and sailed with him to France in 1540.

By now Alexander Crichton of Brunstane was receiving an English pension as a supporter of English political and Protestant religious policy in Scotland. In July 1543 Cardinal Beaton and his allies who opposed Regent Arran and pro-English iniatives camped with up to 6,000 armed men at [[Linlithgow]], where [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was kept in the [[Linlithgow Palace]]. Alexander Crichton told Ralph Sadler that the principal cause of this rebellion was to break the peace with England, the recently signed [[Treaty of Greenwich]]. This peace agreement provided that Mary, Queen of Scots would marry the English [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]] when she was of age. In his report to England, Sadler contrasted Crichton's and [[George Douglas of Pittendreich|George Douglas's]] account of the situation with the statement of the [[William Cunningham, 4th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]], that the rebel party were happy with the marriage plan and only concerned with the detail of when Mary would be sent to England.<ref>Joseph Bain, ''Hamilton Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1890), pp. 590-1.</ref>\n\nThe Governor and the Cardinal were reconciled. Crichton continued to correspond with Ralph Sadler. In November 1543, when Sadler had been forced to move from Edinburgh to [[Tantallon Castle]] and the English marriage plan was losing support in Scotland, Brunstane wrote that he was continuing to recruit supporters for English policy, and mentions John Charteris and John Sandilands of Calder. He persuaded Sandilands's neighbours to refuse offers of French payments.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol. 18 part 2 (London, 1902), nos. 425, 427, 428, 443, 434.</ref>\n\n===Plots against the Cardinal===\nAt the opening of the war of the [[Rough Wooing]] in March 1544, Brunstane met the English [[Berwick Pursuivant|Berwick Pursuivant, Henry Ray]] secretly in Edinburgh and gave him letters he had written for Henry VIII.<ref>''Letters and Papers Henry VIII'', vol.19, no. 228.</ref> In April 1544, he proposed the murder of [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]], while [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Hertford]] was planning the invasion that resulted in the [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|burning of Edinburgh]] in May. The offer was not taken up, but Brunstane was given a cipher code to use in his English letters. Brunstane employed a Scot called Wishart to take his plan for the Cardinal to Lord Hertford on 17 April 1544, who noted for Henry VIII its two objectives;[[File:Arbroath Harbour - geograph.org.uk - 137745.jpg|thumb|right|'''Alexander Crichton of Brunstane''' offered to raise Scottish troops and destroy [[Arbroath]] for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]]]<blockquote>One is, that the [[James Kirkcaldy of Grange|Larde of Grange]], late [[Treasurer of Scotland|Tresourer of Scotlande]], the [[Norman Leslie (soldier)|Master of Rothes, th'earl of Rothers eldest son]], and John Charters, wolde attempte eyther to apprehende or slee the Cardynall at some tyme when he shall passe thorough the Fyf lande, ...,<br>The other is, that in case Your Majestie would grant unto them a convenyent enterteynnment for to kepe 1,000 or 1,500 men in wages for a moneth or two, ..., they will take uppon them, at such tyme as Your Majesties armye shalbe in Scotland, to destroye the abbey and town of [[Arbroath]] ..., and t'apprehende all those whiche they say be the principall impugnators of amyte bitwen Englande and Scotlande\"<br><br>One is, that the laird of Grange, lately Treasurer of Scotland, the Master of Rothes, the earl of Rothes's eldest son, and John Charteris, would attempt either to apprehend or slay the Cardinal at some time when he shall through Fife land.<br>The other is, that in case Your Majesty would grant them a convenient entertainment (finance) for 1,000 or 1,500 men in wages, they will undertake at such time as Your Majesties army shall be in Scotland, to destroy the Abbey and town of Arbroath, and apprehend all those which they say be the principal opponents of the amity between England and Scotland<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 part 2 continued (London, 1836), p. 377, Hertford to Henry VIII.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian [[Charles Rogers (author)|Charles Rogers]] discussed the identity of Brunstane's messenger \"Wishart.\" Rogers argued that the priest and master of arts and Protestant preacher [[George Wishart]] would not simply be called \"Wishart\" in this correspondence, and suggested the messenger was a young man, John, eldest son of John Wishart of Carnbeg.<ref>Rogers, Charles (1876), pp. 311-4</ref>\n\nAccording to the report of [[Eustace Chapuys]], Brunstane tried to speak to Lord Hertford at [[Leith]] on 5 May 1544 during [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|his invasion of Edinburgh]]. One of Hertford's guards shot him in the leg with an arrow. He returned next day with papers of safe-conduct, saying he had offers from Scottish lords, but Hertford, who had orders not to negotiate with any Scot, would not see him.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spain'', vol.7 (London, 1899), no. 95, (Chapuys's reference shows that Crichton was already known to the Empire.)</ref> Hertford wrote that Crichton was in the field with Arran's forces and retreated with them to [[Linlithgow]].

Henry VIII would not directly sponsor the murder but Ralph Sadler wrote to Brunstane with the encouragement that it would be \"an acceptable service to God to take him away.\" Sadler promised Henry VIII would reward the killers. He also suggested that [[George Douglas of Pittendreich]] and the [[Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassilis]] should become involved in Brunstane's plot, although nothing was done at this time.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.20 part 1, (London, 1905), nos. 1177, 1178: ''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 (London, 1836), p.440 footnote (mentions Brunstane's cipher)</ref>\n\n===International angles===\nThe Governor of the [[Netherlands]], [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] believed that France insincerely encouraged the English marriage plan in order to gain an advantage in negotiations with England about [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u20131546)|Boulogne]] which had been captured on 13 September 1544.<ref>''CSP Spain'', vol.9 (1912), p.41.</ref> There was a third  scheme. Brunstane wrote to Sadler on 20 October 1545 requesting an urgent meeting at [[Berwick upon Tweed]]. [[George Douglas of Pittendreich]] had told him that the Lords of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] had signed an agreement for Mary, Queen of Scots to marry [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|James Hamilton]], the son of the Governor.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.20 part 2, (1907), no.622.</ref> James Hamilton, the \"Master of Hamilton,\" had been kept by the Cardinal at [[St Andrews Castle]] since October 1544.<ref>''Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8, p.319</ref> Alexander had heard that the Cardinal was trying to have the queen brought to St Andrews, but he was sceptical that the Cardinal really wanted the Hamilton marriage to proceed, and thought that Mary of Guise was pretending to be angry about the plan.<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 (London, 1836), p. 549, 6 Oct. 1545.</ref>\n\nSadler returned to London and the revelation of his wife's bigamy, and there is no record of a meeting with Brunstane at Berwick. The diplomat [[Johannes Sturm]] wrote to the English secretary of state, [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|William Paget]] on 4 December with news of discussions of the new marriage plan in France. Sturmius realised that the Hamilton marriage would disrupt the [[Treaty of Ardres|Anglo-French peace treaty negotiations]] and advised Paget they should hinder it.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol. 20 part 2 (London, 1907), no. 697, 927.</ref>\n\n===Wishart's arrest===\n[[File:GeorgeWishart2.jpg|thumb|right|'''Alexander Crichton of Brunstane''' was with the preacher '''[[George Wishart]]''' when [[Regent Arran|Arran's]] men came to arrest him.]]\nIn 1546 the preacher George Wishart stayed at the House of Brunstane.

As the factional rivalry between the Governor and Mary of Guise continued, there was controversy over who should carry Scotland's ratification to London.

Finally, Henry's Welsh diplomat [[Sir Edward Carne|Edward Carne]] was able to show the Scottish ratification to Mary of Hungary's administrator in Brussels, the President Lodewijk van Schore on 10 September. Schore pointed out its shortcomings and noted that Arran laid siege to St Andrews Castle. Mary of Hungary understood that the Empire remained at war with Scotland despite the treaty. She believed Arran's government delayed the resolution of peace with the empire because the situation prevented Henry sending military aid to the Protestants in St Andrews Castle.<ref>''Letters and Papers, Henry VIII'', vol. 21 part 2 (London, 1910), no. 75, 92.</ref>\n\n===Brunstane declares for England===\n[[File:Brunstane Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1567978.jpg|thumb|right|'''Brunstane Castle''' near [[Penicuik]]]]\nThe English Privy Council authorised payments to Brunstane in 1546, one in April for three months wages for a band of 100 horsemen, and in October granted his servant Cockburn a passport to carry satin cloth over the border for his furniture.

By now Alexander Crichton of Brunstane was receiving an English pension as a supporter of English political and Protestant religious policy in Scotland. In July 1543 Cardinal Beaton and his allies who opposed Regent Arran and pro-English iniatives camped with up to 6,000 armed men at [[Linlithgow]], where [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was kept in the [[Linlithgow Palace]]. Alexander Crichton told Ralph Sadler that the principal cause of this rebellion was to break the peace with England, the recently signed [[Treaty of Greenwich]]. This peace agreement provided that Mary, Queen of Scots would marry the English [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]] when she was of age. In his report to England, Sadler contrasted Crichton's and [[George Douglas of Pittendreich|George Douglas's]] account of the situation with the statement of the [[William Cunningham, 4th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]], that the rebel party were happy with the marriage plan and only concerned with the detail of when Mary would be sent to England.<ref>Joseph Bain, ''Hamilton Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1890), pp. 590-1.</ref>\n\nThe Governor and the Cardinal were reconciled. Crichton continued to correspond with Ralph Sadler. In November 1543, when Sadler had been forced to move from Edinburgh to [[Tantallon Castle]] and the English marriage plan was losing support in Scotland, Brunstane wrote that he was continuing to recruit supporters for English policy, and mentions John Charteris and John Sandilands of Calder. He persuaded Sandilands's neighbours to refuse offers of French payments.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol. 18 part 2 (London, 1902), nos. 425, 427, 428, 443, 434.</ref>\n\n===Plots against the Cardinal===\nAt the opening of the war of the [[Rough Wooing]] in March 1544, Brunstane met the English [[Berwick Pursuivant|Berwick Pursuivant, Henry Ray]] secretly in Edinburgh and gave him letters he had written for Henry VIII.<ref>''Letters and Papers Henry VIII'', vol.19, no. 228.</ref> In April 1544, he proposed the murder of [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]], while [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Hertford]] was planning the invasion that resulted in the [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|burning of Edinburgh]] in May. The offer was not taken up, but Brunstane was given a cipher code to use in his English letters. Brunstane employed a Scot called Wishart to take his plan for the Cardinal to Lord Hertford on 17 April 1544, who noted for Henry VIII its two objectives;[[File:Arbroath Harbour - geograph.org.uk - 137745.jpg|thumb|right|'''Alexander Crichton of Brunstane''' offered to raise Scottish troops and destroy [[Arbroath]] for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]]]<blockquote>One is, that the [[James Kirkcaldy of Grange|Larde of Grange]], late [[Treasurer of Scotland|Tresourer of Scotlande]], the [[Norman Leslie (soldier)|Master of Rothes, th'earl of Rothers eldest son]], and John Charters, wolde attempte eyther to apprehende or slee the Cardynall at some tyme when he shall passe thorough the Fyf lande, ...,<br>The other is, that in case Your Majestie would grant unto them a convenyent enterteynnment for to kepe 1,000 or 1,500 men in wages for a moneth or two, ..., they will take uppon them, at such tyme as Your Majesties armye shalbe in Scotland, to destroye the abbey and town of [[Arbroath]] ..., and t'apprehende all those whiche they say be the principall impugnators of amyte bitwen Englande and Scotlande\"<br><br>One is, that the laird of Grange, lately Treasurer of Scotland, the Master of Rothes, the earl of Rothes's eldest son, and John Charteris, would attempt either to apprehend or slay the Cardinal at some time when he shall through Fife land.<br>The other is, that in case Your Majesty would grant them a convenient entertainment (finance) for 1,000 or 1,500 men in wages, they will undertake at such time as Your Majesties army shall be in Scotland, to destroy the Abbey and town of Arbroath, and apprehend all those which they say be the principal opponents of the amity between England and Scotland<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 part 2 continued (London, 1836), p. 377, Hertford to Henry VIII.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian Charles Rogers discussed the identity of Brunstane's messenger \"Wishart.\" Rogers argued that the priest and master of arts and Protestant preacher [[George Wishart]] would not simply be called \"Wishart\" in this correspondence, and suggested the messenger was a young man, John, eldest son of John Wishart of Carnbeg.<ref>Rogers, Charles (1876), pp. 311-4</ref>\n\nAccording to the report of [[Eustace Chapuys]], Brunstane tried to speak to Lord Hertford at [[Leith]] on 5 May 1544 during [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|his invasion of Edinburgh]]. One of Hertford's guards shot him in the leg with an arrow. He returned next day with papers of safe-conduct, saying he had offers from Scottish lords, but Hertford, who had orders not to negotiate with any Scot, would not see him.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spain'', vol.7 (London, 1899), no. 95, (Chapuys's reference shows that Crichton was already known to the Empire.)</ref> Hertford wrote that Crichton was in the field with Arran's forces and retreated with them to [[Linlithgow]].

Henry VIII would not directly sponsor the murder but Ralph Sadler wrote to Brunstane with the encouragement that it would be \"an acceptable service to God to take him away.\" Sadler promised Henry VIII would reward the killers. He also suggested that [[George Douglas of Pittendreich]] and the [[Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassilis]] should become involved in Brunstane's plot, although nothing was done at this time.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.20 part 1, (London, 1905), nos. 1177, 1178: ''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 (London, 1836), p.440 footnote (mentions Brunstane's cipher)</ref>\n\n===International angles===\nThe Governor of the [[Netherlands]], [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] believed that France insincerely encouraged the English marriage plan in order to gain an advantage in negotiations with England about [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u20131546)|Boulogne]] which had been captured on 13 September 1544.<ref>''CSP Spain'', vol.9 (1912), p.41.</ref> There was a third  scheme. Brunstane wrote to Sadler on 20 October 1545 requesting an urgent meeting at [[Berwick upon Tweed]]. [[George Douglas of Pittendreich]] had told him that the Lords of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] had signed an agreement for Mary, Queen of Scots to marry [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|James Hamilton]], the son of the Governor.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.20 part 2, (1907), no.622.</ref> James Hamilton, the \"Master of Hamilton,\" had been kept by the Cardinal at [[St Andrews Castle]] since October 1544.<ref>''Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8, p.319</ref> Alexander had heard that the Cardinal was trying to have the queen brought to St Andrews, but he was sceptical that the Cardinal really wanted the Hamilton marriage to proceed, and thought that Mary of Guise was pretending to be angry about the plan.<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 (London, 1836), p. 549, 6 Oct. 1545.</ref>\n\nSadler returned to London and the revelation of his wife's bigamy, and there is no record of a meeting with Brunstane at Berwick. The diplomat [[Johannes Sturm]] wrote to the English secretary of state, [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|William Paget]] on 4 December with news of discussions of the new marriage plan in France. Sturmius realised that the Hamilton marriage would disrupt the [[Treaty of Ardres|Anglo-French peace treaty negotiations]] and advised Paget they should hinder it.<ref>''Letters & Papers, Henry VIII'', vol. 20 part 2 (London, 1907), no. 697, 927.</ref>\n\n===Wishart's arrest===\n[[File:GeorgeWishart2.jpg|thumb|right|'''Alexander Crichton of Brunstane''' was with the preacher '''[[George Wishart]]''' when [[Regent Arran|Arran's]] men came to arrest him.]]\nIn 1546 the preacher George Wishart stayed at the House of Brunstane.

As the factional rivalry between the Governor and Mary of Guise continued, there was controversy over who should carry Scotland's ratification to London. [[Adam Otterburn]] wrote to Mary of Guise with news that [[William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven|Lord Ruthven]], the secretary [[David Paniter]], and Arran's half-brother, the [[John Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews)|Abbot of Paisley]] accompanied by Alexander Crichton of Brunstane had set out, but they were recalled after a change of plan.<ref>Thomson, Thomas, ed., ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol.2 (Edinburgh, 1814), pp. 473-4: Cameron, Annie I., ed., ''Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine'' (SHS, Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 169-173.</ref>\n\nThe [[Spanish Empire]] pressed for the ratification, as Scottish captains were able to harass Flemish shipping without redress. Finally, Henry's Welsh diplomat [[Sir Edward Carne|Edward Carne]] was able to show the Scottish ratification to Mary of Hungary's administrator in Brussels, the President Lodewijk van Schore on 10 September. Schore pointed out its shortcomings and noted that Arran laid siege to St Andrews Castle. Mary of Hungary understood that the Empire remained at war with Scotland despite the treaty. She believed Arran's government delayed the resolution of peace with the empire because the situation prevented Henry sending military aid to the Protestants in St Andrews Castle.<ref>''Letters and Papers, Henry VIII'', vol. 21 part 2 (London, 1910), no. 75, 92.</ref>\n\n===Brunstane declares for England===\n[[File:Brunstane Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1567978.jpg|thumb|right|'''Brunstane Castle''' near [[Penicuik]]]]\nThe English Privy Council authorised payments to Brunstane in 1546, one in April for three months wages for a band of 100 horsemen, and in October granted his servant Cockburn a passport to carry satin cloth over the border for his furniture.

She returned full-time on 7 August 2017.\n\nLinda's storylines include her feud with [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), coming to terms with her youngest son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny]] ([[Sam Strike]]/[[Ted Reilly]]) being [[Homosexuality|gay]], being [[rape]]d by Mick's brother [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and coping in the aftermath, giving birth to a premature baby after falling down the stairs, suffering from [[bulimia nervosa]], being in denial of the possibility that her baby son [[Ollie Carter]] could have brain damage, leaving to care for her mother [[Elaine Peacock]] ([[Maria Friedman]]) following her [[stroke]], discovering that Mick kissed their daughter-in-law [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) and revealing that she has secretly battled [[cervical cancer]] before being involved in an ambulance crash when Johnny is shot, [[perverting the course of justice]] when [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) is shot leading to her being falsely accused of [[attempted murder]], coping with Ollie's diagnosis of [[autism]], battling with [[alcoholism]], shooting [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]) to pretend that he has been murdered by [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) and splitting with Mick as a result of her alcoholism.\n\n==Storylines==\nLinda first appears when her partner [[Mick Carter]]'s ([[Danny Dyer]]) sisters, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), visit her mother [[Elaine Peacock]]'s ([[Maria Friedman]]) pub in [[Watford]], where Linda and her family are living. They intend to ask Mick for a loan but Linda rejects them as Mick is not around. As revenge, Tina steals the money from a bingo jar but Shirley returns it, proving her honesty to Mick, and also recommends [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] as a potential pub of their own on [[Albert Square]] in [[Walford]], where Shirley lives. Mick purchases the pub from [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), who is at first unaware of his identity, and Mick, Linda, their son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]) and their [[bulldog]], [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] (Hot Lips), move in and start trading. Linda continues to clash with Shirley, who moves in with them, and she befriends [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) over their mutual dislike of Shirley. Linda and Mick receive an invite to their daughter [[Nancy Carter]]'s ([[Maddy Hill]]) wedding to [[Wayne Ladlow]] ([[Malachi Kirby]]), a troublemaker, but they disapprove so Mick forcibly removes her from the wedding service. In the following argument, Nancy reveals that Johnny is gay, and has been hiding his sexuality in fear of how his parents will react. Linda refuses to accept that he is gay and encourages him to date [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), who shows an interest in him. Mick, along with Shirley and Tina, visit their estranged father [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) for money, and reunite with him in the process. He moves into the pub when he breaks his ankle and becomes immobile, and, despite initially clashing with him, Linda warms to having him around.\n\nLinda's friendship with Sharon comes under strain when Sharon reveals plans to open a new bar in Walford, named \"The Albert\". Realising it will be in direct competition to The Queen Vic, she plots to get inside knowledge about the bar, convincing Johnny to take a job there. However, Johnny likes the job and tells her that he does not want to feed information to her. Linda and Mick's eldest son, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), returns from Afghanistan, where he has been serving in the army. He is grieving for a comrade he has lost, and Linda is a comfort and support to him. Shirley's estranged son [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) comes to Walford, and although he continues to share a troubled relationship with his mother, he is welcomed by Mick and Linda into the family. Dean develops feelings for Linda, which she is at first unaware of, but discovers when he gropes her buttocks at a photoshoot for his new salon. She warns him that it is inappropriate but does not tell Mick out of fear of angering him.\n\nTina encourages Johnny to embrace his sexuality, inviting him to [[gay pride]] in London. Linda continues to be uncomfortable with this, and attempts to sabotage his plans by making him work. However, he realises what she is doing and in the ensuing argument he leaves home. Stan takes Linda to his old flat where Johnny is staying, and, after some tough love from Stan about her past, she apologises to Johnny and drops him off at gay pride, giving him her blessing. The following week, Linda has a party for her birthday, and Lee returns permanently from Afghanistan in time for the celebrations. After the party, Linda and Mick have a heart to heart, and he asks her to marry him properly, but she declines, determined to keep up the pretence to their children that they are already married. This conversation is overheard by Dean, who agrees to keep quiet.\n\nLinda supports Mick when he participates in a swimming gala for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]), despite being fearful of water. Mick conquers his fears, but on the way home he is arrested for [[soliciting]] a [[prostitute]]. He tells Linda that the police are making a mistake as it was in fact his friend [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), that was speaking with the prostitute; he pulled over merely to see what was going on. Stan's girlfriend, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) overhears the conversation and accompanies Linda to Mick's hearing, and Linda is devastated when he pleads guilty to protect Ian, who is going through a tough time following the death of his daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Linda agrees to keep quiet, but Cora has a change of heart about supporting Linda and reveals Mick's offence to the whole pub, running his name through the mud. Unable to cope with the negative social stigma surrounding her family, Linda demands that Mick reveals the truth, but he refuses, wanting to keep his word to Ian. However, the truth is revealed when the prostitute, who is revealed to be Cora's estranged daughter [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]), bumps into Ian's partner [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and reveals the truth. Denise visits Linda, struggling with the revelation, and Linda lies that she only just found out about Ian's actions. Ian however reveals the truth to Denise, who accuses Linda of attention seeking. One evening, Dean kisses Linda but she slaps him. Distraught over the upset that Mick's actions have brought her family, Linda leaves Walford to stay with Elaine in Watford. She returns, reconciling with Mick, before Sharon and Phil's wedding. When Sharon suggests that Dean's advances towards Linda were encouraged, both drunk, they have a bitter row in the pub. Then Sharon tells Nancy about the kiss, so Nancy accuses Dean and Linda of having an affair.\n\nShirley flees from Walford after the wedding, leaving Dean upset. Mick asks Linda to comfort him, but, misunderstanding her reassurance and very drunk, Dean rapes her. She becomes very withdrawn, telling nobody and refusing to be intimate with Mick. Trying to get to the bottom of what is going on, he calls Linda's mother, Elaine, asking her to visit The Vic to help him understand her behaviour. Elaine makes some progress before leaving again. Mick theorises that Linda is pregnant when she vomits at the smell of lavender bath soap, and she, is horrified to discover he is correct, when she takes a test. She lies to Mick about the result and plans to have an abortion, but Mick finds out and she agrees to keep the baby. She is disturbed when Dean finds out, and tries to hang onto the belief that the baby is Mick's. [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) bumps into Linda who asks her about her relationship with Dean, Linda nearly admits that Dean raped her however she is stopped from doing so when they are interrupted by Dean. However, Stacey grows suspicious, and when Linda unexpectedly gets scared when Dean is around, Stacey surmises that Dean raped her and confronts Linda. When Stacey depicts how she felt after her rape, Linda accepts that he did. Johnny announces he is leaving Walford to travel with Gianluca, although initially upset, Linda decides to support him.\n\nLinda, feeling increasingly threatened by Dean, turns down Mick's Christmas Day proposal before stunning Mick by revealing the rape. Later that day he confronts Dean who lies, saying that he and Linda were having an affair. Mick attacks Dean forcing Shirley's revelation\u2014Dean is his brother. Linda eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells them that Dean raped Linda, but she overhears. Without saying anything, Linda leaves the pub. Mick leaves messages on her voicemail to ask her to come home and Elaine returns her to the pub. When she attempts to find solace in Sharon's home, Mick joins her, and she says they should not let what happened get in the way of their relationship. They are about to return to the pub when Mick has second thoughts and he decides to take Linda away for a break.  When they return a few weeks later, they find Shirley helping to run the pub so Mick asks her to leave. When Mick accompanies her to the police station, Linda reports Dean for rape. She then fills Nancy and Lee in on recent events, having already told Elaine and Sharon. Dean is arrested by the police but released after questioning and accuses Linda of lying. Linda proposes to Mick who accepts. The next day, Nancy confesses to her that Mick choked Dean unconscious in the cellar and is being secretive about what happened. Elaine returns for Mick and Linda's engagement party, while Linda confronts Mick, who assures her that he did not kill Dean, although, later, Nancy tries to tell Shirley something about Dean, but collapses on the ground before she can do so. After Elaine returns for Linda's five-month scan the day after, Linda confesses to her her fears that the baby may not be Mick's. Linda organises a romantic picnic as a fresh start for her and Mick. Linda is devastated to learn that Dean will not be charged due to lack of evidence. Linda pleads with Dean to admit he raped her but just as she seems to be making leeway, Mick interrupts.\n\nLinda falls down the stairs, causing her to go into premature labour. She gives birth to a healthy son, [[Ollie Carter]] (Jack Tilley). Linda confronts a delusional Dean when he insists on meeting the baby, believing that Ollie is his son. Mick discovers that he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood type, but Dean does not, meaning Dean cannot be the father. Linda and Mick agree they should marry soon. On her return home with Mick and Ollie, Linda snubs an apologetic Dean's attempt to shake her hand. When Linda and Nancy return from holiday, Linda learns that Lee has been suffering from depression, and she encourages him to take his medication. Elaine moves in temporarily, which initially causes consternation when she interferes with running the pub. Mick arranges for Linda to go to a wedding fair in Birmingham, and when she returns, she discovers that Mick and Shirley have been seeing each other in secret, which upsets Linda. After making herself sick one day, she tells Mick she cannot get married. Eventually, she tells him she hates herself and, because of Dean, she feels the same way she did when she suffered from [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] after her father died, and has been making herself sick again. However, she agrees to marry Mick with his support. When Dean attempts to rape his fianc\u00e9e [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), Linda encourages her to report this to the police. During a heated exchange with Linda where Shirley is present, Dean admits that he raped Linda. Stunned, Linda tells Mick, while Dean goes into hiding, where he sees one of Mick and Linda's wedding invites. On New Year's Day 2016, Dean goes to the wedding venue and attempts to drown Shirley, jumping into the lake with her. Mick fights with Dean in the lake and he is knocked unconscious. Mick rescues him and resuscitates him, and he is arrested for the attempted rape of Roxy.  Afterwards, Linda and Mick marry. When they return from their honeymoon, Whitney kisses Mick, saying she has feelings for him, so he tells Linda what happened. Linda tells Whitney to keep away from Mick and not to give up on Lee.\n\nNancy and Lee have an argument, which causes Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) to fall off his highchair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and when Mick insists they should get Ollie to hospital, Linda states he seems fine, but she later finds Ollie is not breathing. She successfully resuscitates him, only for him to suffer a seizure. Ollie is taken to hospital where a doctor tells the Carters that he could have brain damage after a head injury. Linda, in denial about the severity of Ollie's condition, argues with Mick, especially when he blames Nancy for the incident, however, she soon realises that Mick is right about Ollie having changed when he does not respond to her in the usual way. Linda is delighted by Johnny's (now played by [[Ted Reilly]]) return but saddened by Nancy's departure. Linda is devastated when Dean is acquitted but tells Mick she has become a strong person and that their relationship has become stronger. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a [[miscarriage]] but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. The Carters are traumatised by a violent robbery on The Queen Vic, during which Linda's favourite necklace is stolen. Linda is inspired to make Christmas great as a result, and is overjoyed when Ollie takes his first steps. Linda is devastated to learn that Elaine has had a stroke in Spain on Christmas Eve, and she flies out there with Johnny to support her mother. Later, Johnny returns to Walford while Linda relocates with Elaine to Watford to aid her mother's recovery. Mick visits Linda and informs her that Babe has caused the pub to be fined \u00a320,000 because of her selling alcohol illegally outside of licensing hours. When Mick struggles to cope with the pub's mounting debts, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to leave. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument, although they make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Linda then sends [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) to work in The Queen Vic as a bar manager. With Lady Di needing an expensive operation and mounting debts, Shirley convinces Linda to sell the freehold of The Queen Vic, and they agree not to tell Mick. Linda signs the paperwork and Shirley forges Mick's signature. Linda returns to Walford for her birthday and meets [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]), The Queen Vic's business consultant sent by the freeholder, Grafton Hill, and with the changes, she feels that The Queen Vic is not her home. She leaves again in the middle of the night, saying Elaine has fallen, but she is fine and Linda tells Elaine that she could not talk to Mick.\n\nTwo months later, Mick phones Linda, telling her to come back home or else there will be nothing to come back to. When Linda and Ollie (now played by Harry Farr) return, she is surprised when she discovers the amount of changes that have happened. When Linda discovers that Mick has been fighting in the pub, Shirley tells her that he has struggled with her prolonged absence and Linda admits that she has neglected him. When Linda is seemingly about to tell Mick about her secret, Mick admits to her that he is in love with someone else. Linda realises it is Whitney and throws her out, while Mick begs her not to give up on their marriage. Linda agrees to reconcile but is furious when Mick admits he paid Whitney off, so she slaps him. Following a conversation with Fi, Linda offers Whitney her job back but she also defies Fi by rehiring [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey]] ([[Jane Slaughter]]). After confiding in Denise about Mick's infatuation, Denise tells Linda that she saw Mick and Whitney kiss several months previously. Linda then learns that Fi nearly kissed Mick. Linda considers leaving Walford with Ollie, however, she talks to [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and reveals that Elaine's stroke was not severe and she recovered relatively quickly, but that Linda stayed away from Walford because she had been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while caring for Elaine. Jack accompanies Linda to a check-up where she is told that there are no signs of cancer in her body but there is a chance it could come back, so she is unsure if she should tell Mick, but she does so. They go on holiday to rekindle their marriage and when they return, Linda is delighted that Whitney and Woody are emigrating, but Woody leaves without Whitney, so Linda is annoyed. Mick asks Linda to renew their wedding vows and she accepts, though has doubts after seeing Mick comforting Whitney. The Carters attempt to raise money after Grafton Hill tell them they need to pay \u00a360,000 in repair costs or face eviction, though Fi tells them she has reduced it to \u00a350,000. They raise the money but Fi's father, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), reveals he now owns the business and Fi denies reducing the debt. Willmott-Brown gives an eviction notice to the Carters, giving them a month to leave. After Willmott-Brown collapses from a heart attack, Fi gives the Carters a chance to buy back the freehold for The Queen Vic for \u00a3150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. However, Mick is determined to find the money to keep the pub and signs up to participate in a robbery with [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]) and his gang on New Year's Day 2018.  Linda is distraught when Mick is shot by [[Callum \"Halfway\" Highway]] ([[Tony Clay]]), an army friend of Lee's during the robbery. However, Mick recovers with the help of Linda, Shirley, [[Mariam Ahmed]] (Indira Joshi) and a remorseful Halfway, who offers to help out at the pub. Several days later, Mick finds an expensive ring in Halfway's possession and interrogates Halfway, who admits he stole it from the robbery. Halfway gives the ring to the Carters, who then give the ring to Fi in exchange for the freehold for the pub. However, Aidan becomes suspicious of this and attempts to blackmail Mick into letting him use the pub for drug dealing. Aidan steps up his demands, repeatedly forcing him to accept money for these drug deals despite Linda returning it. The Carters decide to flee Walford to escape Aidan, who shows up and beats Mick up for not giving into his demands. However, Phil stops Aidan at the last minute and pressures him into leaving Walford or he'll reveal to the police that he killed Fi's brother [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill). Aidan calls off the drug deals, giving the Carters back control of The Queen Vic.\n\nHalfway's brother and Mick's longtime friend, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), arrives. Tina reveals that he abused her and another person [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Dylan Box|Dylan Box]] ([[Ricci Harnett]]) when they were teenagers, and she attacks him. Stuart seeks revenge on the Carters and one night, Stuart is shot in The Queen Vic. Linda initially thinks Mick shot Stuart so she dumps the gun in the canal after she finds it in the bar but she is seen by [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]). Mick tells Linda he is innocent and she worries whether she did the right thing, though Mick reassures her. The next day, Linda is arrested for Stuart's attempted murder. However, when Stuart regains consciousness, he tells the police that Mick shot him, and Mick is arrested and remanded. Linda ends their relationship when he admits he started smothering Stuart and tells Stuart she believes that Mick shot him. Linda and Stuart begin meeting regularly and become close despite the family's protests. She tells the family she thinks Mick is guilty, throws away her wedding rings, and later throws the family out, then allows Stuart to move in, and calls a solicitor to begin divorce proceedings from Mick. When Shirley breaks into the pub to confront Linda over being manipulated by Stuart, Linda calls the police and they arrest Shirley. She is released the next day and attacks Stuart. Linda takes Shirley aside and secretly shows her that she has hidden her wedding rings in her bra: her close friendship with Stuart is actually part of a bigger plan to help get Mick out of prison as she still loves Mick and believes he is innocent. Linda then attempts to seduce Stuart to record a confession from him, but he finds the  recording device. After he attempts to rape her, Linda gets him to confess that Mick did not shoot him, but he is unaware that she has a second recording device in her hair. Following this, Stuart is arrested for perverting the course of justice but is quickly released after he blames Dylan, this annoys and worries Linda that Mick might not be released, she hears a sound in the barrel stall and while investigating comes face to face with Mick.\n\nMonths later, Linda develops a [[Alcoholism|stress-induced drinking disorder]]. She is arrested after crashing into a parent's car during the school run and, failing a breathalyser test, faces a court summons, also a driving ban which she keeps secret from Mick, unfortunately she reverts back to drinking alcohol, anxious about telling him. On Christmas Eve, Linda gets drunk and insults [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) and Mick, mocking him about his [[panic attack]]s, which Ollie witnesses. Linda walks out and passes out in the gardens, being awoken by Lee, who has returned for Christmas. She spends the next day in hospital but discharges herself, in the need of a drink. Linda passes out in the back of a van and when she wakes up hungover, she finds herself at an abandoned warehouse where [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) has been ordered by [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden) to kill Keanu, in revenge for Keanu having an affair with and impregnating his stepmother, Sharon. As Ben wants evidence of Keanu's murder on a burner phone and, growing tired of Martin's uncertainty, Linda shoots Keanu in the shoulder herself. He survives and they follow Linda's plan of staging Keanu's murder, with Martin disposing of the evidence and both of them keeping quiet. Linda later invites Sharon to live with the Carters but her guilt grows, especially when Keanu's mother [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) becomes convinced that Phil has killed him, causing her to drink heavily again. On New Year's Eve, she goes to Karen's party and gets excessively drunk, leading to her almost exposing the events of Christmas Day, kicking Sharon out, flirting with [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and almost being raped by a stranger after going to his hotel room. After she phones him, Martin, turning up outside The Queen Vic, forcefully warns her in the nearby alleyway against revealing the events of Christmas Day or they are \"both dead\".\n\nMick later finds out about the hotel and confronts Linda, who claims she cannot remember anything but gets herself tested for [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]]s. Linda later gets drunk and confesses to Sharon that Keanu is still alive; she continues to taunt Martin over this, with him growing more worried that she will reveal everything. Linda's alcoholism continues to spiral out of control, resulting in her slapping Sharon and social services intervening as Ollie's schoolteachers notice him becoming extremely unhappy. After almost setting fire to the kitchen and potentially endangering Ollie with her behaviour, Shirley tries to drown Linda, who breaks down. Shirley then urges her to attend therapy for her alcoholism or face never seeing Ollie again. However, Linda continues her drinking and thinks that the family are all against her. Linda later kicks off and produces divorce papers telling Mick that their marriage is over, to his horror.\n\nAfter Linda gives a drunken speech in front of everyone at the Vic one night, humiliating Mick, he tells her he\u2019ll see her in court. The day of the boat party, which is being held to celebrate the Vic winning best pub, Linda and Shirley fight when Shirley notices Linda drinking as they prepare to leave. Shirley urges Linda to realize that she still loves Mick and that she should try to save her marriage. As they get ready to board the bus, Linda sees Mick and Whitney talking and assumes they\u2019re having an affair. Unbeknownst to her, Whitney has asked Mick for help after her accidental murder of Leo King. Linda drinks Mo\u2019s vodka on the bus en route to the boat and arrives drunk, which leads to her announcing in front of everyone that Mick and Whitney are having an affair. She later goes down to the boat\u2019s kitchen and sees a bottle of wine on a shelf, but as she climbs to reach for it the boat crash happens and she falls. Her ankle gets stuck and she gets knocked out, and later when water begins to pour in Mick arrives and hears her cries for help. Mick can\u2019t get Linda\u2019s foot out and Linda tells him to leave her and to think of their kids, but Mick says he\u2019s staying with her. As the boat fills with more water, Mick decides to break Linda\u2019s ankle to free her and he and Linda later appear in the Thames with Mick holding on to an unconscious Linda. They are rescued by Stuart and Rainie who are on a life boat, and Linda regains consciousness. Once they reach the dock with all the other passengers, Linda is devastated as she sees Dennis being declared dead by paramedics who failed to resuscitate him. Mick, Linda and Tina later arrive home to the Vic where Linda finally admits that she is an alcoholic and that she wants to get help, choosing her marriage and Mick over alcohol.\n\nThe day after the boat crash Mick tells Linda about Whitney calling him for help after her accidental murder of Leo as he is worried now that Whitney has confessed. Linda questions why he didn\u2019t call the police considering it was in self-defence. Mick later tells police he invited Whitney to the party as a distraction but doesn\u2019t reveal he knew about the murder. Linda makes a costume for Ollie for World Book Day and he wins 2nd place, delighting Linda. She also puts up a chart marking the days of being sober and gets rid of all her hidden bottles of alcohol throughout the house. While getting a coffee she runs into Sharon and offers to help her care for her newborn son.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Pink dressing gown EastEnders.jpg|thumb|Pink dressing gown costume from ''EastEnders'', said to belong to the character of Linda but usually worn by her husband [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), including for their wedding, on display at the ''EastEnders'' Meet and Greet event.]]\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nLinda was introduced as the wife of [[Mick Carter]], played by [[Danny Dyer]], the brother of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who has appeared in ''EastEnders'' since 2006.

They intend to ask Mick for a loan but Linda rejects them as Mick is not around. As revenge, Tina steals the money from a bingo jar but Shirley returns it, proving her honesty to Mick, and also recommends [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] as a potential pub of their own on [[Albert Square]] in [[Walford]], where Shirley lives. Mick purchases the pub from [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), who is at first unaware of his identity, and Mick, Linda, their son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]) and their [[bulldog]], [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] (Hot Lips), move in and start trading. Linda continues to clash with Shirley, who moves in with them, and she befriends [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) over their mutual dislike of Shirley. Linda and Mick receive an invite to their daughter [[Nancy Carter]]'s ([[Maddy Hill]]) wedding to [[Wayne Ladlow]] ([[Malachi Kirby]]), a troublemaker, but they disapprove so Mick forcibly removes her from the wedding service. In the following argument, Nancy reveals that Johnny is gay, and has been hiding his sexuality in fear of how his parents will react. Linda refuses to accept that he is gay and encourages him to date [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), who shows an interest in him. Mick, along with Shirley and Tina, visit their estranged father [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) for money, and reunite with him in the process. He moves into the pub when he breaks his ankle and becomes immobile, and, despite initially clashing with him, Linda warms to having him around.\n\nLinda's friendship with Sharon comes under strain when Sharon reveals plans to open a new bar in Walford, named \"The Albert\". Realising it will be in direct competition to The Queen Vic, she plots to get inside knowledge about the bar, convincing Johnny to take a job there. However, Johnny likes the job and tells her that he does not want to feed information to her. Linda and Mick's eldest son, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), returns from Afghanistan, where he has been serving in the army. He is grieving for a comrade he has lost, and Linda is a comfort and support to him. Shirley's estranged son [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) comes to Walford, and although he continues to share a troubled relationship with his mother, he is welcomed by Mick and Linda into the family. Dean develops feelings for Linda, which she is at first unaware of, but discovers when he gropes her buttocks at a photoshoot for his new salon. She warns him that it is inappropriate but does not tell Mick out of fear of angering him.\n\nTina encourages Johnny to embrace his sexuality, inviting him to [[gay pride]] in London. Linda continues to be uncomfortable with this, and attempts to sabotage his plans by making him work. However, he realises what she is doing and in the ensuing argument he leaves home. Stan takes Linda to his old flat where Johnny is staying, and, after some tough love from Stan about her past, she apologises to Johnny and drops him off at gay pride, giving him her blessing. The following week, Linda has a party for her birthday, and Lee returns permanently from Afghanistan in time for the celebrations. After the party, Linda and Mick have a heart to heart, and he asks her to marry him properly, but she declines, determined to keep up the pretence to their children that they are already married. This conversation is overheard by Dean, who agrees to keep quiet.\n\nLinda supports Mick when he participates in a swimming gala for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]), despite being fearful of water. Mick conquers his fears, but on the way home he is arrested for [[soliciting]] a [[prostitute]]. He tells Linda that the police are making a mistake as it was in fact his friend [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), that was speaking with the prostitute; he pulled over merely to see what was going on. Stan's girlfriend, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) overhears the conversation and accompanies Linda to Mick's hearing, and Linda is devastated when he pleads guilty to protect Ian, who is going through a tough time following the death of his daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Linda agrees to keep quiet, but Cora has a change of heart about supporting Linda and reveals Mick's offence to the whole pub, running his name through the mud. Unable to cope with the negative social stigma surrounding her family, Linda demands that Mick reveals the truth, but he refuses, wanting to keep his word to Ian. However, the truth is revealed when the prostitute, who is revealed to be Cora's estranged daughter [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]), bumps into Ian's partner [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and reveals the truth. Denise visits Linda, struggling with the revelation, and Linda lies that she only just found out about Ian's actions. Ian however reveals the truth to Denise, who accuses Linda of attention seeking. One evening, Dean kisses Linda but she slaps him. Distraught over the upset that Mick's actions have brought her family, Linda leaves Walford to stay with Elaine in Watford. She returns, reconciling with Mick, before Sharon and Phil's wedding. When Sharon suggests that Dean's advances towards Linda were encouraged, both drunk, they have a bitter row in the pub. Then Sharon tells Nancy about the kiss, so Nancy accuses Dean and Linda of having an affair.\n\nShirley flees from Walford after the wedding, leaving Dean upset. Mick asks Linda to comfort him, but, misunderstanding her reassurance and very drunk, Dean rapes her. She becomes very withdrawn, telling nobody and refusing to be intimate with Mick. Trying to get to the bottom of what is going on, he calls Linda's mother, Elaine, asking her to visit The Vic to help him understand her behaviour. Elaine makes some progress before leaving again. Mick theorises that Linda is pregnant when she vomits at the smell of lavender bath soap, and she, is horrified to discover he is correct, when she takes a test. She lies to Mick about the result and plans to have an abortion, but Mick finds out and she agrees to keep the baby. She is disturbed when Dean finds out, and tries to hang onto the belief that the baby is Mick's. [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) bumps into Linda who asks her about her relationship with Dean, Linda nearly admits that Dean raped her however she is stopped from doing so when they are interrupted by Dean. However, Stacey grows suspicious, and when Linda unexpectedly gets scared when Dean is around, Stacey surmises that Dean raped her and confronts Linda. When Stacey depicts how she felt after her rape, Linda accepts that he did. Johnny announces he is leaving Walford to travel with Gianluca, although initially upset, Linda decides to support him.\n\nLinda, feeling increasingly threatened by Dean, turns down Mick's Christmas Day proposal before stunning Mick by revealing the rape. Later that day he confronts Dean who lies, saying that he and Linda were having an affair. Mick attacks Dean forcing Shirley's revelation\u2014Dean is his brother. Linda eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells them that Dean raped Linda, but she overhears. Without saying anything, Linda leaves the pub. Mick leaves messages on her voicemail to ask her to come home and Elaine returns her to the pub. When she attempts to find solace in Sharon's home, Mick joins her, and she says they should not let what happened get in the way of their relationship. They are about to return to the pub when Mick has second thoughts and he decides to take Linda away for a break.  When they return a few weeks later, they find Shirley helping to run the pub so Mick asks her to leave. When Mick accompanies her to the police station, Linda reports Dean for rape. She then fills Nancy and Lee in on recent events, having already told Elaine and Sharon. Dean is arrested by the police but released after questioning and accuses Linda of lying. Linda proposes to Mick who accepts. The next day, Nancy confesses to her that Mick choked Dean unconscious in the cellar and is being secretive about what happened. Elaine returns for Mick and Linda's engagement party, while Linda confronts Mick, who assures her that he did not kill Dean, although, later, Nancy tries to tell Shirley something about Dean, but collapses on the ground before she can do so. After Elaine returns for Linda's five-month scan the day after, Linda confesses to her her fears that the baby may not be Mick's. Linda organises a romantic picnic as a fresh start for her and Mick. Linda is devastated to learn that Dean will not be charged due to lack of evidence. Linda pleads with Dean to admit he raped her but just as she seems to be making leeway, Mick interrupts.\n\nLinda falls down the stairs, causing her to go into premature labour. She gives birth to a healthy son, [[Ollie Carter]] (Jack Tilley). Linda confronts a delusional Dean when he insists on meeting the baby, believing that Ollie is his son. Mick discovers that he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood type, but Dean does not, meaning Dean cannot be the father. Linda and Mick agree they should marry soon. On her return home with Mick and Ollie, Linda snubs an apologetic Dean's attempt to shake her hand. When Linda and Nancy return from holiday, Linda learns that Lee has been suffering from depression, and she encourages him to take his medication. Elaine moves in temporarily, which initially causes consternation when she interferes with running the pub. Mick arranges for Linda to go to a wedding fair in Birmingham, and when she returns, she discovers that Mick and Shirley have been seeing each other in secret, which upsets Linda. After making herself sick one day, she tells Mick she cannot get married. Eventually, she tells him she hates herself and, because of Dean, she feels the same way she did when she suffered from [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] after her father died, and has been making herself sick again. However, she agrees to marry Mick with his support. When Dean attempts to rape his fianc\u00e9e [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), Linda encourages her to report this to the police. During a heated exchange with Linda where Shirley is present, Dean admits that he raped Linda. Stunned, Linda tells Mick, while Dean goes into hiding, where he sees one of Mick and Linda's wedding invites. On New Year's Day 2016, Dean goes to the wedding venue and attempts to drown Shirley, jumping into the lake with her. Mick fights with Dean in the lake and he is knocked unconscious. Mick rescues him and resuscitates him, and he is arrested for the attempted rape of Roxy.  Afterwards, Linda and Mick marry. When they return from their honeymoon, Whitney kisses Mick, saying she has feelings for him, so he tells Linda what happened. Linda tells Whitney to keep away from Mick and not to give up on Lee.\n\nNancy and Lee have an argument, which causes Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) to fall off his highchair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and when Mick insists they should get Ollie to hospital, Linda states he seems fine, but she later finds Ollie is not breathing. She successfully resuscitates him, only for him to suffer a seizure. Ollie is taken to hospital where a doctor tells the Carters that he could have brain damage after a head injury. Linda, in denial about the severity of Ollie's condition, argues with Mick, especially when he blames Nancy for the incident, however, she soon realises that Mick is right about Ollie having changed when he does not respond to her in the usual way. Linda is delighted by Johnny's (now played by [[Ted Reilly]]) return but saddened by Nancy's departure. Linda is devastated when Dean is acquitted but tells Mick she has become a strong person and that their relationship has become stronger. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a [[miscarriage]] but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. The Carters are traumatised by a violent robbery on The Queen Vic, during which Linda's favourite necklace is stolen. Linda is inspired to make Christmas great as a result, and is overjoyed when Ollie takes his first steps. Linda is devastated to learn that Elaine has had a stroke in Spain on Christmas Eve, and she flies out there with Johnny to support her mother. Later, Johnny returns to Walford while Linda relocates with Elaine to Watford to aid her mother's recovery. Mick visits Linda and informs her that Babe has caused the pub to be fined \u00a320,000 because of her selling alcohol illegally outside of licensing hours. When Mick struggles to cope with the pub's mounting debts, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to leave. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument, although they make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Linda then sends [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) to work in The Queen Vic as a bar manager. With Lady Di needing an expensive operation and mounting debts, Shirley convinces Linda to sell the freehold of The Queen Vic, and they agree not to tell Mick. Linda signs the paperwork and Shirley forges Mick's signature. Linda returns to Walford for her birthday and meets [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]), The Queen Vic's business consultant sent by the freeholder, Grafton Hill, and with the changes, she feels that The Queen Vic is not her home. She leaves again in the middle of the night, saying Elaine has fallen, but she is fine and Linda tells Elaine that she could not talk to Mick.\n\nTwo months later, Mick phones Linda, telling her to come back home or else there will be nothing to come back to. When Linda and Ollie (now played by Harry Farr) return, she is surprised when she discovers the amount of changes that have happened. When Linda discovers that Mick has been fighting in the pub, Shirley tells her that he has struggled with her prolonged absence and Linda admits that she has neglected him. When Linda is seemingly about to tell Mick about her secret, Mick admits to her that he is in love with someone else. Linda realises it is Whitney and throws her out, while Mick begs her not to give up on their marriage. Linda agrees to reconcile but is furious when Mick admits he paid Whitney off, so she slaps him. Following a conversation with Fi, Linda offers Whitney her job back but she also defies Fi by rehiring [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey]] ([[Jane Slaughter]]). After confiding in Denise about Mick's infatuation, Denise tells Linda that she saw Mick and Whitney kiss several months previously. Linda then learns that Fi nearly kissed Mick. Linda considers leaving Walford with Ollie, however, she talks to [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and reveals that Elaine's stroke was not severe and she recovered relatively quickly, but that Linda stayed away from Walford because she had been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while caring for Elaine. Jack accompanies Linda to a check-up where she is told that there are no signs of cancer in her body but there is a chance it could come back, so she is unsure if she should tell Mick, but she does so. They go on holiday to rekindle their marriage and when they return, Linda is delighted that Whitney and Woody are emigrating, but Woody leaves without Whitney, so Linda is annoyed. Mick asks Linda to renew their wedding vows and she accepts, though has doubts after seeing Mick comforting Whitney. The Carters attempt to raise money after Grafton Hill tell them they need to pay \u00a360,000 in repair costs or face eviction, though Fi tells them she has reduced it to \u00a350,000. They raise the money but Fi's father, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), reveals he now owns the business and Fi denies reducing the debt. Willmott-Brown gives an eviction notice to the Carters, giving them a month to leave. After Willmott-Brown collapses from a heart attack, Fi gives the Carters a chance to buy back the freehold for The Queen Vic for \u00a3150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. However, Mick is determined to find the money to keep the pub and signs up to participate in a robbery with [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]) and his gang on New Year's Day 2018.  Linda is distraught when Mick is shot by [[Callum \"Halfway\" Highway]] ([[Tony Clay]]), an army friend of Lee's during the robbery. However, Mick recovers with the help of Linda, Shirley, [[Mariam Ahmed]] (Indira Joshi) and a remorseful Halfway, who offers to help out at the pub. Several days later, Mick finds an expensive ring in Halfway's possession and interrogates Halfway, who admits he stole it from the robbery. Halfway gives the ring to the Carters, who then give the ring to Fi in exchange for the freehold for the pub. However, Aidan becomes suspicious of this and attempts to blackmail Mick into letting him use the pub for drug dealing. Aidan steps up his demands, repeatedly forcing him to accept money for these drug deals despite Linda returning it. The Carters decide to flee Walford to escape Aidan, who shows up and beats Mick up for not giving into his demands. However, Phil stops Aidan at the last minute and pressures him into leaving Walford or he'll reveal to the police that he killed Fi's brother [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill). Aidan calls off the drug deals, giving the Carters back control of The Queen Vic.\n\nHalfway's brother and Mick's longtime friend, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), arrives. Tina reveals that he abused her and another person [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Dylan Box|Dylan Box]] ([[Ricci Harnett]]) when they were teenagers, and she attacks him. Stuart seeks revenge on the Carters and one night, Stuart is shot in The Queen Vic. Linda initially thinks Mick shot Stuart so she dumps the gun in the canal after she finds it in the bar but she is seen by [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]). Mick tells Linda he is innocent and she worries whether she did the right thing, though Mick reassures her. The next day, Linda is arrested for Stuart's attempted murder. However, when Stuart regains consciousness, he tells the police that Mick shot him, and Mick is arrested and remanded. Linda ends their relationship when he admits he started smothering Stuart and tells Stuart she believes that Mick shot him. Linda and Stuart begin meeting regularly and become close despite the family's protests. She tells the family she thinks Mick is guilty, throws away her wedding rings, and later throws the family out, then allows Stuart to move in, and calls a solicitor to begin divorce proceedings from Mick. When Shirley breaks into the pub to confront Linda over being manipulated by Stuart, Linda calls the police and they arrest Shirley. She is released the next day and attacks Stuart. Linda takes Shirley aside and secretly shows her that she has hidden her wedding rings in her bra: her close friendship with Stuart is actually part of a bigger plan to help get Mick out of prison as she still loves Mick and believes he is innocent. Linda then attempts to seduce Stuart to record a confession from him, but he finds the  recording device. After he attempts to rape her, Linda gets him to confess that Mick did not shoot him, but he is unaware that she has a second recording device in her hair. Following this, Stuart is arrested for perverting the course of justice but is quickly released after he blames Dylan, this annoys and worries Linda that Mick might not be released, she hears a sound in the barrel stall and while investigating comes face to face with Mick.\n\nMonths later, Linda develops a [[Alcoholism|stress-induced drinking disorder]]. She is arrested after crashing into a parent's car during the school run and, failing a breathalyser test, faces a court summons, also a driving ban which she keeps secret from Mick, unfortunately she reverts back to drinking alcohol, anxious about telling him. On Christmas Eve, Linda gets drunk and insults [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) and Mick, mocking him about his [[panic attack]]s, which Ollie witnesses. Linda walks out and passes out in the gardens, being awoken by Lee, who has returned for Christmas. She spends the next day in hospital but discharges herself, in the need of a drink. Linda passes out in the back of a van and when she wakes up hungover, she finds herself at an abandoned warehouse where [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) has been ordered by [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden) to kill Keanu, in revenge for Keanu having an affair with and impregnating his stepmother, Sharon. As Ben wants evidence of Keanu's murder on a burner phone and, growing tired of Martin's uncertainty, Linda shoots Keanu in the shoulder herself. He survives and they follow Linda's plan of staging Keanu's murder, with Martin disposing of the evidence and both of them keeping quiet. Linda later invites Sharon to live with the Carters but her guilt grows, especially when Keanu's mother [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) becomes convinced that Phil has killed him, causing her to drink heavily again. On New Year's Eve, she goes to Karen's party and gets excessively drunk, leading to her almost exposing the events of Christmas Day, kicking Sharon out, flirting with [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and almost being raped by a stranger after going to his hotel room. After she phones him, Martin, turning up outside The Queen Vic, forcefully warns her in the nearby alleyway against revealing the events of Christmas Day or they are \"both dead\".\n\nMick later finds out about the hotel and confronts Linda, who claims she cannot remember anything but gets herself tested for [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]]s. Linda later gets drunk and confesses to Sharon that Keanu is still alive; she continues to taunt Martin over this, with him growing more worried that she will reveal everything. Linda's alcoholism continues to spiral out of control, resulting in her slapping Sharon and social services intervening as Ollie's schoolteachers notice him becoming extremely unhappy. After almost setting fire to the kitchen and potentially endangering Ollie with her behaviour, Shirley tries to drown Linda, who breaks down. Shirley then urges her to attend therapy for her alcoholism or face never seeing Ollie again. However, Linda continues her drinking and thinks that the family are all against her. Linda later kicks off and produces divorce papers telling Mick that their marriage is over, to his horror.\n\nAfter Linda gives a drunken speech in front of everyone at the Vic one night, humiliating Mick, he tells her he\u2019ll see her in court. The day of the boat party, which is being held to celebrate the Vic winning best pub, Linda and Shirley fight when Shirley notices Linda drinking as they prepare to leave. Shirley urges Linda to realize that she still loves Mick and that she should try to save her marriage. As they get ready to board the bus, Linda sees Mick and Whitney talking and assumes they\u2019re having an affair. Unbeknownst to her, Whitney has asked Mick for help after her accidental murder of Leo King. Linda drinks Mo\u2019s vodka on the bus en route to the boat and arrives drunk, which leads to her announcing in front of everyone that Mick and Whitney are having an affair. She later goes down to the boat\u2019s kitchen and sees a bottle of wine on a shelf, but as she climbs to reach for it the boat crash happens and she falls. Her ankle gets stuck and she gets knocked out, and later when water begins to pour in Mick arrives and hears her cries for help. Mick can\u2019t get Linda\u2019s foot out and Linda tells him to leave her and to think of their kids, but Mick says he\u2019s staying with her. As the boat fills with more water, Mick decides to break Linda\u2019s ankle to free her and he and Linda later appear in the Thames with Mick holding on to an unconscious Linda. They are rescued by Stuart and Rainie who are on a life boat, and Linda regains consciousness. Once they reach the dock with all the other passengers, Linda is devastated as she sees Dennis being declared dead by paramedics who failed to resuscitate him. Mick, Linda and Tina later arrive home to the Vic where Linda finally admits that she is an alcoholic and that she wants to get help, choosing her marriage and Mick over alcohol.\n\nThe day after the boat crash Mick tells Linda about Whitney calling him for help after her accidental murder of Leo as he is worried now that Whitney has confessed. Linda questions why he didn\u2019t call the police considering it was in self-defence. Mick later tells police he invited Whitney to the party as a distraction but doesn\u2019t reveal he knew about the murder. Linda makes a costume for Ollie for World Book Day and he wins 2nd place, delighting Linda. She also puts up a chart marking the days of being sober and gets rid of all her hidden bottles of alcohol throughout the house. While getting a coffee she runs into Sharon and offers to help her care for her newborn son.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Pink dressing gown EastEnders.jpg|thumb|Pink dressing gown costume from ''EastEnders'', said to belong to the character of Linda but usually worn by her husband [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), including for their wedding, on display at the ''EastEnders'' Meet and Greet event.]]\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nLinda was introduced as the wife of [[Mick Carter]], played by [[Danny Dyer]], the brother of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who has appeared in ''EastEnders'' since 2006.

His exposure owes  to the fact that Ermisch had oversight of the departments at Hypo-Vereinsbank (his previous employer) which engaged in cum-ex trading and the Bank is now seeking compensation from three ex-committee members in an amount of 110mm euros.  There is a chance that these ex-committee members, in turn, will make a claim against Ermisch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/cum-ex/cum-ex-steuerskandal-staatsanwaltschaft-ermittelt-gegen-ehemalige-hsh-nordbank/25103566.html|title=Cum-Ex: Steuerskandal: Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen ehemalige HSH Nordbank|website=www.handelsblatt.com|language=de|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>  The article also claims that at the time HSH's own misdeeds in relation to cum-ex trading came to light, the Hanseatic state government showed no zeal to actually investigate the bank at that time.  However, currently the Cum-ex scandal is being actively pursued by  prosecutors in the city of Cologne who are showing much more zeal in pursuing banks that engaged in the illegal stock maneuvers. It was further reported by many German newspapers that the Cologne Prosecutors Office now has over 400 individuals in its investigative sights, including two former HSH Nordbank managers.  The investigation also has many financial institutions as targets, including HCOB.  Spokespeople for HCOB say that they consider the matter resolved via their previous payments of 127mm euro.  However, it is unclear whether the Cologne Prosecutors Office will again be investigating HCOB in relation to its participation in the scandal and whether more charges and  penalties might be forthcoming.  The articles now estimate the scandal cost the German Treasury approximately 12 billion euros. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/banken/hsh-nordbank-ermittlungen-gegen-ex-manager-wegen-cum-ex-a-1291620.html|title=HSH-Nordbank: Ermittlungen gegen Ex-Manager wegen Cum-Ex|website=manager magazin|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>   \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.hcob-bank.de/en/startseite/ Hamburg Commercial Bank]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081108015824/http://hsh-nordbank.com/ HSH-Nordbank AG Home Page]\n* {{PM20|FID=co/010680|TEXT=Documents and clippings about|NAME=}}\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n\n[[Category:Banks established in 2003]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Hamburg]]\n[[Category:Landesbanks]]\n[[Category:2003 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Government-owned companies of Germany]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePrivatization, Lawsuits and the Return of the Cum-Ex Scandal  2018-2019:Typo/generalfixes, replaced: sumbit \u2192 submit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_Commercial_Bank"}

The building was officially opened on 14 March 1919 and began operating as a modern distribution centre for post, telegraphs and telephones. Following some architectural changes to the building\u2019s exterior, such as the expansion of two floors and the street and  pathway of Montalb\u00e1n, it began to house municipal offices of the [[Madrid|City of Madrid]] in 2007, moving its departments from the Case de la Villa (''House of the City'') and the Casa de Cisneros, which were both located in the Plaza de la Villa. This renovation of the building from the early twenty-first century also included a cultural area called \"CentroCentro\".\n\nThe whole complex, from a [[Spanish architecture]] stance, is one of the first examples of {{ill|Modernismo madrile\u00f1o|es|modernismo madrile\u00f1o|lt=Modernismo}}{{dubious}} and most representative, to be built in the centre of Madrid,<ref>Isla Ayuso, Bel\u00e9n (2000). \u00abPalacio de Comunicaciones: intervenci\u00f3n en una de las muestras del modernismo madrile\u00f1o\u00bb.

The Cybele Palace was the beginning of the brilliant career in construction for both architects.

Modifications were carried out in both buildings in the 1960s and were directed by [[Alejandro de la Sota]]. Antonio de Sala-Navarro and Reverter carried out further repairs and alterations between 1980 and 1992.

The royal couple, Alfonso XIII and his wife Victoria Eugenie, attended the celebration accompanied by members of the government. Their visit lasted two hours. The palace was at the time a symbol of national progress, modernity and the ideas of regenerationism that were taking root in the media and in some of the intellectuals of the age. The Palace became the hub of communications in Madrid at the beginning of the twentieth century. After just one year, the Palace became the international headquarters of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). One of the first responsibilities of the Palace was to deal with postal traffic. Palm trees were planted in the Plaza de C\u00e1novas during the 1920s.\n{{Gallery|Palacio de Comunicaciones - Fachada 01.JPG|Head of the Egyptian Goddess [[Hathor]]\n|Palacio de Comunicaciones - Fachada 02.JPG|Head of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]\n|Palacio de Comunicaciones - Fachada 03.JPG|An Aztec deity\n|title=Decoration around the windows on the main facade|width=250|align=center}}\n\nIn 1927 saw the construction of the rear half of the [[Bank of Spain]] (''Banco de Espa\u00f1a''), which is situated on Calle Alacl\u00e1, demolishing the Casas-Palacio (known as Santamarca) for its completion.

The needs of the city hall and municipal administration had outgrown their traditional seat, the Casa de la Villa and Casa de Cisneros, both of which are located in the Plaza de la Villa. \n\nTherefore the city council was relocated to the much grander but underused building on Plaza de Cibeles. The first municipal bodies, including the office of the mayor, were moved  in 2007; the city council held its first session in the palace in 2011. \n\nThe Casa de la Villa is still owned by the municipality and is used for receptions and other formal events.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1919 establishments in Spain]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1919]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural landmarks in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Former post office buildings]]\n[[Category:Paseo del Prado]]\n[[Category:City and town halls in Spain]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jer\u00f3nimos neighborhood, Madrid]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox building\n| name = Cibeles Palace\n| alternate_names = \n| status = Complete\n| image = File:Palacio de Comunicaciones - 47.jpg\n| image_size = 268x268px\n| caption = Cybele Palace, with the fountain of the same name in the foreground\n| location = [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|40.418906|-3.692084|region:ES|display=inline,title}}\n| start_date = \n| completion_date = \n| architect = [[Antonio Palacios]]<br/>Joaqu\u00edn Otamendi\n| owner = \n| cost = \n| floor_area = \n| floor_count = \n| references = \n| highest_region = \n| highest_start = \n| highest_prev = \n| highest_end = \n| highest_next = \n| architectural_style = [[Eclecticism]]<br/>Neo-Plateresque\n| architectural = [[Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural|Spanish Property of Cultural Interest]]\n| observatory = \n| elevator_count = \n| structural_engineer = \n| services_engineer = \n| main_contractor = \n| opening = \n| developer = \n| native_name = Palacio de Cibeles\n| former_names = Palacio de Comunicaciones<br/>Palacio de Telecomunicaciones\n| current_tenants = Ayuntamiento de Madrid\n| inauguration_date = 1919\n}}\n\n'''Cibeles Palace''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Palacio de Cibeles''), formally known as '''Palacio de Comunicaciones''' (''Palace of Communications'') and '''Palacio de Telecomunicaciones''' (''Palace of Telecommunications'') until 2011, is a complex composed of two buildings with white facades and is located in one of the historical centres of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

The palace was at the time a symbol of national progress, modernity and the ideas of regenerationism that were taking root in the media and in some of the intellectuals of the age. The Palace became the hub of communications in Madrid at the beginning of the twentieth century. After just one year, the Palace became the international headquarters of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). One of the first responsibilities of the Palace was to deal with postal traffic. Palm trees were planted in the Plaza de C\u00e1novas during the 1920s.\n{{Gallery|Palacio de Comunicaciones - Fachada 01.JPG|Head of the Egyptian Goddess [[Hathor]]\n|Palacio de Comunicaciones - Fachada 02.JPG|Head of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]\n|Palacio de Comunicaciones - Fachada 03.JPG|An Aztec deity\n|title=Decoration around the windows on the main facade|width=250|align=center}}\n\nIn 1927 saw the construction of the rear half of the [[Bank of Spain]] (''Banco de Espa\u00f1a''), which is situated on Calle Alacl\u00e1, demolishing the Casas-Palacio (known as Santamarca) for its completion. The Plaza de Cibeles was the main location for various political celebrations, such as the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] on 14 April 1931, when the [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|flag of the Second Republic]] was raised on the fa\u00e7ade of the Palacio de Comunicaciones.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Proclamaci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica: La fiesta popular del 14 de julio|last=Mart\u00ednez Rus|first=Ana|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Madrid|year=2002|editor-last=Madrid siglo XX|edition=primera|page=245}}</ref> The first remodelling was undertaken, adding two further floors to the management building.\n\nDespite the important location, the building did not suffer major damage from the bombings that devastated Madrid during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the [[Siege of Madrid]], the building came under gun fire. The bullet holes can still be seen today on the building's white fa\u00e7ade. The bullet holes were caused by the military-like actions at the end of the Civil War (at the beginning of March 1939), as a consequence of [[Segismundo Casado]]'s revolt against [[Juan Negr\u00edn|Juan Neger\u00edn]]'s government.<ref name=\"GCM\">{{Cite journal|last=Montero Barrado|first=Severiano|year=2001|title=Arqueolog\u00eda de la guerra civil en Madrid|journal=Historia y Comunicaci\u00f3n Social|location=Madrid|publisher=|volume=|issue=6|pages=97-122|issn=1137-0734}}</ref> The constitution of the [[National Defence Council (Spain)|National Defence Council]] placed a, artillery battery in the Plaza de Cibeles. The building was involved in a battle on 8 and 9 March when communist troops succeeded in taking the Palacio de Comunicaciones within a few hours, while Casado's troops were resisting in the Naval Office (''Ministerio de la Marina''), the War Office and the Bank of Spain. Much later it would be confirmed as the beginning of the street [[Gran V\u00eda, Madrid|Gran V\u00eda]] (''The Great Way'').<ref>Santiago Am\u00f3n, (1977), ''Programa de TV \u00abTrazos\u00bb'', recorrido por la Gran V\u00eda</ref>\n\n===Decline in its use as a postal centre and reuse===\nTelegraph services continued increasing in Spain until 1987. During this period the building underwent some restorations and a whitening of its fa\u00e7ade in 1994. Since this date, the building's use had started to decline until 2005 when it became a purely residential service; with less than five hundred users. In 1996 the architect Bel\u00e9n Isla Ayuso was in charge of the first restoration of the fa\u00e7ade.<ref name=\"BIA\">{{Cite journal|last=Isla Ayuso|first=Bel\u00e9n|year=2000|title=Palacio de Comunicaciones: intervenci\u00f3n en una de las muestras del modernismo madrile\u00f1o|journal=Restauraci\u00f3n & Rehabilitaci\u00f3n: Revista Internacional del Patrimonio Hist\u00f3rico|location=|publisher=|volume=|issue=44|pages=34-45|issn=11344571}}</ref>  \n\nThe Palacio de Comunicaciones' transformation began in 2003 after the Collaboration Protocol between the City Council of Madrid and the Treasury Department to optimise the use of certain buildings in Madrid. The needs of the city hall and municipal administration had outgrown their traditional seat, the Casa de la Villa and Casa de Cisneros, both of which are located in the Plaza de la Villa. \n\nTherefore the city council was relocated to the much grander but underused building on Plaza de Cibeles. The first municipal bodies, including the office of the mayor, were moved  in 2007; the city council held its first session in the palace in 2011. \n\nThe Casa de la Villa is still owned by the municipality and is used for receptions and other formal events.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1919 establishments in Spain]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1919]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural landmarks in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Former post office buildings]]\n[[Category:Paseo del Prado]]\n[[Category:City and town halls in Spain]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jer\u00f3nimos neighborhood, Madrid]]\n", "name_user": "Asqueladd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele_Palace"}

His father, was Joseph Moses Coplans a medical doctor and a Renaissance man of many scientific and artistic talents. His father left England for Johannesburg while John was an infant. At the age of two, John was brought to his father in South Africa; from 1924-1927 the family was in flux between London and South Africa, settling in a seaside Cape Town suburb until 1930.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=150\u2013154|edition=First}}</ref>  Despite the instability of his early home life, Coplans developed an enormous admiration for his father, who took him to galleries on the weekends and instilled within him a love for exploration, experimentation, and a fascination with the world.<ref name=Hopkinson>{{cite news|last1=Hopkinson|first1=Amanda|title=John Coplans: Prolific founder of Artforum magazine whose phorographic self-portraits challenged the taboo of ageing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/05/guardianobituaries.obituaries|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 4, 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937, John Coplans boarded a Union Castle ship and returned to England from South Africa. The eighteen-year-old Coplans was commissioned into the Royal Air Force as an Acting Pilot Officer. Due to his hearing being affected by a rugby match, two years later, he volunteered for the army.  His childhood experience living in Africa led to his appointment to the King\u2019s African Rifles in East Africa. He was active as a platoon commander (primarily in Ethiopia) until 1943, after which his unit was deployed to Burma. In 1945, after eight years serving in the army, Coplans returned to civilian life and decided to become an artist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=157\u2013158|edition=First}}</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\n\nAfter WWII, Coplans settled in London, rooming at the Abbey Art Center; he wanted to become an artist. The British government was giving grants to recent veterans of the war as the city rebuilt itself, and he received one such grant to study art. He tried both Goldsmiths and Chelsea College of the Arts, but found that art school did not suit him. He painted part-time whilst running his business John Rivers Limited.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Paul|title=Oral history interview with John Coplans, 1975 Apr. 4-1977 Aug. 4|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-john-coplans-12787|website=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref> It specialised in interior decorating and he worked for Cecil Beaton, Basil Deardon and other luminaries of the time.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Coplans began attending lectures by Lawrence Alloway at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Here he was introduced to the budding [[Pop Art]] movement, which he would become deeply involved in as both critic and curator.<ref name=Coplans159>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|page=159}}</ref> His experience viewing exhibitions such as the Hard-Edged Painting exhibition (ICA, 1959) and New American Painting (The Tate, 1959) helped to solidify his growing passion for not just Pop Art, but American art as well.<ref name=Hopkinson/>\n\nDuring this period he struggled as a young artist to find his artistic voice, and developed an abstract painting practice which reflected trends of [[tachism]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] pioneered by Americans [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]]. Coplans would later refer to this early painting work as \"derivative\"; these paintings were shown in exhibitions at the [[Royal Society of British Artists]] (1950) and later at the New Vision Center.<ref name=Coplans159/>\n\nIn 1960, Coplans sold all of his belongings and moved to the United States, initially settling in San Francisco and taking a position at UC Berkeley as a visiting assistant design professor. Here he met gallerist Phil Leider, the future editor of ''[[ArtForum]]''. Leider connected Coplans to John Irwin, who wanted to start a magazine. Coplans convinced Irwin that the West Coast needed an art publication: one that gave voice to art that was important, but had not yet received critical attention. He further suggested that it should be published in square format so that both vertical and horizontal images would be viewed equally, thus giving birth to ''ArtForum'''s iconic shape\u2014and to the successful foundation of ''ArtForum'' itself. Coplans was a regular writer for the magazine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=161\u2013162}}</ref> His perspective on art writing was anti-elitist, using popular appeal and excitement over new work to \u201cstimulate debate and awareness\u201d especially for West Coast artists.<ref name=Hopkinson/>\n\nFinding himself conflicted between his painting and writing careers, he chose the latter, devoting the next twenty years of his life to the magazine, curatorial pursuits, and a career as a museum director. It was not until 1981, at the age of 62, that he returned to his career as an artist.<ref name=Coplans166>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|page=166}}</ref>\n\n==Artistic practice==\n[[File:\"Frieze, No. 2, Four Panels, 1994\" by John Coplans.jpg|thumb|\"Frieze, No. 2, Four Panels, 1994\" by John Coplans, in the collection of [http://collection.whitney.org/object/12907 The Whitney Museum of American Art] and the [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/coplans-self-portrait-frieze-no-2-four-panels-p78534 Tate Modern].]]\nCoplans is known for his series of black and white self-portraits which are a frank study of the naked, aging body. He photographed his body from the base of his foot to the wrinkles on his hand. As he never photographed his face, his images are not focused on a specific man nor identity.\n\nIn 1980, during his one-year appointment as head of the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, Coplans first began experimenting with photography.  Here he took his initial nude photographs with a timer,<ref name=Berlind>{{cite journal|last1=Berlind|first1=Robert|title=John Coplans|journal=Art Journal|date=Spring 1994|pages=33\u201334}}</ref> but would not return to the idea until 1984, when he began a serious exploration into the self portraits with the help of an assistant.  The poses were inspired by an intuitive connection to a pre-conscious, pre-lingual awareness of the body. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happens, but when I pose for one of these photographs, I become immersed in the past...I am somewhere else, another person, or a woman in another life. At times, I\u2019m in my youth.\u201d<ref name=Coplans166/>\n\nHis technique for making the photographs involved use of Polaroid positive/negative 4x5 film, so that he could quickly see the result of the poses and make immediate adjustments. He later used a video camera connected to a television monitor to see the back of the 4x5 camera for an even more immediate mirror effect.  Although this technique deepened his control and accuracy, it is of note that he claimed to possess a sense of pre-determined clarity about the poses.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chevrier|first1=Jean-Francois|title=John Coplans Interview|journal=Academie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart: Symposium: Die Photographie in der zeitgenossischen Kunst|date=1990|pages=183\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nHis photographs ultimately question the taboo of age through the provocative and direct style of addressing his body. Said Coplans: \u201cI have the feeling that I\u2019m alive, I have a body. I\u2019m seventy years old, and generally the bodies of seventy-year old men look somewhat like my body. It's a neglected subject matter...So, I\u2019m using my body and saying, even though it's a seventy year old body, I can make it interesting. This keeps me alive and gives me vitality. It's a kind of process of energizing myself by my belief that the classical tradition of art that we\u2019ve inherited from the Greeks is a load of bullshit.\u201d<ref name=Berlind/>\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nHis major one-person exhibitions include: the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] (1981, 1989),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1988),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[Museum of Modern Art]], NY (1988),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Boymans-van Beuningan, Rotterdam (1990),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the Fundacio Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon (1990),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[Pompidou, Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges|Centre George Pompidou]], Paris (1994),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Ludwig Forum, Aachen (1995),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]], NY (1997),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Paco dasArtes, S\u00e3o Paulo (1998),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh (1999),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Malm\u00f6 Konsthall]], Sweden (1999).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Artforum==\nCoplans had a long affiliation with ''[[ArtForum]]'' as one of its founding members (1962), a contributing critic, and chief editor (1971-1976). Along with fellow founding member John Irwin he followed the magazine to Los Angeles and, in 1967, to its permanent home in New York. In June 1971, he replaced Philip Leider as chief editor (first announced on the magazine's masthead in January 1972). He subsequently presided over the magazine's tumultuous years, which saw the core editorial group of the mid- to late 1960s break apart into a handful of factions; the majority fo the group had left the magazine by the end of the 1970s. Coplans's reign at ''Artforum'' was considered a time of editorial catholicity, reflecting a moment of expanding media, practices, and modes of engagement within contemporary art. He was dismissed, along with his managing editor [[Max Kozloff]], by the magazine's publisher [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]] in December 1976.\n\n==Curator and museum director==\nFrom 1965 to 1967 Coplans was director of the Art Gallery of the University of California at Irvine. As senior curator at the Pasadena Art Museum (1967 \u2013 1970), Coplans was among the earliest champions of Pop Art and a vociferously sympathetic critic of the work of [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and especially [[Andy Warhol]]. Coplans began a series of exhibitions in a small gallery in the old Pasadena Art Museum which included West Coast artists [[Dewain Valentine]], Doug Wheeler, [[James Turrell]], Robert Irwin, [[Wayne Thiebaud]], and [[Judy Chicago]]. In many of these cases, such as with Lichtenstein, it was their crucial first exhibition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=163\u2013164|edition=First}}</ref> Many of the catalogue essays that accompanied these exhibitions were also published in ''ArtForum,'' bringing critical attention of these West Coast artists to a New York audience.\n\nIn 1968, Coplans became Acting Director of the Pasadena Art Museum and curated the \"Serial Imagery\" show. He resigned in 1970 and left California in 1971 to become the editor in chief of ''ArtForum'' in New York City. He did, however, curate another major Warhol exhibition as well as a Richard Serra show before his move to New York.\n\nHe was director of the [[Akron Art Museum]], [[Ohio]] beginning in February, 1978, and ending in December, 1979, when he left his position due to a dispute with the Museum's Board of Directors. During his leadership he brought many exhibitions to Akron from New York, helped the institution to focus on photography and art of the Nineteenth Century and thereafter. He led the Museum's efforts to raise $5 million and design a new art museum facility utiling the 1899 Post Office Building in downtown Akron. This brief period was also important as Coplans bought cameras, set up a dark room in his apartment, and actively began his photographic work, initially by mimicking photographers who he admired, such as Lee Friedlander, Jan Groover, and others. He moved back to New York City in February, 1980.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=164\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n\n=== Writings by Coplans ===\nCoplans wrote critical essays on the work of such artists as [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Philip Guston]], and [[Donald Judd]], many of which are included in his anthology entitled ''Provocations'' (1996).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=Provocations|date=1996|publisher=London Projects|location=London|isbn=1 900602 00 8|edition=First}}</ref> Many of these texts were initially writings for exhibition catalogues of exhibitions he had curated, and were in turn published in ''ArtForum''.

The eighteen-year-old Coplans was commissioned into the Royal Air Force as an Acting Pilot Officer. Due to his hearing being affected by a rugby match, two years later, he volunteered for the army.  His childhood experience living in Africa led to his appointment to the King\u2019s African Rifles in East Africa. He was active as a platoon commander (primarily in Ethiopia) until 1943, after which his unit was deployed to Burma. In 1945, after eight years serving in the army, Coplans returned to civilian life and decided to become an artist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=157\u2013158|edition=First}}</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\n\nAfter WWII, Coplans settled in London, rooming at the Abbey Art Center; he wanted to become an artist. The British government was giving grants to recent veterans of the war as the city rebuilt itself, and he received one such grant to study art. He tried both Goldsmiths and Chelsea College of the Arts, but found that art school did not suit him. He painted part-time whilst running his business John Rivers Limited.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Paul|title=Oral history interview with John Coplans, 1975 Apr. 4-1977 Aug. 4|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-john-coplans-12787|website=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref> It specialised in interior decorating and he worked for Cecil Beaton, Basil Deardon and other luminaries of the time.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Coplans began attending lectures by Lawrence Alloway at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Here he was introduced to the budding [[Pop Art]] movement, which he would become deeply involved in as both critic and curator.<ref name=Coplans159>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|page=159}}</ref> His experience viewing exhibitions such as the Hard-Edged Painting exhibition (ICA, 1959) and New American Painting (The Tate, 1959) helped to solidify his growing passion for not just Pop Art, but American art as well.<ref name=Hopkinson/>\n\nDuring this period he struggled as a young artist to find his artistic voice, and developed an abstract painting practice which reflected trends of [[tachism]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] pioneered by Americans [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]]. Coplans would later refer to this early painting work as \"derivative\"; these paintings were shown in exhibitions at the [[Royal Society of British Artists]] (1950) and later at the New Vision Center.<ref name=Coplans159/>\n\nIn 1960, Coplans sold all of his belongings and moved to the United States, initially settling in San Francisco and taking a position at UC Berkeley as a visiting assistant design professor. Here he met gallerist Phil Leider, the future editor of ''[[ArtForum]]''. Leider connected Coplans to John Irwin, who wanted to start a magazine. Coplans convinced Irwin that the West Coast needed an art publication: one that gave voice to art that was important, but had not yet received critical attention. He further suggested that it should be published in square format so that both vertical and horizontal images would be viewed equally, thus giving birth to ''ArtForum'''s iconic shape\u2014and to the successful foundation of ''ArtForum'' itself. Coplans was a regular writer for the magazine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=161\u2013162}}</ref> His perspective on art writing was anti-elitist, using popular appeal and excitement over new work to \u201cstimulate debate and awareness\u201d especially for West Coast artists.<ref name=Hopkinson/>\n\nFinding himself conflicted between his painting and writing careers, he chose the latter, devoting the next twenty years of his life to the magazine, curatorial pursuits, and a career as a museum director. It was not until 1981, at the age of 62, that he returned to his career as an artist.<ref name=Coplans166>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|page=166}}</ref>\n\n==Artistic practice==\n[[File:\"Frieze, No. 2, Four Panels, 1994\" by John Coplans.jpg|thumb|\"Frieze, No. 2, Four Panels, 1994\" by John Coplans, in the collection of [http://collection.whitney.org/object/12907 The Whitney Museum of American Art] and the [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/coplans-self-portrait-frieze-no-2-four-panels-p78534 Tate Modern].]]\nCoplans is known for his series of black and white self-portraits which are a frank study of the naked, aging body. He photographed his body from the base of his foot to the wrinkles on his hand. As he never photographed his face, his images are not focused on a specific man nor identity.\n\nIn 1980, during his one-year appointment as head of the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, Coplans first began experimenting with photography.  Here he took his initial nude photographs with a timer,<ref name=Berlind>{{cite journal|last1=Berlind|first1=Robert|title=John Coplans|journal=Art Journal|date=Spring 1994|pages=33\u201334}}</ref> but would not return to the idea until 1984, when he began a serious exploration into the self portraits with the help of an assistant.  The poses were inspired by an intuitive connection to a pre-conscious, pre-lingual awareness of the body. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happens, but when I pose for one of these photographs, I become immersed in the past...I am somewhere else, another person, or a woman in another life. At times, I\u2019m in my youth.\u201d<ref name=Coplans166/>\n\nHis technique for making the photographs involved use of Polaroid positive/negative 4x5 film, so that he could quickly see the result of the poses and make immediate adjustments. He later used a video camera connected to a television monitor to see the back of the 4x5 camera for an even more immediate mirror effect.  Although this technique deepened his control and accuracy, it is of note that he claimed to possess a sense of pre-determined clarity about the poses.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chevrier|first1=Jean-Francois|title=John Coplans Interview|journal=Academie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart: Symposium: Die Photographie in der zeitgenossischen Kunst|date=1990|pages=183\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nHis photographs ultimately question the taboo of age through the provocative and direct style of addressing his body. Said Coplans: \u201cI have the feeling that I\u2019m alive, I have a body. I\u2019m seventy years old, and generally the bodies of seventy-year old men look somewhat like my body. It's a neglected subject matter...So, I\u2019m using my body and saying, even though it's a seventy year old body, I can make it interesting. This keeps me alive and gives me vitality. It's a kind of process of energizing myself by my belief that the classical tradition of art that we\u2019ve inherited from the Greeks is a load of bullshit.\u201d<ref name=Berlind/>\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nHis major one-person exhibitions include: the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] (1981, 1989),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1988),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[Museum of Modern Art]], NY (1988),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Boymans-van Beuningan, Rotterdam (1990),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the Fundacio Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon (1990),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[Pompidou, Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges|Centre George Pompidou]], Paris (1994),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Ludwig Forum, Aachen (1995),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]], NY (1997),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Paco dasArtes, S\u00e3o Paulo (1998),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh (1999),{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Malm\u00f6 Konsthall]], Sweden (1999).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Artforum==\nCoplans had a long affiliation with ''[[ArtForum]]'' as one of its founding members (1962), a contributing critic, and chief editor (1971-1976). Along with fellow founding member John Irwin he followed the magazine to Los Angeles and, in 1967, to its permanent home in New York. In June 1971, he replaced Philip Leider as chief editor (first announced on the magazine's masthead in January 1972). He subsequently resided over the magazine's tumultuous years, which saw the core editorial group of the mid- to late 1960s break apart into a handful of factions; the majority fo the group had left the magazine by the end of the 1970s. Coplans's reign at ''Artforum'' was considered a time of editorial catholicity, reflecting a moment of expanding media, practices, and modes of engagement within contemporary art. He was dismissed, along with his managing editor [[Max Kozloff]], by the magazine's publisher [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]] in December 1976.\n\n==Curator and museum director==\nFrom 1965 to 1967 Coplans was director of the Art Gallery of the University of California at Irvine. As senior curator at the Pasadena Art Museum (1967 \u2013 1970), Coplans was among the earliest champions of Pop Art and a vociferously sympathetic critic of the work of [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and especially [[Andy Warhol]]. Coplans began a series of exhibitions in a small gallery in the old Pasadena Art Museum which included West Coast artists [[Dewain Valentine]], Doug Wheeler, [[James Turrell]], Robert Irwin, [[Wayne Thiebaud]], and [[Judy Chicago]]. In many of these cases, such as with Lichtenstein, it was their crucial first exhibition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=163\u2013164|edition=First}}</ref> Many of the catalogue essays that accompanied these exhibitions were also published in ''ArtForum,'' bringing critical attention of these West Coast artists to a New York audience.\n\nIn 1968, Coplans became Acting Director of the Pasadena Art Museum and curated the \"Serial Imagery\" show. He resigned in 1970 and left California in 1971 to become the editor in chief of ''ArtForum'' in New York City. He did, however, curate another major Warhol exhibition as well as a Richard Serra show before his move to New York.\n\nHe was director of the [[Akron Art Museum]], [[Ohio]] beginning in February, 1978, and ending in December, 1979, when he left his position due to a dispute with the Museum's Board of Directors. During his leadership he brought many exhibitions to Akron from New York, helped the institution to focus on photography and art of the Nineteenth Century and thereafter. He led the Museum's efforts to raise $5 million and design a new art museum facility utiling the 1899 Post Office Building in downtown Akron. This brief period was also important as Coplans bought cameras, set up a dark room in his apartment, and actively began his photographic work, initially by mimicking photographers who he admired, such as Lee Friedlander, Jan Groover, and others. He moved back to New York City in February, 1980.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=A Body|date=2002|publisher=powerHouse Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57687-136-3|pages=164\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n\n=== Writings by Coplans ===\nCoplans wrote critical essays on the work of such artists as [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Philip Guston]], and [[Donald Judd]], many of which are included in his anthology entitled ''Provocations'' (1996).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coplans|first1=John|title=Provocations|date=1996|publisher=London Projects|location=London|isbn=1 900602 00 8|edition=First}}</ref> Many of these texts were initially writings for exhibition catalogues of exhibitions he had curated, and were in turn published in ''ArtForum''.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F.

Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the B.Arch. degree and the B.Sc. degree in Architectural Engineering.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.
