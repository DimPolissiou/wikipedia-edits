They originally included founders ([[Jacques Cartier]], [[Samuel de Champlain]] and [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve|de Maisonneuve]]), clerics ([[Fran\u00e7ois de Laval|de Laval]], [[Jean de Br\u00e9beuf|de Br\u00e9beuf]], [[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]] and [[Jean-Jacques Olier|Olier]]), military men ([[Louis de Buade de Frontenac|de Frontenac]], [[James Wolfe|Wolfe]], [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|de Montcalm]] and [[Francis de Gaston, Chevalier de Levis|de Levis]]), Amerindians, French governors ([[Pierre de Voyer d'Argenson, Vicomte de Mouzay|D'Argenson]], [[Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy|de Tracy]], [[Louis-Hector de Calli\u00e8re|de Calli\u00e8res]], [[Charles de Montmagny|de Montmagny]], [[Louis d'Ailleboust de Coulonge|d'Aillesbout]], [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|de Vaudreuil]]) and, in the words of Tach\u00e9, \"some English governors the most sympathetic to our nationality\"<ref name = \"La devise Je me souviens\" /> ([[James Murray (Quebec governor)|Murray]], [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Dorchester]], [[George Pr\u00e9vost|Prevost]] and [[Charles Bagot|Bagot]]) and [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], who was given a special place for he was seen as an important player in obtaining \"[[responsible government]]\". Tach\u00e9 purposely left blank spaces to allow future generations to add their own statues.\n\nHis contemporaries, however, did not have any trouble interpreting its meaning. The first interpretations that can be cited are those of historian [[Thomas Chapais]] and civil servant [[Ernest Gagnon]].<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" />\n\nChapais, during a speech given for the occasion of the unveiling of a bronze statue honouring de L\u00e9vis, on June 24, 1895, said: \"the province of Quebec has a motto of which she is proud and which she likes enough to carve it on her monuments and palaces. This motto has only three words: {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}}; but these three words, in their simple economy of expression, are worth more than the most eloquent speeches. Yes, we remember. We remember the past and its lessons, the past and its misfortunes, the past and its glories.\"<ref>\"{{lang|fr|... la province de Qu\u00e9bec a une devise dont elle est fi\u00e8re et qu'elle aime \u00e0 graver au fronton de ses monuments et de ses palais.

Nous nous souvenons du pass\u00e9 et de ses le\u00e7ons, du pass\u00e9 et de ses malheurs, du pass\u00e9 et de ses gloires.}}\"</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Gagnon wrote that the motto \"admirably sums up the {{lang|fr|raison d'\u00eatre}} of Champlain and Maisonneuve's Canada as a distinct province in the confederation.\"<ref>\"{{lang|fr|r\u00e9sume admirablement la raison d'\u00eatre du Canada de Champlain et de Maisonneuve comme province distincte dans la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration}}\" - Ernest Gagnon. \"{{lang|fr|Notes sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'H\u00f4tel du gouvernement \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec}}\" in {{lang|fr|Rapport du Commissaire des Travaux publics pour l'ann\u00e9e 1895-1896}}, Documents de la session, 1896, 1, doc. 7, p. 115-116.</ref>\n\nIn 1919, seven years after Tach\u00e9's death, the historian Pierre-Georges Roy underlined the symbolic character of the three-word motto: \"which says so eloquently in three words, the past as well as the present and the future of the only French province of the confederation.\"<ref>\"{{lang|fr|qui dit si \u00e9loquemment en trois mots, le pass\u00e9 comme le pr\u00e9sent et le futur de la seule province fran\u00e7aise de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration.}}\" - Pierre-Georges Roy (1919). {{lang|fr|Les petites choses de notre histoire}}, L\u00e9vis, 1919, p. 285.</ref> This sentence would be cited or paraphrased several times afterwards.<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\"/>\n\nVarious scholars have attempted to discover the source of Tach\u00e9's words. The ethnologist [[Conrad Laforte]] has suggested that they might derive from the song {{lang|fr|Un Canadien errant}},<ref>{{lang|fr|\u00ab\u202fVa, dis \u00e0 mes amis/ Que je me souviens d'eux\u202f\u00bb}}</ref> or possibly [[Victor Hugo]]'s poem {{lang|fr|Lueur au couchant}}.<ref>{{lang|fr|\u00ab\u202fJ'entendais pr\u00e8s de moi rire les jeunes hommes/ Et les graves vieillards dire \u00ab\u202fJe me souviens\u202f\u00bb}}</ref> Writer [[Andr\u00e9 Duval]] thought the answer was simpler and closer at hand: In the hall of the Parliament building in which the motto is carved above the door, are the arms of the [[Marquess of Lorne]] whose motto was {{lang|la|ne obliviscaris}} (\"do not forget\"). Consequently, Duval believed \"the motto of Quebec to be at the same time the translation of the Marquess of Lorne's motto and the answer of a French-Canadian subject of Her Majesty to the said motto.\"<ref>{{lang|fr|\u00ab\u202fla devise du Qu\u00e9bec est \u00e0 la fois la traduction de la devise du marquis de Lorne et la r\u00e9ponse d'un sujet canadien-fran\u00e7ais de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00e0 cette m\u00eame devise\u202f\u00bb.}}</ref>\n\nResearch published in English before 1978 led to the same conclusions regarding the motto's origin, the number of words it has and its interpretation.<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\"/> A 1934 biographical notice about Tach\u00e9 reads:\n\n\"M. Tach\u00e9 is also the author of the beautiful poetic and patriotic motto which accompanies the official coat of arms of the Province of Quebec \u2014 {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}} \u2014 the full significance of which cannot perhaps be readily expressed in English words but which may be paraphrased as conveying the meaning 'We do not forget, and will never forget, our ancient lineage, traditions and memories of all the past'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEncyclopedias and quotation dictionaries, including those of Wallace, Hamilton, Colombo or Hamilton and Shields, all provide the same information as the French-language sources.<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" />\n\nIn 1955, the historian Mason Wade added his opinion by writing: \"When the French Canadian says {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}}, he not only remembers the days of New France but also the fact that he belongs to a conquered people.\"<ref>Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians'', 1760\u20131945, Toronto, 1955, p. 47.</ref>\n\n== Controversy and \"second motto\" ==\n[[File:1983 Qu\u00e9bec license plate GBR 822.jpg|thumb|200px|Since 1978, the Quebec [[licence plate]] has featured the phrase \"Je me souviens\"]]\nIn 1978, {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}} replaced the tourist-oriented motto {{lang|fr|La belle province}} on [[Vehicle registration plates of Quebec|Quebec's vehicle registration plate]]. According to the historian Gaston Desch\u00eanes, this event marks the start of a new period of attempts to reinterpret the meaning of the motto in the mainstream media of Canada.\n\nOn February 4, 1978, Robert Goyette signed an article entitled \"Car owners argue over motto\" in ''[[The Montreal Star]]''. This article attracted the attention of a reader, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne P\u00e2quet, a granddaughter of Tach\u00e9 who replied on February 15 in an open letter entitled \"{{lang|fr|Je me souviens}}. It reads in part:\n\n{{quote|\nAccording to [Goyette's] article, there is confusion about the Quebec motto. As you mentioned, it was written by E. E. Tach\u00e9. \"Je me souviens\" is only the first line, which may be the cause of the confusion. It goes like this:\n\n''Je me souviens/ Que n\u00e9 sous le lys/ Je cro\u00ees sous la rose.''\n\nI remember/ That born under the lily/ I grow under the rose.}}\n\nThe lily refers to [[England]] while the rose refers to [[France]], both relating to the [[floral emblem]]s of the nations. The idea that the motto had a lesser known second part spread widely. This new piece of information had a long life in the media before it was investigated by Desch\u00eanes in 1992.\n\nWhen Desch\u00eanes contacted H\u00e9l\u00e8ne P\u00e2quet in 1992, she was unable to specify the origin of text she quoted in her letter. Her statements were not conformable to those of her father, Lieutenant-Colonel \u00c9tienne-Th\u00e9odore P\u00e2quet Jr.,<ref>Son of [[\u00c9tienne-Th\u00e9odore P\u00e2quet]], a provincial MLA.</ref> who on March 3, 1939, wrote in a letter to [[John Samuel Bourque]], T\u00e2ch\u00e9's son-in-law, and Minister of Public Works, that \"the one who synthesized in three words the history and traditions of our race deserves to be recognized\"<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" /> as much as [[Adolphe-Basile Routhier|Routhier]] and [[Calixa Lavall\u00e9e|Lavall\u00e9e]] who composed the \"[[O Canada]]\".\n\nThe origin of the second part is today known to be a ''second motto'', created by the same Eug\u00e8ne-\u00c9tienne Tach\u00e9, many years after the first one, and originally destined to be used on a monument honouring the ''Canadian nation'', but which was never built. The monument was to be a statue of a young and graceful adolescent girl, an allegoric figure of the Canadian nation, bearing the motto: \"N\u00e9e dans les lis, je grandis dans les roses / Born in the lilies, I grow in the roses\".<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" /> While the project was never realized, the idea was \"recycled\" in a commemorative medal for the 300th anniversary of the foundation of [[Quebec City]], created by Tach\u00e9, on which is written {{lang|fr|\"N\u00e9e sous les lis, Dieu aidant, l'\u0153uvre de Champlain a grandi sous les roses\"}} (\"Born under the lilies, God helping, Champlain's work has grown under the roses\").<ref>{{lang|fr|Les f\u00eates du troisi\u00e8me centenaire de Qu\u00e9bec}}, 1608-1908, Qu\u00e9bec, 1911, p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Other uses ==\n{{lang|fr|Je me souviens}} is also the motto of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]], a [[Francophone]] [[regiment]] of the [[Canadian Forces]].<ref>[http://www.r22er.com/pages/heritage/traditions_et_coutumes/les_insignes_regimentaire.htm Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment Traditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708010528/http://www.r22er.com/pages/heritage/traditions_et_coutumes/les_insignes_regimentaire.htm |date=2009-07-08 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{lang|fr|[[Je me souviens (film)|Je me souviens]]}}, documentary film\n* [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols]]\n* {{lang|fr|[[Un Canadien errant]]}}, 1842 song by Antoine G\u00e9rin-Lajoie that includes {{lang|fr|Va, dis \u00e0 mes amis que je me souviens d'eux.}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n; English\n* Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20091117091612/http://www.historywire.ca/en/article/19731 Je me souviens]\", in ''HistoryWire'', March 26, 2009\n* Deschenes, Gaston. \"Gaston Deschenes on the motto mystery: deciphering the true meaning of Quebec's famous slogan, Je me souviens\", in ''The Beaver: Exploring Canada's History'', February 1, 2008 [https://web.archive.org/web/20121105104030/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-177057159.html?key=01-42160D517E19136E130F051E03674B2E224E324D3417295C30420B61651B617F137019731B7B1D6B39 excerpt]\n\n; French\n* Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"[http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/fr/article-518/La_devise_qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9coise_%C2%ABJe_me_souviens%C2%BB.html La devise qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise \u00ab\u202fJe me souviens\u202f\u00bb]\", in {{lang|fr|L'Encyclop\u00e9die du patrimoine culturel de l'Am\u00e9rique fran\u00e7aise}}, February 1, 2011\n* Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"[http://agora.qc.ca/reftext.nsf/Documents/Quebec_-_Etat--La_devise_Je_me_souviens_par_Gaston_Deschenes La devise \u00ab\u202fJe me souviens\u202f\u00bb]\", in {{lang|fr|L'Encyclop\u00e9die de l'Agora}}, online since September 14, 2001, updated on May 20, 2006\n* Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec. \"[http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/devise/devise.html La devise du Qu\u00e9bec]\", in the site {{lang|fr|Drapeau et symboles nationaux}} of the Government of Quebec, updated January 14, 2008\n* Albert, Madeleine and Gaston Desch\u00eanes. \"Une devise centenaire : Je me souviens\", in {{lang|fr|Bulletin de la Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale}}, 14, 2 (April 1984), p.&nbsp;21-30.

Tach\u00e9 purposely left blank spaces to allow future generations to add their own statues.\n\nHis contemporaries, however, did not have any trouble interpreting its meaning. The first interpretations that can be cited are those of historian [[Thomas Chapais]] and civil servant [[Ernest Gagnon]].<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" />\n\nChapais, during a speech given for the occasion of the unveiling of a bronze statue honouring de L\u00e9vis, on June 24, 1895, said: \"the province of Quebec has a motto of which she is proud and which she likes enough to carve it on her monuments and palaces. This motto has only three words: {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}}; but these three words, in their simple economy of expression, are worth more than the most eloquent speeches. Yes, we remember. We remember the past and its lessons, the past and its misfortunes, the past and its glories.\"<ref>\"{{lang|fr|... la province de Qu\u00e9bec a une devise dont elle est fi\u00e8re et qu'elle aime \u00e0 graver au fronton de ses monuments et de ses palais.

Nous nous souvenons du pass\u00e9 et de ses le\u00e7ons, du pass\u00e9 et de ses malheurs, du pass\u00e9 et de ses gloires.}}\"</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Gagnon wrote that the motto \"admirably sums up the {{lang|fr|raison d'\u00eatre}} of Champlain and Maisonneuve's Canada as a distinct province in the confederation.\"<ref>\"{{lang|fr|r\u00e9sume admirablement la raison d'\u00eatre du Canada de Champlain et de Maisonneuve comme province distincte dans la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration}}\" - Ernest Gagnon. \"{{lang|fr|Notes sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'H\u00f4tel du gouvernement \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec}}\" in {{lang|fr|Rapport du Commissaire des Travaux publics pour l'ann\u00e9e 1895-1896}}, Documents de la session, 1896, 1, doc. 7, p. 115-116.</ref>\n\nIn 1919, seven years after Tach\u00e9's death, the historian Pierre-Georges Roy underlined the symbolic character of the three-word motto: \"which says so eloquently in three words, the past as well as the present and the future of the only French province of the confederation.\"<ref>\"{{lang|fr|qui dit si \u00e9loquemment en trois mots, le pass\u00e9 comme le pr\u00e9sent et le futur de la seule province fran\u00e7aise de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration.}}\" - Pierre-Georges Roy (1919). {{lang|fr|Les petites choses de notre histoire}}, L\u00e9vis, 1919, p. 285.</ref> This sentence would be cited or paraphrased several times afterwards.<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\"/>\n\nVarious scholars have attempted to discover the source of Tach\u00e9's words. The ethnologist [[Conrad Laforte]] has suggested that they might derive from the song {{lang|fr|Un Canadien errant}},<ref>{{lang|fr|\u00ab\u202fVa, dis \u00e0 mes amis/ Que je me souviens d'eux\u202f\u00bb}}</ref> or possibly [[Victor Hugo]]'s poem {{lang|fr|Lueur au couchant}}.<ref>{{lang|fr|\u00ab\u202fJ'entendais pr\u00e8s de moi rire les jeunes hommes/ Et les graves vieillards dire \u00ab\u202fJe me souviens\u202f\u00bb}}</ref> Writer [[Andr\u00e9 Duval]] thought the answer was simpler and closer at hand: In the hall of the Parliament building in which the motto is carved above the door, are the arms of the [[Marquess of Lorne]] whose motto was {{lang|la|ne obliviscaris}} (\"do not forget\"). Consequently, Duval believed \"the motto of Quebec to be at the same time the translation of the Marquess of Lorne's motto and the answer of a French-Canadian subject of Her Majesty to the said motto.\"<ref>{{lang|fr|\u00ab\u202fla devise du Qu\u00e9bec est \u00e0 la fois la traduction de la devise du marquis de Lorne et la r\u00e9ponse d'un sujet canadien-fran\u00e7ais de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00e0 cette m\u00eame devise\u202f\u00bb.}}</ref>\n\nResearch published in English before 1978 led to the same conclusions regarding the motto's origin, the number of words it has and its interpretation.<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\"/> A 1934 biographical notice about Tach\u00e9 reads:\n\n\"M. Tach\u00e9 is also the author of the beautiful poetic and patriotic motto which accompanies the official coat of arms of the Province of Quebec \u2014 {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}} \u2014 the full significance of which cannot perhaps be readily expressed in English words but which may be paraphrased as conveying the meaning 'We do not forget, and will never forget, our ancient lineage, traditions and memories of all the past'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEncyclopedias and quotation dictionaries, including those of Wallace, Hamilton, Colombo or Hamilton and Shields, all provide the same information as the French-language sources.<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" />\n\nIn 1955, the historian Mason Wade added his opinion by writing: \"When the French Canadian says {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}}, he not only remembers the days of New France but also the fact that he belongs to a conquered people.\"<ref>Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians'', 1760\u20131945, Toronto, 1955, p. 47.</ref>\n\n== Controversy and \"second motto\" ==\n[[File:1983 Qu\u00e9bec license plate GBR 822.jpg|thumb|200px|Since 1978, the Quebec [[licence plate]] has featured the phrase \"Je me souviens\"]]\nIn 1978, {{lang|fr|Je me souviens}} replaced the tourist-oriented motto {{lang|fr|La belle province}} on [[Vehicle registration plates of Quebec|Quebec's vehicle registration plate]]. According to the historian Gaston Desch\u00eanes, this event marks the start of a new period of attempts to reinterpret the meaning of the motto in the mainstream media of Canada.\n\nOn February 4, 1978, Robert Goyette signed an article entitled \"Car owners argue over motto\" in ''[[The Montreal Star]]''. This article attracted the attention of a reader, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne P\u00e2quet, a granddaughter of Tach\u00e9 who replied on February 15 in an open letter entitled \"{{lang|fr|Je me souviens}}. It reads in part:\n\n{{quote|\nAccording to [Goyette's] article, there is confusion about the Quebec motto. As you mentioned, it was written by E. E. Tach\u00e9. \"Je me souviens\" is only the first line, which may be the cause of the confusion. It goes like this:\n\n''Je me souviens/ Que n\u00e9 sous le lys/ Je cro\u00ees sous la rose.''\n\nI remember/ That born under the lily/ I grow under the rose.}}\n\nThe lily refers to [[England]] while the rose refers to [[France]], both relating to the [[floral emblems]] of the nations. The idea that the motto had a lesser known second part spread widely. This new piece of information had a long life in the media before it was investigated by Desch\u00eanes in 1992.\n\nWhen Desch\u00eanes contacted H\u00e9l\u00e8ne P\u00e2quet in 1992, she was unable to specify the origin of text she quoted in her letter. Her statements were not conformable to those of her father, Lieutenant-Colonel \u00c9tienne-Th\u00e9odore P\u00e2quet Jr.,<ref>Son of [[\u00c9tienne-Th\u00e9odore P\u00e2quet]], a provincial MLA.</ref> who on March 3, 1939, wrote in a letter to [[John Samuel Bourque]], T\u00e2ch\u00e9's son-in-law, and Minister of Public Works, that \"the one who synthesized in three words the history and traditions of our race deserves to be recognized\"<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" /> as much as [[Adolphe-Basile Routhier|Routhier]] and [[Calixa Lavall\u00e9e|Lavall\u00e9e]] who composed the \"[[O Canada]]\".\n\nThe origin of the second part is today known to be a ''second motto'', created by the same Eug\u00e8ne-\u00c9tienne Tach\u00e9, many years after the first one, and originally destined to be used on a monument honouring the ''Canadian nation'', but which was never built. The monument was to be a statue of a young and graceful adolescent girl, an allegoric figure of the Canadian nation, bearing the motto: \"N\u00e9e dans les lis, je grandis dans les roses / Born in the lilies, I grow in the roses\".<ref name=\"La devise Je me souviens\" /> While the project was never realized, the idea was \"recycled\" in a commemorative medal for the 300th anniversary of the foundation of [[Quebec City]], created by Tach\u00e9, on which is written {{lang|fr|\"N\u00e9e sous les lis, Dieu aidant, l'\u0153uvre de Champlain a grandi sous les roses\"}} (\"Born under the lilies, God helping, Champlain's work has grown under the roses\").<ref>{{lang|fr|Les f\u00eates du troisi\u00e8me centenaire de Qu\u00e9bec}}, 1608-1908, Qu\u00e9bec, 1911, p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Other uses ==\n{{lang|fr|Je me souviens}} is also the motto of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]], a [[Francophone]] [[regiment]] of the [[Canadian Forces]].<ref>[http://www.r22er.com/pages/heritage/traditions_et_coutumes/les_insignes_regimentaire.htm Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment Traditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708010528/http://www.r22er.com/pages/heritage/traditions_et_coutumes/les_insignes_regimentaire.htm |date=2009-07-08 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{lang|fr|[[Je me souviens (film)|Je me souviens]]}}, documentary film\n* [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols]]\n* {{lang|fr|[[Un Canadien errant]]}}, 1842 song by Antoine G\u00e9rin-Lajoie that includes {{lang|fr|Va, dis \u00e0 mes amis que je me souviens d'eux.}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n; English\n* Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20091117091612/http://www.historywire.ca/en/article/19731 Je me souviens]\", in ''HistoryWire'', March 26, 2009\n* Deschenes, Gaston. \"Gaston Deschenes on the motto mystery: deciphering the true meaning of Quebec's famous slogan, Je me souviens\", in ''The Beaver: Exploring Canada's History'', February 1, 2008 [https://web.archive.org/web/20121105104030/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-177057159.html?key=01-42160D517E19136E130F051E03674B2E224E324D3417295C30420B61651B617F137019731B7B1D6B39 excerpt]\n\n; French\n* Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"[http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/fr/article-518/La_devise_qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9coise_%C2%ABJe_me_souviens%C2%BB.html La devise qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise \u00ab\u202fJe me souviens\u202f\u00bb]\", in {{lang|fr|L'Encyclop\u00e9die du patrimoine culturel de l'Am\u00e9rique fran\u00e7aise}}, February 1, 2011\n* Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"[http://agora.qc.ca/reftext.nsf/Documents/Quebec_-_Etat--La_devise_Je_me_souviens_par_Gaston_Deschenes La devise \u00ab\u202fJe me souviens\u202f\u00bb]\", in {{lang|fr|L'Encyclop\u00e9die de l'Agora}}, online since September 14, 2001, updated on May 20, 2006\n* Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec. \"[http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/devise/devise.html La devise du Qu\u00e9bec]\", in the site {{lang|fr|Drapeau et symboles nationaux}} of the Government of Quebec, updated January 14, 2008\n* Albert, Madeleine and Gaston Desch\u00eanes. \"Une devise centenaire : Je me souviens\", in {{lang|fr|Bulletin de la Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale}}, 14, 2 (April 1984), p.&nbsp;21-30.

The original Sun Hung Kai Bank shareholders included [[Banque Paribas]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and the family of [[Fung King Hey]] (founder of Sun Hung Kai Securities).\n\nIn 1985, Ahmet D. Arsan, Asia Head of [[Arab Banking Corporation]] (ABC), arranged for ABC to acquire 75% of Sun Hung Kai Bank, which, at the time, was suffering from sub-optimal results and was ripe for a take-over.  Arsan was a well-known and highly influential Turkish-American banker who ABC had recruited in 1982 to head ABC Asia Pacific, after his success, years earlier, in establishing the Asia Pacific arm of First Chicago (now JPMorgan Asia).  Immediately following the 1985 acquisition of Sun Hung Kai Bank by ABC, Arsan made sweeping changes in the bank, ranging from the executive management team and most of the bank's staff, to the bank's entire set of operating procedures, on which all employees were trained.\n\nIn 1986, Arsan changed the institution's name and re-branded the organisation as [[International Bank of Asia]] (IBA); (\u6e2f\u57fa\u570b\u969b\u9280\u884c).  Ahmet D. Arsan was the founding Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of IBA from 1985 to 1989, after which Arsan left IBA and established a private Hong Kong based trading firm.\n\nIn 1990, following Arsan's departure, ABC acquired the remaining 25% of IBA shares, making IBA a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC, until October 1993 when [[China Everbright Group]] became a 20% stake holder.  In November 1990, IBA was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].\n\nIn February 2004 [[Fubon Financial Holding Co., Ltd.]], a member of Taiwanese financial institution Fubon Group, in an acquisition of IBA shares from both ABC and [[China Everbright Limited]] ( a subsidiary of Everbright Group incorporated in 1997), acquired a 75% stake in IBA.  The M&A advisor was Citigroup Global Markets.\n\nAt the 2005 Fubon Group annual general meeting, the Fubon board approved a movement for IBA to adopt the Fubon name.  On April 6, 2005, IBA was renamed Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.\n\nFubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited operates 26 branches in Hong Kong inclusive of commercial banking centre and securities services centers. The branches are distributed across Hong Kong Island (9), Kowloon (10) and New Territories (7). <ref>[http://www.fubonbank.com.hk/en/branch-locator.html Fubon branch locations, retrieved on 2018-05-22]</ref> Fubon provides a wide range of financial services encompassing consumer and wholesale banking, wealth management, financial markets, hire purchase, securities brokerage and investment services.  Fubon Bank is listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (stock code: 636) and holds an A-2 short-term, BBB+ long-term rating from S&P.

Denys informs his mother Mildred, the matriarch of the family, that he has invited Rowena Hyde. She shows up in a chauffeur-driven car. Also making an appearance is patriarch Arthur Royd's friend Adrian Barrasford. The pair go fishing. When Adrian reveals he is very fond of Mary Jarrow, Arthur invites him to supper, as Mary will be there. Miranda Bute, nearly eighteen years old, is another surprise guest. Mildred becomes a bit concerned, as she knows that Miranda, her niece, is attached to Denys (though he himself is oblivious), making for an awkward situation.\n\nWhen Miranda discovers that Denys has turned down an attractive job offer because there was \"just no money in it\", she is sure there is \"something behind this\". Then she encounters Rowena, who informs her that Denys has accepted a well-paying job in Hollywood as a private secretary, rather than pursuing a career as a [[scenic design]]er. She eventually quarrels with Denys over his decision.\n\nAdrian takes Arthur and Mildred's advice to make his intentions known, only to have Mary misconstrue his proposal as an offer to sell her his house. He, on the other hand, thinks she has turned down his offer of marriage.\n\nDenys and Rowena go to a party of her upper-class friends. He becomes annoyed when she chooses Paul Perry (Denys's future employer) instead of him as her partner in a game.\n\nMeanwhile, Arthur, Adrian and Sam sneak off to do some [[poaching]]; Miranda joins them, and after much searching, they catch a large salmon. However, they are spotted and chased by the authorities. Miranda flags down a passing car, which turns out to be driven by Denys. He lies to a policeman to keep her out of trouble and takes her home. Arthur and Adrian eventually show up, but Sam is caught and taken into custody. Arthur has to get Adrian, in his official capacity as the local [[justice of the peace]], to allow him to bail out their fellow poacher.\n\nThe next morning, Miranda is delighted to learn that Denys has changed his mind and declined the Hollywood job. It soon becomes apparent that he has also drastically changed his view of Miranda as well. Adrian, emboldened by his experience the night before, proposes to and is accepted by Mary.

In the early 1970s, Monz\u00f3 reported from [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[East Africa]] for the Barcelona newspaper ''Tele/eXpres''. He lives in [[Barcelona]] and publishes regularly in ''[[La Vanguardia]]''.\n\nHis [[fiction]] is characterized by an awareness of [[popular culture|pop culture]] and [[irony]].  His other [[prose]] maintains this humor. One collection of his [[essay]]s, ''Catorze ciutats comptant-hi Brooklyn'', is notable for its account of [[New York City]] in the days immediately following September 11. In collaboration with Cuca Canals, he wrote the dialogue for [[Bigas Luna]]'s ''[[Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n]]''. He has also written ''El tango de Don Joan'', with [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Savary]].\n\nIn 2007 he wrote and read the opening speech at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], the year in which Catalan culture was the guest. Monz\u00f3 designed an acclaimed lecture written as if it were a short story, thus differing completely from a traditional speech. From December 2009 to April 2010 there took place in the Arts Santa M\u00f2nica Gallery in Barcelona a great retrospective exhibition on his life and his work, called ''Monz\u00f3''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Books in English ===\n* ''O'Clock'', 1986.

In the early 1970s, Monz\u00f3 reported from [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[East Africa]] for the Barcelona newspaper ''Tele/eXpres''. He lives in [[Barcelona]] and publishes regularly in ''[[La Vanguardia]]''.\n\nHis [[fiction]] is characterized by an awareness of [[popular culture|pop culture]] and [[irony]].  His other [[prose]] maintains this humor. One collection of his [[essay]]s, ''Catorze ciutats comptant-hi Brooklyn'', is notable for its account of [[New York City]] in the days immediately following September 11. In collaboration with Cuca Canals, he wrote the dialogue for [[Bigas Luna]]'s ''[[Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n]]''. He has also written ''El tango de Don Joan'', with [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Savary]].\n\nIn 2007 he wrote and read the opening speech at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], the year in which Catalan culture was the guest. Monz\u00f3 designed an acclaimed lecture written as if it were a short story, thus differing completely from a traditional speech. From December 2009 to April 2010 there took place in the Arts Santa M\u00f2nica Gallery in Barcelona a great retrospective exhibition on his life and his work, called ''Monz\u00f3''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Books in English ===\n* ''O'Clock'', 1986.
