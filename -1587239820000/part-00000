The film was also dubbed in Hindi as ''Aaj ka Sharifzaada''.\n\n== Plot ==\nAjay Varma is a [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]-based Kabbadi player who visits [[Kurnool]] to take part in a state-level tournament. There, he saves Swapna Reddy from Obul Reddy, a dangerous faction leader, who is in love with Swapna and wants to marry her against her wishes. Ajay learns that Swapna is trying to leave to the United States for pursuing higher education after Obul killed her brothers. When Ajay saves Swapna, he humiliates Obul by pushing him into a mudpond. Obul refuses to cleanse the mud until Swapna is found and brought back. Ajay helps Swapna escape and takes her to his house in an old city, hiding her in his room with the help of his sister, Asha.\n\nSoon, his parents find out she is hiding in their house. Swapna and Ajay run away again and she falls in love with him. The next day, the police, led by Ajay's father Vijay, surround the [[Charminar]] where Swapna is hidden by Ajay. The duo, along with Ajay's friends, reach the airport to go to the United States. They bring her parents to see her one last time before she leaves. After Swapna is past airport security, Ajay realises he loves Swapna. She shows up and hugs him while proposing him.\n\nAt the airport, Vijay arrests Ajay while Obul's men take Swapna away. After Swapna taunts him by saying that Ajay will definitely come for her, Obul goes to the jail and asks Ajay to come with him. Here, Vijay expresses that he's not worried about Ajay; rather, he's worried for Obul. Obul and his henchmen are kidnapped by Ajay, who, along with his friends, attend the finals of national level tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, Obul's brother Siva Reddy, who happens to be the home minister of the state, is waiting at the venue of Obul's marriage with Swapna. After coming to know about his whereabouts, Siva reaches the stadium along with Swapna and his mother where Ajay and Obul are fighting with each other. Swapna's father stabs Obul, whereas his mother dies in a bomb blast. Siva decides not to react as it would harm his position as a minister and Ajay, whose team won the match, celebrates the victory with Swapna and his family.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mahesh Babu]] as Ajay Varma\n* [[Bhumika Chawla]] as Swapna Reddy, Ajay's love interest\n* [[Mukesh Rishi]] as [[Deputy Commissioner of Police (India)|DCP]] Vijay Varma, Ajay's father\n* [[Rajan P.

The film was also dubbed in Hindi as ''Aaj ka Sharifzaada''.\n\n== Plot ==\nAjay Varma is a [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]-based Kabbadi player who visits [[Kurnool]] to take part in a state-level tournament. There, he saves Swapna Reddy from Obul Reddy, a dangerous faction leader, who is in love with Swapna and wants to marry her against her wishes. Ajay learns that Swapna is trying to leave to the United States for pursuing higher education after Obul killed her brothers. When Ajay saves Swapna, he humiliates Obul by pushing him into a mudpond. Obul refuses to cleanse the mud until Swapna is found and brought back. Ajay helps Swapna escape and takes her to his house in an old city, hiding her in his room with the help of his sister, Asha.\n\nSoon, his parents find out she is hiding in their house. Swapna and Ajay run away again and she falls in love with him. The next day, the police, led by Ajay's father Vijay, surround the [[Charminar]] where Swapna is hidden by Ajay. The duo, along with Ajay's friends, reach the airport to go to the United States. They bring her parents to see her one last time before she leaves. After Swapna is past airport security, Ajay realises he loves Swapna. She shows up and hugs him while proposing him.\n\nAt the airport, Vijay arrests Ajay while Obul's men take Swapna away. After Swapna taunts him by saying that Ajay will definitely come for her, Obul goes to the jail and asks Ajay to come with him. Here, Vijay expresses that he's not worried about Ajay; rather, he's worried for Obul. Obul and his henchmen are kidnapped by Ajay, who, along with his friends, attend the finals of national level tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, Obul's brother Siva Reddy, who happens to be the home minister of the state, is waiting at the venue of Obul's marriage with Swapna. After coming to know about his whereabouts, Siva reaches the stadium along with Swapna and his mother where Ajay and Obul are fighting with each other. Swapna's father stabs Obul, whereas his mother dies in a bomb blast. Siva decides not to react as it would harm his position as a minister and Ajay, whose team won the match, celebrates the victory with Swapna and his family.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mahesh Babu]] as Ajay Varma\n* [[Bhumika Chawla]] as Swapna Reddy, Ajay's love interest\n* [[Mukesh Rishi]] as [[Deputy Commissioner of Police (India)|DCP]] Vijay Varma, Ajay's father\n* [[Rajan P.

After watching ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961), he took inspiration from the war between two gangs and wrote a script choosing Charminar and [[Old City (Hyderabad, India)|Old city]] area of Hyderabad as the film's backdrop.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=10}} Years later, [[Ashwini Dutt]] met Gunasekhar during the re-recording sessions of ''[[Choodalani Vundi]]'' (1998) where the latter saw the portfolio images of [[Mahesh Babu]] whose debut film ''[[Rajakumarudu]]'' was officially launched that day. Finding Mahesh apt for the protagonist he envisioned, Gunasekhar narrated the script to him and gained his consent.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=10}}\n\nAfter the release of ''[[Mrugaraju]]'' (2001), Gunasekhar resumed work on the film's script. After reading an interview of [[Pullela Gopichand]] who pursued a career in [[badminton]] against his father's wishes and faced many hardships, Gunasekhar made the protagonist a person who aspires to be a [[kabaddi]] player against his father's wishes.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=10}} He met [[Ramoji Rao]] who expressed his wish to produce the film and permitted Gunasekhar to erect a Charminar set at [[Ramoji Film City]].{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=10}}\n\nRao walked out due to unknown reasons and Mahesh, along with Gunasekhar, met [[M. S. Raju]] at [[Padmalaya Studios]] office. Mahesh asked Raju to permit them to erect a Charminar set as they cannot avail police permission to shoot at the original after a person committed [[suicide]] by jumping from the top. Raju agreed to do so after listening to the script narration and the project was subsequently announced.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=11}}\n\nGunasekhar wanted to name the film as ''Athade Ame Sainyam'', but the title was already registered for another film which made Gunasekhar name the film as ''Okkadu'' after considering ''Kabaddi''.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=11}} The film was produced under the banner [[Sumanth Art Productions]] with a budget of {{INR}}130{{mdash}}140 million.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=11}}\n\n=== Cast and crew ===\nImpressed with her screen presence in ''[[Yuvakudu]]'' (2000), Gunasekhar chose [[Bhumika Chawla]] as the film's female lead to be paired with Mahesh.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=11}} [[Mukesh Rishi]] and [[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]] were signed to play Mahesh's parents in the film.

The surroundings of Charminar were recreated in five acres around the set. 300 workers were employed in the construction of the set which lasted for three months and costed {{INR}}17.5 million.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=11}}\n\nThe makers decided to create the roads near the set using computer graphics in order to reduce the budget. [[Principal photography]] began in the same set and fifteen generators were used for illuminating the area. Strada Cranes were used for filming key scenes after ordinary cranes proved to be futile.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=11}} The film's climax was shot in December 2002 for 11 days and 1000 junior artistes participated in the film's shoot amid extreme climatic conditions.

Almost uninhabited, it is known for its five small resorts and clean, quiet beaches.\n\n==Resort island==\nUoleva is known for its five small resorts: Tiana's, Captain Cook's, Sea Change Eco Retreat, Fanifo Lofa, and Serenity Beach. They are each capable of hosting perhaps two dozen guests each, but attendance is usually lower. Each is located on the west, leeward side of the island.\n\nBesides the resort owners and their guests, the island is uninhabited. The locals who own the land use it to raise pigs or harvest coconuts, but not on any large scale.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are no roads on Uoleva.  There are no cell phone towers but it is within range of the towers on Lifuka or \u2018Uiha.  Electricity is only generated by small-scale solar panels.  Water is available only from rainwater collection tanks.\n\n==Transportation==\nUoleva can be reached by boat or by foot.  The reef between the north tip of Uoleva and the south tip of Lifuka is shallow enough at low tide to ford with a 30-minute strenuous walk.  The water is usually at knee height but can rise to waist level depending on where one walks.  A path is clearly visible through most of it but the terrain changes after each major storm.  Tongans from Lifuka sometimes ride horses across this reef to visit their plantations on Uoleva.\n\nUoleva is most often reached by boat.  Services can be arranged by the resort owners or by several foreign operators in Pangai.\n\n==History==\nThere has been no known permanent settlement on Uoleva.  When the first Lapita settlers arrived on Tonga in approximately 2850 B.P. (900 BCE), the sea level was {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} higher than it is today, making it a much smaller island.<ref name=\"burley\" >David V.
