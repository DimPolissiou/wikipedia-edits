{"title_page": "Child sexuality", "text_new": "Development of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] is an integral part of the development and maturation of children. A range of sensational, emotional and consequent sexual activities that may occur before or during early puberty, but before full sexual maturity is established. The development of '''child sexuality''' is influenced by social and cultural aspects; the perception of developing child sexuality is even more heavily influenced by cultural aspects. The concept of child sexuality also played an important role in the classical psychoanalysis.\n==History of research==\n===Freud===\nUntil [[Sigmund Freud]] published his ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' in 1905, children were often regarded as [[Asexuality|asexual]], having no sexuality until later development. Freud was one of the first researchers to seriously study child sexuality. While his ideas, such as [[psycho-sexual development]] and the [[Oedipus complex]], have been rejected, acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was a significant change.<ref name=\"Santrock\"/> Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions&nbsp;\u2013  they wonder where babies come from, they notice anatomical differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]] or [[masturbation]]. Child sex play includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.<ref name=\"Santrock\">Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4''th''ed.).'' New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Sex play with others usually decreases as children go through their elementary school years, yet they still may possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, escalating in [[puberty]] (roughly the teenage years) when the main surge in sexual interest occurs.<ref name=\"Santrock\"/>\n===Kinsey===\n[[Alfred Kinsey]] in the [[Kinsey Reports]] (1948 and 1953) included research on the physical sexual response of children, including pre-pubescent children (though the main focus of the reports was adults). While there were initially concerns that some of the data in his reports could not have been obtained without observation of or participation in [[child sexual abuse]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims: A Practical Guide|last=Salter, Ph.D.|first=Anna C.|year=1988|pages=22\u201324 |publisher=Sage Publications Inc |isbn= 978-0-8039-3182-4}}</ref> the data was revealed much later in the 1990s to have been gathered from the diary of a single pedophile who had been molesting children since 1917.<ref name=\"Pool\">{{cite news|last=Pool |first=Gary |title=Sex, science, and Kinsey: a conversation with Dr. John Bancroft - head of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction |publisher=Humanist |date=Sep\u2013Oct 1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_n5_v56/ai_18640605/pg_1 |accessdate=2008-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327222948/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_n5_v56/ai_18640605/pg_1 |archivedate=2008-03-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/cont-akchild.html |title=Kinsey Institute director denies allegations by Reisman |publisher=Kinseyinstitute.org |accessdate=2013-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212143625/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/cont-akchild.html |archivedate=2014-02-12 }}</ref>  This effectively rendered the data-set nearly worthless, not only because it relied entirely on a single source, but the data was [[hearsay]] reported by a highly  [[Confirmation bias|unreliable observer]].

The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report:\n*Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked;\n*Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \"[[playing doctor|play doctor]]\"; and\n*Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers.\nThe report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development).<ref name=\"NTCSN.2009\">{{cite report| title=Sexual Development and Behavior in Children: Information for Parents and Caregivers| year=2009| publisher=American Psychological Association| url=https://doi.org/10.1037/e736972011-001}}</ref>\n\nChildren can discover the pleasure of [[genital stimulation]] naturally at an early age.<ref name=SHP>{{cite book|title=Sexuality Today: The Human Perspective Edn 7|first=Garry | last = Kelly|publisher=McGraw-Hill Tx USA|year=2003|isbn=978-0072558357}}</ref> Boys often lie on their stomachs and girls may sit and rock.

A range of sensational, emotional and consequent sexual activities that may occur before or during early puberty, but before full sexual maturity is established.

The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report:\n*Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked;\n*Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \"[[playing doctor|play doctor]]\"; and\n*Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers.\nThe report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development).<ref name=\"NTCSN.2009\">{{cite report| title=Sexual Development and Behavior in Children: Information for Parents and Caregivers| year=2009| publisher=American Psychological Association| url=https://doi.org/10.1037/e736972011-001}}</ref>\n\nChildren can discover the pleasure of [[genital stimulation]] naturally at an early age.<ref name=SHP>{{cite book|title=Sexuality Today: The Human Perspective Edn 7|first=Garry | last = Kelly|publisher=McGraw-Hill Tx USA|year=2003|isbn=978-0072558357}}</ref> Boys often lie on their stomachs and girls may sit and rock.
