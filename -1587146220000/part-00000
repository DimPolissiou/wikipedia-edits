The Haselrigges Lobsters Regiment lost around 70% of their men defending the retreating Parliament army which was attempting to return to Tewkesbury. At the end, Parliamentary reinforcements checked the Royalists at Mythe Hill just north of Tewkesbury.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|pp=82\u201383}}.\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation| last=Willis-Bund |first=John William |authorlink=John William Willis-Bund |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/civilwarinworce00bundgoog |title=The Civil War In Worcestershire, 1642-1646: And the Scotch Invasion Of 1651 |location=Birmingham |publisher=The Midland Educational Company |pages=[https://archive.org/stream/civilwarinworce00bundgoog#page/n91/mode/1up 81]\u201383}}\n\n\n\n{{coord|52.042|-2.187|region:GB|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ripple Field}}\n[[Category:Battles of the English Civil Wars]]\n[[Category:1643 in England]]\n[[Category:17th century in Worcestershire]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1643]]\n", "name_user": "VFF0347", "label": "safe", "comment": "Collapsed the table of battles.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ripple_Field"}

Typically, the heroine was either a \"good girl\" or \"bad girl\", with both roles having small effect on a male character's decision. In the [[Archie Comics]], the titular character can never definitively chose between his two love interests [[Betty Cooper|Betty]] and [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]], who typify this dichotomy between the good Girl-Next-Door and the dangerous allure of her foil respectively. The duo got their own title in 1950, [[Betty and Veronica (comic book)]], which quickly became a popular comic, featuring the two lead characters continuing to obsess over boys and fight over who would get to date Archie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica|title=Betty and Veronica|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crimes by Women 2.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Crimes by Women'' #1]]\nFemale costumed crimefighters were among the early comics characters.

The first widely recognizable female superhero is ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', from [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would merge to form [[DC Comics]]. In an October 25, 1940, interview conducted by former student [[Olive Byrne]] (under the pseudonym 'Olive Richard') and published in ''[[Family Circle]]'', titled \"Don't Laugh at the Comics\", [[William Moulton Marston]] described what he saw as the great educational potential of comic books (a follow up article was published two years later in 1942.<ref>Richard, Olive. ''[http://www.wonderwoman-online.com/articles/fc-marston.html Our Women Are Our Future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727002702/http://www.wonderwoman-online.com/articles/fc-marston.html |date=2006-07-27 }}.''</ref>) This article caught the attention of comics publisher [[Max Gaines]], who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodicals and [[All-American Publications]], two of the companies that would merge to form the future [[DC Comics]]. At that time, Marston decided to develop a new superhero. In the early 1940s the DC line was dominated by superpowered male characters such as the [[Green Lantern]], [[Batman]], and its flagship character, [[Superman]]. According to the Fall 2001 issue of the [[Boston University]] alumni magazine, it was his wife [[Elizabeth Holloway Marston|Elizabeth Hollowy]]'s idea to create a female superhero.<ref name=\"Who Was Wonder Woman\">'[http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ Who Was Wonder Woman?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208045132/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ |date=2007-12-08 }}</ref>  Marston introduced the idea to [[Max Gaines]], cofounder (along with [[Jack Liebowitz]]) of [[All-American Publications]]. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed ''Wonder Woman'' with Elizabeth (whom Marston believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman).<ref name=\"Who Was Wonder Woman\"/> In creating Wonder Woman, Marston was also inspired by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a [[polygamy|polygamous]]/[[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship.<ref>Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History,'' (DC Comics, 2000), pp.  28-30.</ref> In a 1943 issue of ''[[The American Scholar]]'', Marston wrote:\n{{quotation|Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power.  Not wanting to be girls, they don't want to be tender, submissive, peace-loving as good women are. Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness.

According to Marston this imagery of bondage was a reflection of the suffrage movement's use bondage as well.

After a conducting a survey among Justice Society Readers Wonder Woman was admitted to the organization in ''All-Star Comics # 11.'' Although published concurrently with Marston's run in ''Sensation Comics'' the writer of Justice Society kept Wonder Woman in the limited position as Secretary of the League, rarely involving her in action.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of wonder woman.|last=Jill.|first=Lepore|date=2015|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780804173407|location=|pages=204\u2013205 and 210\u2013211|oclc=941724731}}</ref> In 1947 Marston died, and despite his widow's petitioned to be hired as writer DC instead hired [[Robert Kanigher]].

Influenced largely by [[Fredric Wertham|Fredric Wertham's]] book published that same year, ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', a public hearing was held to determine if juvenile delinquency and comic books were linked. Wertham had specifically attacked the portrayal of many comic book women stating: \"They are not homemakers. They do not bring up a family. Mother-love is entirely absent ...

The code explicitly censors violence, sexuality and \"abnormal\" romance for the implicit purpose of \"emphasiz[ing] the value of the home and the sanctity of marriage,\" and a reenforcement of traditional gender roles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/origin-story-wonder-woman-180952710/|title=The Surprising Origin Story of Wonder Woman|last=Lepore|first=Jill|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n===Silver Age of Comic Books===\nBetween 1961 and 1963, one of the top two comic book genres was romance comics. Many influences from this genre overlapped in the superhero comics of the era. Although superhero titles would eventually become the leading [[genre]], DC Comics' [[Young Romance]] would end its thirty-year run in 1977.<ref>Trina Robbins, From Girls to Grrrlz: a History of Women's Comics from Teens to Zines, p.77, Diane Pub Co, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7567-8120-5}}</ref>\n\nAfter the implementation of the [[Comics Code]], DC Comics implemented its own in-house Editorial Policy Code regarding the portrayal of women, which stated, \"The inclusion of females in stories is specifically discouraged. Women, when used in plot structure, should be secondary in importance, and should be drawn realistically, without exaggeration of feminine physical qualities\".<ref name=Uslan5>Uslan, Michael. ''Batman in the Fifties'' (2002) Introduction, p.5. {{ISBN|1-56389-810-1}}, 2002</ref> Most of DC's [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] superheroes each had a major female supporting character. These included three career women: [[journalist]] [[Lois Lane]], who worked at ''The Daily Planet'' with [[Superman]]'s alter ego, Clark Kent; [[Jean Loring]] lawyer and girlfriend of [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] a.k.a. [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]] and  [[aircraft manufacturer]] executive [[Carol Ferris]], the boss of [[Green Lantern]]'s alter ego, Hal Jordan. [[Iris West]] was the on-again, off-again girlfriend of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'s alter ego, Barry Allen.\n\nBatman's supporting cast, beginning in the 1950s, occasionally included journalist [[Vicki Vale]] and heiress Kathy Kane, whose alter ego was the [[motorcycle]]-riding masked crimefighter [[Batwoman]]. With a tip of her cowl to the [[Harvey Comics]] character the [[Black Cat (Harvey Comics)|Black Cat]], who preceded her by 15 years as a superheroine on a motorcycle, Batwoman used weapons as well, although hers included powder puffs, charm bracelets, perfume, a hair net, a compact mirror, and a shoulder bag utility case with matching bolo strap.<ref name=\"Uslan5\" />\n\nDuring this time frame, the comics of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] published by Marvel and DC were different enough that if you liked one, you were liable not to like the other. If you wanted the classic feel of the original 1940s superheroes, you were a DC partisan. If you wanted fast action mixed with the emotional angst reflecting a world where social unrest was slowly coming to a boil, you were more likely to read the Marvel offerings<ref>Foreword, Doom Patrol Archives, Volume 2, pp.5-6, Roy Thomas, writer, {{ISBN|978-1-4012-0150-0}}, 2004</ref> When [[Atlas Comics]] became [[Marvel Comics]] in 1961, many brand new women superheroes were introduced; these superheroes were given a supporting roles. The first female superhero from the newly named Marvel Comics was the [[Invisible Girl]], a.k.a. Susan Storm, charter member of the Fantastic Four.\n\nAlthough female characters would develop and become cornerstones of the Marvel Universe, their early treatment would resemble a struggle to be recognized as equals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the history of Comic Book Heroines|last = Madrid|first = Mike|publisher = Exterminating Angel Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-935259-03-9|location = United States of America|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/supergirlsfashio00mike}}</ref> Supergirl of DC Comics went through such a struggle as she fights against the title of \"Superman's kid cousin\" to earn her own title as Power Girl.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Bronze Age of Comic Books===\nThe Bronze Age of Comics reflected many of the feminist tensions of the era. The number of female characters, both heroes and villains, increased substantially in the 1970s, in response to the feminist movement, and in an attempt to diversify readership.<ref name=CBnation250>Wright, p. 250</ref> However, these characters were often stereotypical, such as the man-hating Thundra or angry-feminist [[parody]], Man-killer.<ref name=CBnation250/>\n\nMeanwhile in the underground comic circle The Women's Liberation Basement Press began published a one-shot comic titled ''That Ain't Me Babe'' in 1970 that featured many of the most famous female comic icons. \"Supergirl tells Superman to get lost, Veronica ditches Archie for Betty, Petunia Pig tells Porky Pig to cook his own dinner.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of wonder woman.|last=Jill.|first=Lepore|date=2015|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780804173407|location=|pages=283\u2013284|oclc=941724731}}</ref> This would evolve into [[Wimmen's Comix]], an underground anthology series that would run through 1992, dealing many controversial women's issues.\n\nThe character [[Ms. Marvel]] is an example of Marvel's struggle with the issues of feminism. Debuting in 1977 at the height of the [[women's liberation movement]], with the honorific \"[[Ms.]]\" part of her [[cryptonym]], the heroine's name was a strong symbol of [[feminist]] solidarity, as was her civilian job as editor of ''Woman'' magazine (a reference to the then-new ''[[Ms. Magazine]]''). The first couple of issues of her self-titled comic book even included the cover line \"This Female Fights Back!\" The reality, however, was decidedly mixed. The controversial Ms. Marvel rape was handled poorly by Marvel Comics: first having Ms. Marvel be the victim to a man's attempt of escape from Limbo, give birth to said man that raped her, her teammates confused as to why she would not want the child, and subsequently fall in love with him and move into Limbo with him.<ref>The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the history of Comic Book Heroines</ref>\n\nThroughout most of the Silver and Bronze Age, women in comics were not given leadership positions. In the 1980s, under writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]] found new uses for her powers and developed an assertive self-confidence to use her powers more aggressively. She changed her alias from the Invisible Girl to the [[Invisible Woman]]. Eventually, the Invisible Woman would chair the Fantastic Four, while over in the Avengers, [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] chaired the team.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnormous impact was made both within comic book storylines and amongst comic book fans by the radical portrayal of women in the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' comics, which had been relaunched in 1975.  Previously existing female characters were given huge increases in [[power-levels]], new code-names, flashier costumes, and strong, confident, assertive personalities: Jean Grey went from being Marvel Girl to the nigh-omnipotent Phoenix, and Lorna Dane became Polaris.  New creation Storm (Ororo Monroe) was unique in many ways: not only was she (and still is) the most famous black superhero in history, she was portrayed as incredibly powerful, confident and capable from her very first appearance.\n\nYounger/teen-age female super-heroines, which heretofore had been portrayed as inept or limited in power, were re-examined by the portrayal of [[Kitty Pryde]], who at age 13 became the youngest member of the X-Men. In the 1980s, the X-Men met with the Morlock tribe in which they kidnapped Kitty Pryde and forced her to marry one of their own. When Kitty escapes, she meets with a Japanese Sorcerer who uses mind control on her and she escapes from him as well, but changed greatly.<ref name=\":0\" />  Much credit for the \"turnaround\" of portrayals of female super-heroes that happened in the 1970s could be given to X-Men writer [[Chris Claremont]]: his portrayals of Storm, Jean Grey, Emma Frost, Kitty Pryde, Rogue and Psylocke in The Uncanny X-Men (as well as his work on Ms. Marvel, Spider-Woman, Misty Knight and Coleen Wing) became known in the industry and amongst fandom as \"Claremont Women\": smart, powerful, capable, multi-faceted women super heroes.\n\nDuring the events of Alan Moore's iconic work ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', [[Barbara Gordon]], a.k.a. [[Batgirl]] is crippled by the Joker. She eventually made the best of her situation to become Oracle, a vital information broker for the [[DC Universe]]'s superhero community who also leads her own superhero team, the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].\n\n===Modern Age of Comic Books===\nIn the [[1990s in comics|90s]], a popular feminist comic book girl was [[Tank Girl]] (by [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Alan Martin (writer)|Alan Martin]]), who sported punk-influenced clothing and a shaved head. After becoming a figurehead in ''[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]'' magazine, her popularity was such that [[Tank Girl (film)|a movie]] was eventually made. She represented the new modern woman as one who no longer had to live under traditional images of beauty or manners.\n\nDue to the fan\u2013based nature of the comic book industry, many of the readers feel, either directly or indirectly, that they are involved in a social practice.<ref name=blacksuperheroes129>By Jeffrey A.

Roles and choices such as single parenting, same-sex relationships, and positions of power in the workplace have come to define many women in modern society.

Even if a female character isn't sexualized, there are still characteristics that give way to womanhood. There is a habit amongst cartoonists when they characterize their animals as females.  Around the 1980s was when the over sexualization between both male and females rose. Males became even taller, muscular, and smarter. Females, too, became taller, but only in the legs. Their breast proportions became exaggerated, as well as their waist.\n\nCharacterizations of women as sex objects has declined in recent decades, as have depictions of women as victims of physical brutality have significantly decreased over the past 20 years.

The portrayals of female characters and superheroes' were targeted towards a predominantly male demographic, rather than towards female readers.<ref name=CBnation250/> After decades of self-perpetuating male creators did not focus on what women wanted to read about, and therefore didn't try very hard to include female stories.<ref name=\"Reading Comics\">{{cite book|last1=Wolk|first1=Douglas|title=Reading Comics: How Graphic Novels Work and What They Mean|date=1 June 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=70\u201374|ref=27}}</ref> Although many female superheroes were created and featured in comics, very few starred in their own series or achieved stand-alone success outside straightforward [[Adult comics|erotic works]]. Most female heroines in comic books were merely supporting characters; for example, the Wasp and the Invisible Girl were both introduced as team characters, fighting alongside male superheroes, and Batgirl and Catwoman both debuted as supporting characters in the Batman comics.Wonder Woman is the only female heroine studied who earned her own comic book title.<ref name=\":2\">Dunne, Maryjane. \"The Representation of Women in Comic Books, Post WWII Through the Radical 60s.\" ''PSU McNair Scholars Online Journal'' 2.1 (2006): 1-13. Web. 19 Dec. 2016.</ref> It has been debated whether the perceived lack of female readership was due to male writers being uncomfortable with writing about or for women, or whether the comic book industry is male dominated due to actual lack of women's interest in comics.<ref name=CBnation250/>\n\n=== Introduction of the Comics Code Authority ===\nThere is a historical context for the lack of female representation in comics. In 1954, the comics industry was attacked by concerned parents, psychologists, and politicians. These individuals were concerned that comic books were unfit for children. Superheroines, who had made their debut in 1941, were a major focus; \"Foremost on the agendas of the anti-comics crusade were concerns that gender roles were bent in the stories, allowing characters like [[Wonder Woman]] to act out lesbian and sadomasochistic fantasies.\"<ref name=\"Supermom1228\" /> Hollywood, which had undergone similar attacks in the past, had created a self-governed Production Code, which was then imitated by the comic book industry with the creation of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. \"The code policed the visual, textual, and thematic content of all comic books published after 1954, and is still active\u2014in diluted form\u2014today. Because of this, superhero comics made after 1954 tended to appease conservative ideology, and gender roles appeared rooted in tradition.\"<ref name=\"Supermom1228\" />\n\n=== Feminism in comics ===\nThe enforcement of gender roles within comics continued well past the 1950s. The roles of women in comics during the 1960s and 70s shifted to become more diverse and began to extend past traditional roles as a result of the civil rights movement, second wave feminism, and the sexual revolution, when more women in society were taking on predominantly male professions and advocating for social rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the 1970s, female characters in comics and other mainstream media were sometimes depicted as \"playing with the boys\" and taking more traditionally male-dominated roles, though they still tended to be cast as love interests or to take maternal roles.<ref name=\"Supermom1228\">{{cite journal|last1=D'Amore|first1=Laura Mattoon|title=The Accidental Supermom: Superheroines and Maternal Performativity, 1963-1980|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=1 December 2012|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1226\u20131233|ref=26|doi=10.1111/jpcu.12006|url=https://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context=fcas_fp}}</ref> Prominent superheroines that were introduced during this period in comics were Spider-Woman, Ms. Marvel, the Cat, and Valkyrie.<ref>(Lent, J.

The view that comic book reading was a hobby strictly for males created a hostile environment for the female comic book reader. Women that read comics were often viewed as \"doing womanhood wrong\" or as individuals that \"read comics wrong.\" This led to a cyclical pattern of hostility towards females in the comic book audience. Author Douglas Wolk states \"I remember seeing a Marvel sales plan, sometime in the early '90s-a huge document, several hundred pages long; near the back, a little section labeled \"Female Readers\" listed the two titles Marvel published for half of their potential audience: Barbie and Barbie Fashion.\"<ref name=\"Reading Comics\" />\n\nIn the 1980s there was a shift in the way comics were written; instead of treating each issue of a comic as if it were the reader's first issue, or an \"on ramp\", as it had been done previously,<ref name=\"Reading Comics\" /> comics began to be written in a way that demanded continuous readership from the beginning of a series in order for the plot to be understood. It is possible that this may have led to a further decline in female readership, as the female readers that might have tried to start during this era would find themselves confused and lost.\n\n[[Carol Danvers]], a superhero who has been known as Ms. Marvel, Binary, and Captain Marvel, is one of Marvel's most popular female superheroes, and has been considered a feminist icon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/10/28/marvel-first-female-superhero-powerful/|title=Carol Danvers, Marvel's first female superhero, is also the most powerful|last=Dickey|first=Josh|website=Mashable|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref> She is considered one of the strongest superheroes created by Marvel.\n\n=== Sexualized superheroes ===\nDuring the late 1980s, comics had undergone a stylistic shift in terms of character proportions. The sexual characteristics of comic book characters became more exaggerated, which affected both male and female characters. Male characters were typically drawn with bigger muscles, smaller heads, broader shoulders and chests. Female characters developed larger breasts and rears, very thin waists, longer legs, large lips, and more revealing costumes. While male characters generally had a variety of poses, females often were drawn in suggestive poses that further accentuated their breasts and rears. Female characters that were deemed to be empower feminist views were also portrayed in a sexualized manner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantasy-magazine.com/non-fiction/articles/the-objectification-of-women-in-graphic-novels/|title=The Objectification of Women in Comic Books {{!}} Fantasy Magazine|website=www.fantasy-magazine.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref> The trend has become the target of satire by feminists, especially on websites like [[The Hawkeye Initiative]].\n\n=== Independent comics ===\nIn addition, many female readers sway towards [[Independent comics|independent]] works, where there is a lot more female representation. The independent comics industry, whose products are often referred to as indies, have become a huge source of authentically represented females in comics. More women than ever before are becoming comic book artists and writers, and many of them have flocked to the independent industry. This, combined with a large female readership, has resulted in greatly increased numbers of female-driven stories in this industry. [[Manga]], another form of graphic novel, has also led to a rise in female readership of comics. The trend towards [[Sexualization|hyper-sexualized]] female characters in mainstream comics is part of the reason that independent comics have become so popular among women; independent artists, regardless of gender, tend to draw both male and female characters in a similar style. When those characters do have noticeable sex characteristics, such as breasts or broader shoulders, they are not exaggerated to the point that they are in the mainstream comic book industry.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/gender/trinarobbins.htm|title=Gender Differences in Comics by Trina Robbins|website=www.imageandnarrative.be|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Robbins\">{{cite journal|date=September 2002|title=Gender Difference in Comics|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/gender/trinarobbins.htm|journal=Image & Narrative|issue=4|ref=28|last1=Robbins|first1=Trina|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== LGBTQ superheroes ===\nRecently LGBTQ superheroes are becoming more prevalent and available. In 2011 Batwoman DC reinvented Batwoman from a casual sidekick in need of saving to an independent, lesbian superheroine. This version fights back against female stereotypes, and lacks the traditional female superhero physique. Her body sports more muscles and less chest and hip padding. She also lacks the traditional long flowing hair, instead sporting a short cut. She fights the more grotesque images of womanhood including the gorgons, her undead mother, and the ghost of her previous incarnation.<ref>Race, Kristen Coppess.

Because of this, black women in comic books did not start appearing regularly until the 1970s, in the Bronze Age of comic books. One of the first black female superheroes, and one of the most popular female black superheroes to this day, was [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]], who had the power to control the weather. She first appeared in 1975. In several reincarnations of the X-Men, she is the leader.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #201\n</ref>\n\n[[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau)]] first appeared in 1982, and received her own comic in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/3833/|title=GCD :: Series :: Captain Marvel|website=www.comics.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref> Captain Marvel had the power to transform herself into any form of energy, and obtains the properties of that energy. She has also joined [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] on several occasions.<ref>The Avengers #273-277</ref> There are several other characters who have the name [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], one of the most famous being [[Carol Danvers]], who is white.\n\nDespite the growth of black females in comic books after the Civil Rights Movement, there still continues to be a lack of black women in comic books. When black women are presented in comic books, they are often not fully human, like Storm, and are given stereotyped features and powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/columns/johnson/031218.shtml |title=PopMatters {{!}} Columns {{!}} Lynne d Johnson {{!}} Black Thoughtware {{!}} Bearing the Black Female Body as Witness in Sci-Fi |date=2008-04-23 |access-date=2016-12-19 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423011821/http://www.popmatters.com/columns/johnson/031218.shtml |archivedate=2008-04-23 }}</ref> Oftentimes, black comic book characters are stereotyped with ghetto characteristics.

Despite the more realistic portrayal of women in independent comics, the mainstream comic book industry still sometimes struggles with portraying women realistically.<ref name=Robbins/> There continues to be a difference in the way female superheroes are treated (by both their on-page counterparts and their writers) when compared to male superheroes of the same caliber.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite web|last1=Blanch|first1=Christina|title=What Do Comic Books Teach Us About Gender Attitudes?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswomanfiles/2013/01/23/what-do-comic-books-teach-us-about-gender-attitudes/|website=forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=17 January 2015|ref=29}}</ref> However, more recently steps have been made towards equality and de-sexualization with specific stories and comics.\n\nThere is a distinct effort being made by some to address these issues however; there is a Gender in Comics panel at [[San Diego Comic Con]] which, in 2014, \"included noted comic book journalists, editors, writers and behind-the-scenes figures all currently working to further awareness of the gender issues within the comic book industry.\"<ref name=GenderinComics>{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Brett|title=SDCC: Gender in Comics|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswomanfiles/2013/01/23/what-do-comic-books-teach-us-about-gender-attitudes/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=16 January 2015|ref=30}}</ref> One of the panelists, Laura Hudson, said this in regards to gender roles in comics and the criticism that they are facing:\n\n\"The panel spoke about how ingrained a lot of these false gender-based ideas have become thanks to decades of unchallenged existence. \"A metaphor I use a lot is it's like working in a bell factory,\" explained Hudson. \"If you work in the bell factory long enough you stop hearing the bells. I think super hero comics has stopped hearing the bells for a long time, but now you have other people coming in from the outside and [the gender issues in super hero comics are] very apparent.

In the [[Archie Comics]], the titular character can never definitively chose between his two love interests [[Betty Cooper|Betty]] and [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]], who typify this dichotomy between the good Girl-Next-Door and the dangerous allure of her foil respectively.

The first widely recognizable female superhero is ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', from [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would merge to form [[DC Comics]]. In an October 25, 1940, interview conducted by former student [[Olive Byrne]] (under the pseudonym 'Olive Richard') and published in ''[[Family Circle]]'', titled \"Don't Laugh at the Comics\", [[William Moulton Marston]] described what he saw as the great educational potential of comic books (a follow up article was published two years later in 1942.<ref>Richard, Olive.

At that time, Marston decided to develop a new superhero. In the early 1940s the DC line was dominated by superpowered male characters such as the [[Green Lantern]], [[Batman]], and its flagship character, [[Superman]]. According to the Fall 2001 issue of the [[Boston University]] alumni magazine, it was his wife [[Elizabeth Holloway Marston|Elizabeth Hollowy]]'s idea to create a female superhero.<ref name=\"Who Was Wonder Woman\">'[http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ Who Was Wonder Woman?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208045132/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ |date=2007-12-08 }}</ref>  Marston introduced the idea to [[Max Gaines]], cofounder (along with [[Jack Liebowitz]]) of [[All-American Publications]]. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed ''Wonder Woman'' with Elizabeth (whom Marston believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman).<ref name=\"Who Was Wonder Woman\"/> In creating Wonder Woman, Marston was also inspired by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a [[polygamy|polygamous]]/[[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship.<ref>Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History,'' (DC Comics, 2000), pp.  28-30.</ref> In a 1943 issue of ''[[The American Scholar]]'', Marston wrote:\n{{quotation|Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power.

Many influences from this genre overlapped in the superhero comics of the era. Although superhero titles would eventually become the leading [[genre]], DC Comics' [[Young Romance]] would end its thirty-year run in 1977.<ref>Trina Robbins, From Girls to Grrrlz: a History of Women's Comics from Teens to Zines, p.77, Diane Pub Co, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7567-8120-5}}</ref>\n\nAfter the implementation of the [[Comics Code]], DC Comics implemented its own in-house Editorial Policy Code regarding the portrayal of women, which stated, \"The inclusion of females in stories is specifically discouraged. Women, when used in plot structure, should be secondary in importance, and should be drawn realistically, without exaggeration of feminine physical qualities\".<ref name=Uslan5>Uslan, Michael. ''Batman in the Fifties'' (2002) Introduction, p.5. {{ISBN|1-56389-810-1}}, 2002</ref> Most of DC's [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] superheroes each had a major female supporting character. These included three career women: [[journalist]] [[Lois Lane]], who worked at ''The Daily Planet'' with [[Superman]]'s alter ego, Clark Kent; [[Jean Loring]] lawyer and girlfriend of [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] a.k.a. [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]] and  [[aircraft manufacturer]] executive [[Carol Ferris]], the boss of [[Green Lantern]]'s alter ego, Hal Jordan. [[Iris West]] was the on-again, off-again girlfriend of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'s alter ego, Barry Allen.\n\nBatman's supporting cast, beginning in the 1950s, occasionally included journalist [[Vicki Vale]] and heiress Kathy Kane, whose alter ego was the [[motorcycle]]-riding masked crimefighter [[Batwoman]]. With a tip of her cowl to the [[Harvey Comics]] character the [[Black Cat (Harvey Comics)|Black Cat]], who preceded her by 15 years as a superheroine on a motorcycle, Batwoman used weapons as well, although hers included powder puffs, charm bracelets, perfume, a hair net, a compact mirror, and a shoulder bag utility case with matching bolo strap.<ref name=\"Uslan5\" />\n\nDuring this time frame, the comics of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] published by Marvel and DC were different enough that if you liked one, you were liable not to like the other. If you wanted the classic feel of the original 1940s superheroes, you were a DC partisan. If you wanted fast action mixed with the emotional angst reflecting a world where social unrest was slowly coming to a boil, you were more likely to read the Marvel offerings<ref>Foreword, Doom Patrol Archives, Volume 2, pp.5-6, Roy Thomas, writer, {{ISBN|978-1-4012-0150-0}}, 2004</ref> When [[Atlas Comics]] became [[Marvel Comics]] in 1961, many brand new women superheroes were introduced; these superheroes were given a supporting roles. The first female superhero from the newly named Marvel Comics was the [[Invisible Girl]], a.k.a. Susan Storm, charter member of the Fantastic Four.\n\nAlthough female characters would develop and become cornerstones of the Marvel Universe, their early treatment would resemble a struggle to be recognized as equals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the history of Comic Book Heroines|last = Madrid|first = Mike|publisher = Exterminating Angel Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-935259-03-9|location = United States of America|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/supergirlsfashio00mike}}</ref> Supergirl of DC Comics went through such a struggle as she fights against the title of \"Superman's kid cousin\" to earn her own title as Power Girl.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Bronze Age of Comic Books===\nThe Bronze Age of Comics reflected many of the feminist tensions of the era. The number of female characters, both heroes and villains, increased substantially in the 1970s, in response to the feminist movement, and in an attempt to diversify readership.<ref name=CBnation250>Wright, p. 250</ref> However, these characters were often stereotypical, such as the man-hating Thundra or angry-feminist [[parody]], Man-killer.<ref name=CBnation250/>\n\nMeanwhile in the underground comic circle The Women's Liberation Basement Press began published a one-shot comic titled ''That Ain't Me Babe'' in 1970 that featured many of the most famous female comic icons. \"Supergirl tells Superman to get lost, Veronica ditches Archie for Betty, Petunia Pig tells Porky Pig to cook his own dinner.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of wonder woman.|last=Jill.|first=Lepore|date=2015|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780804173407|location=|pages=283\u2013284|oclc=941724731}}</ref> This would evolve into [[Wimmen's Comix]], an underground anthology series that would run through 1992, dealing many controversial women's issues.\n\nThe character [[Ms. Marvel]] is an example of Marvel's struggle with the issues of feminism. Debuting in 1977 at the height of the [[women's liberation movement]], with the honorific \"[[Ms.]]\" part of her [[cryptonym]], the heroine's name was a strong symbol of [[feminist]] solidarity, as was her civilian job as editor of ''Woman'' magazine (a reference to the then-new ''[[Ms. Magazine]]''). The first couple of issues of her self-titled comic book even included the cover line \"This Female Fights Back!\" The reality, however, was decidedly mixed. The controversial Ms. Marvel rape was handled poorly by Marvel Comics: first having Ms. Marvel be the victim to a man's attempt of escape from Limbo, give birth to said man that raped her, her teammates confused as to why she would not want the child, and subsequently fall in love with him and move into Limbo with him.<ref>The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the history of Comic Book Heroines</ref>\n\nThroughout most of the Silver and Bronze Age, women in comics were not given leadership positions. In the 1980s, under writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]] found new uses for her powers and developed an assertive self-confidence to use her powers more aggressively. She changed her alias from the Invisible Girl to the [[Invisible Woman]]. Eventually, the Invisible Woman would chair the Fantastic Four, while over in the Avengers, [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] chaired the team.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnormous impact was made both within comic book storylines and amongst comic book fans by the radical portrayal of women in the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' comics, which had been relaunched in 1975.  Previously existing female characters were given huge increases in [[power-levels]], new code-names, flashier costumes, and strong, confident, assertive personalities: Jean Grey went from being Marvel Girl to the nigh-omnipotent Phoenix, and Lorna Dane became Polaris.  New creation Storm (Ororo Monroe) was unique in many ways: not only was she (and still is) the most famous black superhero in history, she was portrayed as incredibly powerful, confident and capable from her very first appearance.\n\nYounger/teen-age female super-heroines, which heretofore had been portrayed as inept or limited in power, were re-examined by the portrayal of [[Kitty Pryde]], who at age 13 became the youngest member of the X-Men. In the 1980s, the X-Men met with the Morlock tribe in which they kidnapped Kitty Pryde and forced her to marry one of their own. When Kitty escapes, she meets with a Japanese Sorcerer who uses mind control on her and she escapes from him as well, but changed greatly.<ref name=\":0\" />  Much credit for the \"turnaround\" of portrayals of female super-heroes that happened in the 1970s could be given to X-Men writer [[Chris Claremont]]: his portrayals of Storm, Jean Grey, Emma Frost, Kitty Pryde, Rogue and Psylocke in The Uncanny X-Men (as well as his work on Ms. Marvel, Spider-Woman, Misty Knight and Coleen Wing) became known in the industry and amongst fandom as \"Claremont Women\": smart, powerful, capable, multi-faceted women super heroes.\n\nDuring the events of Alan Moore's iconic work ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', [[Barbara Gordon]], a.k.a. [[Batgirl]] is crippled by the Joker. She eventually made the best of her situation to become Oracle, a vital information broker for the [[DC Universe]]'s superhero community who also leads her own superhero team, the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].\n\n===Modern Age of Comic Books===\nIn the [[1990s in comics|90s]], a popular feminist comic book girl was [[Tank Girl]] (by [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Alan Martin (writer)|Alan Martin]]), who sported punk-influenced clothing and a shaved head. After becoming a figurehead in ''[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]'' magazine, her popularity was such that [[Tank Girl (film)|a movie]] was eventually made. She represented the new modern woman as one who no longer had to live under traditional images of beauty or manners.\n\nDue to the fan\u2013based nature of the comic book industry, many of the readers feel, either directly or indirectly, that they are involved in a social practice.<ref name=blacksuperheroes129>By Jeffrey A.

Even if a female character isn't sexualized, there are still characteristics that give way to womanhood. There is a habit amongst cartoonists when they characterize their animals as females.  Around the 1980s was when the over sexualization between both male and females rose. Males became even taller, muscular, and smarter. Females, too, became taller, but only in the legs. Their breast proportions became exaggerated, as well as their waist.\n\nCharacterizations of women as sex objects has declined in recent decades, as have depictions of women as victims of physical brutality have significantly decreased over the past 20 years.

Web. 19 Dec. 2016.</ref> It has been debated whether the perceived lack of female readership was due to male writers being uncomfortable with writing about or for women, or whether the comic book industry is male dominated due to actual lack of women's interest in comics.<ref name=CBnation250/>\n\n=== Introduction of the Comics Code Authority ===\nThere is a historical context for the lack of female representation in comics. In 1954, the comics industry was attacked by concerned parents, psychologists, and politicians. These individuals were concerned that comic books were unfit for children. Superheroines, who had made their debut in 1941, were a major focus; \"Foremost on the agendas of the anti-comics crusade were concerns that gender roles were bent in the stories, allowing characters like [[Wonder Woman]] to act out lesbian and sadomasochistic fantasies.\"<ref name=\"Supermom1228\" /> Hollywood, which had undergone similar attacks in the past, had created a self-governed Production Code, which was then imitated by the comic book industry with the creation of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. \"The code policed the visual, textual, and thematic content of all comic books published after 1954, and is still active\u2014in diluted form\u2014today. Because of this, superhero comics made after 1954 tended to appease conservative ideology, and gender roles appeared rooted in tradition.\"<ref name=\"Supermom1228\" />\n\n=== Feminism in comics ===\nThe enforcement of gender roles within comics continued well past the 1950s. The roles of women in comics during the 1960s and 70s shifted to become more diverse and began to extend past traditional roles as a result of the civil rights movement, second wave feminism, and the sexual revolution, when more women in society were taking on predominantly male professions and advocating for social rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the 1970s, female characters in comics and other mainstream media were sometimes depicted as \"playing with the boys\" and taking more traditionally male-dominated roles, though they still tended to be cast as love interests or to take maternal roles.<ref name=\"Supermom1228\">{{cite journal|last1=D'Amore|first1=Laura Mattoon|title=The Accidental Supermom: Superheroines and Maternal Performativity, 1963-1980|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=1 December 2012|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1226\u20131233|ref=26|doi=10.1111/jpcu.12006|url=https://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context=fcas_fp}}</ref> Prominent superheroines that were introduced during this period in comics were Spider-Woman, Ms. Marvel, the Cat, and Valkyrie.<ref>(Lent, J.

The view that comic book reading was a hobby strictly for males created a hostile environment for the female comic book reader. Women that read comics were often viewed as \"doing womanhood wrong\" or as individuals that \"read comics wrong.\" This led to a cyclical pattern of hostility towards females in the comic book audience. Author Douglas Wolk states \"I remember seeing a Marvel sales plan, sometime in the early '90s-a huge document, several hundred pages long; near the back, a little section labeled \"Female Readers\" listed the two titles Marvel published for half of their potential audience: Barbie and Barbie Fashion.\"<ref name=\"Reading Comics\" />\n\nIn the 1980s there was a shift in the way comics were written; instead of treating each issue of a comic as if it were the reader's first issue, or an \"on ramp\", as it had been done previously,<ref name=\"Reading Comics\" /> comics began to be written in a way that demanded continuous readership from the beginning of a series in order for the plot to be understood. It is possible that this may have led to a further decline in female readership, as the female readers that might have tried to start during this era would find themselves confused and lost.\n\n[[Carol Danvers]], a superhero who has been known as Ms. Marvel, Binary, and Captain Marvel, is one of Marvel's most popular female superheroes, and has been considered a feminist icon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/10/28/marvel-first-female-superhero-powerful/|title=Carol Danvers, Marvel's first female superhero, is also the most powerful|last=Dickey|first=Josh|website=Mashable|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref> She is considered one of the strongest superheroes created by Marvel.\n\n=== Sexualized superheroes ===\nDuring the late 1980s, comics had undergone a stylistic shift in terms of character proportions. The sexual characteristics of comic book characters became more exaggerated, which affected both male and female characters. Male characters were typically drawn with bigger muscles, smaller heads, broader shoulders and chests. Female characters developed larger breasts and rears, very thin waists, longer legs, large lips, and more revealing costumes. While male characters generally had a variety of poses, females often were drawn in suggestive poses that further accentuated their breasts and rears. Female characters that were deemed to be empower feminist views were also portrayed in a sexualized manner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantasy-magazine.com/non-fiction/articles/the-objectification-of-women-in-graphic-novels/|title=The Objectification of Women in Comic Books {{!}} Fantasy Magazine|website=www.fantasy-magazine.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref> The trend has become the target of satire by feminists, especially on websites like [[The Hawkeye Initiative]].\n\n=== Independent comics ===\nIn addition, many female readers sway towards [[Independent comics|independent]] works, where there is a lot more female representation. The independent comics industry, whose products are often referred to as indies, have become a huge source of authentically represented females in comics. More women than ever before are becoming comic book artists and writers, and many of them have flocked to the independent industry. This, combined with a large female readership, has resulted in greatly increased numbers of female-driven stories in this industry. [[Manga]], another form of graphic novel, has also led to a rise in female readership of comics. The trend towards [[Sexualization|hyper-sexualized]] female characters in mainstream comics is part of the reason that independent comics have become so popular among women; independent artists, regardless of gender, tend to draw both male and female characters in a similar style. When those characters do have noticeable sex characteristics, such as breasts or broader shoulders, they are not exaggerated to the point that they are in the mainstream comic book industry.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/gender/trinarobbins.htm|title=Gender Differences in Comics by Trina Robbins|website=www.imageandnarrative.be|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Robbins\">{{cite journal|date=September 2002|title=Gender Difference in Comics|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/gender/trinarobbins.htm|journal=Image & Narrative|issue=4|ref=28|last1=Robbins|first1=Trina|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== LGBTQ superheroes ===\nRecently LGBTQ superheroes are becoming more prevalent and available. In 2011 Batwoman DC reinvented Batwoman from a casual sidekick in need of saving to an independent, lesbian superheroine. This version fights back against female stereotypes, and lacks the traditional female superhero physique. Her body sports more muscles and less chest and hip padding. She also lacks the traditional long flowing hair, instead sporting a short cut. She fights the more grotesque images of womanhood including the gorgons, her undead mother, and the ghost of her previous incarnation.<ref>Race, Kristen Coppess.

She first appeared in 1975. In several reincarnations of the X-Men, she is the leader.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #201\n</ref>\n\n[[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau)]] first appeared in 1982, and received her own comic in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/3833/|title=GCD :: Series :: Captain Marvel|website=www.comics.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref> Captain Marvel had the power to transform herself into any form of energy, and obtains the properties of that energy. She has also joined [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] on several occasions.<ref>The Avengers #273-277</ref> There are several other characters who have the name [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], one of the most famous being [[Carol Danvers]], who is white.\n\nDespite the growth of black females in comic books after the Civil Rights Movement, there still continues to be a lack of black women in comic books. When black women are presented in comic books, they are often not fully human, like Storm, and are given stereotyped features and powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/columns/johnson/031218.shtml |title=PopMatters {{!}} Columns {{!}} Lynne d Johnson {{!}} Black Thoughtware {{!}} Bearing the Black Female Body as Witness in Sci-Fi |date=2008-04-23 |access-date=2016-12-19 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423011821/http://www.popmatters.com/columns/johnson/031218.shtml |archivedate=2008-04-23 }}</ref> Oftentimes, black comic book characters are stereotyped with ghetto characteristics.

I think super hero comics has stopped hearing the bells for a long time, but now you have other people coming in from the outside and [the gender issues in super hero comics are] very apparent.
