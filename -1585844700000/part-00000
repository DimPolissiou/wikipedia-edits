Hamad goes on to attend High school education at the same school from 1962\u20131963.\n\nAfter completing high school in December 1963, for the next nine years (1964\u20131972), he was prevented from pursuing University Education because he was required to fill in one of the vacancies in the civil service caused by the mass departure of British officials in 1964,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maalimseifforpresident.net/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023123919/http://www.maalimseifforpresident.net/about.html |archivedate=2010-10-23 }}</ref> after being asked to do so by the new Zanzibar Revolutionary Government. He was posted to teach in Secondary Schools, before joining [[University of Dar es Salaam]] in 1972\u20131975, and graduated with B.A. (Honors) in Political Science, Public Administration and International Relations.\n\n==Political career==\nHamad served as Member of the Zanzibar Revolutionary Council and Zanzibar Minister of Education (1977\u20131980), founding member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives (1980\u20131989) and Member of Tanzanian Parliament (1977), Member of the Central Committee and National Executive Committee of Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) - Tanzaniania's Ruling Party (1977\u20131987), Head of the Economic and Planning Department of the CCM (1982\u20131987) and  [[Heads of Government of Zanzibar|Chief Minister]] of [[Zanzibar]] from 6 February 1984 to 22 January 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.es/personal2/monolith/tanzania.htm|title=Political Leaders:Tanzania}}</ref> Soon after his dismissal, he was expelled from the sole legal party, [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM), after disputes with party officials.

The first multiparty elections took place in 1995 and Hamad was the CUF's candidate for the [[List of Presidents of Zanzibar|Presidency of Zanzibar]]. He was narrowly defeated by CCM candidate [[Salmin Amour]], winning 49.76% of the vote to Amour's 50.24%. Observers noted serious irregularities in the poll and the CUF rejected the result as rigged.\n\nHamad was again defeated in the 2000 elections by CCM candidate [[Amani Abeid Karume]]. He received 32.96% of the vote to Karume's 67.04%. Observers condemned the poll citing widespread irregularities and instances of [[intimidation]] of opposition supporters by the security forces. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] team described the election as a 'shambles'.\n\nOn 26 and 27 January 2001, more than forty five CUF supporters were gunned down by Tanzanian Security Forces in peaceful demonstration called to protest the imposition of Zanzibar Government against the will of the people. This led to the ruling CCM party and opposition CUF to have a dialogue that resulted in signing MUAFAKA II, a peace accord designed to ensure electoral and constitutional reforms. Most of the planned reforms were not implemented by the government, including, crucially, an agreed credible voter's register prior to the elections of October 2005.\n\nIn the 30 October 2005 election, according to official results, Hamad was again defeated by Amani Abeid Karume, winning 46.07% of the vote to Karume's 53.18%. CUF disputed the election and refused to recognise Karume as President.  International observers, such as the Commonwealth, and National Democratic Institute again noted serious concerns with the fairness of the poll, and the United States boycotted the swearing-in ceremony of Abeid Karume as President.\n\nThe union elections in December 2005 followed a similar pattern on Zanzibar with CUF carrying Pemba but not Unguja.\nOn 31 October 2010, Tanzanians vote to elect President of Tanzania and Zanzibar and Hamad runs for election, alongside Dr [[Ali Mohamed Shein]] of the ruling party CCM who was declared the winner on Monday, 1 November 2010, scooping 179,809 votes against 175,338 votes of Hamad. \nDr Shein's victory is equal to 50.1 per cent of all the 364,924 votes cast while Hamad garnered 49.1 per cent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201011020981.html|title=Tanzania: Isles Picks Shein for President|last=Mushi|first=Deogratias|date=2010-11-02|work=Tanzania Daily News (Dar es Salaam)|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref>\nIn October 2015 Hamad won the election by 25000 votes against Incumbent Ali Mohamed Sheni  but the election commission canceled the election after noticing ruling party had lost the election.

On 21 September 2019, he scored his first goal with the club with a kick after a [[Kiril Despodov]]'s corner in an away 3-3 draw against [[SV Mattersburg]]. The Greek defender, who has been irreplaceable this season in Sturm Graz's backline, produced a cheeky back-heel assist to register his second assist of the season. As a result of his excellent form, was included in the Best XI for matchday 18 in the Austrian Football Bundesliga. <ref>[https://www.ligaportal.at/bundesliga/spielberichte/5477-3-3-spektakulaeres-remis-zwischen-mattersburg-und-sturm-graz 3:3!

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones. The Posidonia Shale is considered to be the reference formation for the Lower Toarcian section.<ref>R\u00f6hl, H. J., & Schmid-R\u00f6hl, A. (2005).

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%.

The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

Although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons <65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost. Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last 9 months of 2009. The majority (62\u201385%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe. The model attributed 148,000\u2013249,000 respiratory deaths to influenza in an average pre-pandemic season, with only 19% in persons <65 years of age.<ref name=\"mortality estimate worldwide\">{{cite journal |last=Simonsen |first=Lone |last2=Spreeuwenberg |first2=Peter |last3=Lustig |first3=Roger |last4=Taylor |first4=Robert J. |last5=Fleming |first5=Douglas M. |last6=Kroneman |first6=Madelon |last7=Van Kerkhove |first7=Maria D. |last8=Mounts |first8=Anthony W. |last9=Paget |first9=W.

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%.

The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

Although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons <65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost. Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last 9 months of 2009. The majority (62\u201385%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe.

The word \"ethics\" is \"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality', and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual.\"<ref>John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.</ref> Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially [[deontological ethics]], sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: \"Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of [[Immanuel Kant]], based on notions such as duty, obligation, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] of conduct, reserving ethics for the more [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a [[virtue]], and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations.\"<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Simon Blackburn|last = Blackburn|first = Simon |title = Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|edition = 2nd|date = 2008|page = 240|isbn = 978-0199541430|title-link = Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy}}</ref>\n\n===Descriptive and normative===\nIn its descriptive sense, \"morality\" refers to [[Value (personal and cultural)|personal or cultural values]], [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] or social [[mores]] from a society that provides these codes of conduct in which it applies and is accepted by an individual. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong. [[Descriptive ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.<ref name=\"Gert\">{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/morality-definition/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Gert|first=Bernard|last2=Gert|first2=Joshua|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn its [[normative]] sense, \"morality\" refers to whatever (if anything) is ''actually'' right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. [[Normative ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.<ref name=\"Gert\"/>\n\n===Realism and anti-realism===\nPhilosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of [[meta-ethics]]) are broadly divided into two classes:\n* [[Moral realism]] is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts. For example, while they might concede that forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] significantly shape individuals' \"moral\" decisions, they deny that those cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[convention (norm)|customs]] define morally right behavior. This may be the philosophical view propounded by [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]], however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. [[ethical non-naturalism|ethical non-naturalists]]).<ref>[[Georges Chapouthier|Chapouthier, Georges]], \"To what extent is moral judgment natural?\", ''European Review'' (GB), 2004, 12(2): 179\u201383</ref>\n* Moral [[anti-realism]], on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts. Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts ([[error theory]]); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts ([[ethical subjectivism]]); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command ([[non-cognitivism]]).\n\nSome forms of non-cognitivism and ethical [[subjectivism]], while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with [[moral universalism]]. For example, [[universal prescriptivism]] is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and [[divine command theory]] and [[ideal observer theory]] are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.\n\n==Anthropology==\n\n===Tribal and territorial===\n[[Celia Green]] made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality.<ref name=\"Green\">Green, Celia (2004). ''Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Chapters I\u2013XX.</ref> She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person's territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and 'flexible', whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s '[[categorical imperative]]' and [[Norman Geisler|Geisler]]'s [[graded absolutism]]. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.\n\n===In-group and out-group===\n{{main|In-group and out-group}}\nSome observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an \"[[in-group]]\" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same group) or an \"out-group\" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution.<ref>T.R. Shultz, M. Hartshorn, and A. Kaznatcheev.

P. Seligman. ''Character Strengths and Virtues''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref> approach the anthropological view looking across cultures, geo-cultural areas and across millennia. They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include ''wisdom / knowledge; courage; [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]]; justice; temperance; and transcendence''. Each of these includes several divisions. For instance ''humanity'' includes ''[[love]]'', ''[[kindness]]'', and ''social intelligence''.\n\nStill, others theorize that morality is not always absolute, contending that moral issues often differ along cultural lines. A 2014 PEW research study among several nations illuminates significant cultural differences among issues commonly related to morality, including divorce, extramarital affairs, homosexuality, gambling, abortion, alcohol use, contraceptive use, and premarital sex. Each of the 40 countries in this study has a range of percentages according to what percentage of each country believes the common moral issues are acceptable, unacceptable, or not moral issues at all. Each percentage regarding the significance of the moral issue varies greatly on the culture in which the moral issue is presented.<ref>Pew Research http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/04/15/global-morality/table/alcohol-use/).</ref>\n\nAdvocates of a theory known as moral relativism subscribe to the notion that moral virtues are right or wrong only within the context of a certain standpoint (e.g., cultural community).  In other words, what is morally acceptable in one culture may be taboo in another.  They further contend that no moral virtue can objectively be proven right or wrong <ref>(Westacott, https://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-re/#SH2g).</ref>  Critics of moral relativism point to historical atrocities such as infanticide, slavery, or genocide as counter arguments, noting the difficulty in accepting these actions simply through cultural lenses.\n\n[[Fons Trompenaars]], author of ''Did the Pedestrian Die?'', tested members of different cultures with various [[moral dilemma]]s. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAYKAQAAMAAJ|title=Did the Pedestrian Die: Insights from the World's Greatest Culture!|last=Trompenaars|first=Fons|date=2003-03-14|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781841124360|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n{{See also|Altruism#Evolutionary explanations|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}\n\nThe development of modern morality is a process closely tied to [[sociocultural evolution]]. Some [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], particularly [[Sociobiology|sociobiologists]], believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through [[group selection]] (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved \"pro-social\" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.\n\nOn this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically driven behaviors which encourage human [[cooperation]]. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate [[selfishness]] in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.<ref name=\"shermer\">{{Cite book\n|title=The Science of Good and Evil\n|isbn=978-0-8050-7520-5\n|last=Shermer\n|first=Michael\n|authorlink=Michael Shermer\n|chapter=Transcendent Morality\n|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eevvWAcMBaAC&pg=PA19&dq=shermer+exegesis&ei=EIC1SNOiE4uWyATTmaj2Bg&sig=ACfU3U3KFh8kP8Ns8-YgpqBuI03N1JrpEg\n|title-link=The Science of Good and Evil\n|date=2004-02-02\n}}</ref>\n\nOn this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]). Examples: the [[maternal bond]] is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the [[Westermarck effect]], where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins [[Incest taboo|taboos against incest]] because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as [[inbreeding]].\n\n<!-- kinship altruism theory -->\n<!-- handicap altruism theory -->\n<!-- reputation theory -->\n<!-- reciprocity theory -->\nThe phenomenon of [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some [[vampire bat]]s fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus. Bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)\n\nMarc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g., wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees). They define morality as \"a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups.\" This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness.<ref>Bekoff, Marc and Jessica Pierce ''Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals'' (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press 2009)</ref> In related work, it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show [[empathy]] for each other in a wide variety of contexts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Connell |first= Sanjida |date=July 1995|title= Empathy in chimpanzees: Evidence for theory of mind? |journal= Primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 397\u2013410|issn= 0032-8332 |url=  |quote=|doi= 10.1007/BF02382862 }}</ref> They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social politics<ref>{{cite book|title = Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals|last = de Waal|first = Frans|date = 1997|publisher = Harvard University Press |isbn = 978-0674356610}}</ref> prototypical of our own tendencies for [[gossip]] and [[reputation management]].\n<!-- [[hypocrisy]] Johnathan Haidt -->\n\nChristopher Boehm (1982)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boehm|first=Christopher|title=The evolutionary development of morality as an effect of dominance behaviour and conflict interference|journal=Journal of Social and Biological Sciences|year=1982|volume=5|issue=4 |pages=413\u201322|doi= 10.1016/s0140-1750(82)92069-3}}</ref> has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout [[Great ape|hominid]] evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons.

A number of psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Elliot Turiel]] have cognitive-developmental approaches to [[moral development]]; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains. In the [[Ethics of care]] approach established by [[Carol Gilligan]], moral development occurs in the context of caring, mutually responsive relationships  which are based on [[interdependence]], particularly in parenting but also in social relationships generally.<ref>Gilligan and Kohlberg: \"Implications for Moral Theory\" Author(s): Lawrence A.

Moral identity theorists, such as [[William Damon]] and [[Mordechai Nisan]], see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of [[psychoanalyst]]s such as [[Sigmund Freud]], who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the [[super-ego]] as guilt-shame avoidance.\n\nBecause we are naturally prone to be empathic and moral, we have a sense of responsibility to pursue moral purposes,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Decety | first = Jean | year = 2008 | title = Study shows Children are naturally prone to be empathic and moral | url = http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/07/11/children-are-naturally-prone-be-empathic-and-moral-university-chicago-study-shows | journal = University of Chicago}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J | last2 = Michalska | first2 = KJ | last3 = Akitsuki | first3 = Y | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the Pain?

According to this investigation, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral\njudgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So why\nwere moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. On the basis of this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other\nmorally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Camprodon |first2= Joan Albert |last3= Hauser |first3= Marc |last4= Pascual-Leone |first4= Alvaro |last5= Saxe |first5= Rebecca |year= 2010 |title= Disruption of the right temporoparietal junction with transcranial magnetic stimulation reduces the role of beliefs in moral judgments |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |volume= 107 |issue= 15 |pages= 6753\u201358 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0914826107 |pmid=20351278 |pmc=2872442|bibcode= 2010PNAS..107.6753Y }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly VMPC-impaired persons will judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Bechara |first2= Antoine |last3= Tranel |first3= Daniel |last4= Damasio |first4= Hanna |last5= Hauser |first5= Marc |last6= Damasio |first6= Antonio |year= 2010 |title= Damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex impairs judgment of harmful intent |journal= Neuron |volume= 65 |issue= 6 |pages= 845\u201351 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.03.003 |pmid=20346759 |pmc=3085837}}</ref>\n\n===Mirror neurons===\n[[Mirror neuron]]s are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action.

Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogenous communities, in contrast to [[port]]-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.\n\nGroup morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess \"moral fiber\", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of [[Cistercian]] reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Dowager Empress]] in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content.\nPolitical Morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population.

There are many types of religious value systems. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]], define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. Other religions spanning [[pantheistic]] to [[nontheistic]] tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong.<ref>Peggy Morgan, \"Buddhism.\" In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages= 61, 88\u201389}}</ref> A further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by [[Barbara Stoler Miller]], who states that, in Hinduism, \"practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and [[egalitarianism]], this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last=  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-553-21365-2 |page= 3}}</ref>\n\nReligions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas.

Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, \"the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious [[piety]] and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere.\"<ref>[[David Hume]], \"The Natural History of Religion.\" In {{cite book|title=The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|titlelink=The Portable Atheist|editor-last=Hitchens|editor-first=Christopher|editorlink=Christopher Hitchens|year= 2007|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-306-81608-6|page=30}}</ref>\n\nReligious value systems can diverge from commonly held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]].

[[Descriptive ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.<ref name=\"Gert\">{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/morality-definition/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Gert|first=Bernard|last2=Gert|first2=Joshua|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn its [[normative]] sense, \"morality\" refers to whatever (if anything) is ''actually'' right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. [[Normative ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.<ref name=\"Gert\"/>\n\n===Realism and anti-realism===\nPhilosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of [[meta-ethics]]) are broadly divided into two classes:\n* [[Moral realism]] is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts. For example, while they might concede that forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] significantly shape individuals' \"moral\" decisions, they deny that those cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[convention (norm)|customs]] define morally right behavior. This may be the philosophical view propounded by [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]], however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. [[ethical non-naturalism|ethical non-naturalists]]).<ref>[[Georges Chapouthier|Chapouthier, Georges]], \"To what extent is moral judgment natural?\", ''European Review'' (GB), 2004, 12(2): 179\u201383</ref>\n* Moral [[anti-realism]], on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts. Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts ([[error theory]]); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts ([[ethical subjectivism]]); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command ([[non-cognitivism]]).\n\nSome forms of non-cognitivism and ethical [[subjectivism]], while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with [[moral universalism]]. For example, [[universal prescriptivism]] is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and [[divine command theory]] and [[ideal observer theory]] are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.\n\n==Anthropology==\n\n===Tribal and territorial===\n[[Celia Green]] made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality.<ref name=\"Green\">Green, Celia (2004). ''Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Chapters I\u2013XX.</ref> She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person's territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and 'flexible', whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s '[[categorical imperative]]' and [[Norman Geisler|Geisler]]'s [[graded absolutism]]. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.\n\n===In-group and out-group===\n{{main|In-group and out-group}}\nSome observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an \"[[in-group]]\" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same group) or an \"out-group\" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution.<ref>T.R. Shultz, M. Hartshorn, and A. Kaznatcheev.

P. Seligman. ''Character Strengths and Virtues''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref> approach the anthropological view looking across cultures, geo-cultural areas and across millennia. They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include ''wisdom / knowledge; courage; [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]]; justice; temperance; and transcendence''. Each of these includes several divisions. For instance ''humanity'' includes ''[[love]]'', ''[[kindness]]'', and ''social intelligence''.\n\nStill, others theorize that morality is not always absolute, contending that moral issues often differ along cultural lines. A 2014 PEW research study among several nations illuminates significant cultural differences among issues commonly related to morality, including divorce, extramarital affairs, homosexuality, gambling, abortion, alcohol use, contraceptive use, and premarital sex. Each of the 40 countries in this study has a range of percentages according to what percentage of each country believes the common moral issues are acceptable, unacceptable, or not moral issues at all. Each percentage regarding the significance of the moral issue varies greatly on the culture in which the moral issue is presented.<ref>Pew Research http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/04/15/global-morality/table/alcohol-use/).</ref>\n\nAdvocates of a theory known as moral relativism subscribe to the notion that moral virtues are right or wrong only within the context of a certain standpoint (e.g., cultural community).  In other words, what is morally acceptable in one culture may be taboo in another.  They further contend that no moral virtue can objectively be proven right or wrong <ref>(Westacott, https://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-re/#SH2g).</ref>  Critics of moral relativism point to historical atrocities such as infanticide, slavery, or genocide as counter arguments, noting the difficulty in accepting these actions simply through cultural lenses.\n\n[[Fons Trompenaars]], author of ''Did the Pedestrian Die?'', tested members of different cultures with various [[moral dilemma]]s. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAYKAQAAMAAJ|title=Did the Pedestrian Die: Insights from the World's Greatest Culture!|last=Trompenaars|first=Fons|date=2003-03-14|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781841124360|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n{{See also|Altruism#Evolutionary explanations|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}\n\nThe development of modern morality is a process closely tied to [[sociocultural evolution]]. Some [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], particularly [[Sociobiology|sociobiologists]], believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through [[group selection]] (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved \"pro-social\" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.\n\nOn this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically driven behaviors which encourage human [[cooperation]]. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate [[selfishness]] in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.<ref name=\"shermer\">{{Cite book\n|title=The Science of Good and Evil\n|isbn=978-0-8050-7520-5\n|last=Shermer\n|first=Michael\n|authorlink=Michael Shermer\n|chapter=Transcendent Morality\n|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eevvWAcMBaAC&pg=PA19&dq=shermer+exegesis&ei=EIC1SNOiE4uWyATTmaj2Bg&sig=ACfU3U3KFh8kP8Ns8-YgpqBuI03N1JrpEg\n|title-link=The Science of Good and Evil\n|date=2004-02-02\n}}</ref>\n\nOn this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]). Examples: the [[maternal bond]] is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the [[Westermarck effect]], where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins [[Incest taboo|taboos against incest]] because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as [[inbreeding]].\n\n<!-- kinship altruism theory -->\n<!-- handicap altruism theory -->\n<!-- reputation theory -->\n<!-- reciprocity theory -->\nThe phenomenon of [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some [[vampire bat]]s fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus.

A number of psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Elliot Turiel]] have cognitive-developmental approaches to [[moral development]]; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains.

According to this investigation, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral\njudgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So why\nwere moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. On the basis of this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other\nmorally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Camprodon |first2= Joan Albert |last3= Hauser |first3= Marc |last4= Pascual-Leone |first4= Alvaro |last5= Saxe |first5= Rebecca |year= 2010 |title= Disruption of the right temporoparietal junction with transcranial magnetic stimulation reduces the role of beliefs in moral judgments |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |volume= 107 |issue= 15 |pages= 6753\u201358 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0914826107 |pmid=20351278 |pmc=2872442|bibcode= 2010PNAS..107.6753Y }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly VMPC-impaired persons will judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Bechara |first2= Antoine |last3= Tranel |first3= Daniel |last4= Damasio |first4= Hanna |last5= Hauser |first5= Marc |last6= Damasio |first6= Antonio |year= 2010 |title= Damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex impairs judgment of harmful intent |journal= Neuron |volume= 65 |issue= 6 |pages= 845\u201351 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.03.003 |pmid=20346759 |pmc=3085837}}</ref>\n\n===Mirror neurons===\n[[Mirror neuron]]s are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action.

Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogenous communities, in contrast to [[port]]-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.\n\nGroup morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess \"moral fiber\", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of [[Cistercian]] reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Dowager Empress]] in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content.\nPolitical Morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population.

There are many types of religious value systems. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]], define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. Other religions spanning [[pantheistic]] to [[nontheistic]] tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong.<ref>Peggy Morgan, \"Buddhism.\" In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages= 61, 88\u201389}}</ref> A further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by [[Barbara Stoler Miller]], who states that, in Hinduism, \"practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and [[egalitarianism]], this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last=  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-553-21365-2 |page= 3}}</ref>\n\nReligions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it \"may be inevitable and indeed necessary\" in certain circumstances.<ref>Werner Menski, \"Hinduism.\" In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}</ref> In monotheistic traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]].{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Religion is not always positively associated with morality. Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, \"the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious [[piety]] and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere.\"<ref>[[David Hume]], \"The Natural History of Religion.\" In {{cite book|title=The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|titlelink=The Portable Atheist|editor-last=Hitchens|editor-first=Christopher|editorlink=Christopher Hitchens|year= 2007|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-306-81608-6|page=30}}</ref>\n\nReligious value systems can diverge from commonly held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]].

The term [[concentration camp]] grew in prominence during that period. The camps had originally been set up by the British Army as [[refugee camps]] in order to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for any reason which was related to the war. However, when [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|the Earl Kitchener]] took command of the British forces in late 1900, he introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the [[Boer Commando|guerrilla campaign]] and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result. An epidemic of measles killed thousands.<ref>Fetter, B., & Kessler, S. (1996). Scars from a Childhood Disease: Measles in the Concentration Camps during the Boer War. Social Science History, 20(4), 593-611.</ref> According to the historian, [[Thomas Pakenham (historian)|Thomas Pakenham]], Kitchener initiated plans to flush out guerrillas in a series of systematic drives, organised like a sporting shoot, with success defined by a weekly 'bag' of killed, captured and wounded, and sweep the country bare of everything that could give sustenance to the guerrillas, including women and children&nbsp;... It was the clearance of civilians\u2014uprooting a whole nation\u2014that would come to dominate the last phase of the war.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=493}}[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lizzie van Zyl]] a [[Boer]] child, visited by [[Emily Hobhouse]] in a British [[concentration camp]]]]\n\nAs Boer farms were destroyed by the British under their \"[[Scorched Earth]]\" policy\u2014including the systematic destruction of crops and the slaughtering or removal of livestock, the burning down of homesteads and farms\u2014to prevent the Boers from resupplying themselves from a home base, many tens of thousands of men, women and children were forcibly moved into the camps.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-children-white-concentration-camps-during-anglo-boer-war-1900-1902|title=Women and Children in White Concentration Camps during the Anglo-Boer War, 1900-1902 &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref><ref>Marks, S.

Of the 28,000 Boer men who were captured as [[prisoners of war]], 25,630 were sent overseas. The vast majority of Boers who remained in the local camps were women and children. Over 26,000 women and children perished in these concentration camps.{{sfn|Wessels|2010|p=32}}\n\nThe camps were poorly administered from the outset and they became increasingly overcrowded when Kitchener's troops implemented the internment strategy on a vast scale. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene and bad sanitation. The supply of all items was unreliable, partly because of the constant disruption of communication lines by the Boers. The food [[ration]]s were meager and there was a two-tier allocation policy, whereby families of men who were still fighting were routinely given smaller rations than others.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=505}} The inadequate shelter, poor diet, bad hygiene and overcrowding led to malnutrition and endemic contagious diseases such as [[measles]], [[typhoid]] and [[dysentery]] to which the children were particularly vulnerable.{{sfn|Judd|Surridge|2013|p=195}} Coupled with a shortage of modern medical facilities, many of the internees died.\n\n==UK public opinion and political opposition==\n\nAlthough the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 UK general election]], also known as the \"Khaki election,\" had resulted in a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government on the back of recent British victories against the Boers, public support quickly waned as it became apparent that the war would not be easy and further unease developed following reports about the treatment by the British army of the Boer civilians. Public and political opposition to government policies in South Africa regarding Boer civilians was first expressed in Parliament in February 1901 in the form of an attack on the policy, the government, and the army by the radical [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP [[David Lloyd George]].\n[[File:Hobhouse.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Emily Hobhouse]] campaigned for improvement to the appalling conditions of the concentration camps. She helped to alter public opinion and to force the government to improve conditions in the camps, resulting in the [[Millicent Fawcett|Fawcett Commission]].]]\n\n[[Emily Hobhouse]], a delegate of the South African Women and Children's Distress Fund, visited some of the camps in the Orange Free State from January 1901, and in May 1901 she returned to England on board the ship, the ''Saxon''. [[Alfred Milner]], High Commissioner in South Africa, also boarded the ''Saxon'' for holiday in England but, unfortunately for both the camp internees and the British government, he had no time for Miss Hobhouse, regarding her as a Boer sympathiser and \"trouble maker.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|pp=531\u201332, 536+}}</ref> On her return, Emily Hobhouse did much to publicise the distress of the camp inmates. She managed to speak to the Liberal Party leader, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] who professed to be suitably outraged but was disinclined to press the matter, as his party was split between the imperialists and the pro-Boer factions.\n\nThe more radical Liberals however such as [[David Lloyd George]] and [[John Ellis (Liberal politician)|John Ellis]] were prepared to raise the matter in Parliament and to harass the government on the issue, which they duly did. [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|St John Brodrick]], the Conservative secretary of state for war, first defended the government's policy by arguing that the camps were purely \"voluntary\" and that the interned Boers were \"contented and comfortable,\" but was somewhat undermined as he had no firm statistics to back up his argument, so when his \"voluntary\" argument proved untenable, he resorted to the \"military necessity\" argument and stated that everything possible was being done to ensure satisfactory conditions in the camps.\n\nHobhouse published a report in June 1901 that contradicted Brodrick's claim, and Lloyd George then openly accused the government of \"a policy of extermination\" directed against the Boer population. The same month Liberal opposition party leader Campbell-Bannerman took up the assault and answered the rhetorical question \"When is a war not a war?\" with his own rhetorical answer \"When it is carried on by methods of barbarism in South Africa,\" referring to those same camps and the policies that created them. The Hobhouse report caused uproar both domestically and in the international community. However, there was very little public sympathy for the highly reactionary Boer president [[Paul Kruger]].\n\n==The Fawcett Commission==\n\nAlthough the government had comfortably won the parliamentary debate by a margin of 252 to 149, it was stung by the criticism and concerned by the escalating public outcry, it called on Kitchener for a detailed report. In response, complete statistical returns from camps were sent out in July 1901. By August 1901, it was clear to government and opposition alike that Miss Hobhouse's worst fears were being confirmed \u2013 93,940 Boers and 24,457 black Africans were reported to be in \"camps of refuge\" and the crisis was becoming a catastrophe as the death rates appeared very high, especially among the children.\n\nThe government responded to the growing clamour by appointing a commission.{{efn|A personal copy of Millicent Fawcett's report, together with extensive photographs and inserts, is available for consultation at [http://www.thewomenslibrary.ac.uk The Women's Library], Old Castle Street, London E1 7NT, archive reference 7MGF/E/1}} The Fawcett Commission, as it became known was, uniquely for its time, an all-woman affair headed by [[Millicent Fawcett]] who despite being the leader of the women's suffrage movement was a [[Liberal Unionist]] and thus a government supporter and considered a safe pair of hands.  Between August and December 1901, the Fawcett Commission conducted its own tour of the camps in South Africa.  While it is probable that the British government expected the Commission to produce a report that could be used to fend off criticism, in the end it confirmed everything that Emily Hobhouse had said.  Indeed, if anything the Commission's recommendations went even further.  The Commission insisted that rations should be increased and that additional nurses be sent out immediately, and included a long list of other practical measures designed to improve conditions in the camp.  Millicent Fawcett was quite blunt in expressing her opinion that much of the catastrophe was owed to a simple failure to observe elementary rules of [[hygiene]].\n\nIn November 1901, the Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] ordered Alfred Milner to ensure that \"all possible steps are being taken to reduce the rate of mortality.\"  The civil authority took over the running of the camps from Kitchener and the British command and by February 1902 the annual death-rate in the concentration camps for white inmates dropped to 6.9 percent and eventually to 2 percent. However, by then the damage had been done.  A report after the war concluded that 27,927 Boers (of whom 24,074 [50 percent of the Boer child population] were children under 16) had died in the camps.  In all, about one in four (25 percent) of the Boer inmates, mostly children, died.\n\n\"Improvements [however] were much slower in coming to the black camps\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2002|p=235}} It is thought that about 12 percent of black African inmates died (about 14,154) but the precise number of deaths of black Africans in concentration camps is unknown as little attempt was made to keep any records of the 107,000 black Africans who were interned.\n\n{{quote|The main decisions (or their absence) had been left to the soldiers, to whom the life or death of the 154,000 Boer and African civilians in the camps rated as an abysmally low priority. [It was only]&nbsp;... ten months after the subject had first been raised in Parliament&nbsp;... [and after public outcry and after the Fawcett Commission that remedial action was taken and]&nbsp;... the terrible mortality figures were at last declining. In the interval, at least twenty thousand whites and twelve thousand coloured people had died in the concentration camps, the majority from epidemics of measles and typhoid that could have been avoided.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=549}}</ref>{{efn|Somewhat higher figures for total deaths in the concentration camps are given some historians.{{sfn|Spies|1977|p=265}}}}}}\n\nSir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had served as a volunteer doctor in the Langman Field Hospital at Bloemfontein between March and June 1900. In his widely distributed and translated pamphlet 'The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct' he justified both the reasonings behind the war and handling of the conflict itself. He also pointed out that over 14,000 British soldiers had died of disease during the conflict (as opposed to 8,000 killed in combat) and at the height of epidemics he was seeing 50\u201360 British soldiers dying each day in a single ill-equipped and overwhelmed military hospital.\n\n==Kitchener's policy and the post-war debate==\n\nIt has been argued that \"this was not a deliberately genocidal policy; rather it was the result of [a] disastrous lack of foresight and rank incompetence on [the] part of the [British] military\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2002|p=250}} British historian [[Niall Ferguson]] also argues that \"Kitchener no more desired the deaths of women and children in the camps than of the wounded [[Dervishes]] after [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]], or of his own soldiers in the typhoid stricken hospitals of [[Bloemfontein]].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=524}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener - Project Gutenberg eText 15306.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] was one of the most controversial British generals in the war.

This was disingenuous as the countryside had by then been devastated under the \"Scorched Earth\" policy (the Fawcett Commission in December 1901 in its recommendations commented that: \"to turn 100,000 people now being held in the concentration camps out on the veldt to take care of themselves would be cruelty\") and now that the New Model counter insurgency tactics were in full swing, it made cynical military sense to leave the Boer families in desperate conditions in the countryside.\n\nIt was according to one historian {{citation needed|date=March 2020}} that \"at [the Vereeniging negotiations in May 1902] Boer leader Louis Botha asserted that he had tried to send [Boer] families to the British, but they had refused to receive them.\" Quoting a Boer commandant referring to Boer women and children made refugees by Britain's scorched-earth policy as saying, \"Our families are in a pitiable condition and the enemy uses those families to force us to surrender&nbsp;...and there is little doubt that that was indeed the intention of Kitchener when he had issued instructions that no more families were to be brought into the concentration camps.\" [[Thomas Pakenham (historian)|Thomas Pakenham]] writes of Kitchener's policy U-turn,\n<blockquote>No doubt the continued 'hullabaloo' at the death-rate in these concentration camps, and Milner's belated agreement to take over their administration, helped change Kitchener's mind [some time at the end of 1901].&nbsp;... By mid-December at any rate, Kitchener was already circulating all column commanders with instructions not to bring in women and children when they cleared the country, but to leave them with the guerrillas.&nbsp;... Viewed as a gesture to Liberals, on the eve of the new session of Parliament at Westminster, it was a shrewd political move.

The term [[concentration camp]] grew in prominence during that period. The camps had originally been set up by the British Army as [[refugee camps]] in order to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for any reason which was related to the war. However, when [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|the Earl Kitchener]] took command of the British forces in late 1900, he introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the [[Boer Commando|guerrilla campaign]] and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result. An epidemic of measles killed thousands.<ref>Fetter, B., & Kessler, S. (1996). Scars from a Childhood Disease: Measles in the Concentration Camps during the Boer War. Social Science History, 20(4), 593-611.</ref> According to the historian, [[Thomas Pakenham (historian)|Thomas Pakenham]], Kitchener initiated plans to flush out guerrillas in a series of systematic drives, organised like a sporting shoot, with success defined by a weekly 'bag' of killed, captured and wounded, and sweep the country bare of everything that could give sustenance to the guerrillas, including women and children&nbsp;...

Of the 28,000 Boer men who were captured as [[prisoners of war]], 25,630 were sent overseas. The vast majority of Boers who remained in the local camps were women and children. Over 26,000 women and children perished in these concentration camps.{{sfn|Wessels|2010|p=32}}\n\nThe camps were poorly administered from the outset and they became increasingly overcrowded when Kitchener's troops implemented the internment strategy on a vast scale. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene and bad sanitation. The supply of all items was unreliable, partly because of the constant disruption of communication lines by the Boers. The food [[ration]]s were meager and there was a two-tier allocation policy, whereby families of men who were still fighting were routinely given smaller rations than others.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=505}} The inadequate shelter, poor diet, bad hygiene and overcrowding led to malnutrition and endemic contagious diseases such as [[measles]], [[typhoid]] and [[dysentery]] to which the children were particularly vulnerable.{{sfn|Judd|Surridge|2013|p=195}} Coupled with a shortage of modern medical facilities, many of the internees died.\n\n==UK public opinion and political opposition==\n\nAlthough the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 UK general election]], also known as the \"Khaki election,\" had resulted in a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government on the back of recent British victories against the Boers, public support quickly waned as it became apparent that the war would not be easy and further unease developed following reports about the treatment by the British army of the Boer civilians. Public and political opposition to government policies in South Africa regarding Boer civilians was first expressed in Parliament in February 1901 in the form of an attack on the policy, the government, and the army by the radical [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP [[David Lloyd George]].\n[[File:Hobhouse.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Emily Hobhouse]] campaigned for improvement to the appalling conditions of the concentration camps. She helped to alter public opinion and to force the government to improve conditions in the camps, resulting in the [[Millicent Fawcett|Fawcett Commission]].]]\n\n[[Emily Hobhouse]], a delegate of the South African Women and Children's Distress Fund, visited some of the camps in the Orange Free State from January 1901, and in May 1901 she returned to England on board the ship, the ''Saxon''. [[Alfred Milner]], High Commissioner in South Africa, also boarded the ''Saxon'' for holiday in England but, unfortunately for both the camp internees and the British government, he had no time for Miss Hobhouse, regarding her as a Boer sympathiser and \"trouble maker.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|pp=531\u201332, 536+}}</ref> On her return, Emily Hobhouse did much to publicise the distress of the camp inmates. She managed to speak to the Liberal Party leader, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] who professed to be suitably outraged but was disinclined to press the matter, as his party was split between the imperialists and the pro-Boer factions.\n\nThe more radical Liberals however such as [[David Lloyd George]] and [[John Ellis (Liberal politician)|John Ellis]] were prepared to raise the matter in Parliament and to harass the government on the issue, which they duly did. [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|St John Brodrick]], the Conservative secretary of state for war, first defended the government's policy by arguing that the camps were purely \"voluntary\" and that the interned Boers were \"contented and comfortable,\" but was somewhat undermined as he had no firm statistics to back up his argument, so when his \"voluntary\" argument proved untenable, he resorted to the \"military necessity\" argument and stated that everything possible was being done to ensure satisfactory conditions in the camps.\n\nHobhouse published a report in June 1901 that contradicted Brodrick's claim, and Lloyd George then openly accused the government of \"a policy of extermination\" directed against the Boer population. The same month Liberal opposition party leader Campbell-Bannerman took up the assault and answered the rhetorical question \"When is a war not a war?\" with his own rhetorical answer \"When it is carried on by methods of barbarism in South Africa,\" referring to those same camps and the policies that created them. The Hobhouse report caused uproar both domestically and in the international community. However, there was very little public sympathy for the highly reactionary Boer president Kruger.\n\n==The Fawcett Commission==\n\nAlthough the government had comfortably won the parliamentary debate by a margin of 252 to 149, it was stung by the criticism and concerned by the escalating public outcry, it called on Kitchener for a detailed report. In response, complete statistical returns from camps were sent out in July 1901. By August 1901, it was clear to government and opposition alike that Miss Hobhouse's worst fears were being confirmed \u2013 93,940 Boers and 24,457 black Africans were reported to be in \"camps of refuge\" and the crisis was becoming a catastrophe as the death rates appeared very high, especially among the children.\n\nThe government responded to the growing clamour by appointing a commission.{{efn|A personal copy of Millicent Fawcett's report, together with extensive photographs and inserts, is available for consultation at [http://www.thewomenslibrary.ac.uk The Women's Library], Old Castle Street, London E1 7NT, archive reference 7MGF/E/1}} The Fawcett Commission, as it became known was, uniquely for its time, an all-woman affair headed by [[Millicent Fawcett]] who despite being the leader of the women's suffrage movement was a [[Liberal Unionist]] and thus a government supporter and considered a safe pair of hands.  Between August and December 1901, the Fawcett Commission conducted its own tour of the camps in South Africa.  While it is probable that the British government expected the Commission to produce a report that could be used to fend off criticism, in the end it confirmed everything that Emily Hobhouse had said.  Indeed, if anything the Commission's recommendations went even further.  The Commission insisted that rations should be increased and that additional nurses be sent out immediately, and included a long list of other practical measures designed to improve conditions in the camp.  Millicent Fawcett was quite blunt in expressing her opinion that much of the catastrophe was owed to a simple failure to observe elementary rules of [[hygiene]].\n\nIn November 1901, the Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] ordered Alfred Milner to ensure that \"all possible steps are being taken to reduce the rate of mortality.\"  The civil authority took over the running of the camps from Kitchener and the British command and by February 1902 the annual death-rate in the concentration camps for white inmates dropped to 6.9 percent and eventually to 2 percent. However, by then the damage had been done.  A report after the war concluded that 27,927 Boers (of whom 24,074 [50 percent of the Boer child population] were children under 16) had died in the camps.  In all, about one in four (25 percent) of the Boer inmates, mostly children, died.\n\n\"Improvements [however] were much slower in coming to the black camps\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2002|p=235}} It is thought that about 12 percent of black African inmates died (about 14,154) but the precise number of deaths of black Africans in concentration camps is unknown as little attempt was made to keep any records of the 107,000 black Africans who were interned.\n\n{{quote|The main decisions (or their absence) had been left to the soldiers, to whom the life or death of the 154,000 Boer and African civilians in the camps rated as an abysmally low priority. [It was only]&nbsp;... ten months after the subject had first been raised in Parliament&nbsp;... [and after public outcry and after the Fawcett Commission that remedial action was taken and]&nbsp;... the terrible mortality figures were at last declining. In the interval, at least twenty thousand whites and twelve thousand coloured people had died in the concentration camps, the majority from epidemics of measles and typhoid that could have been avoided.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=549}}</ref>{{efn|Somewhat higher figures for total deaths in the concentration camps are given some historians.{{sfn|Spies|1977|p=265}}}}}}\n\nSir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had served as a volunteer doctor in the Langman Field Hospital at Bloemfontein between March and June 1900. In his widely distributed and translated pamphlet 'The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct' he justified both the reasonings behind the war and handling of the conflict itself. He also pointed out that over 14,000 British soldiers had died of disease during the conflict (as opposed to 8,000 killed in combat) and at the height of epidemics he was seeing 50\u201360 British soldiers dying each day in a single ill-equipped and overwhelmed military hospital.\n\n==Kitchener's policy and the post-war debate==\n\nIt has been argued that \"this was not a deliberately genocidal policy; rather it was the result of [a] disastrous lack of foresight and rank incompetence on [the] part of the [British] military\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2002|p=250}} British historian [[Niall Ferguson]] also argues that \"Kitchener no more desired the deaths of women and children in the camps than of the wounded [[Dervishes]] after [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]], or of his own soldiers in the typhoid stricken hospitals of [[Bloemfontein]].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=524}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener - Project Gutenberg eText 15306.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] was one of the most controversial British generals in the war.

This was disingenuous as the countryside had by then been devastated under the \"Scorched Earth\" policy (the Fawcett Commission in December 1901 in its recommendations commented that: \"to turn 100,000 people now being held in the concentration camps out on the veldt to take care of themselves would be cruelty\") and now that the New Model counter insurgency tactics were in full swing, it made cynical military sense to leave the Boer families in desperate conditions in the countryside.\n\nIt was according to one historian {{citation needed|date=March 2020}} that \"at [the Vereeniging negotiations in May 1902] Boer leader Louis Botha asserted that he had tried to send [Boer] families to the British, but they had refused to receive them.\" Quoting a Boer commandant referring to Boer women and children made refugees by Britain's scorched-earth policy as saying, \"Our families are in a pitiable condition and the enemy uses those families to force us to surrender&nbsp;...and there is little doubt that that was indeed the intention of Kitchener when he had issued instructions that no more families were to be brought into the concentration camps.\" [[Thomas Pakenham (historian)|Thomas Pakenham]] writes of Kitchener's policy U-turn,\n<blockquote>No doubt the continued 'hullabaloo' at the death-rate in these concentration camps, and Milner's belated agreement to take over their administration, helped change Kitchener's mind [some time at the end of 1901].&nbsp;... By mid-December at any rate, Kitchener was already circulating all column commanders with instructions not to bring in women and children when they cleared the country, but to leave them with the guerrillas.&nbsp;... Viewed as a gesture to Liberals, on the eve of the new session of Parliament at Westminster, it was a shrewd political move.
