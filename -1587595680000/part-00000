Its orbit around the [[Sun]] takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the messenger of the gods.\n\nLike [[Venus]], Mercury orbits the Sun within [[Earth's orbit]] as an [[Inferior and superior planets|inferior planet]], and its [[apparent distance]] from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28\u00b0. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon [[dusk|after sunset]] or eastern horizon [[dawn|before sunrise]], usually in [[twilight]]. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of [[Planetary phase|phases]], similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its [[synodic period]] of approximately 116 days.\n\nMercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] with the Sun in a 3:2 [[Orbital resonance|spin\u2013orbit resonance]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and the Outer Solar System |first1=Linda T. |last1=Elkins-Tanton |author-link1=Lindy Elkins-Tanton |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4381-0729-5 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJoYlBWbCAYC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bJoYlBWbCAYC&pg=PA51 Extract of page 51]</ref> meaning that relative to the [[fixed stars]], it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.{{efn|name=rotation/revolution}}<ref name=orbit>{{cite web |title=Animated clip of orbit and rotation of Mercury |url=http://sciencenetlinks.com/interactives/messenger/or/OrbitRotation.html |publisher=Sciencenetlinks.com}}</ref> As seen from the Sun, in a [[frame of reference]] that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.\n\nMercury's axis has the smallest [[axial tilt|tilt]] of any of the Solar System's planets (about {{frac|30}} degree). Its [[orbital eccentricity]] is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;{{efn|name=dwarf planet}} at [[perihelion]], Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at [[aphelion]]. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the [[Moon]]'s, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from {{convert|100|K}} at night to {{convert|700|K|C F}} during the day across the equatorial regions.<ref name=\":0\" /> The polar regions are constantly below {{convert|180|K}}.

In the other alternate Mercurian years, the same thing happens at the other of these two points. The amplitude of the retrograde motion is small, so the overall effect is that, for two or three weeks, the Sun is almost stationary overhead, and is at its most brilliant because Mercury is at perihelion, its closest to the Sun. This prolonged exposure to the Sun at its brightest makes these two points the hottest places on Mercury. Maximum temperature occurs when the Sun is at an angle of about 25 degrees past noon due to [[Diurnal temperature variation#Temperature lag|diurnal temperature lag]], at 0.4 Mercury days and 0.8 Mercury years past sunrise.<ref>{{citation |last=Seligman |first=C. |title=The Rotation of Mercury |url=https://cseligman.com/text/planets/mercuryrot.htm |publisher=cseligman.com |at=NASA Flash animation |access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> Conversely, there are two other points on the equator, 90 degrees of longitude apart from the first ones, where the Sun passes overhead only when the planet is at aphelion in alternate years, when the apparent motion of the Sun in Mercury's sky is relatively rapid.

[[Radar]] observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin\u2013orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun. The eccentricity of Mercury's orbit makes this resonance stable\u2014at perihelion, when the solar tide is strongest, the Sun is nearly still in Mercury's sky.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Han-Shou |last2=O'Keefe |first2=John A. |title=Theory of Rotation for the Planet Mercury |journal=Science |date=1965 |volume=150 |issue=3704 |page=1717 |doi=10.1126/science.150.3704.1717 |pmid=17768871 |bibcode=1965Sci...150.1717L}}</ref>\n\nThe rare 3:2 resonant tidal locking is stabilized by the variance of the tidal force along Mercury's eccentric orbit, acting on a permanent dipole component of Mercury's mass distribution.<ref name=\"Colombo\" /> In a circular orbit there is no such variance, so the only resonance stabilized in such an orbit is at 1:1 (e.g., Earth\u2013Moon), when the tidal force, stretching a body along the \"center-body\" line, exerts a torque that aligns the body's axis of least inertia (the \"longest\" axis, and the axis of the aforementioned dipole) to point always at the center.

Viewed from low latitudes and at the right times of year, the [[ecliptic]] intersects the horizon at a steep angle.

This is because Mercury's maximum western elongation occurs only during early autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas its greatest eastern elongation happens only during late winter in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"RASC2007\" /> In both of these cases, the angle at which the planet's orbit intersects the horizon is maximized, allowing it to rise several hours before sunrise in the former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in the latter from southern mid-latitudes, such as Argentina and South Africa.<ref name=\"RASC2007\" />\n\nAn alternate method for viewing Mercury involves observing the planet during daylight hours when conditions are clear, ideally when it is at its greatest elongation. This allows the planet to be found easily, even when using telescopes with {{Convert|8|cm|abbr = on}} apertures. Care must be taken to ensure the instrument isn't pointed directly towards the Sun because of the risk for eye damage. This method bypasses the limitation of twilight observing when the ecliptic is located at a low elevation (e.g. on autumn evenings).\n\nGround-based telescope observations of Mercury reveal only an illuminated partial disk with limited detail.

To this end, the probe carried imaging devices that gathered much-higher-resolution images of much more of Mercury than {{nowrap|''Mariner 10''}}, assorted [[spectrometer]]s to determine abundances of elements in the crust, and [[magnetometer]]s and devices to measure velocities of charged particles. Measurements of changes in the probe's orbital velocity were expected to be used to infer details of the planet's interior structure.<ref name=\"messenger_faq\">{{cite web |url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/Resources/Resources/MESSENGER_FS22811_PRESS.PDF |title=MESSENGER: Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Applied Physics Laboratory]] |date=February 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref> ''MESSENGER''{{'s}} final maneuver was on April 24, 2015, and it crashed into Mercury's surface on April 30, 2015.<ref name=\"results 2015\">{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=http://www.space.com/28948-messenger-mercury-probe-final-days.html |title=NASA Mercury Probe Trying to Survive for Another Month |work=Space.com |date=March 29, 2015 |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20150427\">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=NASA's Messenger Mission Is Set to Crash Into Mercury |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/science/nasas-messenger-mission-is-set-to-crash-into-mercury.html |date=April 27, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20150430\">{{cite news |last=Corum |first=Jonathan |title=Messenger's Collision Course With Mercury |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/30/science/space/messenger-collides-with-mercury.html |date=April 30, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref> The spacecraft's impact with Mercury occurred near 3:26 PM EDT on April 30, 2015, leaving a crater estimated to be {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=1602 |title=Details of MESSENGER's Impact Location |website=MESSENGER Featured Images |date=April 29, 2015 |accessdate=April 29, 2015 |publisher=JHU \u2013 APL |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430230716/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=1602 |archivedate=April 30, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:PIA19449-PlanetMercury-MESSENGER-Images-First-20110329-Last-20150430.jpg|thumb|center|600px|First (March 29, 2011) and last (April 30, 2015) images of Mercury by ''MESSENGER'']]\n\n==== ''BepiColombo'' ====\n{{Main|BepiColombo}}\nThe [[European Space Agency]] and the [[JAXA|Japanese Space Agency]] developed and launched a joint mission called ''[[BepiColombo]]'', which will orbit Mercury with two probes: one to map the planet and the other to study its [[magnetosphere]].<ref name=\"ESAColumboGoAhead\">{{cite web |title=ESA gives go-ahead to build BepiColombo |date=February 26, 2007 |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |url=http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMC8XBE8YE_index_0.html |accessdate=May 29, 2008}}</ref> Launched on October 20, 2018, ''BepiColombo'' is expected to reach Mercury in 2025.<ref>{{cite web |title=BepiColombo Fact Sheet |url=http://sci.esa.int/bepicolombo/47346-fact-sheet/ |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate=December 19, 2016 |date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> It will release a [[magnetometer]] probe into an elliptical orbit, then chemical rockets will fire to deposit the mapper probe into a circular orbit.

Its orbit around the [[Sun]] takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the messenger of the gods.\n\nLike [[Venus]], Mercury orbits the Sun within [[Earth's orbit]] as an [[Inferior and superior planets|inferior planet]], and its [[apparent distance]] from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28\u00b0. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon [[dusk|after sunset]] or eastern horizon [[dawn|before sunrise]], usually in [[twilight]]. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of [[Planetary phase|phases]], similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its [[synodic period]] of approximately 116 days.\n\nMercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] with the Sun in a 3:2 [[Orbital resonance|spin\u2013orbit resonance]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and the Outer Solar System |first1=Linda T. |last1=Elkins-Tanton |author-link1=Lindy Elkins-Tanton |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4381-0729-5 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJoYlBWbCAYC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bJoYlBWbCAYC&pg=PA51 Extract of page 51]</ref> meaning that relative to the [[fixed stars]], it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.{{efn|name=rotation/revolution}}<ref name=orbit>{{cite web |title=Animated clip of orbit and rotation of Mercury |url=http://sciencenetlinks.com/interactives/messenger/or/OrbitRotation.html |publisher=Sciencenetlinks.com}}</ref> As seen from the Sun, in a [[frame of reference]] that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.\n\nMercury's axis has the smallest [[axial tilt|tilt]] of any of the Solar System's planets (about {{frac|30}} degree). Its [[orbital eccentricity]] is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;{{efn|name=dwarf planet}} at [[perihelion]], Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at [[aphelion]]. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the [[Moon]]'s, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from {{convert|100|K}} at night to {{convert|700|K|C F}} during the day across the equatorial regions.<ref name=\":0\" /> The polar regions are constantly below {{convert|180|K}}.

In the other alternate Mercurian years, the same thing happens at the other of these two points. The amplitude of the retrograde motion is small, so the overall effect is that, for two or three weeks, the Sun is almost stationary overhead, and is at its most brilliant because Mercury is at perihelion, its closest to the Sun. This prolonged exposure to the Sun at its brightest makes these two points the hottest places on Mercury.

[[Radar]] observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin\u2013orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun.

However, with noticeable eccentricity, like that of Mercury's orbit, the tidal force has a maximum at perihelion and therefore stabilizes resonances, like 3:2, enforcing that the planet points its axis of least inertia roughly at the Sun when passing through perihelion.<ref name=\"Colombo\" />\n\nThe original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked was that, whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, it was always nearly at the same point in its 3:2 resonance, hence showing the same face. This is because, coincidentally, Mercury's rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to Earth.

Viewed from low latitudes and at the right times of year, the [[ecliptic]] intersects the horizon at a steep angle. Mercury is 10\u00b0 above the horizon when the planet appears directly above the Sun (i.e. its orbit appears vertical) and is at maximum elongation from the Sun (28\u00b0) and also when the Sun is 18\u00b0 below the horizon, so the sky is just completely dark.{{efn|See [[Twilight#Astronomical twilight]]}} This angle is the maximum [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] at which Mercury is visible in a completely dark sky.\n\n[[File:PIA19422-Mercury-CarnegieRupes-MDIS-MLA-20150416.jpg|thumb|right|False-color image of Carnegie Rupes, a tectonic landform\u2014high terrain (red); low (blue).]]\n\nAt [[middle latitude]]s, Mercury is more often and easily visible from the [[Southern Hemisphere]] than from the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]]. This is because Mercury's maximum western elongation occurs only during early autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas its greatest eastern elongation happens only during late winter in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"RASC2007\" /> In both of these cases, the angle at which the planet's orbit intersects the horizon is maximized, allowing it to rise several hours before sunrise in the former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in the latter from southern mid-latitudes, such as Argentina and South Africa.<ref name=\"RASC2007\" />\n\nAn alternate method for viewing Mercury involves observing the planet during daylight hours when conditions are clear, ideally when it is at its greatest elongation. This allows the planet to be found easily, even when using telescopes with {{Convert|8|cm|abbr = on}} apertures. Care must be taken to ensure the instrument isn't pointed directly towards the Sun because of the risk for eye damage. This method bypasses the limitation of twilight observing when the ecliptic is located at a low elevation (e.g. on autumn evenings).\n\nGround-based telescope observations of Mercury reveal only an illuminated partial disk with limited detail.

Curt Bach, Lakewood Clinic administrator became a dual-president with Tim Rice. Later that year, Curt Bach resigned and Rice became the sole administrator.\n\nLakewood Health System expanded its clinic services in 1998 to the [[Motley, Minnesota|Motley]] area.

A renovation coincided to add additional exam rooms. In the same month, Lakewood Health System purchased Pine Lawn Estates and renamed the building to Lakewood Pines; independent living apartments with add-on healthcare services.  In July, the [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]] (FASD) diagnostic clinics were added through a grant awarded by the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning. This project was in collaboration with Freshwater Education District, located also in Staples.\n\nThe Mary Rohndorf Home was revisited in 2005 when Lakewood Health System purchased the estate and established what is now called Lakewood Manor, a full-service assisted living facility.\n\nIn 2010, Lakewood Health System has 12 family medicine physicians, 10 mid-level providers and nine on-staff specialists including [[oncology]], [[surgery]], [[podiatry]], [[OB/GYN]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[rheumatology]] and [[anesthesiology]].\n\n'''Lakewood Clinic'''\n\nLakewood Clinic was built in Staples in 1969. It grew to have two satellite clinics, one in Eagle Bend and one in Browerville before merging with Greater Staples Hospital and Greater Staples Care Center to become Lakewood Health System.\n\n==Administration history==\nMiss Dorothy E. Smith was the first administrator of the Staples Municipal Hospital and served April 12-July 1, 1937. She Left due to her mother's illness and Miss Cora L. Anderson succeeded her.

Tim Rice is the current hospital administrator and has been since February 1980.\n\n==Important issues and advancements==\nOn Tuesday, Feb 20, 1973, the United District Hospital voted unanimously to adopt the recommendation of the Staples Ministerial Association on the topic of abortion. In the current day, Lakewood Health System continues to uphold the decision to reject abortion unless in the most extreme conditions.<ref>''Long Prairie Leader'' March 1, 1973 \"Hospital board takes position on abortion\"</ref>\n\nHome Health Care was added in November, 1982,<ref>''Staples World'' November 18, 1982 \"Hospital to begin program offering help at home\"</ref> the first mammography machine was purchased in February, 1984<ref>''Staples World'' February 23, 1984 \"Hospital now offering special x-ray to detect breast cancer\"</ref> and Hospice care was added March, 1985.<ref>Tom Crawford,''Staples World'' March 14, 1985 \"Hospice program now offered at UD Hospital\"</ref>\n\nThe Greater Staples Hospital and Greater Staples Care Center went smoke-free on January 1, 1990 to provide a healthy workplace to employees, patients and visitors.<ref>''Staples World'' December 29, 1988 \"Hospital to be smoke free\" pg 38</ref> To date, Lakewood Health System is a tobacco-free campus and all use of tobacco is prohibited on Lakewood Health System grounds.\n\nThe first [[laparoscopic surgery]] was performed when Lakewood Health System was the United District Hospital.

Sally Gorton was the Director. The first fundraising events included a golf scramble, pedal bike rally and dinner auction.\n\nIn 1996, Greater Staples Hospital and Care Center merged with Lakewood Clinic to become Lakewood Health System. Curt Bach, Lakewood Clinic administrator became a dual-president with Tim Rice. Later that year, Curt Bach resigned and Rice became the sole administrator.\n\nLakewood Health System expanded its clinic services in 1998 to the [[Motley, Minnesota|Motley]] area.

A renovation coincided to add additional exam rooms. In the same month, Lakewood Health System purchased Pine Lawn Estates and renamed the building to Lakewood Pines; independent living apartments with add-on healthcare services.  In July, the [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]] (FASD) diagnostic clinics were added through a grant awarded by the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning. This project was in collaboration with Freshwater Education District, located also in Staples.\n\nThe Mary Rohndorf Home was revisited in 2005 when Lakewood Health System purchased the estate and established what is now called Lakewood Manor, a full-service assisted living facility.\n\nIn 2010, Lakewood Health System has 12 family medicine physicians, 10 mid-level providers and nine on-staff specialists including [[oncology]], [[surgery]], [[podiatry]], [[OB/GYN]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[rheumatology]] and [[anesthesiology]].\n\n'''Lakewood Clinic'''\n\nLakewood Clinic was built in Staples in 1969. It grew to have two satellite clinics, one in Eagle Bend and one in Browerville before merging with Greater Staples Hospital and Greater Staples Care Center to become Lakewood Health System.\n\n==Administration history==\nMiss Dorothy E.

Tim Rice is the current hospital administrator and has been since February 1980.\n\n==Important issues and advancements==\nOn Tuesday, Feb 20, 1973, the United District Hospital voted unanimously to adopt the recommendation of the Staples Ministerial Association on the topic of abortion.

Howard]]'s  [[sword and sorcery]] hero [[Conan the Barbarian]]. It was first published in trade paperback by [[Tor Books]] in October 1983, and was reprinted in 1991; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in April 1985, and was reprinted in January 1987, May 1991 and February 2011. The first British edition was published in paperback by [[Sphere Books]] in November 1985; a later British edition was published in paperback by [[Legend Books]] in April 1997. The novel was later gathered together with ''[[Conan the Magnificent]]'' and ''[[Conan the Destroyer (novel)|Conan the Destroyer]]'' into the hardcover omnibus collection ''[[The Conan Chronicles II]]'' (Legend, April 1997), and was later gathered together with ''[[Conan the Magnificent]]'' and ''[[Conan the Victorious]]'' into the hardcover omnibus collection ''[[The Further Chronicles of Conan]]'' (Tor Books, October 1999).<ref>{{isfdb title|id=9273|title=Conan the Triumphant}}\n</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nConan guides his army of mercenaries into Ianthe, capital of Ophir, where they become entangled in the chaos ensuing from the death of King Valdric. The factions of Antimides, Valentius, and Lady Synelle (Countess of Asmark) all contest for the throne. Synelle is secretly a sorceress and the high priestess of a nearly-forgotten demon god known as Al\u2019Kiir. Al\u2019Kiir was imprisoned within the depths of a mountain, called '''Tor Al\u2019Kiir''', centuries before by a mage named Avanrakash. However, Synelle plans on releasing him by providing Al'Kiir a \u201cbride\u201d through human sacrifice and enlist his power in obtaining the throne.\n\nConan comes into Synelle's attention after he buys an idol of Al\u2019Kiir, which she believes can be used in reviving her god. She plan on obtaining the idol, sending various agents to steal it and bewitching the Cimmerian into enlisting in her service. This attachment is complicated by Conan's interest in Julia, a young noblewoman reduced to trulldom{{typo help inline|reason=similar to trolldom|date=November 2019}}, and his old rival, a female bandit named Karela the Red Hawk, one of many thieves Synelle has hired to steal the idol.\n\nUltimately, Synelle's true colors are revealed. In the depths of Tor Al\u2019Kirr, she and her priestess attempt to sacrifice Karela to raise the demon. Conan and his company battle her forces and the Cimmerian wins through\u2014just too late. Al\u2019Kiir is raised, but takes Synelle instead of his intended victim. When the demon turns its attention towards Karela, Conan seizes the '''Staff of Avanrakash''' and spears the creature. At its unearthly screams, Synelle's defenders flee. Both Al'kiir and the captive sorceress harden into stone as the mountain begins to rumble. Conan and his men flee, putting as much distance as they can between themselves and the mountain before it erupts in a pillar of flame resembling the staff.\n\nIn the aftermath, the victorious army of Valentius marches onto Ianthe. The remnants of the Free Company, sidelined, break up, each going their separate way. Conan urges Karela to go to Argos with him, but she refuses, preferring her free life instead being mastered by the Cimmerian. He proceeds south alone.

Howard]]'s  [[sword and sorcery]] hero [[Conan the Barbarian]]. It was first published in trade paperback by [[Tor Books]] in October 1983, and was reprinted in 1991; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in April 1985, and was reprinted in January 1987, May 1991 and February 2011. The first British edition was published in paperback by [[Sphere Books]] in November 1985; a later British edition was published in paperback by [[Legend Books]] in April 1997. The novel was later gathered together with ''[[Conan the Magnificent]]'' and ''[[Conan the Destroyer (novel)|Conan the Destroyer]]'' into the hardcover omnibus collection ''[[The Conan Chronicles II]]'' (Legend, April 1997), and was later gathered together with ''[[Conan the Magnificent]]'' and ''[[Conan the Victorious]]'' into the hardcover omnibus collection ''[[The Further Chronicles of Conan]]'' (Tor Books, October 1999).<ref>{{isfdb title|id=9273|title=Conan the Triumphant}}\n</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nConan guides his army of mercenaries into Ianthe, capital of Ophir, where they become entangled in the chaos ensuing from the death of King Valdric. The factions of Antimides, Valentius, and Lady Synelle (Countess of Asmark) all contest for the throne. Synelle is secretly a sorceress and the high priestess of a nearly-forgotten demon god known as Al\u2019Kiir. Al\u2019Kiir was imprisoned within the depths of a mountain, called '''Tor Al\u2019Kiir''', centuries before by a mage named Avanrakash. However, Synelle plans on releasing him by providing Al'Kiir a \u201cbride\u201d through human sacrifice and enlist his power in obtaining the throne.\n\nConan comes into Synelle\u2019s attention after he buys an idol of Al\u2019Kiir, which she believes can be used in reviving her god. She plan on obtaining the idol, sending various agents to steal it and bewitching the Cimmerian into enlisting in her service. This attachment is complicated by Conan\u2019s interest in Julia, a young noblewoman reduced to trulldom{{typo help inline|reason=similar to trolldom|date=November 2019}}, and his old rival, a female bandit named Karela the Red Hawk, one of many thieves Synelle has hired to steal the idol.\n\nUltimately, Synelle\u2019s true colors are revealed. In the depths of Tor Al\u2019Kirr, she and her priestess attempt to sacrifice Karela to raise the demon. Conan and his company battle her forces and the Cimmerian wins through\u2014just too late. Al\u2019Kiir is raised, but takes Synelle instead of his intended victim. When the demon turns its attention towards Karela, Conan seizes the '''Staff of Avanrakash''' and spears the creature. At its unearthly screams, Synelle\u2019s defenders flee. Both Al'kiir and the captive sorceress harden into stone as the mountain begins to rumble. Conan and his men flee, putting as much distance as they can between themselves and the mountain before it erupts in a pillar of flame resembling the staff.\n\nIn the aftermath, the victorious army of Valentius marches onto Ianthe. The remnants of the Free Company, sidelined, break up, each going their separate way. Conan urges Karela to go to Argos with him, but she refuses, preferring her free life instead being mastered by the Cimmerian. He proceeds south alone. Meanwhile, Synelle is rescued from the destroyed mountain and brought back to life by Thoth-Amon.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Don D'Ammassa]] notes \"The ending is rather weak in this one and there are a few too many coincidences.\"<ref>D'Ammassa, Don.
