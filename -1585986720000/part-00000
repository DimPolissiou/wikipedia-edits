Originally hailing from the world of [[Earth-Two]], first envisioned as the home of DC's wartime heroes as published in 1940s comic books, Power Girl becomes stranded in the [[DC Universe|main universe]] where DC stories are set, and becomes acquainted with that world's Superman and her own counterpart, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].\n\nIn common with Supergirl's origin story, she is the daughter of Superman's [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Alura|aunt]] and [[Zor-El|uncle]] and a native of the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=315-317}}</ref> The infant Power Girl's parents enabled her to escape the destruction of her home planet by placing her in a rocket ship. Although she left the planet at the same time that Superman did, her ship took much longer to reach Earth-Two. On Earth, as with other Kryptonians, Power Girl discovered she possessed abilities like super strength, flight, and heat vision, using which she became a protector of innocents and a hero for humanity. Though the specifics of how vary over subsequent retellings, Power Girl is later stranded on another Earth when a cosmic crisis affects her home of Earth-Two, and later carves out a separate identity for herself from her dimensional counterpart Supergirl once they are forced to coexist.\n\nThough they are biologically the same person, Power Girl behaves as an older, more mature, and more level-headed version of Supergirl, with a more aggressive fighting style. She also adopts a different secret identity from her counterpart. These changes are reflected in their differing costumes and superhero names as well; Power Girl sports a [[bob cut|bob]] of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume with a [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]-displaying cutout. The name Power Girl reflects that she chooses not to be seen as a derivative of Superman, but rather her own hero and this choice is reflected in the strong independent attitude of the character. Over various decades, Power Girl has been depicted as a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice Society of America]], [[Infinity, Inc.]], [[Justice League Europe]], and the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].\n\nPower Girl's origin has gone through revisions, but over time has reverted to her original conception as the Supergirl of Earth-Two. The 1985 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' eliminated Earth-Two from history, causing her to be [[retcon]]ned as the granddaughter of an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] known as [[Arion (comics)|Arion]]. This was an unpopular change and writers depicted the revised Power Girl inconsistently. The 2005\u20132006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series then restored her status as a refugee from the Krypton of the destroyed [[Pre-Crisis]] Earth-Two universe. Following DC's 2011 \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline and [[New 52]] reboot, Power Girl's origin was retold as the Supergirl of \"Earth 2\", cousin and adopted daughter of Superman, who during evil [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] [[New Gods|New God]] [[Darkseid]]'s invasion of Earth 2 becomes stranded in the main continuity of Earth 0, subsequently adopting the name Power Girl to hide her true identity. She returned to her source Earth in the story ''Earth 2: World's End'' (2014\u20132015).\n\n==Publication history==\nPower Girl was introduced in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #58 in 1976,<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 169 |quote = Along with artist Ric Estrada, [Gerry] Conway also introduced the DC Universe to the cousin of Earth-2's Superman, Kara Zor-L a.k.a.

[[Marvel Comics]]' then-publisher [[Stan Lee]] said in 1978 that when [[DC Comics]] created Power Girl after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], \"I'm pretty annoyed about that. ...I've got to ask the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] lawyer \u2013 she's supposed to be starting a lawsuit about that and I haven't heard anything. I don't like the idea. ... You know, years ago we brought out [[Wonder Man]], and [DC Comics] sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and ... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man.

Due in part to her being one of the more popular characters in ''All-Star Comics'' at the time,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson|first=Dan|title=Showcase Presents...

During this time, she was a regularly featured character in the annual Justice Society crossovers in the original ''Justice League of America'' series. She was a founding member of ''[[Infinity Inc.]]'', appearing in each of the first 12 issues and making later guest appearances.\n\nAfter DC's continuity-altering ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, her origin was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] in ''Secret Origins'' vol. 2, #11 and she became a magic-based character with ties to ancient Atlantis, leading to appearances in ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|The Warlord]]''. The character did not receive her own self-titled series until the ''Power Girl'' miniseries of 1988.<ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=797 The Comic Book Database] \u2013 Power Girl (1988)</ref> The character became a featured member of ''[[Justice League Europe]]'' (a spin off from ''Justice League International'') for the run of the series. After the cancellation of JLI, the character joined [[Chris Claremont]]'s [[creator-owned]] series ''[[Sovereign Seven]]'' and appeared in several issues of ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]''. She eventually rejoined the Justice Society in ''JSA'' #31 and became a regular part of that series and its follow-up, ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3.\n\nPower Girl played a significant role in the continuity-changing events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005), which tied into her starring role in the first ''[[JSA Classified]]'' story arc \"Power Trip\" in 2005 (issues #1\u20134 of the series).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sequart.org/magazine/1541/your-guide-to-infinite-crisis-powertrip/|title=Your Guide to Infinite Crisis:|work=Sequart Organization}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/storyarc.php?ID=1424 The Comic Book Database] \u2013 \"Power Trip\"</ref> These stories heavily featured the revelation that Power Girl was in fact the Earth-Two Power Girl and a Kryptonian, who survived ''Crisis'', and that her Atlantean backstory had been a lie.

Kara\u2019s Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of [[virtual reality]]. The Symbioship allows her to interact with virtual copies of her parents and fellow Kryptonians. Originally, by the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is shown to be in her early twenties. However, as mentioned in ''JSA Classified'' #1, her age at arrival has now been [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] to about eighteen in post-''Crisis'' continuity.\n\nIn ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #97, Kara is reclaimed by the sentient Symbioship and reimmersed into Kandorian society for a time. Several years of virtual time elapse, in which Kara is married and has a child. She is freed with the assistance of newspaper reporter Andrew Vinson, at which point she disables the ship.\n\n===Debut===\nPower Girl's existence is not revealed to the general public until much later; her cousin [[Clark Kent|Clark]] and his wife [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois Lane]] provide her a family environment to assist her transition towards real life relationships. In her first recorded adventure, Kara assists Justice Society members [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]] and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] with containing an artificially induced volcanic eruption in China. She then joins Robin and [[Star-Spangled Kid]] to form a Super Squad to assist the Justice Society in defeating [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]] and [[Per Degaton]], who were causing disasters around the world. She pushes their base towards the [[Sun]], the heat causing the villains to fall unconscious. Later, she becomes a full member of the Society when Superman retires from active membership.\n\nHaving been raised by the Symbioship with artificial Kryptonian life experiences, Power Girl finds it difficult to adapt to life on Earth. However, with the help of reporter Andrew Vinson, she adopts the [[secret identity]] of computer [[programmer]] Karen Starr (she obtains her knowledge in this field from exposure to [[Wonder Woman]]'s [[Purple Ray]] on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]). On the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two, Power Girl's closest friend is the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]], the daughter of the Earth-Two [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]].\n\nThe first contact between Power Girl and [[Earth-One]]'s universe was on the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] ''Justice League of America #147'', written by [[Paul Levitz]] & [[Martin Pasko]], where the character shows her attraction to that reality saying, \"It has a much nicer brand of Superman, y'know?\".<ref>''[[Justice League of America]]'' #147 (October 1977): \"Crisis in the 30th Century!\". DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Atlantean===\nThe 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' limited series erased the existence of the Earth-Two Superman, and Power Girl's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was thus substantially disrupted.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #11.

Later, while a member of [[Justice League Europe]], she suffers a near fatal injury while battling a mystical being. Superman must assist in her medical treatment, using his heat-vision to perform surgery on her otherwise-invulnerable tissues.<ref>''Justice League Europe #9'' (December 1989). DC Comics.</ref> Although she recovers, Power Girl is significantly weaker, as she lost her vision powers and could not fly for a time. However, she regained them all as time went on. Power Girl adopts a one-eyed mangy cat, an animal which would affect much of the team.

Some of the missing time from this joint encounter was explored in the 6-issue mini-series [[Harley Quinn and Power Girl]] (2015). Due to an attack by some evil aliens she got knocked back to Earth and landed at Harley Quinn's feet, devoid of memories. Harley temporarily took her on as a partner and they fought crime together before being sent across the universe on a quest to return home. When Power Girl got her memories back and realized that Harley had lied to her, she was less than amused, but forgave her. However when Harley hit on her, Power Girl left her atop the Eiffel Tower. Power Girl has reappeared in Harley Quinn's ongoing series several times since and has recently taken Terra/Altee on as her sidekick/partner.\n\n===''DC Universe''===\nIn the post-''[[DC Rebirth]]'' ''DC Universe'', Power Girl (Karen Starr) appears to be trapped in some sort of interdimensional void between earths.

DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs the biological cousin of Superman, Power Girl exhibits all of the classic [[Kryptonian]] powers: super strength; flight; super speed; invulnerability; x-ray, telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; freeze breath; and super-hearing. Over the years various writers have given Power Girl's Kryptonian power differing levels, reflecting the lower powers of the Earth-Two Superman [[Kal-L]]. For example, Power Girl can fly through space, but has to breathe, so before she leaves a planet, she must take a deep breath and hold it for several hours until she needs a new oxygen source. Power Girl needs to sleep or she will experience disorientation due to fatigue. However, as recently shown in \"[[Brightest Day]]\", she now draws her superpowers from yellow sunlight, just like Superman. The reason for this change has not yet been explained.\n\nSince she is from an alternative universe (pre-Crisis [[Earth Two]]), kryptonite has no effect on her, but she is still vulnerable to magic. As Karen Starr, she is an accomplished business woman and is regarded by Mr. Terrific as a first rate scientist. Even though Power Girl is from an alternative universe, her biology is still similar to Superman's. As one of a handful of characters who survived the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC editorial was initially uncertain how to portray the character and attempted to portray Power Girl with a non-Kryptonian origin for a number of years. Power Girl's abilities have fluctuated since 1986. For some time, Power Girl believed she was an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]].<ref name=IC2>''Infinite Crisis'' #2</ref> At one point, Power Girl possessed [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]];<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #42</ref> at another she was vulnerable to attacks by certain natural elements (for example, wooden weapons).<ref>''Supergirl'' #16 (1997)</ref> After sustaining severe injuries from a magic attack Power Girl retained only a degree of super strength, speed and durability.<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #9 (1989)<!--month needed--></ref> However, she later recovered her ability to fly, and writers have gradually restored her superpowers.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' #31 (2002)<!--month needed--></ref>\n\n==Physical appearance and costumes==\nPower Girl's original [[Wally Wood]] artwork (1976) showed her as relatively busty but otherwise her [[BWH|figure and build]] conformed in appearance to other contemporary comic book women. However, in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' #34 (2009), written by [[Gail Simone]], Dinah Lance, the [[Black Canary]], mentions Power Girl as having the top bosom of [[DC Universe|DCU]], comparing her assets with a \"national treasure\".<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #34 (September 2009). DC Comics.</ref> Her most common outfit is a leg-baring, figure-hugging, long-sleeved white leotard with a keyhole cut-out opening in the chest.<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #58 (January\u2013February 1976)</ref>\n\nAccording to character writer [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], \"Okay. When the character was created, Wally Wood was the artist that drew Power Girl, and he was convinced that the editors were not paying attention to anything he did. So, his inker said every issue I\u2019m going to draw the tits bigger until they notice it. It took about seven or eight issues before anyone was like hey, what\u2019s with the tits?

Ross rendered her as a heavily muscled ''Power Woman'' (as if she was an ardent [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]]).\n\nThe character is consistently depicted as a large breasted young woman, and her physique is one of her most recognizable attributes \u2013 to the extent that various writers have acknowledged it in both serious and humorous ways.<ref>''Power Girl'' #1, May 2009 Page 12 and 17. DC Comics.</ref><ref>[[Jeph Loeb]]. ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #6 (March 2004) Page 3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nFor example, ''Justice League Europe'' #37 (1992) attempts to explain Power Girl's revealing costume by having [[Crimson Fox]] question her about it; she receives the reply that the costume \"shows what I am: female, healthy. If men want to degrade themselves by staring, that's their problem, I'm not going to apologize for it.\"<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #37 (April 1992). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nConversely, in ''JSA: Classified'' #2 (2005), writer [[Geoff Johns]] has Power Girl explain her cleavage-window to Superman, revealing that \"the first time I made this costume, I wanted to have a symbol, like you. I just\u2026I couldn\u2019t think of anything. I thought eventually, I\u2019d figure it out. And close the hole. But I haven\u2019t.\"<ref>''JSA: Classified'' #2 (October 2005). DC Comics.</ref> A similar treatment of the character can be seen in ''Superman/Batman'' #4 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), in which the heroes need to distract the [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Toyman]] while Batman and Superman battle [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Hawkman]]. Batman suggests that Power Girl's endowments would be likely to distract Toyman, a 13-year-old boy. Toyman later attempts to make a reference to the size of her chest before being cut off by Superman.<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Superman/Batman'' #4 (January 2004). DC Comics.</ref> A variant of this joke is included in the ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' movie.<ref>Warner Premiere, ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', Warner Home Video (2009). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nPower Girl's costume design has varied greatly over the years. Her classic costume design from ''All-Star Comics'' #58 is that which is in use today: a red cape and belt, blue gloves and boots, and a white [[bodysuit]] sporting a circular [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]-exposing cut-out on her chest (its variable size and shape determined by the artist depicting her).  According to [[Gerry Conway]], \"The true, dumb reason for the circle? At the time, it was a convention for hero costumes to have a chest symbol. I thought a giant 'P' looked silly. The circle was intended as a nod to convention without being conventional. Not a sexy thing at all, until Wally Wood\u2019s inks.\"<ref>{{cite web|date=2 January 2020|url=https://twitter.com/gerryconway/status/1212830266625904640|title=The true, dumb reason for the circle?...|website=Twitter|first=Gerry|last=Conway|authorlink=Gerry Conway|accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> This window was closed for the first time in ''All-Star Comics'' #64, pencilled by Wood.<ref>All-Star Comics #64, Cover (February 1977).

After his second death, Power Girl's adoptive mother [[Lois Lane]] ([[Red Tornado]]) gives her [[Superman logo|the S-shaped hope symbol from Superman's chest]], which then becomes a part of Power Girl's costume.<ref>''Earth 2: World's End'' #16 (2015). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{See also|Alternative versions of Supergirl}}\n* The first use of the name Power Girl was a story in ''Superman'' #125 (1958). In this story, [[Lois Lane]] has a dream where she is a superhero named Power Girl who is constantly coming to the aid of a bumbling [[Clark Kent]] whom she dreams as a superhero named Power Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carolastrickland.com/comics/powergirl/index.html |title=Carol Strickland's Power Girl Index |publisher=Carolastrickland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> In ''Power Girl'' #23 (June 2011), Power Girl adopts this incarnation's red wig disguise for her Karen Starr identity (along with glasses), after being advised by Superman to make Karen a real person, not just a costume.\n* In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2007), a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is formed, consisting of 52 [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel realities]]. As a result of [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] \"eating\" aspects of these realities, their histories are modified, and one takes on aspects of the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two. This reality listed as \"Earth-2\" has its own Power Girl who has spent years in space searching for her long lost cousin Superman. As shown in several issues of ''Justice Society'' (Vol 3 Annual 1 (2008) and issues 18\u201325), the mainstream Power Girl was sent to Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 by Gog and was briefly confused to be the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl by its native heroes. Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl returned to her source Earth and battled the mainstream Power Girl as she regarded the mainstream Power Girl to be an imposter who caused the disappearance of her source Earth Superman who she had been searching unsuccessfully for years off-world. Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl wears the original Power Girl costume and shows herself to be arrogant to the point of being unbalanced, and is overtly aggressive as shown when she openly tortured the mainstream Power Girl almost to the point of killing her as well as directly attacking the Earth-22 Superman. The two Power Girls parted with no apologies given for the torture. Starman stated that the mainstream Power Girl will have important interactions with the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 heroes including the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl at some points in the future (''Justice Society'' Vol 3 #25), despite the obvious disregard the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl has for the mainstream Power Girl. The Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl has not reappeared since this storyline concluded.\n* In the [[Tangent Comics]] imprint, Power Girl is a vastly powered [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] superhero created by the Chinese government. This Power Girl is of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent and is married to that reality's [[Tangent Comics#Superman|Superman]] who is an [[African American]] man with vast [[psionics|psionic]] powers. This powerful couple have conquered the Earth in the reality of [[Earth-9]].\n* The ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'' [[graphic novel]] features a Power Girl who is an ally of that reality's [[Black Canary]] and [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]. Though visually identical to her Earth-2 counterpart, her relationship to Superman or if she is even a Kryptonian at all is never mentioned in the story.\n* In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Power Girl is renamed Power Woman, and assists [[Superman]] in reforming the [[Justice League]].\n* In ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', Power Girl is a member of the Justice League. She has a daughter of her own, Kara Zor-L II.\n* A version of Power Girl appeared in ''Justice League International'' Annual #5, ''No Rules to Follow''. This version of Kara has no memory of where she came from before she arrived on Earth. As part of a team of ten revealed metahumans, she sides with the heroes who go into hiding.\n* Karen, now stripped of her powers thanks to the [[Obsidian (comics)|Great Darkness Engine]], appeared as a prisoner of [[Kid Karnevil]]'s [[Neo-Nazi]] regime shown in the ''Fatherland'' storyline depicted in ''Justice Society of America'' #37\u201340. She is portrayed as one of the world's few living surviving superheroes, with most of her comrades having been executed.\n* An elderly, grotesque and blind version of Power Girl, known as Old Karrie, appeared in an alternative timeline depicted in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''. Set in 2351, she is stated to be the sole survivor of a violent metahuman war instigated by [[Maxwell Lord]]. According to Karrie, even the immortal metahumans were killed in the war. She also claimed to have lost her powers, as a result of [[kryptonite]]. She is still somehow alive, after more than 300 years, without powers, food or even sleep.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> Another future Power Girl appears later in the series, fighting alongside a future incarnation of the Justice League. When [[Captain Atom]] is once again sent into the future, he meets an older Kara Zor-L, with white hair. She has abandoned her classical white bodysuit for a black one, with bracelets (similar to [[Wonder Woman]]'s) & [[Superman logo|Superman's S-shield]].<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14. DC Comics.</ref>\n* In the Ame-Comi line, Power Girl is that universe's equivalent of Superman. She is Kara Jor-El, daughter of Jor-El, cousin of Supergirl, and the primary protector of Metropolis. She makes no efforts to maintain a secret identity, and uses her corporation to utilize Kryptonian technology for the betterment of mankind. This version of Power Girl, unusually for most depictions of Kryptonians, doesn't get her powers from the sun.<ref>''Ame-Comi: Power Girl'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n* A red haired version of Power Girl is seen amongst the agents employed by Monarch in the battle on Earth-51 during ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]''. This version appears to be Kryptonian as she is shown to be susceptible to kryptonite and is slain by that world's version of Batman. Nothing is known about her personality or powers as she is seen only in a few panels and appears to be fully under Monarch's control and arrogantly describes Batman as being \"just a human\". It is the only line she speaks before being slain.\n* In the ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'' universe, Power Girl was cloned from Supergirl's DNA by [[Hugo Strange]] during the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and was forced by her master to fight Supergirl until the latter convinces her to turn on Strange. She escapes the facility beneath the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] thanks to the assistance of Supergirl and another superhuman clone whom she treated like a brother, Superman.\n\n==Collected editions==\n* '''''Power Girl''''' (collects ''JSA Classified'' #1-4, ''Showcase'' #97-99 and ''Secret Origins'' #11)\n* '''''Power Girl: A New Beginning''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #1\u20136)\n* '''''Power Girl: Aliens and Apes''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #7\u201312)\n* '''''Power Girl: Bomb Squad''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #13\u201318)\n* '''''Power Girl: Old Friends''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #19\u201327)\n* '''''Power Girl: Power Trip''''' (collects ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 and ''Power Girl'' #1\u201312)\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Although Power Girl did not directly appear in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series or the follow-up, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the ''JLU'' character '''Galatea''' (voiced by [[Nicholle Tom]]) is based on her. This character is a [[cloning|clone]] of [[Supergirl]] (also voiced by Tom) created by [[Emil Hamilton]] (who sees her as a [[daughter]], while she sees him as a [[father figure]]) from [[Project Cadmus]] as a contingency plan in case the Justice League turned against the US. Although the clone resembles Power Girl and wears a similar hairstyle and costume (at one point, she briefly drapes a red workout towel over her shoulder, resembling the half-cape of her comic book counterpart), her personality and origin are significantly different, being a supervillain who seeks the League's destruction. She also possesses a mental link with Supergirl, allowing them to experience each other's recent memories in the form of dreams. Galatea first appears in the [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1: 2004\u20132005|first season's sixth episode, \"Fearful Symmetry.\"]] She subsequently appears at the end of [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|season 2's \"Flashpoint\"]], and she is last seen in [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|season 2's \"Panic in the Sky\"]]. In her last appearance, \"Panic in the Sky\", she fights Supergirl for control of the [[JLA Watchtower|Watchtower]]. She is defeated by Supergirl, who traps her in a contact, causing all of the Watchtower's power to flow through her, causing an overload. Following the massive surge of electricity, she is left twitching and catatonic; it is unknown whether she ultimately survives. Conversely, this continuity's Supergirl borrows several elements from Power Girl, such as having been in suspended animation (which had not been introduced in the Kara Zor-El mythology at that point) and being a surrogate cousin of Kal-El rather than a biological relative. Also, in her first appearance, in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', when she first meets [[Jimmy Olsen]], she's without a disguise and tells him that her name is \"Karen\".\n* ''[[Smallville]]''\n** In the ''Smallville'' [[Smallville (season 2)|season 2]] episode \"Visage\", [[Chloe Sullivan]] identifies '''Tina Greer''' ([[Lizzy Caplan]]) by the moniker \"Power Girl\".\n** In the ''Smallville'' [[Smallville (season 3)|season 3]] episode \"Extinction\", the \"meteor freaks\" database created by Chloe Sullivan uses a program called Starr-Ware Database System 5.0, which hints at the existence of Karen Starr's corporation, Starrware, in the ''Smallville'' universe.\n** In the ''Smallville'' season 3 finale \"Covenant\", a girl named Kara (played by [[Adrianne Palicki]]) claims to be from Krypton, although she does not claim to be Kal-El's relative. However, when [[Lana Lang (Smallville)|Lana Lang]] asks who she is, Clark pretends Kara is his visiting cousin. At the end of the episode, she is revealed to be '''Lindsay Harrison''', a human empowered and possibly [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Jor-El]]'s technology. As with many of the show's future superheroes, who tend to be dressed in the same colors as the costumes of their comic-book counterparts, Lindsay is dressed in white, matching the color of Power Girl's costume (minus the red cape and blue boots, as Lindsay never wore either a jacket or shoes).\n** In the ''Smallville'' [[Smallville (season 10)|season 10]] episode \"Supergirl\", Lois Lane suggests \"Power Girl\" as a name for Kara Zor-El (then known as \"Maiden of Might\").\n* Former ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' executive producer [[Andrew Kreisberg]] hinted that Power Girl could appear in the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/08/spoiler-room-blindspot-outlander-originals-spoilers |title=Spoiler Room: Scoop on Blindspot, Outlander, The Originals and more |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=April 9, 2016 |access-date=April 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n* In the ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' episode \"#Powersurge\", Supergirl (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) is presumed dead after a major battle with [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]] and decides to reinvent herself as a new heroine and becomes Power Girl. Her comic book origins on Earth-2 are referenced when Superman begins to suspect the ruse and she makes up a story on the spot about being an alternate universe's Supergirl.\n\n===Film===\n* Power Girl appears in the animated ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' film, voiced by [[Allison Mack]]. This marks her first true appearance in animation, as opposed to the above ''JLU'' version which is merely based on her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=502 |title=The World's Finest |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> In the film, she works under the command of [[Captain Atom]], who is under orders from President [[Lex Luthor]]. When Superman is framed for murdering [[Metallo]], she is the only one of her group to truly doubt his guilt, and she later switches sides and helps him and [[Batman]]. She angrily attacks [[Major Force]] after it is revealed he killed Metallo and almost killed Batman; in the fight, she accidentally ruptures Force's containment suit, almost causing him to explode, which would unleash his nuclear energies on the city. The potential disaster is averted by Captain Atom, who absorbs all of the dying Force's energy into his own containment suit, making himself considerably more powerful in the process but passing out from the strain. She is later revealed to have helped them escape from [[Hawkman]] and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. As in the graphic novel on which the film is based, she is assigned to watch over the new teenage [[Toyman]], [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Hiro Okamura]], who finds her quite attractive, even \"testing\" his X-ray goggles on her, which she finds offensive; so she breaks his goggles and avoids him from then on (he later tries to make a comment on her breast size as well, before being interrupted by Batman). She is knocked unconscious by Lex Luthor in his new [[kryptonite]] enhanced battle-suit, but she recovers and is seen at the end, along with her squad members, taking the now-impeached Luthor into custody.\n* An alternate reality version of Power Girl makes a cameo appearance in the animated movie ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]''. She appears as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] and is intended as the alternative reality's version of Supergirl.\n* Power Girl is portrayed by [[Ashley Hinshaw]] in the 2011 short film ''[[The Death and Return of Superman (film)|The Death and Return of Superman]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/in-this-semi-drunk-movie-about-supermans-death-elijah-5882253 |title=In this semi-drunk movie about Superman's death, Elijah Wood is Cyborg Superman |first=Cyriaque |last=Lamar |website=[[io9]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |date=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/chronicle-max-landis-death-and-return-of-superman/ |title=''Chronicle'' Writer Max Landis Vents About The Death and Return of Superman |first=Dave |last=Trumbore |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n* While Power Girl doesn't appear herself, the animated ''[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]'' film briefly features a waitress, at a superhero themed restaurant called Superbabes, who is dressed in a Power Girl costume. The same restaurant is shown to offer a \"Power Girl Jumbo Combo\".\n* Power Girl makes a brief appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]].''\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Power Girl appears in the [[DC Animated Universe]] in the comic book series: ''[[Adventures in the DC Universe]]'' (vol. 1) #6, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (vol. 1) #13,  ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (vol. 1) #16, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (vol. 1) #3, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (vol. 1) #34, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (vol. 1) #8 and ''[[Superman and Batman Magazine]]'' (vol. 1) #1.\n* Power Girl appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' #1 (March 2009) , in which she helps [[Batman]] to stop [[Lex Luthor]]. Much like her mainstream comic counterpart, she came from an alternative universe's [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. In her civilian identity, she goes by the name Karen Starr and is a [[computer programmer]]. Her goal is to create a device to monitor Earth's condition, so that her new home planet will not suffer the fate of Krypton.<ref>''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Power Girl appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game, voiced by [[Adrienne Mishler]]. In the villain campaign, the players help Parasite to defeat Power Girl and to gain a sample of her DNA so that Lex Luthor can be one step ahead of cracking the Kryptonian genetic code. She is also a playable character in DC Universe Online through \"Legends PvP\".\n* Power Girl appears as DLC in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=LEGOBatmanGame|author=LEGO Batman|number=540234286792572928|date=3 December 2014|title=Unfortunately for you, you're not dealing with #Superman...

The skits, which also feature parody versions of [[Superman]] and [[Aquaman]], feature ''AOTS'' guest host [[Carrie Keagan]] as a physically accurate recreation of the character, although the skits cast Power Girl in the stereotypical \"dumb blonde\" role; for example, the second skit has Power Girl trying to convince her friends that actor [[Kevin Bacon]] is, in fact, made of

Originally hailing from the world of [[Earth-Two]], first envisioned as the home of DC's wartime heroes as published in 1940s comic books, Power Girl becomes stranded in the [[DC Universe|main universe]] where DC stories are set, and becomes acquainted with that world's Superman and her own counterpart, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].\n\nIn common with Supergirl's origin story, she is the daughter of Superman's [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Alura|aunt]] and [[Zor-El|uncle]] and a native of the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=315-317}}</ref> The infant Power Girl's parents enabled her to escape the destruction of her home planet by placing her in a rocket ship. Although she left the planet at the same time that Superman did, her ship took much longer to reach Earth-Two. On Earth, as with other Kryptonians, Power Girl discovered she possessed abilities like super strength, flight, and heat vision, using which she became a protector of innocents and a hero for humanity. Though the specifics of how vary over subsequent retellings, Power Girl is later stranded on another Earth when a cosmic crisis affects her home of Earth-Two, and later carves out a separate identity for herself from her dimensional counterpart Supergirl once they are forced to coexist.\n\nThough they are biologically the same person, Power Girl behaves as an older, more mature, and more level-headed version of Supergirl, with a more aggressive fighting style. She also adopts a different secret identity from her counterpart. These changes are reflected in their differing costumes and superhero names as well; Power Girl sports a [[bob cut|bob]] of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume with a [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]-displaying cutout. The name Power Girl reflects that she chooses not to be seen as a derivative of Superman, but rather her own hero and this choice is reflected in the strong independent attitude of the character. Over various decades, Power Girl has been depicted as a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice Society of America]], [[Infinity, Inc.]], [[Justice League Europe]], and the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].\n\nPower Girl's origin has gone through revisions, but over time has reverted to her original conception as the Supergirl of Earth-Two. The 1985 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' eliminated Earth-Two from history, causing her to be [[retcon]]ned as the granddaughter of an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] known as [[Arion (comics)|Arion]]. This was an unpopular change and writers depicted the revised Power Girl inconsistently. The 2005\u20132006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series then restored her status as a refugee from the Krypton of the destroyed [[Pre-Crisis]] Earth-Two universe. Following DC's 2011 \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline and [[New 52]] reboot, Power Girl's origin was retold as the Supergirl of \"Earth 2\", cousin and adopted daughter of Superman, who during evil [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] [[New Gods|New God]] [[Darkseid]]'s invasion of Earth 2 becomes stranded in the main continuity of Earth 0, subsequently adopting the name Power Girl to hide her true identity. She returned to her source Earth in the story ''Earth 2: World's End'' (2014\u20132015).\n\n==Publication history==\nPower Girl was introduced in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #58 in 1976,<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 169 |quote = Along with artist Ric Estrada, [Gerry] Conway also introduced the DC Universe to the cousin of Earth-2's Superman, Kara Zor-L a.k.a.

[[Marvel Comics]]' then-publisher [[Stan Lee]] said in 1978 that when [[DC Comics]] created Power Girl after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], \"I'm pretty annoyed about that. ...I've got to ask the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] lawyer \u2013 she's supposed to be starting a lawsuit about that and I haven't heard anything. I don't like the idea. ... You know, years ago we brought out [[Wonder Man]], and [DC Comics] sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and ... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man.

During this time, she was a regularly featured character in the annual Justice Society crossovers in the original ''Justice League of America'' series. She was a founding member of ''[[Infinity Inc.]]'', appearing in each of the first 12 issues and making later guest appearances.\n\nAfter DC's continuity-altering ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, her origin was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] in ''Secret Origins'' vol. 2, #11 and she became a magic-based character with ties to ancient Atlantis, leading to appearances in ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|The Warlord]]''. The character did not receive her own self-titled series until the ''Power Girl'' miniseries of 1988.<ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=797 The Comic Book Database] \u2013 Power Girl (1988)</ref> The character became a featured member of ''[[Justice League Europe]]'' (a spin off from ''Justice League International'') for the run of the series. After the cancellation of JLI, the character joined [[Chris Claremont]]'s [[creator-owned]] series ''[[Sovereign Seven]]'' and appeared in several issues of ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]''. She eventually rejoined the Justice Society in ''JSA'' #31 and became a regular part of that series and its follow-up, ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3.\n\nPower Girl played a significant role in the continuity-changing events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005), which tied into her starring role in the first ''[[JSA Classified]]'' story arc \"Power Trip\" in 2005 (issues #1\u20134 of the series).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sequart.org/magazine/1541/your-guide-to-infinite-crisis-powertrip/|title=Your Guide to Infinite Crisis:|work=Sequart Organization}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/storyarc.php?ID=1424 The Comic Book Database] \u2013 \"Power Trip\"</ref> These stories heavily featured the revelation that Power Girl was in fact the Earth-Two Power Girl and a Kryptonian, who survived ''Crisis'', and that her Atlantean backstory had been a lie.

Kara\u2019s Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of [[virtual reality]]. The Symbioship allows her to interact with virtual copies of her parents and fellow Kryptonians. Originally, by the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is shown to be in her early twenties. However, as mentioned in ''JSA Classified'' #1, her age at arrival has now been [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] to about eighteen in post-''Crisis'' continuity.\n\nIn ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #97, Kara is reclaimed by the sentient Symbioship and reimmersed into Kandorian society for a time. Several years of virtual time elapse, in which Kara is married and has a child. She is freed with the assistance of newspaper reporter Andrew Vinson, at which point she disables the ship.\n\n===Debut===\nPower Girl's existence is not revealed to the general public until much later; her cousin [[Clark Kent|Clark]] and his wife [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois Lane]] provide her a family environment to assist her transition towards real life relationships. In her first recorded adventure, Kara assists Justice Society members [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] with containing an artificially induced volcanic eruption in China. She then joins Robin and [[Star-Spangled Kid]] to form a Super Squad to assist the Justice Society in defeating [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]] and [[Per Degaton]], who were causing disasters around the world. She pushes their base towards the [[Sun]], the heat causing the villains to fall unconscious. Later, she becomes a full member of the Society when Superman retires from active membership.\n\nHaving been raised by the Symbioship with artificial Kryptonian life experiences, Power Girl finds it difficult to adapt to life on Earth. However, with the help of reporter Andrew Vinson, she adopts the [[secret identity]] of computer [[programmer]] Karen Starr (she obtains her knowledge in this field from exposure to [[Wonder Woman]]'s [[Purple Ray]] on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]). On the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two, Power Girl's closest friend is the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]], the daughter of the Earth-Two [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]].\n\nThe first contact between Power Girl and [[Earth-One]]'s universe was on the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] ''Justice League of America #147'', written by [[Paul Levitz]] & [[Martin Pasko]], where the character shows her attraction to that reality saying, \"It has a much nicer brand of Superman, y'know?\".<ref>''[[Justice League of America]]'' #147 (October 1977): \"Crisis in the 30th Century!\".

Although she has worked with her again on a few occasions when needed, the relationship between the two is tense. In ''Birds of Prey'' #35, Power Girl admitted that she is primarily to blame for the tension, but is unable to overcome the memories of the deaths.\n\nPower Girl is a key member of the Justice Society, which she joined when it was reformed in the late 1990s. During an adventure with the JSA, she meets Arion, who reveals her Atlantean heritage to be a lie he concocted at the behest of Power Girl's \"mother\".<ref>''JSA'' #50 (September 2003).

Karen breaks down in tears upon seeing the twisted corpse of Kal-L, and swears vengeance upon whoever is behind the creation of the Black Lanterns. While on her way to the streets of Manhattan to assist her teammates, Karen hears Ma Hunkel screaming.

In the series, Starr is still the head of Starr Enterprises, which was financed by her comrade in arms [[Helena Wayne]] ([[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]]) after the latter hacked into Wayne Enterprises accounts.

Some of the missing time from this joint encounter was explored in the 6-issue mini-series [[Harley Quinn and Power Girl]] (2015). Due to an attack by some evil aliens she got knocked back to Earth and landed at Harley Quinn's feet, devoid of memories. Harley temporarily took her on as a partner and they fought crime together before being sent across the universe on a quest to return home. When Power Girl got her memories back and realized that Harley had lied to her, she was less than amused, but forgave her. However when Harley hit on her, Power Girl left her atop the Eiffel Tower. Power Girl has reappeared in Harley Quinn's ongoing series several times since and has recently taken Terra/Altee on as her sidekick/partner.\n\n===''DC Universe''===\nIn the post-''[[DC Rebirth]]'' ''DC Universe'', Power Girl (Karen Starr) appears to be trapped in some sort of interdimensional void between earths. Tanya Spears tries to get Karen Starr out by using an etheric transponder that allows her to travel there in an incorporeal state, but her physical body was disconnected from the machine by an unaware [[Wallace West (DC Comics)|Kid Flash (Wallace West)]], so both women remain trapped as a result.<ref>''Deathstroke Annual'' #1 (March 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Power Girl returns alongside many other superheroes to the DC Universe when [[Doctor Manhattan]], inspired by [[Superman]], undoes the changes that he made to the timeline.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12 (February 2020). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nShe can be seen talking with [[Blue Beetle]] on the background alongside with Supergirl in Green Lanterns #40. <ref>''Green Lanterns'' #40 (February 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs the biological cousin of Superman, Power Girl exhibits all of the classic [[Kryptonian]] powers: super strength; flight; super speed; invulnerability; x-ray, telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; freeze breath; and super-hearing. Over the years various writers have given Power Girl's Kryptonian power differing levels, reflecting the lower powers of the Earth-Two Superman [[Kal-L]]. For example, Power Girl can fly through space, but has to breathe, so before she leaves a planet, she must take a deep breath and hold it for several hours until she needs a new oxygen source. Power Girl needs to sleep or she will experience disorientation due to fatigue. However, as recently shown in \"[[Brightest Day]]\", she now draws her superpowers from yellow sunlight, just like Superman. The reason for this change has not yet been explained.\n\nSince she is from an alternative universe (pre-Crisis [[Earth Two]]), kryptonite has no effect on her, but she is still vulnerable to magic. As Karen Starr, she is an accomplished business woman and is regarded by Mr. Terrific as a first rate scientist. Even though Power Girl is from an alternative universe, her biology is still similar to Superman's. As one of a handful of characters who survived the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC editorial was initially uncertain how to portray the character and attempted to portray Power Girl with a non-Kryptonian origin for a number of years. Power Girl's abilities have fluctuated since 1986. For some time, Power Girl believed she was an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]].<ref name=IC2>''Infinite Crisis'' #2</ref> At one point, Power Girl possessed [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]];<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #42</ref> at another she was vulnerable to attacks by certain natural elements (for example, wooden weapons).<ref>''Supergirl'' #16 (1997)</ref> After sustaining severe injuries from a magic attack Power Girl retained only a degree of super strength, speed and durability.<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #9 (1989)<!--month needed--></ref> However, she later recovered her ability to fly, and writers have gradually restored her superpowers.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' #31 (2002)<!--month needed--></ref>\n\n==Physical appearance and costumes==\nPower Girl's original [[Wally Wood]] artwork (1976) showed her as relatively busty but otherwise her [[BWH|figure and build]] conformed in appearance to other contemporary comic book women. However, in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' #34 (2009), written by [[Gail Simone]], Dinah Lance, the [[Black Canary]], mentions Power Girl as having the top bosom of [[DC Universe|DCU]], comparing her assets with a \"national treasure\".<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #34 (September 2009). DC Comics.</ref> Her most common outfit is a leg-baring, figure-hugging, long-sleeved white leotard with a keyhole cut-out opening in the chest.<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #58 (January\u2013February 1976)</ref>\n\nAccording to character writer [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], \"Okay. When the character was created, Wally Wood was the artist that drew Power Girl, and he was convinced that the editors were not paying attention to anything he did. So, his inker said every issue I\u2019m going to draw the tits bigger until they notice it. It took about seven or eight issues before anyone was like hey, what\u2019s with the tits? And that\u2019s where they stopped. True story.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3318/jimmy-palmiotti-time-bomb-and-power-girl-the-breast-of-friends/|title=Jimmy Palmiotti: Time Bomb and Power Girl - the Breast of Friends? - Comics Bulletin|author=Karyn Pinter|work=Comics Bulletin|access-date=2014-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722211125/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3318/jimmy-palmiotti-time-bomb-and-power-girl-the-breast-of-friends/|archive-date=2014-07-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nPower Girl was at one time portrayed as having a highly athletic but slender physique.<ref>''Who\u2019s Who in the DC Universe'' #18 (August 1986)</ref> Artists [[Bart Sears]] (in the ''[[Justice League Europe]]'' series), and later [[Alex Ross]] (in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'') restored Power Girl's well-endowed shape. Ross rendered her as a heavily muscled ''Power Woman'' (as if she was an ardent [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]]).\n\nThe character is consistently depicted as a large breasted young woman, and her physique is one of her most recognizable attributes \u2013 to the extent that various writers have acknowledged it in both serious and humorous ways.<ref>''Power Girl'' #1, May 2009 Page 12 and 17. DC Comics.</ref><ref>[[Jeph Loeb]]. ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #6 (March 2004) Page 3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nFor example, ''Justice League Europe'' #37 (1992) attempts to explain Power Girl's revealing costume by having [[Crimson Fox]] question her about it; she receives the reply that the costume \"shows what I am: female, healthy. If men want to degrade themselves by staring, that's their problem, I'm not going to apologize for it.\"<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #37 (April 1992). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nConversely, in ''JSA: Classified'' #2 (2005), writer [[Geoff Johns]] has Power Girl explain her cleavage-window to Superman, revealing that \"the first time I made this costume, I wanted to have a symbol, like you. I just\u2026I couldn\u2019t think of anything. I thought eventually, I\u2019d figure it out. And close the hole. But I haven\u2019t.\"<ref>''JSA: Classified'' #2 (October 2005). DC Comics.</ref> A similar treatment of the character can be seen in ''Superman/Batman'' #4 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), in which the heroes need to distract the [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Toyman]] while Batman and Superman battle [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Hawkman]]. Batman suggests that Power Girl's endowments would be likely to distract Toyman, a 13-year-old boy. Toyman later attempts to make a reference to the size of her chest before being cut off by Superman.<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Superman/Batman'' #4 (January 2004). DC Comics.</ref> A variant of this joke is included in the ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' movie.<ref>Warner Premiere, ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', Warner Home Video (2009). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nPower Girl's costume design has varied greatly over the years. Her classic costume design from ''All-Star Comics'' #58 is that which is in use today: a red cape and belt, blue gloves and boots, and a white [[bodysuit]] sporting a circular [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]-exposing cut-out on her chest (its variable size and shape determined by the artist depicting her).  According to [[Gerry Conway]], \"The true, dumb reason for the circle? At the time, it was a convention for hero costumes to have a chest symbol. I thought a giant 'P' looked silly. The circle was intended as a nod to convention without being conventional. Not a sexy thing at all, until Wally Wood\u2019s inks.\"<ref>{{cite web|date=2 January 2020|url=https://twitter.com/gerryconway/status/1212830266625904640|title=The true, dumb reason for the circle?...|website=Twitter|first=Gerry|last=Conway|authorlink=Gerry Conway|accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> This window was closed for the first time in ''All-Star Comics'' #64, pencilled by Wood.<ref>All-Star Comics #64, Cover (February 1977).

She has also worn a headband, as had [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] prior to her death in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. In a guest appearance in ''[[Green Lantern]]'', Kara is seen in her large wardrobe closet with every costume design she has ever worn in DC continuity, deciding which costume to wear for that mission.<ref>''Green Lantern and Power Girl'' one-shot (October 2000), part of the \"[[Green Lantern: Circle of Fire|Circle of Fire]]\" story arc</ref> Her original costume returned when Johns and [[David Goyer]] had her rejoin the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn ''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #16, she sports a variation of her traditional costume that includes pants.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #16 (Late February 2011). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nAs part of DC's 2011 reboot of its continuity, [[The New 52]], Power Girl was reintroduced into the DC Universe as first being the Earth-2 Supergirl, where she wears a variation of the traditional Supergirl costume designed by Kevin Maguire that features red gloves and belt, and a new S-shield, identical to the new Earth 2 Superman's, and has a cape that attaches directly to the shield. However, some aspects of her continuity were retained: she was still adopted by Clark Kent and Lois Lane, married on Earth 2 before their deaths and still uses the secret identity of software entrepreneur Karen Starr.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = James Robinson| penciller = Nicola Scott| inker = Trevor Scott| story = The Price of Victory| title = Earth 2| volume = | issue = 1| date = July 2012| publisher = DC Comics| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref> After some time passes, she decides to take on a new identity as she is now trapped on the mainstream DC Earth.

DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{See also|Alternative versions of Supergirl}}\n* The first use of the name Power Girl was a story in ''Superman'' #125 (1958). In this story, [[Lois Lane]] has a dream where she is a superhero named Power Girl who is constantly coming to the aid of a bumbling [[Clark Kent]] whom she dreams as a superhero named Power Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carolastrickland.com/comics/powergirl/index.html |title=Carol Strickland's Power Girl Index |publisher=Carolastrickland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> In ''Power Girl'' #23 (June 2011), Power Girl adopts this incarnation's red wig disguise for her Karen Starr identity (along with glasses), after being advised by Superman to make Karen a real person, not just a costume.\n* In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2007), a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is formed, consisting of 52 [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel realities]]. As a result of [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] \"eating\" aspects of these realities, their histories are modified, and one takes on aspects of the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two. This reality listed as \"Earth-2\" has its own Power Girl who has spent years in space searching for her long lost cousin Superman. As shown in several issues of ''Justice Society'' (Vol 3 Annual 1 (2008) and issues 18\u201325), the mainstream Power Girl was sent to Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 by Gog and was briefly confused to be the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl by its native heroes. Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl returned to her source Earth and battled the mainstream Power Girl as she regarded the mainstream Power Girl to be an imposter who caused the disappearance of her source Earth Superman who she had been searching unsuccessfully for years off-world. Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl wears the original Power Girl costume and shows herself to be arrogant to the point of being unbalanced, and is overtly aggressive as shown when she openly tortured the mainstream Power Girl almost to the point of killing her as well as directly attacking the Earth-22 Superman. The two Power Girls parted with no apologies given for the torture. Starman stated that the mainstream Power Girl will have important interactions with the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 heroes including the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl at some points in the future (''Justice Society'' Vol 3 #25), despite the obvious disregard the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl has for the mainstream Power Girl. The Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl has not reappeared since this storyline concluded.\n* In the [[Tangent Comics]] imprint, Power Girl is a vastly powered [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] superhero created by the Chinese government. This Power Girl is of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent and is married to that reality's [[Tangent Comics#Superman|Superman]] who is an [[African American]] man with vast [[psionics|psionic]] powers. This powerful couple have conquered the Earth in the reality of [[Earth-9]].\n* The ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'' [[graphic novel]] features a Power Girl who is an ally of that reality's [[Black Canary]] and [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]. Though visually identical to her Earth-2 counterpart, her relationship to Superman or if she is even a Kryptonian at all is never mentioned in the story.\n* In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Power Girl is renamed Power Woman, and assists [[Superman]] in reforming the [[Justice League]].\n* In ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', Power Girl is a member of the Justice League. She has a daughter of her own, Kara Zor-L II.\n* A version of Power Girl appeared in ''Justice League International'' Annual #5, ''No Rules to Follow''. This version of Kara has no memory of where she came from before she arrived on Earth. As part of a team of ten revealed metahumans, she sides with the heroes who go into hiding.\n* Karen, now stripped of her powers thanks to the [[Obsidian (comics)|Great Darkness Engine]], appeared as a prisoner of [[Kid Karnevil]]'s [[Neo-Nazi]] regime shown in the ''Fatherland'' storyline depicted in ''Justice Society of America'' #37\u201340. She is portrayed as one of the world's few living surviving superheroes, with most of her comrades having been executed.\n* An elderly, grotesque and blind version of Power Girl, known as Old Karrie, appeared in an alternative timeline depicted in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''. Set in 2351, she is stated to be the sole survivor of a violent metahuman war instigated by [[Maxwell Lord]]. According to Karrie, even the immortal metahumans were killed in the war. She also claimed to have lost her powers, as a result of [[kryptonite]]. She is still somehow alive, after more than 300 years, without powers, food or even sleep.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> Another future Power Girl appears later in the series, fighting alongside a future incarnation of the Justice League. When [[Captain Atom]] is once again sent into the future, he meets an older Kara Zor-L, with white hair. She has abandoned her classical white bodysuit for a black one, with bracelets (similar to [[Wonder Woman]]'s) & [[Superman logo|Superman's S-shield]].<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14. DC Comics.</ref>\n* In the Ame-Comi line, Power Girl is that universe's equivalent of Superman. She is Kara Jor-El, daughter of Jor-El, cousin of Supergirl, and the primary protector of Metropolis. She makes no efforts to maintain a secret identity, and uses her corporation to utilize Kryptonian technology for the betterment of mankind. This version of Power Girl, unusually for most depictions of Kryptonians, doesn't get her powers from the sun.<ref>''Ame-Comi: Power Girl'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n* A red haired version of Power Girl is seen amongst the agents employed by Monarch in the battle on Earth-51 during ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]''. This version appears to be Kryptonian as she is shown to be susceptible to kryptonite and is slain by that world's version of Batman. Nothing is known about her personality or powers as she is seen only in a few panels and appears to be fully under Monarch's control and arrogantly describes Batman as being \"just a human\". It is the only line she speaks before being slain.\n* In the ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'' universe, Power Girl was cloned from Supergirl's DNA by [[Hugo Strange]] during the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and was forced by her master to fight Supergirl until the latter convinces her to turn on Strange. She escapes the facility beneath the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] thanks to the assistance of Supergirl and another superhuman clone whom she treated like a brother, Superman.\n\n==Collected editions==\n* '''''Power Girl''''' (collects ''JSA Classified'' #1-4, ''Showcase'' #97-99 and ''Secret Origins'' #11)\n* '''''Power Girl: A New Beginning''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #1\u20136)\n* '''''Power Girl: Aliens and Apes''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #7\u201312)\n* '''''Power Girl: Bomb Squad''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #13\u201318)\n* '''''Power Girl: Old Friends''''' (collects ''Power Girl'' #19\u201327)\n* '''''Power Girl: Power Trip''''' (collects ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 and ''Power Girl'' #1\u201312)\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Although Power Girl did not directly appear in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series or the follow-up, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the ''JLU'' character '''Galatea''' (voiced by [[Nicholle Tom]]) is based on her. This character is a [[cloning|clone]] of [[Supergirl]] (also voiced by Tom) created by [[Emil Hamilton]] (who sees her as a [[daughter]], while she sees him as a [[father figure]]) from [[Project Cadmus]] as a contingency plan in case the Justice League turned against the US. Although the clone resembles Power Girl and wears a similar hairstyle and costume (at one point, she briefly drapes a red workout towel over her shoulder, resembling the half-cape of her comic book counterpart), her personality and origin are significantly different, being a supervillain who seeks the League's destruction. She also possesses a mental link with Supergirl, allowing them to experience each other's recent memories in the form of dreams. Galatea first appears in the [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1: 2004\u20132005|first season's sixth episode, \"Fearful Symmetry.\"]] She subsequently appears at the end of [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|season 2's \"Flashpoint\"]], and she is last seen in [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|season 2's \"Panic in the Sky\"]]. In her last appearance, \"Panic in the Sky\", she fights Supergirl for control of the [[JLA Watchtower|Watchtower]]. She is defeated by Supergirl, who traps her in a contact, causing all of the Watchtower's power to flow through her, causing an overload. Following the massive surge of electricity, she is left twitching and catatonic; it is unknown whether she ultimately survives. Conversely, this continuity's Supergirl borrows several elements from Power Girl, such as having been in suspended animation (which had not been introduced in the Kara Zor-El mythology at that point) and being a surrogate cousin of Kal-El rather than a biological relative. Also, in her first appearance, in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', when she first meets [[Jimmy Olsen]], she's without a disguise and tells him that her name is \"Karen\".\n* ''[[Smallville]]''\n** In the ''Smallville'' [[Smallville (season 2)|season 2]] episode \"Visage\", [[Chloe Sullivan]] identifies '''Tina Greer''' ([[Lizzy Caplan]]) by the moniker \"Power Girl\".\n** In the ''Smallville'' [[Smallville (season 3)|season 3]] episode \"Extinction\", the \"meteor freaks\" database created by Chloe Sullivan uses a program called Starr-Ware Database System 5.0, which hints at the existence of Karen Starr's corporation, Starrware, in the ''Smallville'' universe.\n** In the ''Smallville'' season 3 finale \"Covenant\", a girl named Kara (played by [[Adrianne Palicki]]) claims to be from Krypton, although she does not claim to be Kal-El's relative. However, when [[Lana Lang (Smallville)|Lana Lang]] asks who she is, Clark pretends Kara is his visiting cousin. At the end of the episode, she is revealed to be '''Lindsay Harrison''', a human empowered and possibly [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Jor-El]]'s technology. As with many of the show's future superheroes, who tend to be dressed in the same colors as the costumes of their comic-book counterparts, Lindsay is dressed in white, matching the color of Power Girl's costume (minus the red cape and blue boots, as Lindsay never wore either a jacket or shoes).\n** In the ''Smallville'' [[Smallville (season 10)|season 10]] episode \"Supergirl\", Lois Lane suggests \"Power Girl\" as a name for Kara Zor-El (then known as \"Maiden of Might\").\n* Former ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' executive producer [[Andrew Kreisberg]] hinted that Power Girl could appear in the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/08/spoiler-room-blindspot-outlander-originals-spoilers |title=Spoiler Room: Scoop on Blindspot, Outlander, The Originals and more |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=April 9, 2016 |access-date=April 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n* In the ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' episode \"#Powersurge\", Supergirl (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) is presumed dead after a major battle with [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]] and decides to reinvent herself as a new heroine and becomes Power Girl. Her comic book origins on Earth-2 are referenced when Superman begins to suspect the ruse and she makes up a story on the spot about being an alternate universe's Supergirl.\n\n===Film===\n* Power Girl appears in the animated ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' film, voiced by [[Allison Mack]]. This marks her first true appearance in animation, as opposed to the above ''JLU'' version which is merely based on her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=502 |title=The World's Finest |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> In the film, she works under the command of [[Captain Atom]], who is under orders from President [[Lex Luthor]]. When Superman is framed for murdering [[Metallo]], she is the only one of her group to truly doubt his guilt, and she later switches sides and helps him and [[Batman]]. She angrily attacks [[Major Force]] after it is revealed he killed Metallo and almost killed Batman; in the fight, she accidentally ruptures Force's containment suit, almost causing him to explode, which would unleash his nuclear energies on the city. The potential disaster is averted by Captain Atom, who absorbs all of the dying Force's energy into his own containment suit, making himself considerably more powerful in the process but passing out from the strain. She is later revealed to have helped them escape from [[Hawkman]] and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. As in the graphic novel on which the film is based, she is assigned to watch over the new teenage [[Toyman]], [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Hiro Okamura]], who finds her quite attractive, even \"testing\" his X-ray goggles on her, which she finds offensive; so she breaks his goggles and avoids him from then on (he later tries to make a comment on her breast size as well, before being interrupted by Batman). She is knocked unconscious by Lex Luthor in his new [[kryptonite]] enhanced battle-suit, but she recovers and is seen at the end, along with her squad members, taking the now-impeached Luthor into custody.\n* An alternate reality version of Power Girl makes a cameo appearance in the animated movie ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]''. She appears as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] and is intended as the alternative reality's version of Supergirl.\n* Power Girl is portrayed by [[Ashley Hinshaw]] in the 2011 short film ''[[The Death and Return of Superman (film)|The Death and Return of Superman]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/in-this-semi-drunk-movie-about-supermans-death-elijah-5882253 |title=In this semi-drunk movie about Superman's death, Elijah Wood is Cyborg Superman |first=Cyriaque |last=Lamar |website=[[io9]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |date=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/chronicle-max-landis-death-and-return-of-superman/ |title=''Chronicle'' Writer Max Landis Vents About The Death and Return of Superman |first=Dave |last=Trumbore |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n* While Power Girl doesn't appear herself, the animated ''[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]'' film briefly features a waitress, at a superhero themed restaurant called Superbabes, who is dressed in a Power Girl costume.

Englehart recounted: {{quote|When I took over [''Green Lantern''], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] was the GL, but everybody expect Hal Jordan to come back and relegate John to backup duty once again. I decided that John deserved better, so I asked myself, 'Why can't there be two GLs?' And that led to, 'Why can't there be more than two?' That eventually led to the GL Corps, but along the way, I decided to resurrect the lost GL, Guy Gardner, who had been terminally bland and then brain-damaged\u2014a completely useless character, as things stood. I was being a good soldier, trying to help my friend [[Dick Giordano]] sell the book, and it turned out to be the second biggest mistake of my entire career because ever since, DC has claimed that since Joe and I didn't create the original Guy Gardner, our completely new take counts for nothing. If I had called the new guy Joe Smith we would have earned major royalties, but as it is, we get nothing, and we get dissed by the people we helped. So adding it all up, I wish I hadn't done it.<ref name=\"back91\">{{cite journal|last=Kingman|first=Jim |title=All About Guy (Gardner) |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91|pages=2\u201311 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>}}\n\nStaton's design for Guy Gardner was based on the character Major Ronald Merrick from the TV series ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'', as Staton saw Merrick's entitlement and resentment as a parallel to Guy Gardner.<ref name=\"back91\"/> Gardner's later blue costume, introduced in the first issue of the character's first ongoing series (cover dated October 1992), was also designed by Staton.<ref name=\"back91\"/> During this series, retitled ''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' with issue #17, Guy Gardner is gradually evolved into a more vulnerable and heroic character; [[Beau Smith]], who wrote the series for most of its run, was concerned that leaving him as an angry jerk would make the character stagnant and one-note.<ref name=\"back91\"/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\nGuy was raised in [[Baltimore]] by his parents, Roland and Peggy Gardner. His father, Roland, was an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who beat Guy every day. Some of Guy's injuries were visible such as bruises, cuts and bumps but others were invisible and were emotionally inflicted. Guy worked hard in school to try to win his father's approval, but Roland instead lavished attention and compliments upon Guy's older brother, Mace. Guy's only escape at this time was ''[[General Glory]]'' comic books, going so far as to model his bowl haircut on Glory's sidekick, Ernie.<ref>''Guy Gardner'' #11 (August 1993)</ref>\n\nDuring his mid-teens, Guy became a [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquent]]. He constantly defied authority. Later, he was straightened out by his older brother, Mace, now a police officer, and he eventually went to college, supporting himself, and earning bachelor's degrees in education and psychology from the [[University of Michigan]], where he also [[Michigan Wolverines football|played football]] until a career-ending injury. The injury deeply affected Guy.\n\nAfter college, Guy worked as a [[social welfare provision|social welfare]] caseworker, dealing with prison inmates and their rehabilitation. He abandoned this line of work, however, fearing it brought out his aggressive nature. Moving on, he became a teacher for children with disabilities. This job brought out the loving and caring side of himself.<ref>''Guy Gardner'' #14 (November 1993)</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Guy is now an ex-police officer and middle child of a family with a long tradition of membership in the [[Baltimore Police Department]] going back to 1860. He is the second human to earn a Green Lantern ring, after coming to the rescue of his older brother Gerard who had become pinned down during a police shootout with a street gang.<ref name=\"glc0\"/>\n\nIn this version Guy has a strained relationship with his father Ebenezer Gardner, a decorated cop forced into disability after taking a bullet in the line of duty, for issues related to the unexplained incident which kicked Guy off the police force.<ref name=\"glc0\">''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #0 (September 2012)</ref> This was retconned in [[DC Rebirth]] which returned to his original origin of Guy being abused by his alcoholic father as a kid, which was seen during Guys fight with the Sinestro Corps member [[Arkillo]] in the present,<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #16</ref> and later his father being reintroduced under his original name Roland Gardner.<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #46</ref>\n\n===Green Lantern Corps===\n[[Image:Green Lantern 59 Mar 1968.jpg|thumb|Guy Gardner's first appearance in ''Green Lantern'' #59 (March, 1968).]]\n\nThe appointed Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814, an alien named [[Abin Sur]] from the planet Ungara, crash-landed on Earth after being mortally wounded. As Sur died, his [[power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] sought and found two potential successors: Guy Gardner and [[Hal Jordan]]. Jordan was nearer to the crash, so he was chosen over Gardner.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #59 (March 1968)</ref> In the same story, the Guardian supercomputers predicted Guy would have perished early in his career if he had been chosen first. In the later ''[[Booster Gold]]'' series it was shown that a time traveling Booster convinced Gardner to visit his dying father, thus ensuring that Jordan would be the candidate in closest proximity. Gardner was relegated to backup status should anything happen to Jordan.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #2 (November 2007)</ref>\n\nWhen Jordan became aware of Gardner's status as his backup, he went out of his way to set up a chance meeting, and the two became friends. Though Gardner was originally naive to Jordan's secret identity, he eventually assisted Jordan during his adventures.{{issue|date=September 2012}} He is later partnered with Jordan after completing his training under [[Kilowog]].<ref name=\"glc0\"/>\n\nDuring an [[earthquake]], Gardner was hit by a bus while attempting to rescue one of his students. During his recovery, the [[Guardians of the Universe|Guardians]] recruited [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] to be Jordan's new \"backup\".<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #87 (December 1971)</ref>\n\nSome time later, during a period where Gardner was performing his duties as a backup Green Lantern, Hal Jordan's power battery, the source of the ring's energy, exploded in Gardner's face due to damage done to it by the Crumbler and trapped him in the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #116 (May 1979)</ref> Jordan and Kari Limbo, Gardner's girlfriend at the time, both believed him to be dead, and the two developed a romantic relationship that ultimately culminated in a marriage proposal.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #121 (October 1979)</ref> Gardner was able to interrupt the wedding by contacting Limbo [[Telepathy|telepathically]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #122 (November 1979)</ref> By then, however, Gardner's bus accident, the power battery explosion, his assimilation into the zone, and the subsequent torture at the hands of [[General Zod]] and other residents of the Phantom Zone had affected his mind. When Gardner was released from the Phantom Zone, he was diagnosed with [[brain damage]] and was [[coma]]tose for a number of years.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #123 (December 1979)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the [[Guardians of the Universe]] split into two factions over how to confront the Crisis. A minority faction of six Guardians emulated their former brethren, the [[Controllers (DC Comics)|Controllers]], by recruiting a Green Lantern to directly attack and destroy the forces of the [[antimatter]] [[universe]]. For reasons unknown, Gardner was revived by the renegade Guardians, given a power ring not tied to the Central Power Battery on [[Oa]] and sporting a uniform similar to that worn by the Fists of the Guardians, and given a mission. He was to recruit and command the deadliest and most powerful criminals in the universe, including the [[Shark (comics)|Shark]], [[Hector Hammond]] (left behind after trying to attack Gardner), [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]], Throttle, Blindside, and [[Goldface]], to launch a strike against the home base of the [[Anti-Monitor]].<ref>Green Lantern 197 (February 1986)</ref>\n\nGardner's brain damage manifested itself in the form of an arrogant, violent, unstable, and often childish new personality.<ref name=\"back91\"/> Gardner believed himself to be the last \"true\" Green Lantern, superior to all the others, particularly Jordan. Five of the renegade Guardians were slain by a wave of antimatter, and the sixth eventually reconciled with the rest of the Guardians. In the meantime, Gardner succeeded in his task of recruiting powerful villains. Both Hal Jordan and John Stewart prevented Gardner from completing his mission, which would have ultimately destroyed the universe.\n\nFollowing the Crisis, the Guardians, along with the [[Zamarons]], left the universe to create the next generation of Guardians. Gardner was placed under the care of the remaining Guardian-turned-mortal [[Appa Ali Apsa]] (who later went on to become the \"Mad Guardian\") on the planet Maltus in order to teach Gardner the ways of the Corps, a situation which Gardner resented. Gardner eventually escaped and returned to Earth, but was recaptured by Appa Ali Apsa (with the assistance of two Corps honor guards) intending to reclaim Gardner's power ring. At the request of Kari Limbo, Hal Jordan pleaded on Gardner's behalf for his freedom, which was granted with no return of gratitude from Gardner.\n\nAs a consequence of the Corps executing Sinestro the majority of the Corps lost their power rings; Gardner was one of the few remaining active Green Lanterns. After the defeat and death of the \"Mad Guardian\" the Guardians returned and assigned Gardner to be the official Green Lantern of Sector 2814 while Jordan was assigned to recruit new Corps members.\n\n===Justice League International===\nSoon after obtaining his freedom from Maltus, Gardner became a founding member of the [[Justice League International]] after the original [[Justice League|JLA]] disbanded during the 1986-87 storyline \"[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]\". In his time with the JLI, Gardner resented [[Batman]]'s leadership of the group, going so far as to challenge the Dark Knight to a fist fight; Batman downed Guy with one punch after Guy took off his ring. The other members left him lying on the floor. When Guy woke up, he banged his head on a console and knocked himself out. When he comes to, his personality has changed to kind and gentle.<ref>''Justice League'' #5 (September 1987). DC Comics.</ref> Until he hit his head again at a later point, Guy was kind, sweet, boyishly innocent, and a perfect gentleman to the female members of the group. Guy's run in JLI was full of constant personality shifts and endless arguing between team members. This led to a fight with [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]],<ref>''Justice League International'' #18</ref><ref>''Justice League International'' #19 (October 1988)</ref> the sucker-punching of [[Blue Beetle]] during a boxing match,<ref>''Justice League America'' #52 (July 1991). DC Comics.</ref> and finally him quitting the team after being \"belittled\" by [[Superman]].<ref>''Justice League America'' #63 (June 1992). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nGardner was romantically involved with his fellow Leaguer [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], even learning some rudimentary Norwegian, but he is often callous to her and slow to admit his feelings.<ref name=\"back91\"/> Their relationship ended with her death at the hands of the [[Overmaster]].\n\n===Guy Gardner: Reborn===\n[[Image:Guy gardner 1.jpg|thumb|Guy Gardner with his yellow power ring]]\nAfter completing his assignment of recruiting new Corps members, Jordan returned to Earth to reclaim his title as Green Lantern of Sector 2814. Gardner's response was to challenge Jordan to a fight where the loser would quit the Corps. Gardner lost and surrendered his ring. After some failed run-ins with Goldface and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] as a non-powered vigilante, he set out on a quest to regain his power and identity. Tricking [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] into assisting him, he invaded [[Qward]] to find the yellow power ring of [[Sinestro]], but was told by the Qwardians that the ring was unique and never returned to Qward. He then travelled to Oa where he found it on Sinestro's hand in Oa's \"Crypt of the Green Lantern Corps\".<ref>''Guy Gardner Reborn'' #1</ref><ref>''Guy Gardner Reborn #3 (1992)</ref>\n\nGardner's own comic series began with him using the yellow ring and a modified costume similar to his Green Lantern costume but from street clothes. The yellow ring did not use a battery to recharge, instead needing to be used against the power rings of [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lanterns]] so it could absorb their residual energy to restore its power, which Gardner discovered by accident when [[Kilowog]] fought him while his ring was powerless.\n\nGuy Gardner returned to Earth to pick a fight with Superman but eventually rejoined the Justice League and helped battle the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], in which he and his teammates were brutally beaten and Superman was killed during the creature's defeat. During the [[Reign of the Supermen]] storyline when four different versions of Superman appeared after his death, Guy fought, became allies with and later endorsed the Last Son of Krypton Superman, who was actually the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. Later, Guy cleared his name of murder that was committed by his Draalian clone \"Joe Gardner\" and learned that his brother Mace had become the assassin Militia; after a brawl between the two, Guy decided to take the codename Warrior.\n\nIn the ''[[Justice League#JLA: Classified|JLA: Classified]]''-based miniseries ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League]]'', Guy assisted the [[Super Buddies]] and was revealed to have kept his yellow ring.\n\n===''Guy Gardner: Warrior''===\nBy this time, the power of Guy's ring had begun to fluctuate due to the meddling of the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] (Hal Jordan). Deprived of his powers, Guy wore a golden [[exosuit]] provided by [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]] which simulated superhuman strength. Guy was not happy with this initial suit as it did not feel as natural as using a ring power. The exosuit first appeared in issue 18, the second issue to feature the new title of ''Guy Gardner; Warrior''.  Although the exosuit was destroyed during combat with Militia in issue 19, Guy's power ring provided him with a new exosuit constructed of ring energy. This was much more to Guy's liking.\n\nWhen a grief-stricken and power-hungry Hal Jordan destroyed the Green Lantern Corps after the destruction of his hometown, [[Ganthet]] first came to Guy Gardner to offer him the last [[Green Lantern]] power ring. When Gardner refused, Ganthet decided to entrust it to [[Kyle Rayner]].<ref>''Green Lantern Secret Files & Origins'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter Guy started having visions of Oa's destruction and his power started to mysteriously increase, he led a group of heroes to Oa to find out what happened to the Corps. Guy and his team were ambushed and quickly defeated by Parallax. Guy managed to trick Hal into thinking that he was dead by simulating a ring powered construct of himself that had been impaled by an energy pike. Guy used the element of surprise and managed to evenly match Hal in a fight for a few minutes due to the fact that his ring siphoned residual Green Lantern plasma-energy. Eventually Hal gained the upper hand, defeated Gardner and destroyed his ring, depriving him of his ring-powered exosuit. Parallax then punched out one of Gardner's eyes and sent him and his team back to Earth. Guy awoke in the hospital after spending three weeks in a coma. Deprived again of his power ring, he was forced to find an alternate means of acquiring power.\n\n[[Image:Guy gardner warrior 44.png|thumb|Warrior: the last Vuldarian]]\nGuy would join up with the [[Doc Savage]] analogue<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/busted/111688512338040.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927003714/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/busted/111688512338040.htm |archivedate=2013-09-27 }}</ref> Buck Wargo and his globe-trotting Monster Hunters, which featured obscure [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] hero Tiger-Man (Desmond Farr) along with Joey Hong and Rita Muldoon. On an expedition to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]], Gardner found and drank from the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] of the Warrior Water. This activated alien DNA that had been implanted in his bloodline a millennium ago by a space-traveling race called the [[Vuldarian]]s. He discovered new, shapeshifting abilities that writer [[Beau Smith]] claims were editorially mandated to capitalize on the success of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'',<ref>Smith, Beau.

[[Comics Bulletin]]. accessed September 15, 2011.</ref> and which would allow him to resume his role as a superhero. When Guy first emerged, his body had assumed the shape of his old exosuit, albeit red instead of gold, and his lost eye had been restored. Guy's body remained that way until the end of the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' storyline, [[morphing]] weapons directly out of his arms as of ''Zero Hour'' issue #2.\n\nGardner opened a superhero theme bar called Warriors, as both a source of income and a base between his adventures.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> He would be joined by Buck's group, Veronna, mightiest of the Nabba Jungle tribe of women, who guarded the Warrior Water and believed herself to be destined as Guy's mate (sharing limited telepathy with him), and those who were brought on as bouncers for Warriors but acted as fellow adventurers: [[Lady Blackhawk]] (displaced in time by [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]), [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], [[Metal Men|Lead]], and [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]].\n\nHis early days as Warrior saw him struggling with his newfound powers. He had difficulty changing his body into any weapon, and his transformations often caused him pain. After a breakdown that led to a confrontation with Superman and [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]], with some soul-searching help from his supposed ancestor Cardone, Gardner was finally able to use his new powers to form most non-energy-based weapons from his body, as well as absorb some forms of energy and redirect them through his various \"weapons\". Another ability, his capability to use the knowledge of warriors from across space and time, was rarely used and mostly forgotten. Guy had many enemies during the series including [[Evil Star]], [[Gorilla Grodd]], Black Serpent, Sledge, [[Major Force]], Martika the Seductress, Bronkk and the Tormocks (ancient nemeses to the Vuldarians), Mudakka, and Dementor as well as the return of his clone (now going by the name [[Enforcer (DC Comics)|Enforcer]]), the Quorum, and his brother Militia with girlfriend Honey. He teamed with many heroes including [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]], with whom he became close friends after discovering Steel attended the University of Michigan and played on the same football team.<ref>''Showcase '96'' #1 (January 1996)</ref> Gardner also became good friends with Lobo after the defeat of the Tormocks (so far as the bounty hunter giving Gardner one of his space bikes and the skull of Bronkk).<ref name=\"GuyGardner\">''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #39 (February 1996)</ref>\n\nDuring the time that Gardner fought against Dementor, he learned that his enemy was also a product of Vuldarian breeding. Dementor's father had raped a Vuldarian woman. Dementor was sent to Hell, where he revealed that he was the one responsible for Gardner's constant personality shifts (in a sense, explaining why his personality changed drastically over the years). In the last issues Gardner finally dealt with his \"family\", as well as revealing another side of his Vuldarian powers, the ability to heal mortal wounds.\n\nOver the course of the series, Gardner made peace with a great deal of his past. On one Christmas, the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], on behalf of the [[Phantom Stranger]], made it possible for Guy to communicate with his deceased father, who apologized for the abuse, both physical and mental, he placed upon Guy, his brother Mace, and their mother. He told Guy how proud he was of all the accomplishments Guy achieved as a man and the pair reconciled. Afterward, Guy would give his condolences to Ice's mother over their shared loss of her daughter and she provided him an ice sculpture to remind him of her daughter. A celebration held at Warriors for the holiday saw Guy cross paths with an inebriated [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] and the pair shared a kiss after expressing how much they missed Ice.<ref name=\"GuyGardner\" /> It was suggested they slept together after this in the following issue.\n\nAfter the ''Warrior'' series was canceled, Gardner continued to appear in the DC Universe; most notably as a recurring character in the ''Green Lantern'' series during Kyle Rayner's run and a reserve member of the JLA. It was thought he was killed during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' crossover.<ref>''JLA: Our Worlds at War'' #1 (September 2001)</ref> He was later discovered to be trapped in a pocket of [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] called the Gorge in [[General Zod]]'s country of [[Pokolistan]]. After freeing himself by switching places with Superman villain [[Kancer]] as ruler of the Gorge, his Warrior powers were apparently enhanced. He declared it his job to do less ethical things that heroes like [[Superman]] could not.<ref>''Action Comics'' #789</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' #790 (May 2002)</ref> However, this new direction only lasted for 30 issues of ''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' (which crossed over in the Way of the Warrior with ''[[Justice League America]]'' and ''[[Hawkman]]'' featuring cameos of Lobo and former Green Lantern Probert) and his many several appearances over a span of ten years.\n\n===Return to the Corps===\nDuring the 2005 [[miniseries]] ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'', Gardner's Vuldarian [[DNA]] is strangely overwritten by his human DNA when [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] possesses Gardner and several Green Lanterns. Hal Jordan's ring splits in two and Gardner's ring is restored to him. Eventually, Parallax is defeated by the combined effort of all five active Green Lanterns, including Gardner. The Guardians then select Gardner as one of the senior officers of the new Green Lantern Corps.\n\nIn the 2005\u20132006 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' (written by [[Dave Gibbons]]), the Guardians assign Gardner to be one of the Corps' three main instructors, along with [[Kilowog]] and Kyle Rayner. The trio is responsible for the training of the new Corps, to which the Guardians intend to name 7,200 members. Gardner is not at all appreciative of his new role, and when he complains to the Guardians, they tell him that success in training new recruits could lead to him being given a new position.\n\nGardner plays a significant role in defeating the Spider Guild attack on Oa. Discovering that trainee [[Soranik Natu]] has disappeared into the forbidden [[Vega]] star system, which the Guardians' pact with the [[Psion (comics)|Psions of Vega]] forbids Green Lanterns from entering, Gardner and Kyle Rayner led a rescue mission in direct violation of Oan policy. Once there, the Lanterns discover the Spider Guild nest and determine that its next target is the Oan sun. Returning just as the attack commences, Gardner gathers the frightened trainee Green Lanterns and rallies them with a speech that impresses even his longtime rival, Hal Jordan. Gardner's performance in repelling the attack results in his promotion to Lantern #1 of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, a position of authority over other Lanterns. In this new role, Gardner is expected to \"think outside the box\" and \"do the jobs other Lanterns cannot,\" a function well-suited to his irascible personality.\n\n===\"Infinite Crisis\" and \"One Year Later\"===\nIn his new role as Lantern #1, Guy leads the Corps in the defense of Oa against [[Superboy-Prime]], creating a wall of energy to slow the rampaging teen and calling a \"Code 54\", authorizing the use of extreme force. Guy supervises the final capture and imprisonment of Superboy-Prime, locking him in a red [[Sun-Eater]] provided by [[Donna Troy]] and organizing a constant watch of fifty Lanterns to keep him imprisoned.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7 (June 2006)</ref>\n\nGuy spends the entire \"missing year\" following ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' doing missions for the Guardians without shore leave (though he is infrequently seen on Earth in the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' weekly limited series, it should be assumed he has sneaked away from the Guardians' watch). When he is finally granted some time off one year later, his relaxation is cut short by an attack by a grudge-holding Bolphunga the Relentless.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #5 (October 2006)</ref> Soon after, Guy assisted [[Hal Jordan]] on an unsanctioned mission to the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] homeworld, Biot. Through Hal and Guy's efforts, several long-lost and believed deceased lanterns (including Arisia, [[List of Green Lanterns#Chaselon|Chaselon]], [[Jack T. Chance]], [[Graf Toren]], [[List of Green Lanterns#Hannu/Honnu|Hannu]], [[Ke'Haan]], [[Laira (comics)|Laira]], and [[Boodikka]]) were freed from imprisonment by the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #11 (May 2006)</ref><ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #12 (July 2006)</ref> Upon returning from the mission, Guy was punished by the Guardians and forced to endure one month as one of the fifty Lanterns on \"Prime Duty\". Lanterns of the Honor Guard, like Guy, are allowed to break the rules three times before expulsion.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #13 (September 2006)</ref>\n\nAccording to ''Green Lantern'' writer [[Geoff Johns]] in a 2006 [[Newsarama]] interview, Prime would not be escaping under Guy's watch. \"Not at all. That\u2019s ridiculous. Anyone who\u2019s read Guy Gardner for the last two years in ''Green Lantern'' or in ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'' knows that he\u2019s a much better, stronger character than that. And even in the old Giffen stuff, he would probably break some rules, taunt the other heroes, and drink a beer or two, but he would not be that much of an idiot. He was never that much of an idiot, and certainly not with what I'm doing with him, or with what Dave Gibbons is doing with him in ''Corps''. He has his moments, and he\u2019s a really fun character, but he's definitely not going to be a moron. His role is not DCU Moron.

Dubbed \"[[Green Lantern Corps#The Corpse|The Corpse]]\", members forsake their rings for stealthier powers provided by the Guardians. Guy took part in one mission as part of this secretive unit. He was tasked with locating Von Daggle, a Durlan who was formerly in charge of the Corpse. Gardner relayed a message from the Guardians, informing Daggle that he was reinstated. From there, Daggle took command of Gardner, leading him to the homeworld of the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]], a race of superscientists with a grudge against Earth. Together, they defeated a super-evolved Dominator, though the Corpse's use of lethal force did not sit well with Guy. Gardner informed Daggle that he couldn't be a part of his crew and Daggle wiped his memory, musing that \"humans never make the cut\".\n\n===\"Sinestro Corps War\"===\nIn the \"[[Sinestro Corps War]]\" storyline, Superboy-Prime and Cyborg Superman escape imprisonment when the [[Sinestro Corps]] attacks Oa, killing the guards on Prime Duty. Guy, along with fellow Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], are captured by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] during battle and brought to Qward.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #21 (July 2007)</ref> Guy and Stewart are then held prisoner by [[Lyssa Drak]], who forces them to relive tragedies in their lives.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #22 (August 2007)</ref> Hal manages to defeat Lyssa and free Guy and John from their nightmare.

Despite Ice's uncertainty as to the wisdom of reviving the old romance, Guy's professions of adoration seemed sufficient to convince her to meet him for a proper date on the same spot exactly one month later.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #19 (December 2007)</ref> Before leaving Earth to open a bar/restaurant on Oa, Guy leaves Ice a note.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #20 (January 2008)</ref> Ice declines his proposal to cohabit on Oa, and Guy reads her desire to rebuild a new life on Earth with her best friend [[Fire (comics)|Beatriz]] as an attempt to distance from him, accusing Beatriz of pitting Ice against him.

However, the Guardians were really planning to undermine all four Earth Lanterns by sabotaging Guy's career after building it up, ensuring a precipitous fall.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 5 #12 (August 2012)</ref>\n\nThis plan begins when the Guardians promote Guy to the role of 'Sentinel Lantern' and entrust him with guarding a group of ambassadors travelling to a planet for a crucial conference. They subsequently release Guy's old enemy Xar from the Science cells and create the impression that he is going after Guy's family on Earth. They predicted that Guy would abandon his duty and return to Earth while Xar attacks the ambassadors.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #13 (September 2012)</ref> With the rest of his team having been absorbed by the Third Army, Guy escapes only through his strength of will, averting the Third Army's attempt to 'recruit' him. With Xar having killed the ambassadors, the Guardians order Guy to resign from the Corps in order to redeem the damage he has done.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #14 (November 2012)</ref>\n\nFeeling depressed after a phone conversation with his family, during which his father dismisses superheroes as overly reliant on their powers, Guy attempts to spend the night fighting crime with only his natural skills. This backfires when he interrupts a police sting operation, culminating in him being arrested by his sister.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #15 (December 2012)</ref> While in prison, he is attacked by the Third Army, but is rescued by Green Lanterns [[Simon Baz]] and B'dg, who send the civilians to safety before crushing the Third Army and retreating to the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on the moon.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #16 (January 2013)</ref> Guy is angered when he discovers that the Guardians have turned against him and the Corps. Simon and B'dg dispatch him to the planet Oa. There, Guy reclaims his ring and joins Kilowog and the others reserve Corps members in their rebellion against the treacherous Guardians.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps Annual'' #1 (January 2013)</ref>\n\nAfter the villainous First Lantern is destroyed and the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, Guy and Kilowog locate where Salaak was imprisoned by the Guardians and free him. Guy is angered when he discovers Salaak's surveillance footage of Xar being released by the Guardians. Salaak helps him locate Xar\u2019s whereabouts, and discovers that Xar is located on Earth and preparing to kill off Guy's family. Guy manages to speed up with [[Saint Walker]]'s willing assistance to arrive in time to blast Xar to be incinerated, and reunites with his family.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #20 (May 2013)</ref>\n\nFollowing the event, Guy was placed in the cast of the ''Red Lanterns'' series where he was sent by Hal Jordan to join the Red Lanterns undercover. He defeats Atrocitus and takes command of the group. It is revealed that part of his decision to join with the Red Lanterns is feeling as if he has never fit in as a Green Lantern.<ref>''Red Lanterns'' #21 (June 2013)</ref> As a Red Lantern Gardner manages to keep his rage in check, successfully leading most of the Red Lanterns; Atrocitus leads a splinter group and allows new Red rings to cause murderous justice-based rampages to continue.

He later acquired Sinestro's [[power ring (DC Comics)#Yellow|Qwardian power ring]], which was later revealed to be based on the bearer's control of fear. This early version of a yellow power ring was powered by absorbing plasma radiation that had been expelled from a Green Lantern ring and seemed to make Guy more invulnerable than a normal Green Lantern power-ring. He used both for basic Lantern abilities including constructs, flight, and energy projection, though it also caused him some difficulty on occasion. For example, if he asked it a question he would get an answer in Qwardian, which he didn't speak. In ''Green Lantern: Rebirth'' #6 it is mentioned that Guy Gardner's ring is constantly sparking with energy, as if unable to contain the power of his will. Following Kyle Rayner's apparent death, Guy's rage caused a red power ring to latch onto him, bestowing on him the ability to generate napalm like flames that would burn even in space. Unlike most Red Lanterns, Guy retained his intelligence, and, like Hal Jordan when he was under the thrall of a red ring, Guy was able to shape the red flames into solid constructs. Unlike Hal, Guy's green ring remained active, allowing him to combine the two lights and obliterate the Black Lanterns and their rings. Guy was also the first male character seen to wield a love-powered Star Sapphire ring, wearing it in conjunction with the Red Lantern ring (he stated that the result felt like he had blood and sugar in his mouth). During the events of the ''Green Lanterns: The Lost Army'', Guy created a new uniform using both his green and red rings. Later during the final battle, the Power Converters used by Lightsmiths, converted Guy's Red Lantern Ring to a Green Lantern ring, thus ending his connection to the Red Lantern Corps.<ref>''Green Lantern: The Lost Army'' #6</ref>\n\n===Vuldarian powers===\nGuy's Vuldarian powers included limited [[shapeshifting]] abilities in which he could create weapons out of his body. At first, these transformations caused him pain and he was unable to shrink from his 7-foot height. He maintained super strength, stamina, and durability around Superman's strata, the power of flight, capable of surviving in outer space unassisted, accelerated healing, and had access to the memories of deceased Vuldarians (touted as the most dangerous warriors in the history of the universe).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/busted/107815836153701.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810202316/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/busted/107815836153701.htm |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}</ref> Trained by the Vuldarian Cardone, Gardner became highly trained in using his abilities and practiced extensively in the martial arts. During the [[Green Lantern: Rebirth|return of Parallax]], he suffered a [[metahuman]] power discharge and his Vuldarian abilities went into recession. Coincidentally, when he awoke he was near Hal Jordan's power ring, which has the ability to duplicate itself. Gardner once more had a power ring, and following the return of the Guardians of the Universe, he was once again a Green Lantern.\n\n===Green Lantern (Tangent Comics)===\n{{Main|Tangent Comics}}\nGuy became the caretaker of a mystical artifact that survived the events of the 2005 \"[[Infinite Crisis]]\" storyline, after it was discovered on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]] by Kyle Rayner. It has the power to temporarily awaken the dead and has also served as a dimensional gateway.

He goes to Earth with Ganthet, however, when he learns Kyle Rayner had disappeared (he had actually been killed by Sinestro). The two meet with Superman to confront him about his activities to force peace, but the Man of Steel refuses to listen. As Hal Jordan leaves with Ganthet for Oa, Guy remains behind to watch over Earth. He eventually leaves when he discovers Superman has allied himself with the Sinestro Corps, spending the next seven months building an army of Green Lanterns to combat Superman. He returns to try and reason with Superman one final time, but the war begins. Guy goes to Earth to confront Hal about his choosing Superman over the Corps, and saves Carol Ferris. Near the end of Year Two, Guy is confronted by a now Yellow Lantern Hal, who falsely believes that Guy killed John Stewart (when it was again Sinestro, who put the blame on Guy). Though he tries to convince Hal he is being manipulated, Hal rips off Guy's broken arm and sends him falling to his death.\n**In the prequel comic of the sequel ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Guy appears as a manifestation of Hal's guilt in his head.\n* In the possible future of ''Futures End'', Guy Gardner became a Blue Lantern, having tried several other Lantern Corps Power Rings to determine which is best to get rid of the Red Lanterns. After defeating and purifying Red King Jack/Rankoor, Guy purifies Bleez, restoring her to normal and destroying all the Red Power Rings, effectively putting an end to the Red Lantern Corps.\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Green Lantern in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n* Guy Gardner has only been portrayed once to date in live-action TV. In 1997, [[Matthew Settle]] played him in a [[Keith Giffen]]-inspired pilot for a proposed TV series ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]''. The personification of the character is very much an amalgam of Earth's various Lanterns. His uniform is based on the \"sleeveless vest\" comics version of Guy Gardner, though he wears a mask and insignia that resemble those of [[Kyle Rayner]]'s first costume. Further, his appearance and personality more accurately mirror those of [[Hal Jordan]].\n* Guy Gardner appears (alongside the Green Lantern Corps) in a non-spoken cameo role in the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' episode, \"The Green Loontern\".\n* Guy Gardner appears in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' in the opening of \"Day of the Dark Knight!\" and was voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8890/tcid/1|title=Collider Confirms Rumors: BATMAN BRAVE AND THE BOLD to Feature Green Lantern Guy Gardener!|date=18 August 2008|publisher=Collider}}</ref> His antics caused a prisoner to go on a path of destructive rage, but [[Batman]], already at Corps headquarters, recaptures the prisoner. He reappears in \"The Eyes of Despero!\" to help Batman overthrow dictator [[Despero]]. He, [[Sinestro]], and [[G'nort]] create Bat-armor for the job when Batman insists on accompanying the Lanterns. When he sees Sinestro attempting to blow up a rogue [[Mogo]]; they do battle, and Guy wins. Guy imprisons Sinestro in his ring at the end of the episode. This episode also pays homage to the iconic scene in the comics, when Batman knocks Gardner out with one punch after an argument. In \"Revenge of the Reach!\", he initially clashes with [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]], believing that he is evil because of the Reach-created suit he wears. After Jaime saves Oa from the attack of other Reach agents, Guy's attitude towards him improves; he even sticks up for him when the Guardians attempt to confiscate his armor. Guy appears in \"Death Race to Oblivion!\" as one of many heroes and villains racing to save the Earth from destruction at the hands of [[Mongul]]. In the teaser for \"The Siege of [[Starro]]! Part One\", Guy is shown fighting off heroes who have fallen under Starro's control, though he is soon put in the same position. In \"Darkseid Descending!\", Guy Gardner joins the Justice League International. He seems to have a crush on team member [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], as seen in Time out of Vengeance when they travel back in time to the pre-historic cave man era.\n* Guy Gardner appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]] in a Maryland accent. Unlike the other Green Lanterns shown, his costume is quite different from the one he wears in the comics. In \"Revelation\", he is shown helping [[Black Canary]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] rescue children from the [[Injustice League]]'s plant creature. In \"Agendas\", the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] mentions that Guy Gardner could be a Justice League member. However, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] and [[Hal Jordan]] (both League members) immediately dismiss the idea. In season 2, it was mentioned that he is a member of the League and is on a mission. In Season 3, he, [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Hawkwoman]] investigate an attack on [[Thanagar]], that eventually leads them onto the tracks of [[Granny Goodness]]'s metahuman trafficking stash, though they fail in releasing the metahuman kids.\n* Guy Gardner appears in ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]. He appears as Hal Jordan's replacement while he was away. When Hal returns to his city, Guy helps him save a runaway crane. When Hal is about to talk to the news lady, Guy pushes him out of the way and takes the credit. Guy later finds out Hal was the Lantern before him and invites him to grab a bite. The two eat hot wings on a roof while Hal contacts the Guardians to ask them about Guy. The Guardians inform Hal that Guy is the new Lantern of Earth. When the Guardians see Guy, they invite him to attend a party with them. Guy accepts forcing Hal to hang up. Hal gets furious and the two engage in battle. Their battle starts at Coast City and ends in the desert. They stop when they come to a temple full of [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]]. Hal and Guy fight them off and end up destroying them. Hal contacts Salaak to ask about the Manhunters. Salaak decides to look into it and when he spots Guy, he asks, \"Is that Guy Gardner?\" But Hal hangs up before he could answer. Then Hal's girlfriend [[Carol Ferris]] calls and breaks up with him. Guy comforts him and relates to his situation. The two shake hands and become friends. Then Guy asks if he can ask Carol out which ends up with Hal punching him in the face. Then the Guardians summon Hal to Oa and Guy asks Hal to put in a good word for him. In \"Ranx\", Guy meets Hal again when he reveals he has been quickly appointed to Honor Guard (his place having been taken by John Stewart) and is led a brigade of Green Lanterns to stop the Manhunters from destroying the planet Ranx, which is containing the still-living head of the Anti-Monitor. In \"Dark Matter\", he also gets on Kilowog's bad side and helps try to defeat the Aya-Monitor once and for all.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Film===\n* In the early script for the ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' live-action film, Gardner was set to make a cameo as a football player who was about to be chosen by the ring, before it went to Hal Jordan.

Englehart recounted: {{quote|When I took over [''Green Lantern''], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] was the GL, but everybody expect Hal Jordan to come back and relegate John to backup duty once again. I decided that John deserved better, so I asked myself, 'Why can't there be two GLs?' And that led to, 'Why can't there be more than two?' That eventually led to the GL Corps, but along the way, I decided to resurrect the lost GL, Guy Gardner, who had been terminally bland and then brain-damaged\u2014a completely useless character, as things stood. I was being a good soldier, trying to help my friend [[Dick Giordano]] sell the book, and it turned out to be the second biggest mistake of my entire career because ever since, DC has claimed that since Joe and I didn't create the original Guy Gardner, our completely new take counts for nothing. If I had called the new guy Joe Smith we would have earned major royalties, but as it is, we get nothing, and we get dissed by the people we helped. So adding it all up, I wish I hadn't done it.<ref name=\"back91\">{{cite journal|last=Kingman|first=Jim |title=All About Guy (Gardner) |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91|pages=2\u201311 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>}}\n\nStaton's design for Guy Gardner was based on the character Major Ronald Merrick from the TV series ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'', as Staton saw Merrick's entitlement and resentment as a parallel to Guy Gardner.<ref name=\"back91\"/> Gardner's later blue costume, introduced in the first issue of the character's first ongoing series (cover dated October 1992), was also designed by Staton.<ref name=\"back91\"/> During this series, retitled ''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' with issue #17, Guy Gardner is gradually evolved into a more vulnerable and heroic character; [[Beau Smith]], who wrote the series for most of its run, was concerned that leaving him as an angry jerk would make the character stagnant and one-note.<ref name=\"back91\"/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\nGuy was raised in [[Baltimore]] by his parents, Roland and Peggy Gardner. His father, Roland, was an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who beat Guy every day. Some of Guy's injuries were visible such as bruises, cuts and bumps but others were invisible and were emotionally inflicted. Guy worked hard in school to try to win his father's approval, but Roland instead lavished attention and compliments upon Guy's older brother, Mace. Guy's only escape at this time was ''[[General Glory]]'' comic books, going so far as to model his bowl haircut on Glory's sidekick, Ernie.<ref>''Guy Gardner'' #11 (August 1993)</ref>\n\nDuring his mid-teens, Guy became a [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquent]]. He constantly defied authority. Later, he was straightened out by his older brother, Mace, now a police officer, and he eventually went to college, supporting himself, and earning bachelor's degrees in education and psychology from the [[University of Michigan]], where he also [[Michigan Wolverines football|played football]] until a career-ending injury. The injury deeply affected Guy.\n\nAfter college, Guy worked as a [[social welfare provision|social welfare]] caseworker, dealing with prison inmates and their rehabilitation. He abandoned this line of work, however, fearing it brought out his aggressive nature. Moving on, he became a teacher for children with disabilities. This job brought out the loving and caring side of himself.<ref>''Guy Gardner'' #14 (November 1993)</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Guy is now an ex-police officer and middle child of a family with a long tradition of membership in the [[Baltimore Police Department]] going back to 1860. He is the second human to earn a Green Lantern ring, after coming to the rescue of his older brother Gerard who had become pinned down during a police shootout with a street gang.<ref name=\"glc0\"/>\n\nIn this version Guy has a strained relationship with his father Ebenezer Gardner, a decorated cop forced into disability after taking a bullet in the line of duty, for issues related to the unexplained incident which kicked Guy off the police force.<ref name=\"glc0\">''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #0 (September 2012)</ref> This was retconned in [[DC Rebirth]] which returned to his original origin of Guy being abused by his alcoholic father as a kid, which was seen during Guys fight with the Sinestro Corps member [[Arkillo]] in the present,<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #16</ref> and later his father being reintroduced under his original name Roland Gardner.<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #46</ref>\n\n===Green Lantern Corps===\n[[Image:Green Lantern 59 Mar 1968.jpg|thumb|Guy Gardner's first appearance in ''Green Lantern'' #59 (March, 1968).]]\n\nThe appointed Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814, an alien named [[Abin Sur]] from the planet Ungara, crash-landed on Earth after being mortally wounded. As Sur died, his [[power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] sought and found two potential successors: Guy Gardner and [[Hal Jordan]]. Jordan was nearer to the crash, so he was chosen over Gardner.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #59 (March 1968)</ref> In the same story, the Guardian supercomputers predicted Guy would have perished early in his career if he had been chosen first. In the later ''[[Booster Gold]]'' series it was shown that a time traveling Booster convinced Gardner to visit his dying father, thus ensuring that Jordan would be the candidate in closest proximity. Gardner was relegated to backup status should anything happen to Jordan.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #2 (November 2007)</ref>\n\nWhen Jordan became aware of Gardner's status as his backup, he went out of his way to set up a chance meeting, and the two became friends. Though Gardner was originally naive to Jordan's secret identity, he eventually assisted Jordan during his adventures.{{issue|date=September 2012}} He is later partnered with Jordan after completing his training under [[Kilowog]].<ref name=\"glc0\"/>\n\nDuring an [[earthquake]], Gardner was hit by a bus while attempting to rescue one of his students. During his recovery, the [[Guardians of the Universe|Guardians]] recruited [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] to be Jordan's new \"backup\".<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #87 (December 1971)</ref>\n\nSome time later, during a period where Gardner was performing his duties as a backup Green Lantern, Hal Jordan's power battery, the source of the ring's energy, exploded in Gardner's face due to damage done to it by the Crumbler and trapped him in the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #116 (May 1979)</ref> Jordan and Kari Limbo, Gardner's girlfriend at the time, both believed him to be dead, and the two developed a romantic relationship that ultimately culminated in a marriage proposal.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #121 (October 1979)</ref> Gardner was able to interrupt the wedding by contacting Limbo [[Telepathy|telepathically]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #122 (November 1979)</ref> By then, however, Gardner's bus accident, the power battery explosion, his assimilation into the zone, and the subsequent torture at the hands of [[General Zod]] and other residents of the Phantom Zone had affected his mind. When Gardner was released from the Phantom Zone, he was diagnosed with [[brain damage]] and was [[coma]]tose for a number of years.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #123 (December 1979)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the [[Guardians of the Universe]] split into two factions over how to confront the Crisis. A minority faction of six Guardians emulated their former brethren, the [[Controllers (DC Comics)|Controllers]], by recruiting a Green Lantern to directly attack and destroy the forces of the [[antimatter]] [[universe]]. For reasons unknown, Gardner was revived by the renegade Guardians, given a power ring not tied to the Central Power Battery on [[Oa]] and sporting a uniform similar to that worn by the Fists of the Guardians, and given a mission. He was to recruit and command the deadliest and most powerful criminals in the universe, including the [[Shark (comics)|Shark]], [[Hector Hammond]] (left behind after trying to attack Gardner), [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]], Throttle, Blindside, and [[Goldface]], to launch a strike against the home base of the [[Anti-Monitor]].<ref>Green Lantern 197 (February 1986)</ref>\n\nGardner's brain damage manifested itself in the form of an arrogant, violent, unstable, and often childish new personality.<ref name=\"back91\"/> Gardner believed himself to be the last \"true\" Green Lantern, superior to all the others, particularly Jordan. Five of the renegade Guardians were slain by a wave of antimatter, and the sixth eventually reconciled with the rest of the Guardians. In the meantime, Gardner succeeded in his task of recruiting powerful villains. Both Hal Jordan and John Stewart prevented Gardner from completing his mission, which would have ultimately destroyed the universe.\n\nFollowing the Crisis, the Guardians, along with the [[Zamarons]], left the universe to create the next generation of Guardians. Gardner was placed under the care of the remaining Guardian-turned-mortal [[Appa Ali Apsa]] (who later went on to become the \"Mad Guardian\") on the planet Maltus in order to teach Gardner the ways of the Corps, a situation which Gardner resented. Gardner eventually escaped and returned to Earth, but was recaptured by Appa Ali Apsa (with the assistance of two Corps honor guards) intending to reclaim Gardner's power ring. At the request of Kari Limbo, Hal Jordan pleaded on Gardner's behalf for his freedom, which was granted with no return of gratitude from Gardner.\n\nAs a consequence of the Corps executing Sinestro the majority of the Corps lost their power rings; Gardner was one of the few remaining active Green Lanterns. After the defeat and death of the \"Mad Guardian\" the Guardians returned and assigned Gardner to be the official Green Lantern of Sector 2814 while Jordan was assigned to recruit new Corps members.\n\n===Justice League International===\nSoon after obtaining his freedom from Maltus, Gardner became a founding member of the [[Justice League International]] after the original [[Justice League|JLA]] disbanded during the 1986-87 storyline \"[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]\". In his time with the JLI, Gardner resented [[Batman]]'s leadership of the group, going so far as to challenge the Dark Knight to a fist fight; Batman downed Guy with one punch after Guy took off his ring. The other members left him lying on the floor. When Guy woke up, he banged his head on a console and knocked himself out. When he comes to, his personality has changed to kind and gentle.<ref>''Justice League'' #5 (September 1987). DC Comics.</ref> Until he hit his head again at a later point, Guy was kind, sweet, boyishly innocent, and a perfect gentleman to the female members of the group. Guy's run in JLI was full of constant personality shifts and endless arguing between team members. This led to a fight with [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]],<ref>''Justice League International'' #18</ref><ref>''Justice League International'' #19 (October 1988)</ref> the sucker-punching of [[Blue Beetle]] during a boxing match,<ref>''Justice League America'' #52 (July 1991). DC Comics.</ref> and finally him quitting the team after being \"belittled\" by [[Superman]].<ref>''Justice League America'' #63 (June 1992). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nGardner was romantically involved with his fellow Leaguer [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], even learning some rudimentary Norwegian, but he is often callous to her and slow to admit his feelings.<ref name=\"back91\"/> Their relationship ended with her death at the hands of the [[Overmaster]].\n\n===Guy Gardner: Reborn===\n[[Image:Guy gardner 1.jpg|thumb|Guy Gardner with his yellow power ring]]\nAfter completing his assignment of recruiting new Corps members, Jordan returned to Earth to reclaim his title as Green Lantern of Sector 2814. Gardner's response was to challenge Jordan to a fight where the loser would quit the Corps. Gardner lost and surrendered his ring. After some failed run-ins with Goldface and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] as a non-powered vigilante, he set out on a quest to regain his power and identity. Tricking [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] into assisting him, he invaded [[Qward]] to find the yellow power ring of [[Sinestro]], but was told by the Qwardians that the ring was unique and never returned to Qward. He then travelled to Oa where he found it on Sinestro's hand in Oa's \"Crypt of the Green Lantern Corps\".<ref>''Guy Gardner Reborn'' #1</ref><ref>''Guy Gardner Reborn #3 (1992)</ref>\n\nGardner's own comic series began with him using the yellow ring and a modified costume similar to his Green Lantern costume but from street clothes. The yellow ring did not use a battery to recharge, instead needing to be used against the power rings of [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lanterns]] so it could absorb their residual energy to restore its power, which Gardner discovered by accident when [[Kilowog]] fought him while his ring was powerless.\n\nGuy Gardner returned to Earth to pick a fight with Superman but eventually rejoined the Justice League and helped battle the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], in which he and his teammates were brutally beaten and Superman was killed during the creature's defeat. During the [[Reign of the Supermen]] storyline when four different versions of Superman appeared after his death, Guy fought, became allies with and later endorsed the Last Son of Krypton Superman, who was actually the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. Later, Guy cleared his name of murder that was committed by his Draalian clone \"Joe Gardner\" and learned that his brother Mace had become the assassin Militia; after a brawl between the two, Guy decided to take the codename Warrior.\n\nIn the ''[[Justice League#JLA: Classified|JLA: Classified]]''-based miniseries ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League]]'', Guy assisted the [[Super Buddies]] and was revealed to have kept his yellow ring.\n\n===''Guy Gardner: Warrior''===\nBy this time, the power of Guy's ring had begun to fluctuate due to the meddling of the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] (Hal Jordan). Deprived of his powers, Guy wore a golden [[exosuit]] provided by [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]] which simulated superhuman strength. Guy was not happy with this initial suit as it did not feel as natural as using a ring power. The exosuit first appeared in issue 18, the second issue to feature the new title of ''Guy Gardner; Warrior''.  Although the exosuit was destroyed during combat with Militia in issue 19, Guy's power ring provided him with a new exosuit constructed of ring energy. This was much more to Guy's liking.\n\nWhen a grief-stricken and power-hungry Hal Jordan destroyed the Green Lantern Corps after the destruction of his hometown, [[Ganthet]] first came to Guy Gardner to offer him the last [[Green Lantern]] power ring. When Gardner refused, Ganthet decided to entrust it to [[Kyle Rayner]].<ref>''Green Lantern Secret Files & Origins'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter Guy started having visions of Oa's destruction and his power started to mysteriously increase, he led a group of heroes to Oa to find out what happened to the Corps. Guy and his team were ambushed and quickly defeated by Parallax. Guy managed to trick Hal into thinking that he was dead by simulating a ring powered construct of himself that had been impaled by an energy pike. Guy used the element of surprise and managed to evenly match Hal in a fight for a few minutes due to the fact that his ring siphoned residual Green Lantern plasma-energy. Eventually Hal gained the upper hand, defeated Gardner and destroyed his ring, depriving him of his ring-powered exosuit. Parallax then punched out one of Gardner's eyes and sent him and his team back to Earth. Guy awoke in the hospital after spending three weeks in a coma.

This activated alien DNA that had been implanted in his bloodline a millennium ago by a space-traveling race called the [[Vuldarian]]s. He discovered new, shapeshifting abilities that writer [[Beau Smith]] claims were editorially mandated to capitalize on the success of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'',<ref>Smith, Beau.

[[Comics Bulletin]]. accessed September 15, 2011.</ref> and which would allow him to resume his role as a superhero. When Guy first emerged, his body had assumed the shape of his old exosuit, albeit red instead of gold, and his lost eye had been restored. Guy's body remained that way until the end of the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' storyline, [[morphing]] weapons directly out of his arms as of ''Zero Hour'' issue #2.\n\nGardner opened a superhero theme bar called Warriors, as both a source of income and a base between his adventures.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> He would be joined by Buck's group, Veronna, mightiest of the Nabba Jungle tribe of women, who guarded the Warrior Water and believed herself to be destined as Guy's mate (sharing limited telepathy with him), and those who were brought on as bouncers for Warriors but acted as fellow adventurers: [[Lady Blackhawk]] (displaced in time by [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]), [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], [[Metal Men|Lead]], and [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]].\n\nHis early days as Warrior saw him struggling with his newfound powers. He had difficulty changing his body into any weapon, and his transformations often caused him pain. After a breakdown that led to a confrontation with Superman and [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]], with some soul-searching help from his supposed ancestor Cardone, Gardner was finally able to use his new powers to form most non-energy-based weapons from his body, as well as absorb some forms of energy and redirect them through his various \"weapons\". Another ability, his capability to use the knowledge of warriors from across space and time, was rarely used and mostly forgotten. Guy had many enemies during the series including [[Evil Star]], [[Gorilla Grodd]], Black Serpent, Sledge, [[Major Force]], Martika the Seductress, Bronkk and the Tormocks (ancient nemeses to the Vuldarians), Mudakka, and Dementor as well as the return of his clone (now going by the name [[Enforcer (DC Comics)|Enforcer]]), the Quorum, and his brother Militia with girlfriend Honey. He teamed with many heroes including [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]], with whom he became close friends after discovering Steel attended the University of Michigan and played on the same football team.<ref>''Showcase '96'' #1 (January 1996)</ref> Gardner also became good friends with Lobo after the defeat of the Tormocks (so far as the bounty hunter giving Gardner one of his space bikes and the skull of Bronkk).<ref name=\"GuyGardner\">''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #39 (February 1996)</ref>\n\nDuring the time that Gardner fought against Dementor, he learned that his enemy was also a product of Vuldarian breeding. Dementor's father had raped a Vuldarian woman. Dementor was sent to Hell, where he revealed that he was the one responsible for Gardner's constant personality shifts (in a sense, explaining why his personality changed drastically over the years). In the last issues Gardner finally dealt with his \"family\", as well as revealing another side of his Vuldarian powers, the ability to heal mortal wounds.\n\nOver the course of the series, Gardner made peace with a great deal of his past. On one Christmas, the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], on behalf of the [[Phantom Stranger]], made it possible for Guy to communicate with his deceased father, who apologized for the abuse, both physical and mental, he placed upon Guy, his brother Mace, and their mother. He told Guy how proud he was of all the accomplishments Guy achieved as a man and the pair reconciled. Afterward, Guy would give his condolences to Ice's mother over their shared loss of her daughter and she provided him an ice sculpture to remind him of her daughter. A celebration held at Warriors for the holiday saw Guy cross paths with an inebriated [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] and the pair shared a kiss after expressing how much they missed Ice.<ref name=\"GuyGardner\" /> It was suggested they slept together after this in the following issue.\n\nAfter the ''Warrior'' series was canceled, Gardner continued to appear in the DC Universe; most notably as a recurring character in the ''Green Lantern'' series during Kyle Rayner's run and a reserve member of the JLA. It was thought he was killed during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' crossover.<ref>''JLA: Our Worlds at War'' #1 (September 2001)</ref> He was later discovered to be trapped in a pocket of [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] called the Gorge in [[General Zod]]'s country of [[Pokolistan]]. After freeing himself by switching places with Superman villain [[Kancer]] as ruler of the Gorge, his Warrior powers were apparently enhanced. He declared it his job to do less ethical things that heroes like [[Superman]] could not.<ref>''Action Comics'' #789</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' #790 (May 2002)</ref> However, this new direction only lasted for 30 issues of ''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' (which crossed over in the Way of the Warrior with ''[[Justice League America]]'' and ''[[Hawkman]]'' featuring cameos of Lobo and former Green Lantern Probert) and his many several appearances over a span of ten years.\n\n===Return to the Corps===\nDuring the 2005 [[miniseries]] ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'', Gardner's Vuldarian [[DNA]] is strangely overwritten by his human DNA when [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] possesses Gardner and several Green Lanterns. Hal Jordan's ring splits in two and Gardner's ring is restored to him. Eventually, Parallax is defeated by the combined effort of all five active Green Lanterns, including Gardner. The Guardians then select Gardner as one of the senior officers of the new Green Lantern Corps.\n\nIn the 2005\u20132006 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' (written by [[Dave Gibbons]]), the Guardians assign Gardner to be one of the Corps' three main instructors, along with [[Kilowog]] and Kyle Rayner. The trio is responsible for the training of the new Corps, to which the Guardians intend to name 7,200 members. Gardner is not at all appreciative of his new role, and when he complains to the Guardians, they tell him that success in training new recruits could lead to him being given a new position.\n\nGardner plays a significant role in defeating the Spider Guild attack on Oa. Discovering that trainee [[Soranik Natu]] has disappeared into the forbidden [[Vega]] star system, which the Guardians' pact with the [[Psion (comics)|Psions of Vega]] forbids Green Lanterns from entering, Gardner and Kyle Rayner led a rescue mission in direct violation of Oan policy. Once there, the Lanterns discover the Spider Guild nest and determine that its next target is the Oan sun. Returning just as the attack commences, Gardner gathers the frightened trainee Green Lanterns and rallies them with a speech that impresses even his longtime rival, Hal Jordan. Gardner's performance in repelling the attack results in his promotion to Lantern #1 of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, a position of authority over other Lanterns. In this new role, Gardner is expected to \"think outside the box\" and \"do the jobs other Lanterns cannot,\" a function well-suited to his irascible personality.\n\n===\"Infinite Crisis\" and \"One Year Later\"===\nIn his new role as Lantern #1, Guy leads the Corps in the defense of Oa against [[Superboy-Prime]], creating a wall of energy to slow the rampaging teen and calling a \"Code 54\", authorizing the use of extreme force. Guy supervises the final capture and imprisonment of Superboy-Prime, locking him in a red [[Sun-Eater]] provided by [[Donna Troy]] and organizing a constant watch of fifty Lanterns to keep him imprisoned.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7 (June 2006)</ref>\n\nGuy spends the entire \"missing year\" following ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' doing missions for the Guardians without shore leave (though he is infrequently seen on Earth in the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' weekly limited series, it should be assumed he has sneaked away from the Guardians' watch). When he is finally granted some time off one year later, his relaxation is cut short by an attack by a grudge-holding Bolphunga the Relentless.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #5 (October 2006)</ref> Soon after, Guy assisted [[Hal Jordan]] on an unsanctioned mission to the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] homeworld, Biot. Through Hal and Guy's efforts, several long-lost and believed deceased lanterns (including Arisia, [[List of Green Lanterns#Chaselon|Chaselon]], [[Jack T. Chance]], [[Graf Toren]], [[List of Green Lanterns#Hannu/Honnu|Hannu]], [[Ke'Haan]], [[Laira (comics)|Laira]], and [[Boodikka]]) were freed from imprisonment by the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #11 (May 2006)</ref><ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #12 (July 2006)</ref> Upon returning from the mission, Guy was punished by the Guardians and forced to endure one month as one of the fifty Lanterns on \"Prime Duty\". Lanterns of the Honor Guard, like Guy, are allowed to break the rules three times before expulsion.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #13 (September 2006)</ref>\n\nAccording to ''Green Lantern'' writer [[Geoff Johns]] in a 2006 [[Newsarama]] interview, Prime would not be escaping under Guy's watch. \"Not at all. That\u2019s ridiculous. Anyone who\u2019s read Guy Gardner for the last two years in ''Green Lantern'' or in ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'' knows that he\u2019s a much better, stronger character than that. And even in the old Giffen stuff, he would probably break some rules, taunt the other heroes, and drink a beer or two, but he would not be that much of an idiot. He was never that much of an idiot, and certainly not with what I'm doing with him, or with what Dave Gibbons is doing with him in ''Corps''. He has his moments, and he\u2019s a really fun character, but he's definitely not going to be a moron. His role is not DCU Moron.

Dubbed \"[[Green Lantern Corps#The Corpse|The Corpse]]\", members forsake their rings for stealthier powers provided by the Guardians. Guy took part in one mission as part of this secretive unit. He was tasked with locating Von Daggle, a Durlan who was formerly in charge of the Corpse. Gardner relayed a message from the Guardians, informing Daggle that he was reinstated. From there, Daggle took command of Gardner, leading him to the homeworld of the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]], a race of superscientists with a grudge against Earth. Together, they defeated a super-evolved Dominator, though the Corpse's use of lethal force did not sit well with Guy. Gardner informed Daggle that he couldn't be a part of his crew and Daggle wiped his memory, musing that \"humans never make the cut\".\n\n===\"Sinestro Corps War\"===\nIn the \"[[Sinestro Corps War]]\" storyline, Superboy-Prime and Cyborg Superman escape imprisonment when the [[Sinestro Corps]] attacks Oa, killing the guards on Prime Duty. Guy, along with fellow Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], are captured by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] during battle and brought to Qward.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #21 (July 2007)</ref> Guy and Stewart are then held prisoner by [[Lyssa Drak]], who forces them to relive tragedies in their lives.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #22 (August 2007)</ref> Hal manages to defeat Lyssa and free Guy and John from their nightmare.

Despite Ice's uncertainty as to the wisdom of reviving the old romance, Guy's professions of adoration seemed sufficient to convince her to meet him for a proper date on the same spot exactly one month later.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #19 (December 2007)</ref> Before leaving Earth to open a bar/restaurant on Oa, Guy leaves Ice a note.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #20 (January 2008)</ref> Ice declines his proposal to cohabit on Oa, and Guy reads her desire to rebuild a new life on Earth with her best friend [[Fire (comics)|Beatriz]] as an attempt to distance from him, accusing Beatriz of pitting Ice against him.

However, the Guardians were really planning to undermine all four Earth Lanterns by sabotaging Guy's career after building it up, ensuring a precipitous fall.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 5 #12 (August 2012)</ref>\n\nThis plan begins when the Guardians promote Guy to the role of 'Sentinel Lantern' and entrust him with guarding a group of ambassadors travelling to a planet for a crucial conference. They subsequently release Guy's old enemy Xar from the Science cells and create the impression that he is going after Guy's family on Earth. They predicted that Guy would abandon his duty and return to Earth while Xar attacks the ambassadors.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #13 (September 2012)</ref> With the rest of his team having been absorbed by the Third Army, Guy escapes only through his strength of will, averting the Third Army's attempt to 'recruit' him. With Xar having killed the ambassadors, the Guardians order Guy to resign from the Corps in order to redeem the damage he has done.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #14 (November 2012)</ref>\n\nFeeling depressed after a phone conversation with his family, during which his father dismisses superheroes as overly reliant on their powers, Guy attempts to spend the night fighting crime with only his natural skills. This backfires when he interrupts a police sting operation, culminating in him being arrested by his sister.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #15 (December 2012)</ref> While in prison, he is attacked by the Third Army, but is rescued by Green Lanterns [[Simon Baz]] and B'dg, who send the civilians to safety before crushing the Third Army and retreating to the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on the moon.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #16 (January 2013)</ref> Guy is angered when he discovers that the Guardians have turned against him and the Corps. Simon and B'dg dispatch him to the planet Oa. There, Guy reclaims his ring and joins Kilowog and the others reserve Corps members in their rebellion against the treacherous Guardians.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps Annual'' #1 (January 2013)</ref>\n\nAfter the villainous First Lantern is destroyed and the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, Guy and Kilowog locate where Salaak was imprisoned by the Guardians and free him. Guy is angered when he discovers Salaak's surveillance footage of Xar being released by the Guardians. Salaak helps him locate Xar\u2019s whereabouts, and discovers that Xar is located on Earth and preparing to kill off Guy's family. Guy manages to speed up with [[Saint Walker]]'s willing assistance to arrive in time to blast Xar to be incinerated, and reunites with his family.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 3 #20 (May 2013)</ref>\n\nFollowing the event, Guy was placed in the cast of the ''Red Lanterns'' series where he was sent by Hal Jordan to join the Red Lanterns undercover. He defeats Atrocitus and takes command of the group. It is revealed that part of his decision to join with the Red Lanterns is feeling as if he has never fit in as a Green Lantern.<ref>''Red Lanterns'' #21 (June 2013)</ref> As a Red Lantern Gardner manages to keep his rage in check, successfully leading most of the Red Lanterns; Atrocitus leads a splinter group and allows new Red rings to cause murderous justice-based rampages to continue. After joining with the Green Lanterns to defeat the cosmic terrorist Relic, Hal promises to give the Red Lanterns a sector for them to watch over, unwittingly this sector becomes Sector 2814, where Earth resides, giving guardianship of Earth to the Red Lantern Corps.<ref>''Red Lanterns'' #28</ref>\n\nGuy also tries to reunite with Ice but she has undergone several personal revelations of her own and needs time apart; Guy promises to give her just that.<ref>''Red Lanterns'' #28 (March, 2014)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n\n===Power rings===\n{{Main|Power ring (DC Comics)}}\nGuy Gardner was trained to use a Green Lantern [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]], which is only limited by the user's will power. He later acquired Sinestro's [[power ring (DC Comics)#Yellow|Qwardian power ring]], which was later revealed to be based on the bearer's control of fear. This early version of a yellow power ring was powered by absorbing plasma radiation that had been expelled from a Green Lantern ring and seemed to make Guy more invulnerable than a normal Green Lantern power-ring. He used both for basic Lantern abilities including constructs, flight, and energy projection, though it also caused him some difficulty on occasion. For example, if he asked it a question he would get an answer in Qwardian, which he didn't speak. In ''Green Lantern: Rebirth'' #6 it is mentioned that Guy Gardner's ring is constantly sparking with energy, as if unable to contain the power of his will. Following Kyle Rayner's apparent death, Guy's rage caused a red power ring to latch onto him, bestowing on him the ability to generate napalm like flames that would burn even in space. Unlike most Red Lanterns, Guy retained his intelligence, and, like Hal Jordan when he was under the thrall of a red ring, Guy was able to shape the red flames into solid constructs. Unlike Hal, Guy's green ring remained active, allowing him to combine the two lights and obliterate the Black Lanterns and their rings. Guy was also the first male character seen to wield a love-powered Star Sapphire ring, wearing it in conjunction with the Red Lantern ring (he stated that the result felt like he had blood and sugar in his mouth). During the events of the ''Green Lanterns: The Lost Army'', Guy created a new uniform using both his green and red rings. Later during the final battle, the Power Converters used by Lightsmiths, converted Guy's Red Lantern Ring to a Green Lantern ring, thus ending his connection to the Red Lantern Corps.<ref>''Green Lantern: The Lost Army'' #6</ref>\n\n===Vuldarian powers===\nGuy's Vuldarian powers included limited [[shapeshifting]] abilities in which he could create weapons out of his body. At first, these transformations caused him pain and he was unable to shrink from his 7-foot height. He maintained super strength, stamina, and durability around Superman's strata, the power of flight, capable of surviving in outer space unassisted, accelerated healing, and had access to the memories of deceased Vuldarians (touted as the most dangerous warriors in the history of the universe).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/busted/107815836153701.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810202316/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/busted/107815836153701.htm |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}</ref> Trained by the Vuldarian Cardone, Gardner became highly trained in using his abilities and practiced extensively in the martial arts. During the [[Green Lantern: Rebirth|return of Parallax]], he suffered a [[metahuman]] power discharge and his Vuldarian abilities went into recession. Coincidentally, when he awoke he was near Hal Jordan's power ring, which has the ability to duplicate itself. Gardner once more had a power ring, and following the return of the Guardians of the Universe, he was once again a Green Lantern.\n\n===Green Lantern (Tangent Comics)===\n{{Main|Tangent Comics}}\nGuy became the caretaker of a mystical artifact that survived the events of the 2005 \"[[Infinite Crisis]]\" storyline, after it was discovered on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]] by Kyle Rayner.

He goes to Earth with Ganthet, however, when he learns Kyle Rayner had disappeared (he had actually been killed by Sinestro). The two meet with Superman to confront him about his activities to force peace, but the Man of Steel refuses to listen. As Hal Jordan leaves with Ganthet for Oa, Guy remains behind to watch over Earth. He eventually leaves when he discovers Superman has allied himself with the Sinestro Corps, spending the next seven months building an army of Green Lanterns to combat Superman. He returns to try and reason with Superman one final time, but the war begins. Guy goes to Earth to confront Hal about his choosing Superman over the Corps, and saves Carol Ferris. Near the end of Year Two, Guy is confronted by a now Yellow Lantern Hal, who falsely believes that Guy killed John Stewart (when it was again Sinestro, who put the blame on Guy). Though he tries to convince Hal he is being manipulated, Hal rips off Guy's broken arm and sends him falling to his death.\n**In the prequel comic of the sequel ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Guy appears as a manifestation of Hal's guilt in his head.\n* In the possible future of ''Futures End'', Guy Gardner became a Blue Lantern, having tried several other Lantern Corps Power Rings to determine which is best to get rid of the Red Lanterns. After defeating and purifying Red King Jack/Rankoor, Guy purifies Bleez, restoring her to normal and destroying all the Red Power Rings, effectively putting an end to the Red Lantern Corps.\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Green Lantern in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n* Guy Gardner has only been portrayed once to date in live-action TV. In 1997, [[Matthew Settle]] played him in a [[Keith Giffen]]-inspired pilot for a proposed TV series ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]''. The personification of the character is very much an amalgam of Earth's various Lanterns. His uniform is based on the \"sleeveless vest\" comics version of Guy Gardner, though he wears a mask and insignia that resemble those of [[Kyle Rayner]]'s first costume. Further, his appearance and personality more accurately mirror those of [[Hal Jordan]].\n* Guy Gardner appears (alongside the Green Lantern Corps) in a non-spoken cameo role in the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' episode, \"The Green Loontern\".\n* Guy Gardner appears in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' in the opening of \"Day of the Dark Knight!\" and was voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8890/tcid/1|title=Collider Confirms Rumors: BATMAN BRAVE AND THE BOLD to Feature Green Lantern Guy Gardener!|date=18 August 2008|publisher=Collider}}</ref> His antics caused a prisoner to go on a path of destructive rage, but [[Batman]], already at Corps headquarters, recaptures the prisoner. He reappears in \"The Eyes of Despero!\" to help Batman overthrow dictator [[Despero]]. He, [[Sinestro]], and [[G'nort]] create Bat-armor for the job when Batman insists on accompanying the Lanterns. When he sees Sinestro attempting to blow up a rogue [[Mogo]]; they do battle, and Guy wins. Guy imprisons Sinestro in his ring at the end of the episode. This episode also pays homage to the iconic scene in the comics, when Batman knocks Gardner out with one punch after an argument. In \"Revenge of the Reach!\", he initially clashes with [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]], believing that he is evil because of the Reach-created suit he wears. After Jaime saves Oa from the attack of other Reach agents, Guy's attitude towards him improves; he even sticks up for him when the Guardians attempt to confiscate his armor. Guy appears in \"Death Race to Oblivion!\" as one of many heroes and villains racing to save the Earth from destruction at the hands of [[Mongul]]. In the teaser for \"The Siege of [[Starro]]! Part One\", Guy is shown fighting off heroes who have fallen under Starro's control, though he is soon put in the same position. In \"Darkseid Descending!\", Guy Gardner joins the Justice League International. He seems to have a crush on team member [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], as seen in Time out of Vengeance when they travel back in time to the pre-historic cave man era.\n* Guy Gardner appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]] in a Maryland accent. Unlike the other Green Lanterns shown, his costume is quite different from the one he wears in the comics. In \"Revelation\", he is shown helping [[Black Canary]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] rescue children from the [[Injustice League]]'s plant creature. In \"Agendas\", the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] mentions that Guy Gardner could be a Justice League member. However, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] and [[Hal Jordan]] (both League members) immediately dismiss the idea. In season 2, it was mentioned that he is a member of the League and is on a mission. In Season 3, he, [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Hawkwoman]] investigate an attack on [[Thanagar]], that eventually leads them onto the tracks of [[Granny Goodness]]'s metahuman trafficking stash, though they fail in releasing the metahuman kids.\n* Guy Gardner appears in ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]. He appears as Hal Jordan's replacement while he was away. When Hal returns to his city, Guy helps him save a runaway crane. When Hal is about to talk to the news lady, Guy pushes him out of the way and takes the credit. Guy later finds out Hal was the Lantern before him and invites him to grab a bite. The two eat hot wings on a roof while Hal contacts the Guardians to ask them about Guy. The Guardians inform Hal that Guy is the new Lantern of Earth. When the Guardians see Guy, they invite him to attend a party with them. Guy accepts forcing Hal to hang up. Hal gets furious and the two engage in battle. Their battle starts at Coast City and ends in the desert. They stop when they come to a temple full of [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]]. Hal and Guy fight them off and end up destroying them. Hal contacts Salaak to ask about the Manhunters. Salaak decides to look into it and when he spots Guy, he asks, \"Is that Guy Gardner?\" But Hal hangs up before he could answer. Then Hal's girlfriend [[Carol Ferris]] calls and breaks up with him. Guy comforts him and relates to his situation. The two shake hands and become friends. Then Guy asks if he can ask Carol out which ends up with Hal punching him in the face. Then the Guardians summon Hal to Oa and Guy asks Hal to put in a good word for him. In \"Ranx\", Guy meets Hal again when he reveals he has been quickly appointed to Honor Guard (his place having been taken by John Stewart) and is led a brigade of Green Lanterns to stop the Manhunters from destroying the planet Ranx, which is containing the still-living head of the Anti-Monitor. In \"Dark Matter\", he also gets on Kilowog's bad side and helps try to defeat the Aya-Monitor once and for all.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Film===\n* In the early script for the ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' live-action film, Gardner was set to make a cameo as a football player who was about to be chosen by the ring, before it went to Hal Jordan.

The character made her debut as \"the Cat\" in ''Batman'' #1 (Spring 1940), and her real name is '''Selina Kyle'''. She is Batman's most enduring love interest and is known for her complex love-hate relationship with him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 1: Batman |date=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co |isbn=0-02-538700-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei/page/104/mode/2up |accessdate=29 March 2020 |pages=105-110}}</ref>\n\nCatwoman is a [[Gotham City]] burglar who typically wears a tight, one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. She was originally characterized as a supervillain and adversary of Batman, but she has been featured in a series since the 1990s which portrays her as an [[antiheroine]], often doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The character thrived since her earliest appearances, but she took an extended hiatus from September 1954 to November 1966 due to the developing [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954. These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code, a code which is no longer in use. In the comics, [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and Eiko Hasigawa have both adopted the Catwoman identity, apart from Selina Kyle.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | authorlink=Scott Beatty | contribution=Catwoman | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=74\u201375 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York City|New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref><ref name=RainbowHubAnnual2/>\n\nCatwoman has been featured in many media adaptations related to Batman.

[[Halle Berry]] starred in 2004's ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]''; this, however, was a critical and commercial flop and bears little similarity to the Batman character.

A young version of Kyle was played by [[Camren Bicondova]] on the 2014 television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' although [[Lili Simmons]] portrayed an older Kyle in the series finale.

Although she does not wear her [[icon]]ic cat-suit, the story establishes her core personality as a femme fatale who both antagonizes and attracts Batman. It is implied Batman may have deliberately let her get away by blocking [[Robin (character)|Robin]] as he tried to leap after her. She next appears in ''Batman'' #2 in a story also involving the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] but escapes Batman in the end. In ''Batman'' #3 she wears a fur mask and again succeeds in escaping Batman.\n\n''Batman'' #62 (December 1950) reveals that Catwoman was an [[amnesiac]] [[flight attendant]] who turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived. She reveals this in the [[Batcave]] after being hit on the head by a piece of rubble while saving Batman while he was chasing her. However, in issue #197 of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'', she later admits that she made up the amnesia story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime. She reforms for several years, helping out Batman in ''Batman'' #65 (June 1951) and #69 (February 1952), until she decides to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #203 (January 1954), after a newspaper publishes stories of Batman's past adventures and some crooks mock her about it. However, Catwoman prevents her thugs from murdering Batman once he is later found knocked out, but quickly claims she wants him as a hostage. Catwoman appears again as a criminal in ''Batman'' #84 (June 1954) and ''Detective Comics'' #211 (September 1954) for her final appearance until 1966. This was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing [[Comics Code Authority]]'s rules for portrayal of female characters that started in 1954.\n\nIn the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters) reveal that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (after the events of ''Batman'' #69) and had married [[Bruce Wayne]]; soon afterward, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]]). ''The Brave and the Bold'' #197 (April 1983) elaborates upon the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman'' #62, after Selina reveals that she never suffered from amnesia. It is revealed that Selina Kyle had been in an bad marriage, and eventually decided to leave her husband. However, her husband kept her jewelry in his private vault, and she had to break into it to retrieve it. Selina enjoyed this experience so much she decided to become a professional costumed cat burglar, and thus began a career that repeatedly leads to her encountering Batman.\n\nThe Earth-Two/Golden Age Selina Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being blackmailed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman, as shown in ''DC Super-Stars'' #17 (December 1977).\n\nCatwoman made her first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] appearance in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #70 (November 1966); afterward, she continued to make appearances across the various ''Batman'' comics.\n\nSeveral stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing murder, something that neither the Earth-One nor Earth-Two versions of her would ever do. This version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-B]], an alternate [[Earth]] that included stories that could not be considered [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] on Earth-One or Earth-Two.<ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Index'' (March 1986)</ref><ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Cross-Over Index'' (July 1986)</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/04/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-171/ | last=Cronin | first=Brian | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #171 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Age===\n{{Long plot|date=May 2015}}\n\n====Tangled origins====\nCatwoman's origin\u2014and, to an extent, her character\u2014was revised in 1987 when writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] published ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman's origin. She worked as a dominatrix for the pimp Stan to survive and also sheltered a child prostitute named [[Holly Robinson (fictional character)|Holly Robinson]] working for him. Selina got into a fight with a disguised Bruce after he grabbed Holly, who had stabbed him during a fight with Stan, but was knocked out.\n\nAs the story progresses, Selina decides to leave prostitution and takes Holly with her. She gets into burglary to make money and starts robbing the rich and powerful men of Gotham, donning a catsuit costume while committing her heists. While trying to rob [[Carmine Falcone]], she gets rescued by Batman but is irked of being thought of as his sidekick by the media.\n\nThe 1989 ''Catwoman'' limited series, written by [[Mindy Newell]] and with art by J.J. Birch, expanded upon Miller's ''Year One'' origin. This storyline, known as \"Her Sister's Keeper\", explores Selina's early life as a dominatrix and the start of her career as Catwoman. The story culminates with Selina's former pimp, Stan, abducting and beating her sister Maggie, who, in contrast to Selina, is a nun. Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and gets away with it. Most of this is revealed in the former series, but is expanded upon in \"Her Sister's Keeper\".\n\n''Catwoman'' vol. 2, #69 provides details about Selina's childhood and neglects Maggie's existence. Maria Kyle is a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats, and commits suicide when Selina is very young. Her alcoholic father, Brian, is cold to Selina for resembling her mother, whom he resents for dying, and eventually drinks himself to death. To survive, Selina takes to the streets for a time before getting caught and sent first to an orphanage, then juvenile detention center,<ref name=\"Catwoman v1 0\">''Catwoman'' (vol. 1) #0</ref> \"where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be\".<ref>''Catwoman: Secret Files and Origins''</ref> Maggie's fate at this point in the time-line is not alluded to. However, when [[Ed Brubaker]] reintroduces her into the comic, he implies that Maggie may have directly entered an orphanage and promptly been adopted.\n\nWhen she is 13 years old, Selina discovers that the detention center's administrator has been embezzling funds, and she confronts her. In an attempt to cover up her crime, the administrator puts Selina in a bag and drops her in a river to drown (like a cat). She escapes and returns to the orphanage, where she steals documents exposing the administrator's corruption. She uses these to blackmail the administrator into erasing \"Selina Kyle\" from the city's records, then steals the administrator's diamond necklace and escapes from the orphanage.<ref name=\"Catwoman v1 0\"/> Selina eventually finds herself in \"Alleytown \u2013 a network of cobblestone streets that form a small borough between the East End and Old [[Gotham City|Gotham]].\"<ref>''Catwoman'' (vol. 2) #12</ref> Selina is taken in by Mama Fortuna, the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and is taught how to steal. Fortuna treats her students like slaves, keeping their earnings for herself. Selina eventually runs away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia. However, the two have difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation try to support themselves by working as prostitutes. The two drift apart afterward, with Sylvia coming to resent Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.\n\nIn the ''Catwoman: Year One'' story,<ref>''Catwoman Annual'' #2 (1995)</ref> Selina, who is now an adult, achieves some success as a thief. Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepts an offer to \"lie low\" as a dominatrix employed by a pimp named Stan. They plan to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes. According to this storyline, Selina trains under the Armless Master of Gotham City, receiving education in martial arts and culture. During this time, a client gives her a cat o' nine tails, which Selina keeps as a trophy.\n\n''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implies that Catwoman suspects she is the illegitimate daughter of Mafia boss [[Carmine Falcone]], although she finds no definitive proof. Selina's connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]''. Though the story adds more circumstantial evidence to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, establishing that the Falcones' second-born daughter was put up for adoption in America, it also supplies no definitive proof. During ''The Long Halloween'', Selina (out of costume) develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne, even leading her to save Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, this relationship appears to end on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. She leaves him for good and also leaves Gotham for a while in ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', after he stands her up on two holidays. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina.\n\nCatwoman also appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' saga, where she is approached by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s henchmen while robbing a house. Bane asks her to work for him, but she refuses, as she is repulsed by the criminal who \"broke\" Batman. Later in the story, she boards a plane with [[Bruce Wayne]] to fly to [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]]. She next appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall#\"Knightquest\"|Batman: Knightquest]]'' saga, where [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] is masquerading as Batman. She is one of the few to recognize that this Batman is an impostor, later being present when the true Batman returns to the fold as he struggles against his successor, his willingness to save even criminals confirming his true identity for Selina.\n\n====''Catwoman'' solo series====\n[[File:Catwoman (Jim Balent and Joe DeVito's art).png|thumb|Catwoman, painted by [[Joe DeVito]] over pencil art by the titular character's series artist [[Jim Balent]]. Balent penciled ''Catwoman'' for several years and defined the visuals of the character for a long period.]]\n\nIn 1993, Catwoman was given her first ongoing comic book series. This series, written by an assortment of writers, but primarily penciled by [[Jim Balent]],<ref>Manning, Matthew K. \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 260: \"Selina Kyle finally stole the spotlight in her first ongoing series by writer Jo Duffy and artist Jim Balent.\"</ref> generally depicted the character as an international thief (and occasional bounty hunter) with an ambiguous moral code.\n\nStory-lines include her adoption of teenage runaway and former sidekick, Arizona; aiding [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], whom she later betrays to [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]; and a stint as a reluctant government operative. The series also delves into her origin, revealing her beginnings as a young thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and her training with [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted \"Wildcat\" Grant]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nMoving to [[New York City]], Selina becomes corporate vice president of Randolf Industries, a mafia-influenced company and then becomes its [[chief executive officer|CEO]] through blackmail. She plans to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City]], but her hopes are dashed when the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] inadvertently connects her to her criminal alter ego.\n\nAfter her time in New York City, Selina returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline. As Catwoman, she assists Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city. After being arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], she escapes from prison. Later that year, during the \"Officer Down\" storyline in the ''Batman'' titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect. Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story, with her series later revealing that she has developed a form of personality disorder after exposure to Scarecrow's fear gas, causing her to act as herself and an identity that appears to be her sister Maggie pretending to be her. Soon afterward, she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at issue #94.\n\nCatwoman then appears in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics'' #759\u2013762 (August\u2013November 2001). In the backup storyline \"Trail of the Catwoman\", by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke, private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle. This storyline leads into the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]). In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and Slam Bradley (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham's East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar.\n\nDuring the ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' storyline, Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and have a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her. At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the [[Riddler]] and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. This is the second story to establish that she knows Batman's true identity. In an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship. The concluding story features a closing panel in which she refers to Batman as \"Bruce\". A change in the editorial team at that point, however, brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.\n\nIn the ''[[Justice League]]'' story arc \"Crisis of Conscience\", Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the Justice League against the old [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.\n\n====Mindwiping revelations====\nCatwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman is true (although brash and unpredictable). However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a mindwipe by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims. Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback, it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and Batman. Catwoman's response to this revelation is unequivocal: she gags Zatanna with duct tape, rendering her powerless, and pushes her out a window. Afterward, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.\n\nStill unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52, Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain. The [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], in an attempt to \"improve himself\", threatens the most important people in Selina's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly. The villain had also previously tortured Selina's sister Maggie by drilling out her husband's eyeballs and feeding them to Maggie, which drove her insane. Black Mask learns Selina's identity through his earlier alliance with Selina's childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbors a grudge against Selina. Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> This action continues to haunt her throughout the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, and it is suggested that this might have been the first time she had ever directly taken a life.\n\n====As a mother====\nFollowing the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the [[DC Universe]] jumps forward in time. After ''One Year later'', Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, she has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena. The father of her new daughter is initially unrevealed; however, Batman demonstrates great concern for the child and at one point asks to have Helena stay at his mansion. Selina attempts to live a safe and somewhat normal life, and gives up her more dangerous ways of living as Catwoman. Holly Robinson takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter (Selina's alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'').<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nThough she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena's birth. Having gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now tighter. In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal. Although the situation is defused through Holly's opportune arrival, the sight of two Catwomen active simultaneously in the city is caught on video. Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado [[Film Freak]] has deduced her alias, joined with [[Angle Man]], and grabbed Helena. After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces [[Zatanna]] to mind-wipe Film Freak and Angle Man in order to preserve her secret identity. Following the procedure, Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage.\n\nA twist occurs when Wildcat informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask. Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly. Finally defeating Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that Bradley has deduced that Helena is the daughter of his son Sam Bradley, Jr., and therefore his granddaughter (although it is still strongly hinted that Bruce Wayne may be the father).\n\nBatman asks Catwoman to infiltrate the violent tribe of the [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana Amazons]] during the ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' crossover. Posing as a criminal, Selina gains the Bana's trust and thwarts a terror attack aimed at causing mass casualties in Gotham City.\n\nSelina questions whether she should be raising a daughter when her life as Catwoman has already proven to be such a danger to the child. After enlisting Batman's help in faking the death of both herself and her daughter, Selina puts Helena up for adoption. A month after Helena is placed with a new family, Catwoman asks Zatanna to erase her memories of Helena and change her mind back to a criminal mentality. Zatanna refuses, judging that such an act would be cruel to both mother and daughter. She tells Selina that she could never reverse Selina's mindset, since she was on the path to becoming a hero on her own. Believing she can no longer function as a criminal, Selina decided to become one of Batman's [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> She quickly quits, however, and is replaced by [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]].\n\n====''Salvation Run''====\nIn ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #2, Catwoman is sent to the Prison Planet. She allies herself with [[Lex Luthor]] in an attempt to return to Earth, and mistakenly ends up on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]-Earth where Catwoman is a notorious villain. It is later revealed that this Earth is a creation of her own mind, and she has not left Prison Planet. When accused of being a traitor by Luthor, she reveals [[Martian Manhunter]] is posing as [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], which would soon lead to the hero's death.\n\nUsing the trust she regained in Luthor's eyes, she earns a passage to the 'real' Earth, in a jerry-rigged teleport machine built by Luthor for letting the villains escape. On Earth, she resumes being a hero, with occasional lapses into thievery by commission, simply for the thrill of it.\n\n====Heart of Hush====\n[[File:Catwoman art.jpg|thumb|upright|''Catwoman'' volume 3, #64 (April 2007), with art by Adam Hughes. Catwoman's costume and style transitioned to a spy aesthetic in the 2000s.]]\nLater, in ''Detective Comics'', Selina is quite uncertain about pursuing a romantic relationship with Batman. She talks with Bruce about [[List of Batman supporting characters#Bruce Wayne's love interests|Jezebel Jet]], his current girlfriend, and then has a quick pep talk with Zatanna, whom she believes is also courting Bruce. Zatanna confirms and admits her feelings, adding that she has since chosen to forget them, but extremely encourages Selina to open her heart to Bruce Wayne before Jet is able to \"seal the deal\". [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] eavesdrops on the conversation, targeting both women as a way to hurt his enemy, Bruce Wayne.\n\nIn ''Detective Comics'' #848 (November 2008), Hush attacks Selina as she is in her apartment, kidnapping her and surgically removing her heart. She is delivered anonymously to a Gotham hospital. Batman receives word of her situation, and while he goes in search of Hush, he leaves Selina in the care of [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], who is considered the superhero community's chief doctor.\n\nBatman recovers her heart, and Dr. Mid-Nite restores it to her body; however, the doctor also makes a prognosis on whether she can still return to her former life swinging through rooftops. While Selina is still in a coma, she encounters Zatanna, who apologizes for not warning her about Hush. She tells Selina that she was so happy about her relationship with Bruce that she ignored the other warnings in the cards. Zatanna gives her a little bottle supposedly containing [[aloe vera]] for her post-op scars. It is hinted that there is a little magic in there to help Selina with her recovery. Selina is sad that she might end up alone again. In the meantime, Bruce enters the recovery room and, believing her unconscious, launches into a soliloquy. He ends by telling Selina that he will always love her, when she opens her eyes and reveals to him that she was awake all the time and heard his confession.\n\n====''Batman R.I.P.''====\nDuring the events of ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', Selina and Bruce's romance lasts only for a night because Bruce must continue to pose as Jezebel's lover to bring down the Black Glove. While still recuperating, she pulls off one more heist and exacts her revenge on Hush. With the help of a few allies on both sides; [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], Holly Robinson, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], and Slam Bradley, Selina taps into Hush's assets, leaving him penniless and suffering from wounds inflicted by Batman.\n\n====''Battle for the Cowl''====\nIn ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Selina is seen as one of the members of [[Nightwing]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s contingency team known as \"The Network\", where she is seen taking down a gang of thugs before seeing [[Tim Drake]] dressed in a Batman uniform and is initially taken by surprise.\n\n====''Batman: Reborn'' and ''Gotham City Sirens''====\nIn the first issue of ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'', Selina runs into Bonebuster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, and is saved by Poison Ivy. Selina, fearing the many dangers of a post-Batman Gotham, proposes that she, Ivy, and Harley Quinn team up, living together at a single base in an abandoned animal shelter. Ivy agrees under one condition: using home-grown drugs to weaken Selina's resistance, Ivy demands the identity of the true Batman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #1 (June 2009)</ref> Selina flashes back three years to when [[Talia al Ghul]] requested her presence in [[Tibet]]. There, Talia made it so that Selina would not relinquish the true identity of Batman under any circumstances. After the interrogation is over, Selina sees Harley with Bruce Wayne on TV. Selina tells Ivy that she knows it is Hush in disguise.\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\nDuring the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Selina is attacked by Black Mask after he has been reborn as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. After he tells her that he plans on getting an emotional response before killing her, Selina steals a car and heads to the mental institution where Maggie is held, believing Black Mask is coming for her. Black Mask attacks the institution, and somehow awakens Maggie from her coma. Selina arrives in time to help her sister flee into the sewers. While on the run, Maggie angrily tells Selina that she ruined both of their lives the day she decided to become Catwoman. Devastated by her sister's statement, Selina fails to realize they have both been heading for a trap. Just as Black Mask is about to gouge Maggie's eyes out and shove them down Selina's throat, Harley and Ivy arrive and defeat the Black Lantern by trapping him in the stomach of a man-eating plant. Selina is helped to her feet by her friends, who tell her that Maggie has fled the scene. The next day, the staff members of the mental institution are shown discussing Maggie's escape, also mentioning that a nun that works at the hospital had been found beaten and stripped of her uniform. Maggie is then shown in the depths of the Gotham City sewers clad in the bloodied nun robes, muttering about her plan to kill Catwoman in order to free Selina's soul.<ref>''Catwoman'' #83 (March 2010)</ref> Now calling herself Sister Zero, Maggie attempts to kill Selina, but ultimately flees after being defeated by the Sirens. She is last seen going over her options, now realizing that she cannot murder her own sister, and therefore must personally exorcise the \"cat demon\" from within Selina's body.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #12\u201313 (July \u2013 August 2010)</ref>\n\n====''The Return of Bruce Wayne''====\nIn the build-up to ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne|The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'', the Sirens help Zatanna put out a massive fire at a local park near their home, only for them to be ambushed by a creature made of mud. After being dragged underneath the soil by the creature, Catwoman awakens bound and gagged on the floor of a dark room, and is quickly forced into an illusion by her unseen captors. Back in reality, Talia reveals to the Sirens that just a few hours prior, an unknown benefactor had offered up a massive reward to whoever could kidnap and deliver Catwoman to him, with the hopes that he could penetrate her mind and learn Batman's secret identity.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #16 (November 2010)</ref> Before the knowledge can be ripped from her mind, Selina's captors (revealed to be [[Shrike (comics)|Shrike]] and a new villain named Sempai), are eventually defeated by the other Sirens.\n\n[[File:Catwoman&Catgirl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Selina with her then-sidekick, Catgirl (2010). Art by Tony Daniel.]]\nOnce Selina is freed, Talia orders Zatanna to wipe Bruce's identity from her memory, reasoning that her kidnapping has proved that the knowledge is too dangerous for her to handle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #17 (December 2010)</ref> The two women initially restrain Selina and attempt to remove the knowledge from her, but Zatanna refuses at the last moment and ends up fighting Talia in order to protect Selina.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #18</ref> Talia tries to kill Selina before vanishing, but she survives and ultimately reunites with Bruce, who had recently returned to the present.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #19</ref>\n\nAfter stealing the contents of a safe belonging to the Falcone crime family, Selina returns home to find [[Kitrina Falcone|Kitrina]], a teenaged escape artist and Carmine Falcone's long lost daughter, breaking into her room. She attacks and subdues Kitrina, who tells Selina that she had unknowingly stolen a map that details the location of the new Black Mask's underground bunker. Realizing that she could use the map to capture Black Mask and claim the 50 million dollar bounty on his head, Selina leaves Kitrina bound in a locked room so that she can keep the map for herself.<ref>''Batman'' #695</ref> She later calls Batman to her house in order to turn the would-be thief over to the police, but discovers that Kitrina had managed to free herself and steal back the map. This impresses Selina, who mentions that she had tied up the child using an \"inescapable\" knot that Bruce had shown her years earlier.<ref>''Batman'' #696</ref>\n\nFollowing a battle with Black Mask and his henchmen, which ends with neither woman being able to claim the bounty, Selina agrees to take on Kitrina as her new sidekick, [[Kitrina Falcone|Catgirl]].<ref>''Batman'' #697</ref><ref>''Batman'' #704</ref> Once Bruce Wayne returns from his time in the past, he establishes [[Batman Incorporated]], a global team of Batmen. Selina accompanies Batman on a mission to break into [[Doctor Sivana]]'s armory, and later travels with him to Tokyo in order to recruit a Japanese representative for Batman Inc.<ref>''Batman Inc.'' #1</ref> Catwoman teams up with Batman to stop Harley Quinn from breaking the Joker out of Arkham Asylum. After defeating Harley and the Joker, Catwoman tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, this after Ivy drugged her in an attempt to uncover Batman's identity.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn have escaped and set off to pursue revenge on Catwoman for leaving them behind.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011)</ref> The two of them found Catwoman and fought her. While they were fighting, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help them. Batman was about to arrest them, but Catwoman helped the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52 / ''Catwoman'' 2011===\nIn 2011, DC Comics relaunched all titles under the umbrella, ''[[The New 52]]'', which rebooted the DC Universe continuity. Catwoman's new monthly title now focused on Selina's earlier days as Catwoman, but not her origins. The series begins with Selina frantically escaping from unknown masked men who are invading her apartment. After flitting from rooftop to rooftop, Selina looks back just in time to see her apartment blown apart by explosives. She turns to her informant, Lola, who often supplies Catwoman with information and various jobs. In this instance, Lola tips Selina off to an unoccupied penthouse where Selina can lay low for a few weeks, as well as a job stealing a painting from Russian mobsters. For this job, Selina infiltrates a Russian club by posing as the bartender. There, she recognizes a man who murdered a friend of hers, and she takes her revenge. Once her cover is blown, Selina dons her Catwoman outfit and fights her way out of the club. It is revealed through Selina's inner monologue that she and Batman are lovers, and the premiere issue ends with the first sex scene between the two.<ref name=\"Catwoman #1 September 2011\">''Catwoman'' #1 (September 2011)</ref> Her revised origin in ''Catwoman'' #0 draws from ''[[Batman Returns]]''.\n\nCatwoman is later confronted by [[Steve Trevor]], who offers her a spot on [[Amanda Waller]]'s new [[Justice League of America]]. Selina initially refuses, but accepts the offer after Trevor promises to help her track down a woman who has apparently been posing as Selina.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> It is later revealed that Catwoman was chosen specifically to take down Batman should the JLA ever need to defeat the original Justice League.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #2</ref> The teams eventually come into conflict in the publisher's \"[[Trinity War]]\" crossover.\n\nIn the [[Earth-Two]] continuity, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are married, and their daughter, Helena Wayne, is that universe's [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. In this universe, either Selina has reformed or was never a supervillain in the first place. It is revealed in issue #0 of ''[[Worlds' Finest]]'' that this Selina was killed while trying to stop what she believed was a human trade ring.\n\n====''Keeper of the Castle'' and ''Inheritance''====\nFrom 2014\u201315, science fiction writer [[Genevieve Valentine]] took over the series and penned a 10-issue story arc focused on Selina Kyle's reign as a [[Gotham City]] crime boss. Following events from ''[[Batman Eternal]]'' and preceding those in ''Batman'' #28, Selina takes over control of the Calabrese crime family, after being revealed as the daughter of Rex Calabrese.<ref name=ThisJustHappened>{{cite web|last1=Ruiz|first1=Sara|title=This Just Happened: Catwoman: Petty Thief Turned Crime Boss?|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2014/09/12/this-just-happened-catwoman-petty-thief-turned-crime-boss|publisher=DC Comics|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=12 September 2014}}</ref> During this time she stops wearing the Catwoman costume, prompting Eiko Hasigawa, heir to the rival Hasigawa family, to replace her in the role.<ref name=RainbowHubAnnual2>{{cite web|last1=Houxbois|first1=Emma|title=Review: Catwoman Annual #2|url=http://www.therainbowhub.com/review-catwoman-annual-2/|website=The Rainbow Hub|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=29 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070959/http://www.therainbowhub.com/review-catwoman-annual-2/|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe women confront each other several times, discussing Eiko's motivations to dress as Catwoman and whether Selina's plans for Gotham and the families are worth the sacrifices required. During one of their encounters, Selina and Eiko kiss, establishing their relationship as a romantic one.\n\n===DC Universe===\nIn June 2016, the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles, in which Catwoman has a prominent role in the third volume of ''Batman''. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the ''Rebirth'' branding, opting to include everything under a larger ''DC Universe'' banner and naming, and Catwoman continues to be featured in the third volume of ''Batman''. The series reveals Selina Kyle's origin through a series of flashbacks and letters exchanged between her and Bruce. Selina's parents died when she was young, and she hardly remembers them. She is sent to the Thomas and Martha Wayne Home For the Boys and Girls of Gotham, and even after being placed in various foster, Selina would escape to return to the orphanage.\n\nEventually, Selina takes on the Catwoman persona. During one of her heists, she is approached by the Kite Man to aide the Joker in a gang war against the Riddler, which she refuses. She later aides Batman, with whom she already has a romantic relationship, to spy on the Joker. She is shot from a window, but is unharmed. At some point in the future, her childhood orphanage is bombed by a terrorist group called the Dogs of War. Batman reluctantly arrests Catwoman after all 237 of them are killed, despite Catwoman's insistence on her guilt.\n\nCatwoman's first appearance is in ''Batman'' #9, where she is revealed to be imprisoned in Arkham Asylum for the alleged murders of the Dogs of War. Batman is determined to prove her innocence, and makes a deal with Amanda Waller to get her off death row in exchange for her help on a mission to Santa Prisca. The mission to find [[Psycho-Pirate]] is a success, and Batman and Catwoman return to Gotham City. Before Batman can return her to custody, she escapes. Batman investigates the murders of the terrorists that she has been charged with, and deduces that it was in fact Holly Robinson who committed the murders after the terrorists burned down the orphanage she and Selina were raised in. After being attacked by Holly Robinson, Batman is rescued by Catwoman.\n\nBruce proposes to Selina in ''Batman'' #24.<ref>''Batman'' #24 (August 2017)</ref> In issue #32, Selina asks Bruce to propose to her again, to which she says, \"Yes\".<ref name=\"Batman #32 December 2017\">''Batman'' #32 (December 2017)</ref> The two leave Gotham for Khadym, where Holly Robinson has fled to, to clear Selina's name.\n\n''Batman Annual'' vol. 3, #2 (January 2018) centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years. Bruce receives a terminal medical diagnosis, and Selina cares for him until his death.<ref>''Batman'' vol. 3, #32 (December 2017)</ref>\n\nAfter calling off her engagement to Batman, Selina leaves Gotham and starts a new life in the California city of Villa Hermosa (''Catwoman'' vol. 5, #1). She faces opposition from the power-hungry Creel family who run Villa Hermosa, specifically First Lady Raina Creel.\n\n==Romantic relationships==\n\n===Batman===\nAlthough Catwoman has been historically portrayed as a supervillain, [[Batman]] and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are frequently depicted as having a romantic relationship. Batman has had many romantic relationships with female characters throughout the years, but while these relationships tend to be short in duration, Batman's attraction to Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear.\n\nIn an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as \"Bruce\". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.\n\nBruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (out of costume) develop a relationship during ''The Long Halloween''. The story sees Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while.\n\nWhen the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, ''Hush'' sees Batman and Catwoman teaming up as allies against the entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]] and rekindling their romantic relationship. In ''Hush'', Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.\n\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211). They have a daughter named [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]]) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.\n\nBatman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on top of a building in ''Catwoman'' vol. 4, #1 (Sept. 2011), and the same issue implies that the two have an ongoing sexual relationship.<ref name=\"Catwoman #1 September 2011\"/>\n\nFollowing the ''DC Rebirth'' continuity reboot, the two once again have a sexual encounter on a rooftop in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #14 (2017).<ref>''Batman'' vol. 3, #14 (March 2017)</ref> In the third volume of ''Batman'', Selina and Bruce are in a romantic relationship, and flashbacks to the past reveal their history together. Bruce proposes to Selina in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #32 (2017), to which she says, \"Yes\".<ref name=\"Batman #32 December 2017\"/>\n\n===Other===\nPrior to the ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' reboot, Selina had a relationship with Slam Bradley Jr., and she named him as the father of her daughter Helena. However, the father may still have been Batman.\n\nIn February 2015, a storyline by writer [[Genevieve Valentine]] shows Selina kissing fellow Catwoman Eiko Hasigawa.<ref name=ValentineCatwoman39>{{cite web|last1=Valentine|first1=Genevieve|title=Catwoman #39: \"Better Than He Does Himself\"|url=http://www.genevievevalentine.com/2015/02/catwoman-39-better-than-he-does-himself/|website=GeneveiveValentine|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Weapons===\nDuring the Silver Age, Catwoman, like most ''Batman'' villains, used a variety of themed weapons, vehicles, and equipment, such as a custom cat-themed car called the \"Cat-illac\". This usage also appeared in the 1960s ''Batman'' television series. In her post-''Crisis'' appearances, Catwoman's favored weapon is a whip. She wields both a standard bullwhip and the cat o' nine tails with expert proficiency. She uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use, and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation. She can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her. Catwoman uses [[caltrop]]s as an anti-personnel weapon and [[bolas]] to entangle opponents at a distance.\n\nCatwoman has also been shown to have various items to restrain her victims, such as rope for binding hands and feet, and a roll of [[duct tape]] used to gag her targets, as she has done with various victims during her robberies over the years. Often, especially in the TV series, she uses sleeping gas or knockout darts to subdue victims. Catwoman's attractiveness and feminine wiles have also allowed her to take advantage of male opponents.\n\n[[File:Catwoman-ninelives-tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Catwoman: Nine Lives of a Feline Fatale'' (2003), showing Catwoman's various costumes throughout the years. Art by Brian Bolland.]]\n\n===Costume===\nCatwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all. It was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a [[catsuit]] with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask.\n\nIn the 1960s, Catwoman's catsuit was green, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a mostly purple, skintight catsuit before switching to a black catsuit similar to [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s costume in ''Batman Returns'', except not stitched together.\n\nIn recent years, artists have typically depicted Catwoman in some variation of a tight, black bodysuit. Ed Brubaker, the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic leather catsuit in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' television series.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Man Behind The Cat \u2013 Exclusive Interview with Ed Brubaker | url=http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html | accessdate=June 10, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528170818/http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html|archivedate=May 28, 2005}}</ref> It has a more high tech look, with domino-shaped [[Thermography|infrared goggles]] on her cowl. Many of her costumes have incorporated retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and sometimes on the toes of her boots. On rare occasions, she has also sported a cat's tail.\n\nOn May 21, 2018, DC Comics unveiled Selina's revamped Catwoman costume designed by comic book writer and artist [[Jo\u00eblle Jones]]. The new costume is black with openings under her arms and shoulders for mobility along with reinforcement in the middle. Gone are the goggles in favor of a cowl and sleeker, more stylish gloves and boots. Jones, who had been drawing the covers and interior art for ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' 's ''Batman'' was announced as the writer and artist of a brand new solo ''Catwoman'' series (volume 5).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2018/05/21/exclusive-get-a-sneak-peek-at-catwomans-new-costume|work=DC Comics|title=Exclusive: Get a Sneak Peek at Catwoman's New Costume|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHolly Robinson uses the same costume Selina used prior to ''Infinite Crisis''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===List of ''Catwoman'' titles===\n* ''Catwoman'' (miniseries) Vol. 1 #1\u20134 (1989)\n* ''Catwoman: Defiant'' (1992)\n* ''Catwoman'' Vol. 2 #1\u201394 (1993\u20132001)\n** ''Catwoman'' #0 (1994)\n** ''Catwoman'' #1,000,000 (1998)\n** ''Catwoman Annual'' #1\u20134 (1994\u20131997)\n* ''Catwoman/[[Vampirella]]: The Furies'' (1997)\n* ''Catwoman Plus/Scream Queen'' #1 (1997) (with Scream Queen)\n* ''Catwoman/[[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]]'' #1\u20134 (1998)\n* ''Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham'' #1\u20132 (1999)\n* ''Catwoman'' Vol. 3 #1\u201383 (2002\u20132008, 2010)\n** ''Catwoman: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (2003)\n* ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]'' #1\u20136 (2004)\n* ''Batman/Catwoman: Trail of the Gun'' #1\u20132 (2004)\n* ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #1\u201326 (2009\u20132011) (Catwoman co-stars in the title alongside Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn)\n* ''Catwoman'' Vol. 4 #1\u201352 (2011\u20132016)\n** ''Catwoman'' #0\n** ''Catwoman: Future's End'' #1\n** ''Catwoman Annual'' #1\u20132 (2013, 2014)\n* ''Catwoman'' Vol. 5 #1\u2013ongoing (2018\u2013present)\n\n===Novels===\n* ''Catwoman: Tiger Hunt'', [[Warner Books]], September 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-446-36043-2}}\n\n===Graphic novels===\n* ''Catwoman: Selina's Big Score'', DC Comics, {{ISBN|978-1-56389-922-5}} (SC, August 2003), {{ISBN|978-1-56389-897-6}} (HC, July 2002)\n\n===Collected editions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Setting out to learn as much about Batman and his enemies as she can, Gata becomes the new Catwoman. Near the end of the story, Gata and her followers face off against Batman, but the two later fall in love, and Maria Romero, also known as Madame X, tells Sheila that she is really a clone of Maria.

Years later she becomes Catwoman, the defender of Gotham City, operating out of a Catcave beneath Kyle Manor, aided by a young maid named Brooks (this universe's version of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]).

As they fight together, Batman finds that Selina's selfless love for him allows him to control his thirst for blood that had begun to consume him. She sacrifices herself to save him from the Joker, who had become the leader of the remaining vampires after Dracula's death, taking a crossbow bolt to the heart that the Joker had fired at Batman. Batman's grief and rage over her death causes him to finally lose control of his bloodlust as he drinks the Joker's blood. In the second sequel, ''Batman: Crimson Mist'', the corrupted Batman reflects grimly that he can no longer understand Selina's noble sacrifice after his psyche has become increasingly corrupted by his surrender to his vampire side.\n\n===''Thrillkiller''===\nIn [[Howard Chaykin]]'s ''Thrillkiller'', Selina Kyle is a stripper in a cat-themed strip club.

The character made her debut as \"the Cat\" in ''Batman'' #1 (Spring 1940), and her real name is '''Selina Kyle'''.

She was originally characterized as a supervillain and adversary of Batman, but she has been featured in a series since the 1990s which portrays her as an [[antiheroine]], often doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The character thrived since her earliest appearances, but she took an extended hiatus from September 1954 to November 1966 due to the developing [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954. These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code, a code which is no longer in use. In the comics, [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and Eiko Hasigawa have both adopted the Catwoman identity, apart from Selina Kyle.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | authorlink=Scott Beatty | contribution=Catwoman | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=74\u201375 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York City|New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref><ref name=RainbowHubAnnual2/>\n\nCatwoman has been featured in many media adaptations related to Batman.

[[Halle Berry]] starred in 2004's ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]''; this, however, was a critical and commercial flop and bears little similarity to the Batman character.

A young version of Kyle was played by [[Camren Bicondova]] on the 2014 television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' although [[Lili Simmons]] portrayed an older Kyle in the series finale.

Although she does not wear her [[icon]]ic cat-suit, the story establishes her core personality as a femme fatale who both antagonizes and attracts Batman. It is implied Batman may have deliberately let her get away by blocking [[Robin (character)|Robin]] as he tried to leap after her. She next appears in ''Batman'' #2 in a story also involving the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] but escapes Batman in the end. In ''Batman'' #3 she wears a fur mask and again succeeds in escaping Batman.\n\n''Batman'' #62 (December 1950) reveals that Catwoman was an [[amnesiac]] [[flight attendant]] who turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived. She reveals this in the [[Batcave]] after being hit on the head by a piece of rubble while saving Batman while he was chasing her. However, in issue #197 of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'', she later admits that she made up the amnesia story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime. She reforms for several years, helping out Batman in ''Batman'' #65 (June 1951) and #69 (February 1952), until she decides to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #203 (January 1954), after a newspaper publishes stories of Batman's past adventures and some crooks mock her about it. However, Catwoman prevents her thugs from murdering Batman once he is later found knocked out, but quickly claims she wants him as a hostage. Catwoman appears again as a criminal in ''Batman'' #84 (June 1954) and ''Detective Comics'' #211 (September 1954) for her final appearance until 1966. This was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing [[Comics Code Authority]]'s rules for portrayal of female characters that started in 1954.\n\nIn the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters) reveal that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (after the events of ''Batman'' #69) and had married [[Bruce Wayne]]; soon afterward, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]]). ''The Brave and the Bold'' #197 (April 1983) elaborates upon the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman'' #62, after Selina reveals that she never suffered from amnesia. It is revealed that Selina Kyle had been in an bad marriage, and eventually decided to leave her husband. However, her husband kept her jewelry in his private vault, and she had to break into it to retrieve it. Selina enjoyed this experience so much she decided to become a professional costumed cat burglar, and thus began a career that repeatedly leads to her encountering Batman.\n\nThe Earth-Two/Golden Age Selina Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being blackmailed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman, as shown in ''DC Super-Stars'' #17 (December 1977).\n\nCatwoman made her first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] appearance in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #70 (November 1966); afterward, she continued to make appearances across the various ''Batman'' comics.\n\nSeveral stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing murder, something that neither the Earth-One nor Earth-Two versions of her would ever do. This version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-B]], an alternate [[Earth]] that included stories that could not be considered [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] on Earth-One or Earth-Two.<ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Index'' (March 1986)</ref><ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Cross-Over Index'' (July 1986)</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/04/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-171/ | last=Cronin | first=Brian | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #171 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Age===\n{{Long plot|date=May 2015}}\n\n====Tangled origins====\nCatwoman's origin\u2014and, to an extent, her character\u2014was revised in 1987 when writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] published ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman's origin. She worked as a dominatrix for the pimp Stan to survive and also sheltered a child prostitute named [[Holly Robinson (fictional character)|Holly Robinson]] working for him. Selina got into a fight with a disguised Bruce after he grabbed Holly, who had stabbed him during a fight with Stan, but was knocked out.\n\nAs the story progresses, Selina decides to leave prostitution and takes Holly with her. She gets into burglary to make money and starts robbing the rich and powerful men of Gotham, donning a catsuit costume while committing her heists. While trying to rob [[Carmine Falcone]], she gets rescued by Batman but is irked of being thought of as his sidekick by the media.\n\nThe 1989 ''Catwoman'' limited series, written by [[Mindy Newell]] and with art by J.J. Birch, expanded upon Miller's ''Year One'' origin. This storyline, known as \"Her Sister's Keeper\", explores Selina's early life as a dominatrix and the start of her career as Catwoman. The story culminates with Selina's former pimp, Stan, abducting and beating her sister Maggie, who, in contrast to Selina, is a nun. Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and gets away with it. Most of this is revealed in the former series, but is expanded upon in \"Her Sister's Keeper\".\n\n''Catwoman'' vol. 2, #69 provides details about Selina's childhood and neglects Maggie's existence. Maria Kyle is a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats, and commits suicide when Selina is very young. Her alcoholic father, Brian, is cold to Selina for resembling her mother, whom he resents for dying, and eventually drinks himself to death. To survive, Selina takes to the streets for a time before getting caught and sent first to an orphanage, then juvenile detention center,<ref name=\"Catwoman v1 0\">''Catwoman'' (vol. 1) #0</ref> \"where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be\".<ref>''Catwoman: Secret Files and Origins''</ref> Maggie's fate at this point in the time-line is not alluded to. However, when [[Ed Brubaker]] reintroduces her into the comic, he implies that Maggie may have directly entered an orphanage and promptly been adopted.\n\nWhen she is 13 years old, Selina discovers that the detention center's administrator has been embezzling funds, and she confronts her. In an attempt to cover up her crime, the administrator puts Selina in a bag and drops her in a river to drown (like a cat). She escapes and returns to the orphanage, where she steals documents exposing the administrator's corruption. She uses these to blackmail the administrator into erasing \"Selina Kyle\" from the city's records, then steals the administrator's diamond necklace and escapes from the orphanage.<ref name=\"Catwoman v1 0\"/> Selina eventually finds herself in \"Alleytown \u2013 a network of cobblestone streets that form a small borough between the East End and Old [[Gotham City|Gotham]].\"<ref>''Catwoman'' (vol. 2) #12</ref> Selina is taken in by Mama Fortuna, the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and is taught how to steal. Fortuna treats her students like slaves, keeping their earnings for herself. Selina eventually runs away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia. However, the two have difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation try to support themselves by working as prostitutes. The two drift apart afterward, with Sylvia coming to resent Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.\n\nIn the ''Catwoman: Year One'' story,<ref>''Catwoman Annual'' #2 (1995)</ref> Selina, who is now an adult, achieves some success as a thief. Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepts an offer to \"lie low\" as a dominatrix employed by a pimp named Stan. They plan to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes. According to this storyline, Selina trains under the Armless Master of Gotham City, receiving education in martial arts and culture. During this time, a client gives her a cat o' nine tails, which Selina keeps as a trophy.\n\n''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implies that Catwoman suspects she is the illegitimate daughter of Mafia boss [[Carmine Falcone]], although she finds no definitive proof. Selina's connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]''. Though the story adds more circumstantial evidence to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, establishing that the Falcones' second-born daughter was put up for adoption in America, it also supplies no definitive proof. During ''The Long Halloween'', Selina (out of costume) develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne, even leading her to save Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, this relationship appears to end on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. She leaves him for good and also leaves Gotham for a while in ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', after he stands her up on two holidays. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina.\n\nCatwoman also appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' saga, where she is approached by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s henchmen while robbing a house. Bane asks her to work for him, but she refuses, as she is repulsed by the criminal who \"broke\" Batman. Later in the story, she boards a plane with [[Bruce Wayne]] to fly to [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]]. She next appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall#\"Knightquest\"|Batman: Knightquest]]'' saga, where [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] is masquerading as Batman. She is one of the few to recognize that this Batman is an impostor, later being present when the true Batman returns to the fold as he struggles against his successor, his willingness to save even criminals confirming his true identity for Selina.\n\n====''Catwoman'' solo series====\n[[File:Catwoman (Jim Balent and Joe DeVito's art).png|thumb|Catwoman, painted by [[Joe DeVito]] over pencil art by the titular character's series artist [[Jim Balent]].

The series also delves into her origin, revealing her beginnings as a young thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and her training with [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted \"Wildcat\" Grant]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nMoving to [[New York City]], Selina becomes corporate vice president of Randolf Industries, a mafia-influenced company and then becomes its [[chief executive officer|CEO]] through blackmail. She plans to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City]], but her hopes are dashed when the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] inadvertently connects her to her criminal alter ego.\n\nAfter her time in New York City, Selina returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline. As Catwoman, she assists Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city. After being arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], she escapes from prison. Later that year, during the \"Officer Down\" storyline in the ''Batman'' titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect. Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story, with her series later revealing that she has developed a form of personality disorder after exposure to Scarecrow's fear gas, causing her to act as herself and an identity that appears to be her sister Maggie pretending to be her. Soon afterward, she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at issue #94.\n\nCatwoman then appears in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics'' #759\u2013762 (August\u2013November 2001). In the backup storyline \"Trail of the Catwoman\", by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke, private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle. This storyline leads into the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]). In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and Slam Bradley (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham's East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar.\n\nDuring the ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' storyline, Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and have a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her. At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the [[Riddler]] and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. This is the second story to establish that she knows Batman's true identity. In an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship. The concluding story features a closing panel in which she refers to Batman as \"Bruce\". A change in the editorial team at that point, however, brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.\n\nIn the ''[[Justice League]]'' story arc \"Crisis of Conscience\", Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the Justice League against the old [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.\n\n====Mindwiping revelations====\nCatwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman is true (although brash and unpredictable). However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a mindwipe by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims. Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback, it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and Batman. Catwoman's response to this revelation is unequivocal: she gags Zatanna with duct tape, rendering her powerless, and pushes her out a window. Afterward, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.\n\nStill unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52, Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain. The [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], in an attempt to \"improve himself\", threatens the most important people in Selina's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly. The villain had also previously tortured Selina's sister Maggie by drilling out her husband's eyeballs and feeding them to Maggie, which drove her insane. Black Mask learns Selina's identity through his earlier alliance with Selina's childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbors a grudge against Selina. Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> This action continues to haunt her throughout the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, and it is suggested that this might have been the first time she had ever directly taken a life.\n\n====As a mother====\nFollowing the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the [[DC Universe]] jumps forward in time. After ''One Year later'', Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, she has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena. The father of her new daughter is initially unrevealed; however, Batman demonstrates great concern for the child and at one point asks to have Helena stay at his mansion. Selina attempts to live a safe and somewhat normal life, and gives up her more dangerous ways of living as Catwoman. Holly Robinson takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter (Selina's alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'').<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nThough she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena's birth. Having gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now tighter. In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal. Although the situation is defused through Holly's opportune arrival, the sight of two Catwomen active simultaneously in the city is caught on video. Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado [[Film Freak]] has deduced her alias, joined with [[Angle Man]], and grabbed Helena. After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces [[Zatanna]] to mind-wipe Film Freak and Angle Man in order to preserve her secret identity. Following the procedure, Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage.\n\nA twist occurs when Wildcat informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask. Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly. Finally defeating Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that Bradley has deduced that Helena is the daughter of his son Sam Bradley, Jr., and therefore his granddaughter (although it is still strongly hinted that Bruce Wayne may be the father).\n\nBatman asks Catwoman to infiltrate the violent tribe of the [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana Amazons]] during the ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' crossover. Posing as a criminal, Selina gains the Bana's trust and thwarts a terror attack aimed at causing mass casualties in Gotham City.\n\nSelina questions whether she should be raising a daughter when her life as Catwoman has already proven to be such a danger to the child. After enlisting Batman's help in faking the death of both herself and her daughter, Selina puts Helena up for adoption. A month after Helena is placed with a new family, Catwoman asks Zatanna to erase her memories of Helena and change her mind back to a criminal mentality. Zatanna refuses, judging that such an act would be cruel to both mother and daughter. She tells Selina that she could never reverse Selina's mindset, since she was on the path to becoming a hero on her own. Believing she can no longer function as a criminal, Selina decided to become one of Batman's [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> She quickly quits, however, and is replaced by [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]].\n\n====''Salvation Run''====\nIn ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #2, Catwoman is sent to the Prison Planet. She allies herself with [[Lex Luthor]] in an attempt to return to Earth, and mistakenly ends up on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]-Earth where Catwoman is a notorious villain. It is later revealed that this Earth is a creation of her own mind, and she has not left Prison Planet. When accused of being a traitor by Luthor, she reveals [[Martian Manhunter]] is posing as [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], which would soon lead to the hero's death.\n\nUsing the trust she regained in Luthor's eyes, she earns a passage to the 'real' Earth, in a jerry-rigged teleport machine built by Luthor for letting the villains escape. On Earth, she resumes being a hero, with occasional lapses into thievery by commission, simply for the thrill of it.\n\n====Heart of Hush====\n[[File:Catwoman art.jpg|thumb|upright|''Catwoman'' volume 3, #64 (April 2007), with art by Adam Hughes. Catwoman's costume and style transitioned to a spy aesthetic in the 2000s.]]\nLater, in ''Detective Comics'', Selina is quite uncertain about pursuing a romantic relationship with Batman. She talks with Bruce about [[List of Batman supporting characters#Bruce Wayne's love interests|Jezebel Jet]], his current girlfriend, and then has a quick pep talk with Zatanna, whom she believes is also courting Bruce. Zatanna confirms and admits her feelings, adding that she has since chosen to forget them, but extremely encourages Selina to open her heart to Bruce Wayne before Jet is able to \"seal the deal\". [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] eavesdrops on the conversation, targeting both women as a way to hurt his enemy, Bruce Wayne.\n\nIn ''Detective Comics'' #848 (November 2008), Hush attacks Selina as she is in her apartment, kidnapping her and surgically removing her heart. She is delivered anonymously to a Gotham hospital. Batman receives word of her situation, and while he goes in search of Hush, he leaves Selina in the care of [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], who is considered the superhero community's chief doctor.\n\nBatman recovers her heart, and Dr. Mid-Nite restores it to her body; however, the doctor also makes a prognosis on whether she can still return to her former life swinging through rooftops. While Selina is still in a coma, she encounters Zatanna, who apologizes for not warning her about Hush. She tells Selina that she was so happy about her relationship with Bruce that she ignored the other warnings in the cards. Zatanna gives her a little bottle supposedly containing [[aloe vera]] for her post-op scars. It is hinted that there is a little magic in there to help Selina with her recovery. Selina is sad that she might end up alone again. In the meantime, Bruce enters the recovery room and, believing her unconscious, launches into a soliloquy. He ends by telling Selina that he will always love her, when she opens her eyes and reveals to him that she was awake all the time and heard his confession.\n\n====''Batman R.I.P.''====\nDuring the events of ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', Selina and Bruce's romance lasts only for a night because Bruce must continue to pose as Jezebel's lover to bring down the Black Glove. While still recuperating, she pulls off one more heist and exacts her revenge on Hush. With the help of a few allies on both sides; [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], Holly Robinson, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], and Slam Bradley, Selina taps into Hush's assets, leaving him penniless and suffering from wounds inflicted by Batman.\n\n====''Battle for the Cowl''====\nIn ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Selina is seen as one of the members of [[Nightwing]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s contingency team known as \"The Network\", where she is seen taking down a gang of thugs before seeing [[Tim Drake]] dressed in a Batman uniform and is initially taken by surprise.\n\n====''Batman: Reborn'' and ''Gotham City Sirens''====\nIn the first issue of ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'', Selina runs into Bonebuster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, and is saved by Poison Ivy. Selina, fearing the many dangers of a post-Batman Gotham, proposes that she, Ivy, and Harley Quinn team up, living together at a single base in an abandoned animal shelter. Ivy agrees under one condition: using home-grown drugs to weaken Selina's resistance, Ivy demands the identity of the true Batman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #1 (June 2009)</ref> Selina flashes back three years to when [[Talia al Ghul]] requested her presence in [[Tibet]]. There, Talia made it so that Selina would not relinquish the true identity of Batman under any circumstances. After the interrogation is over, Selina sees Harley with Bruce Wayne on TV. Selina tells Ivy that she knows it is Hush in disguise.\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\nDuring the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Selina is attacked by Black Mask after he has been reborn as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. After he tells her that he plans on getting an emotional response before killing her, Selina steals a car and heads to the mental institution where Maggie is held, believing Black Mask is coming for her. Black Mask attacks the institution, and somehow awakens Maggie from her coma. Selina arrives in time to help her sister flee into the sewers. While on the run, Maggie angrily tells Selina that she ruined both of their lives the day she decided to become Catwoman. Devastated by her sister's statement, Selina fails to realize they have both been heading for a trap. Just as Black Mask is about to gouge Maggie's eyes out and shove them down Selina's throat, Harley and Ivy arrive and defeat the Black Lantern by trapping him in the stomach of a man-eating plant. Selina is helped to her feet by her friends, who tell her that Maggie has fled the scene. The next day, the staff members of the mental institution are shown discussing Maggie's escape, also mentioning that a nun that works at the hospital had been found beaten and stripped of her uniform. Maggie is then shown in the depths of the Gotham City sewers clad in the bloodied nun robes, muttering about her plan to kill Catwoman in order to free Selina's soul.<ref>''Catwoman'' #83 (March 2010)</ref> Now calling herself Sister Zero, Maggie attempts to kill Selina, but ultimately flees after being defeated by the Sirens. She is last seen going over her options, now realizing that she cannot murder her own sister, and therefore must personally exorcise the \"cat demon\" from within Selina's body.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #12\u201313 (July \u2013 August 2010)</ref>\n\n====''The Return of Bruce Wayne''====\nIn the build-up to ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne|The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'', the Sirens help Zatanna put out a massive fire at a local park near their home, only for them to be ambushed by a creature made of mud. After being dragged underneath the soil by the creature, Catwoman awakens bound and gagged on the floor of a dark room, and is quickly forced into an illusion by her unseen captors. Back in reality, Talia reveals to the Sirens that just a few hours prior, an unknown benefactor had offered up a massive reward to whoever could kidnap and deliver Catwoman to him, with the hopes that he could penetrate her mind and learn Batman's secret identity.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #16 (November 2010)</ref> Before the knowledge can be ripped from her mind, Selina's captors (revealed to be [[Shrike (comics)|Shrike]] and a new villain named Sempai), are eventually defeated by the other Sirens.\n\n[[File:Catwoman&Catgirl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Selina with her then-sidekick, Catgirl (2010). Art by Tony Daniel.]]\nOnce Selina is freed, Talia orders Zatanna to wipe Bruce's identity from her memory, reasoning that her kidnapping has proved that the knowledge is too dangerous for her to handle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #17 (December 2010)</ref> The two women initially restrain Selina and attempt to remove the knowledge from her, but Zatanna refuses at the last moment and ends up fighting Talia in order to protect Selina.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #18</ref> Talia tries to kill Selina before vanishing, but she survives and ultimately reunites with Bruce, who had recently returned to the present.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #19</ref>\n\nAfter stealing the contents of a safe belonging to the Falcone crime family, Selina returns home to find [[Kitrina Falcone|Kitrina]], a teenaged escape artist and Carmine Falcone's long lost daughter, breaking into her room. She attacks and subdues Kitrina, who tells Selina that she had unknowingly stolen a map that details the location of the new Black Mask's underground bunker. Realizing that she could use the map to capture Black Mask and claim the 50 million dollar bounty on his head, Selina leaves Kitrina bound in a locked room so that she can keep the map for herself.<ref>''Batman'' #695</ref> She later calls Batman to her house in order to turn the would-be thief over to the police, but discovers that Kitrina had managed to free herself and steal back the map. This impresses Selina, who mentions that she had tied up the child using an \"inescapable\" knot that Bruce had shown her years earlier.<ref>''Batman'' #696</ref>\n\nFollowing a battle with Black Mask and his henchmen, which ends with neither woman being able to claim the bounty, Selina agrees to take on Kitrina as her new sidekick, [[Kitrina Falcone|Catgirl]].<ref>''Batman'' #697</ref><ref>''Batman'' #704</ref> Once Bruce Wayne returns from his time in the past, he establishes [[Batman Incorporated]], a global team of Batmen. Selina accompanies Batman on a mission to break into [[Doctor Sivana]]'s armory, and later travels with him to Tokyo in order to recruit a Japanese representative for Batman Inc.<ref>''Batman Inc.'' #1</ref> Catwoman teams up with Batman to stop Harley Quinn from breaking the Joker out of Arkham Asylum. After defeating Harley and the Joker, Catwoman tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, this after Ivy drugged her in an attempt to uncover Batman's identity.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn have escaped and set off to pursue revenge on Catwoman for leaving them behind.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011)</ref> The two of them found Catwoman and fought her. While they were fighting, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help them. Batman was about to arrest them, but Catwoman helped the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52 / ''Catwoman'' 2011===\nIn 2011, DC Comics relaunched all titles under the umbrella, ''[[The New 52]]'', which rebooted the DC Universe continuity. Catwoman's new monthly title now focused on Selina's earlier days as Catwoman, but not her origins. The series begins with Selina frantically escaping from unknown masked men who are invading her apartment. After flitting from rooftop to rooftop, Selina looks back just in time to see her apartment blown apart by explosives. She turns to her informant, Lola, who often supplies Catwoman with information and various jobs. In this instance, Lola tips Selina off to an unoccupied penthouse where Selina can lay low for a few weeks, as well as a job stealing a painting from Russian mobsters. For this job, Selina infiltrates a Russian club by posing as the bartender. There, she recognizes a man who murdered a friend of hers, and she takes her revenge. Once her cover is blown, Selina dons her Catwoman outfit and fights her way out of the club. It is revealed through Selina's inner monologue that she and Batman are lovers, and the premiere issue ends with the first sex scene between the two.<ref name=\"Catwoman #1 September 2011\">''Catwoman'' #1 (September 2011)</ref> Her revised origin in ''Catwoman'' #0 draws from ''[[Batman Returns]]''.\n\nCatwoman is later confronted by [[Steve Trevor]], who offers her a spot on [[Amanda Waller]]'s new [[Justice League of America]]. Selina initially refuses, but accepts the offer after Trevor promises to help her track down a woman who has apparently been posing as Selina.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> It is later revealed that Catwoman was chosen specifically to take down Batman should the JLA ever need to defeat the original Justice League.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #2</ref> The teams eventually come into conflict in the publisher's \"[[Trinity War]]\" crossover.\n\nIn the [[Earth-Two]] continuity, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are married, and their daughter, Helena Wayne, is that universe's [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. In this universe, either Selina has reformed or was never a supervillain in the first place. It is revealed in issue #0 of ''[[Worlds' Finest]]'' that this Selina was killed while trying to stop what she believed was a human trade ring.\n\n====''Keeper of the Castle'' and ''Inheritance''====\nFrom 2014\u201315, science fiction writer [[Genevieve Valentine]] took over the series and penned a 10-issue story arc focused on Selina Kyle's reign as a [[Gotham City]] crime boss. Following events from ''[[Batman Eternal]]'' and preceding those in ''Batman'' #28, Selina takes over control of the Calabrese crime family, after being revealed as the daughter of Rex Calabrese.<ref name=ThisJustHappened>{{cite web|last1=Ruiz|first1=Sara|title=This Just Happened: Catwoman: Petty Thief Turned Crime Boss?|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2014/09/12/this-just-happened-catwoman-petty-thief-turned-crime-boss|publisher=DC Comics|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=12 September 2014}}</ref> During this time she stops wearing the Catwoman costume, prompting Eiko Hasigawa, heir to the rival Hasigawa family, to replace her in the role.<ref name=RainbowHubAnnual2>{{cite web|last1=Houxbois|first1=Emma|title=Review: Catwoman Annual #2|url=http://www.therainbowhub.com/review-catwoman-annual-2/|website=The Rainbow Hub|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=29 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070959/http://www.therainbowhub.com/review-catwoman-annual-2/|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe women confront each other several times, discussing Eiko's motivations to dress as Catwoman and whether Selina's plans for Gotham and the families are worth the sacrifices required. During one of their encounters, Selina and Eiko kiss, establishing their relationship as a romantic one.\n\n===DC Universe===\nIn June 2016, the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles, in which Catwoman has a prominent role in the third volume of ''Batman''. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the ''Rebirth'' branding, opting to include everything under a larger ''DC Universe'' banner and naming, and Catwoman continues to be featured in the third volume of ''Batman''. The series reveals Selina Kyle's origin through a series of flashbacks and letters exchanged between her and Bruce. Selina's parents died when she was young, and she hardly remembers them. She is sent to the Thomas and Martha Wayne Home For the Boys and Girls of Gotham, and even after being placed in various foster, Selina would escape to return to the orphanage.\n\nEventually, Selina takes on the Catwoman persona. During one of her heists, she is approached by the Kite Man to aide the Joker in a gang war against the Riddler, which she refuses. She later aides Batman, with whom she already has a romantic relationship, to spy on the Joker. She is shot from a window, but is unharmed. At some point in the future, her childhood orphanage is bombed by a terrorist group called the Dogs of War. Batman reluctantly arrests Catwoman after all 237 of them are killed, despite Catwoman's insistence on her guilt.\n\nCatwoman's first appearance is in ''Batman'' #9, where she is revealed to be imprisoned in Arkham Asylum for the alleged murders of the Dogs of War. Batman is determined to prove her innocence, and makes a deal with Amanda Waller to get her off death row in exchange for her help on a mission to Santa Prisca. The mission to find [[Psycho-Pirate]] is a success, and Batman and Catwoman return to Gotham City. Before Batman can return her to custody, she escapes. Batman investigates the murders of the terrorists that she has been charged with, and deduces that it was in fact Holly Robinson who committed the murders after the terrorists burned down the orphanage she and Selina were raised in. After being attacked by Holly Robinson, Batman is rescued by Catwoman.\n\nBruce proposes to Selina in ''Batman'' #24.<ref>''Batman'' #24 (August 2017)</ref> In issue #32, Selina asks Bruce to propose to her again, to which she says, \"Yes\".<ref name=\"Batman #32 December 2017\">''Batman'' #32 (December 2017)</ref> The two leave Gotham for Khadym, where Holly Robinson has fled to, to clear Selina's name.\n\n''Batman Annual'' vol. 3, #2 (January 2018) centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years. Bruce receives a terminal medical diagnosis, and Selina cares for him until his death.<ref>''Batman'' vol. 3, #32 (December 2017)</ref>\n\nAfter calling off her engagement to Batman, Selina leaves Gotham and starts a new life in the California city of Villa Hermosa (''Catwoman'' vol. 5, #1). She faces opposition from the power-hungry Creel family who run Villa Hermosa, specifically First Lady Raina Creel.\n\n==Romantic relationships==\n\n===Batman===\nAlthough Catwoman has been historically portrayed as a supervillain, [[Batman]] and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are frequently depicted as having a romantic relationship. Batman has had many romantic relationships with female characters throughout the years, but while these relationships tend to be short in duration, Batman's attraction to Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear.\n\nIn an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as \"Bruce\". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.\n\nBruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (out of costume) develop a relationship during ''The Long Halloween''. The story sees Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while.\n\nWhen the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, ''Hush'' sees Batman and Catwoman teaming up as allies against the entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]] and rekindling their romantic relationship. In ''Hush'', Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.\n\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211). They have a daughter named [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]]) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.\n\nBatman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on top of a building in ''Catwoman'' vol. 4, #1 (Sept. 2011), and the same issue implies that the two have an ongoing sexual relationship.<ref name=\"Catwoman #1 September 2011\"/>\n\nFollowing the ''DC Rebirth'' continuity reboot, the two once again have a sexual encounter on a rooftop in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #14 (2017).<ref>''Batman'' vol. 3, #14 (March 2017)</ref> In the third volume of ''Batman'', Selina and Bruce are in a romantic relationship, and flashbacks to the past reveal their history together. Bruce proposes to Selina in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #32 (2017), to which she says, \"Yes\".<ref name=\"Batman #32 December 2017\"/>\n\n===Other===\nPrior to the ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' reboot, Selina had a relationship with Slam Bradley Jr., and she named him as the father of her daughter Helena. However, the father may still have been Batman.\n\nIn February 2015, a storyline by writer [[Genevieve Valentine]] shows Selina kissing fellow Catwoman Eiko Hasigawa.<ref name=ValentineCatwoman39>{{cite web|last1=Valentine|first1=Genevieve|title=Catwoman #39: \"Better Than He Does Himself\"|url=http://www.genevievevalentine.com/2015/02/catwoman-39-better-than-he-does-himself/|website=GeneveiveValentine|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Weapons===\nDuring the Silver Age, Catwoman, like most ''Batman'' villains, used a variety of themed weapons, vehicles, and equipment, such as a custom cat-themed car called the \"Cat-illac\". This usage also appeared in the 1960s ''Batman'' television series. In her post-''Crisis'' appearances, Catwoman's favored weapon is a whip. She wields both a standard bullwhip and the cat o' nine tails with expert proficiency. She uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use, and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation. She can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her. Catwoman uses [[caltrop]]s as an anti-personnel weapon and [[bolas]] to entangle opponents at a distance.\n\nCatwoman has also been shown to have various items to restrain her victims, such as rope for binding hands and feet, and a roll of [[duct tape]] used to gag her targets, as she has done with various victims during her robberies over the years. Often, especially in the TV series, she uses sleeping gas or knockout darts to subdue victims. Catwoman's attractiveness and feminine wiles have also allowed her to take advantage of male opponents.\n\n[[File:Catwoman-ninelives-tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Catwoman: Nine Lives of a Feline Fatale'' (2003), showing Catwoman's various costumes throughout the years. Art by Brian Bolland.]]\n\n===Costume===\nCatwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all. It was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a [[catsuit]] with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask.\n\nIn the 1960s, Catwoman's catsuit was green, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a mostly purple, skintight catsuit before switching to a black catsuit similar to [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s costume in ''Batman Returns'', except not stitched together.\n\nIn recent years, artists have typically depicted Catwoman in some variation of a tight, black bodysuit. Ed Brubaker, the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic leather catsuit in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' television series.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Man Behind The Cat \u2013 Exclusive Interview with Ed Brubaker | url=http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html | accessdate=June 10, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528170818/http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html|archivedate=May 28, 2005}}</ref> It has a more high tech look, with domino-shaped [[Thermography|infrared goggles]] on her cowl. Many of her costumes have incorporated retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and sometimes on the toes of her boots. On rare occasions, she has also sported a cat's tail.\n\nOn May 21, 2018, DC Comics unveiled Selina's revamped Catwoman costume designed by comic book writer and artist [[Jo\u00eblle Jones]].

As they fight together, Batman finds that Selina's selfless love for him allows him to control his thirst for blood that had begun to consume him. She sacrifices herself to save him from the Joker, who had become the leader of the remaining vampires after Dracula's death, taking a crossbow bolt to the heart that the Joker had fired at Batman. Batman's grief and rage over her death causes him to finally lose control of his bloodlust as he drinks the Joker's blood.

{"title_page": "Riddles (Arabic)", "text_new": "{{Arab culture}}\n\n'''Riddles''' are historically a significant genre of Arabic verse, and extensive scholarly collections have also been made of riddles in oral circulation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Analysis of this literary form has, however, been neglected by modern scholars.<ref>Cf. A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), 14-18.</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nRiddles are known in Arabic principally as ''lughz'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u064f\u063a\u0632}}) (pl. ''algh\u0101z'' \u0623\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0632), but other terms include ''u\u1e25jiyya'' (pl. ''a\u1e25\u0101j\u012b''), and ''ta'miya''.<ref>G. J. H. van Gelder, 'lughz', in ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 479.</ref> The term ''mu\u2018amm\u0101'' (literally 'blinded' or 'obscured') is sometimes used as a synonym for ''lughz'' (or to denote cryptography or codes more generally), but it can be used specifically to denote a riddle which is solved 'by combining the constituent letters of the word or name to be found'.<ref>G. J. H. van Gelder, 'mu\u2018amm\u0101', in ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 534.</ref>\n\n''Lughz'' is a capacious term.<ref>Smoor, Pieter, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312, https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref> As [[al-Nuwayri|al-Nuwayr\u012b]] (1272\u20131332) puts it in the chapter on ''algh\u0101z'' and ''a\u1e25\u0101j\u012b'' in his ''Nih\u0101yat al-arab f\u012b fun\u016bn al-adab'':\n<blockquote>''Lughz'' is thought to derive from the phrase ''alghaza \u2019l-yarb\u016b\u2018u wa-laghaza'', which described the action of a field rat when it burrows its way first straight ahead but then veers off to the left or right in order to more successfully elude its enemies (''li-yuw\u0101riya bi-dh\u0101lika'') so that it becomes, as it were, almost invisible (''wa-yu\u2018ammiya \u2018al\u0101 \u1e6d\u0101libih\u012b''). But in fact our language also has many other names of ''lughz'' such as ''mu\u2019\u0101y\u0101h'', ''\u2019aw\u012b\u1e63'', ''ramz'', ''mu\u1e25\u0101g\u0101h'', ''aby\u0101t al-ma\u2019\u0101n\u012b'', ''mal\u0101\u1e25in'', ''marm\u016bs'', ''ta\u2019w\u012bl'', ''kin\u0101yah'', ''ta\u2018r\u012bd'', ''ish\u0101rah'', ''tawg\u012bh'', ''mu\u2018amm\u0101'', ''mumaththal''. Although each of these terms is used more or less interchangeably for ''lughz'', the very fact that there are so many of them is indicative of the varied explanations which the concept of ''lughz'' can apparently support.<ref>Smoor, Pieter, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312 (pp. 283--84), https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref></blockquote>\nThis array of terms goes beyond those covered by ''riddle'' in English, into metaphor, ambiguity, and punning, indicating the fuzzy boundaries of the concept of the riddle in literary Arabic culture.<ref>Smoor, Pieter, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312 (p. 284), https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref>\n\n==Literary riddles==\n\nAs of 2011, 'the emergence of the Arabic literary riddle needs yet to be studied'.<ref>Nefeli Papoutsakis, ''Desert Travel as a Form of Boasting: A Study of D\u0332\u016b r-Rumma's Poetry'', Arabische Studien, 4 (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2009), p. 19; cf. the 2011 article Nefeli Papoutsakis, 'Dh\u016b l-Rumma', in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Islam, THREE'', ed. by Kate Fleet and others (Leiden: Brilll, 2007-), s.v.

J. H. van Gelder, 'lughz', in ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 479.</ref>\n\nAccording to Pieter Smoor, discussing a range of ninth- to eleventh-century poets,\n<blockquote>There is a slow but discernable development which can be traced in the Arabic riddle poem through the course of time. The earlier poets, like [[Ibn al-R\u016bmi]], [[al-Sar\u012b al-Raff\u0101\u2019]] and [[Mutanabb\u012b]] composed riddle poems of the 'narrow' kind, i.e. without the use of helpful homonyms ... [[Al-Ma\u02bfarri|Abu \u2019l-\u2018Al\u0101\u2019]]'s practise, however, tended toward the reverse: in his work 'narrow' riddles have become comparatively rare ... while homonymous riddles are quite common.<ref>Pieter Smoor, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312 (p. 309), https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref></blockquote>\nSince early Arabic poetry often features rich, metaphorical description, and [[ekphrasis]], there is a natural overlap in style and approach between poetry generally and riddles specifically;<ref>G. J. H. van Gelder, 'lughz', in ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 479.</ref> literary riddles are therefore often a subset of the descriptive poetic form known as ''[[wasf]]''.<ref>Yaron Klein, '[https://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/1908119921/fmt/ai/rep/SPDF?_s=RxG5PtSCvik4ZQCyvhpiTnhWIHE%3D]' (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 2009), p. 83.</ref>\n\n===Pre-Abbasid (pre-750 CE)===\n\nThere is little evidence for Arabic riddling in the pre-Islamic period.

[[Ibn Qutaybah]] compiled a good volume on this, and others compiled similar works. They called this kind [of poetry] ''aby\u0101t al-ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b'' because it requires someone to ask about their meaning and they are not comprehended on first consideration.

Several members have gone on to supporting roles in other comics series. [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] filled a pivotal role in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' and is the mother of [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Daniel Hall]]. [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], Nuklon (as [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]]), [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] (as [[Doctor Fate]]), and [[Power Girl]] eventually joined the 21st century incarnation of the JSA.\n\nOriginally, the series took place on the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] of [[Earth-Two]], but in [[1986 in comics|1986]] it was merged with the rest of DC continuity following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. From then on, they shared their spot as Los Angeles' superteam with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and were involved in a crossover with the [[Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]].\n\n==Fictional team biography==\n{{Cleanup-tense|section|date=December 2008}}\n\n===''Infinity, Inc.'' (vol. 1, 1984\u20131988)===\n\n====Formation====\nHector Hall, Lyta Trevor, Norda Cantrell, and Albert Rothstein decide to adopt identities of their own and apply for membership in the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/infinity.htm |title=Infinity, Inc.}}</ref> The four of them adopt the codenames of [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]], [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]], [[Northwind (comics)|Northwind]], and [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]] respectively. They are turned down but, not willing to give up, they apply again with [[Jade (comics)|Jennie-Lynn Hayden]] and [[Obsidian (comics)|Todd Rice]]; these two suspect they are [[Alan Scott]]'s children (revealed as true in ''Infinity Inc. Annual'' #1). Taking pity on the youngsters, [[Star-Spangled Kid]] decides to leave the JSA to create a new group, and they are joined by [[Power Girl]], the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]], and [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave, Jr.]]. They call themselves \"Infinity, Inc.\"<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #1 (March 1984)</ref>\n\nThe team first faces the Justice Society of America, turned evil by the Stream of Ruthlessness, thanks to the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. They defeat the JSA and the Ultra-Humanite and save the world.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #2\u201311 (May 1984 \u2013 February 1985)</ref> In a press conference (to garner media attention for the new team), the team publicly divulge their secret identities, revealing those of their parents in the process, and Hector also announces his engagement to Lyta. The Star-Spangled Kid is able to form a partnership with the city of [[Los Angeles]] to commission his team as for-hire protectors and purchases Stellar Studios to revitalize its production of movies.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #12 (March 1985)</ref>\n\n====Helix====\nFury is kidnapped in an extortion attempt by the villains known as Helix, all products of invitro genetic manipulation by the mad scientist Doctor Love. The original members are Arak the Wind-walker, Baby Boom, Kritter, [[Mister Bones]], Penny Dreadful, and Tao Jones. They are defeated by the Infinitors, but manage to escape.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #16\u201318 (July \u2013 September 1985)</ref>\n\nLater, the second [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], [[Yolanda Montez]], learns that she is a cousin of new Helix member Carcharo and that they are products of the same genetic experiments as Helix. The two teams battle to a stalemate; Mister Bones is arrested, but the others escape.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #25\u201329 (April \u2013 August 1986)</ref>\n\n====Crisis on Infinite Earths====\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\nThe teams are involved within the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] event, which ultimately results in three new superheroes \u2014 [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez]] as Wildcat, [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler]] as Hourman, and [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel]] as Dr. Midnight \u2014 who all join Infinity, Inc.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #31 (October 1986)</ref> The Crisis had severe changes for three members of the team. The Justice Society, who are written out of the DC universe proper by editorial decision and are exiled into a dimension where they constantly fight against the tide of [[Ragnarok]].<ref>''The Last Days of the Justice Society'' (1986)</ref>\n\n====The Silver Scarab saga====\nEven with all of his friends at Infinity, Inc., Hector Hall leaves the group after a fall-out with Lyta, following shortly after the team learns that the Justice Society is seemingly gone. The other members go around notifying the wives and other related characters of the Society of the JSA's disappearance.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #30 (September 1986)</ref> A certain Professor James Rock has also contacted Hector, but the real James Rock is supposed to be long dead. Travelling to Hall Mansion, Northwind means to confront Hector, only to find him already under Hath-Set's manipulations (Hath-Set has been reincarnated as a female Dr. Hastor and used the alias of Professor James Rock).<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #37 (April 1987)</ref>\n\nHector goes on to kidnap Fury, and he and Hath-Set uncover the Eye of Ra, a powerful and ancient weapon. Northwind returns and leads Infinity, Inc. into a final confrontation with the Silver Scarab at Hall Mansion, which, when burned down, reveals a topless pyramid inside. While Northwind confronts the Silver Scarab in a duel, Nuklon saves Fury.\n\nThe Eye of Ra denies the Silver Scarab control and flies away. The Silver Scarab is not pure enough in the eyes of Seketh the Egyptian god of Death, for the pureness of Hector's heart still lives on in his unborn child with Lyta. Therefore, he is not fully cleansed of his goodness and the Silver Scarab is thrown away by the Eye's power, the armor of [[Nth Metal]] an empty shell. Northwind is able to close the Eye of Ra, while Hath-Set escapes. Infinity, Inc. mourn the loss of Hector, and Northwind and Fury leave the team after his funeral.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #42\u201344 (September \u2013 November 1987)</ref>\n\nA very pregnant Lyta goes home to spend time with her parents. When Nuklon goes to visit her (and profess his love for her), she tells him she isn't over Hector yet and that she only has friendly feelings for him. Disappointed, he discovers that there is a prowler sneaking around the property peeking in on Lyta. Nuklon captures him and discovers him to be Hector Hall, the new Sandman. Hector reveals that his spirit wound up in the dream dimension after the scarab ejected it from his body. The former Sandman Garrett Sanford had died after years of service and his assistants Brute and Glob conscripted Hector to replace him. They put Hector into Garrett's body and gave him a new life. He can only come out of the dream stream for one hour a day, but it's enough for him and Lyta to rekindle their relationship.\n\n====Death in the Family====\nDuring the wedding of Hector and Lyta Trevor-Hall, [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]] (Marcie Cooper) uses deception to have Bones and Skyman meet at [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy's]] room.\n\nShe then deceives Solomon Grundy into grabbing Bones' arm and using him to kill Skyman with his [[cyanide]] touch. Upset, Bones leaves and Infinity, Inc. finds him with Helix. Dr. Love had gained control of Helix and orders them to kill Bones. Helix turns on Love, killing him instead. Helix then leaves in disgust, telling Bones he is no longer one of them. The Infinitors, though, granted Bones full membership in the team. Afterwards, the Infinitors decide to continue on in Skyman's memory, but apparently decided to disband some time after anyway.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #51\u201353 (June \u2013 August 1988)</ref>\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\nA post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' version of the original Infinity, Inc. appeared in ''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1 in 2008, and is known as the ''Justice Society Infinity'' after it merged with its world's Justice Society of America. The Earth-2 versions of Silver Scarab, Fury, [[Jade (comics)|Jade]], and Northwind are members, but their Superman is missing, their Flash is retired and their [[Green Lantern]] (Alan Scott) is dead.<ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=137685|title=''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1}}</ref>\n\n===JSA: Black Reign===\nThe closest that Infinity, Inc. has come to reforming is when Brainwave (under Mr. Mind's thrall), Atom Smasher, and Northwind, along with [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]] and [[Eclipso]] (who at the time was being controlled by the cousin of the second Wildcat), were [[Black Adam]]'s army in Khandaq.

The therapy spawned six perfect specimens, to whom Luthor gave the identities purchased from the Pemberton Estate. Calling his new dream-team \"Infinity Inc.\", he created Starlight ([[Natasha Irons#Starlight|Natasha Irons]], the team's leader), a new [[Nuklon]], a male [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]], a new [[Skyman]], the shapeshifting [[Everyman (DC Comics)|Everyman]], and the rebellious speedster Trajectory.<ref>''52'' Week 21 (September 27, 2006)</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to the team, Luthor is able to \"shut off\" any of the team's powers at any time as he does to Trajectory during a battle, causing her death.

Luthor severely injures Irons and impales him with his own hammer before Natasha is able to destroy Lex's exo-gene with an electromagnetic pulse from Steel's hammer, allowing him to be easily knocked out.

The book was written by [[Peter Milligan]] with art by Max Fiumara.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=DC NATION PANEL FROM WW:LA \n |publisher=[[Newsarama]] \n |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423 \n |date=2007-03-16 \n |accessdate=2007-03-18 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320015505/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423 \n |archivedate=2007-03-20 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nThe first issues focuses on Natasha Irons (formerly Starlight), Erik Strom (formerly Fury), and Gerome McKenna (formerly Nuklon), a year after the end of the Everyman Project.  Natasha is living with her uncle John Henry Irons and is in [[psychotherapy]] along with Erik, who refers to it as \"our national religion\" and Gerome. Another longtime patient, teenager Dale Smith, attacks his therapist and realizes his powers as a [[Energy vampire|psychic vampire]]. Smith takes the name \"Kid Empty\". Apparently, a side effect of the exogene therapy is that once the exogene itself is suppressed, the energies unleashed by the therapy remains, re-enabling the metagene in a different fashion.  As a result, Natasha finds herself turning to a mist-like substance, McKenna gains the ability to duplicate himself, and Strom gains a powerhouse, overconfident, female alter-ego. The group gain new members in [[Mercy Graves]] and Lucia, an Everyman subject who can psychically inflict pain on others. In #8, the team gains official costumes and codenames, and go on their first mission.\n\nIn issue #10, Mercy admits she is not ready to be on a team, and leaves.  Issue #11 begins a two issue arc that ties into the [[Dark Side Club]].\n\n[[Desaad]], under the false identity of \"Doctor Bud Fogel\", secretly manipulates McKenna (now using the codename of \"Double Trouble\") by nurturing a third personality created from McKenna's base and repressed instincts, and promising it the opportunity to take full control.\n\nWhen the splintered McKenna personality is able to wrest control over the main body (as shown when McKenna's main personality is transported in Desaad's labs, while his duplicate attempts to force himself on Lucia), the Infinitors try to stop him.\n\nHowever, the plan is revealed to be a trap. The duplicate fatally wounds McKenna in the hopes of possessing his body, but disappears with McKenna's weakening. The other subjects are trapped in a machine designed to take away the powers of the remaining Everymen without activating their metagene. Desaad admits he was forced to this course of action because the Everymen, even after turning into metahumans, are undetectable from Darkseid's minions, and they could be a wild card during the planned ''[[Final Crisis]]''.\n\nAs a side effect of the machine, the Infinitors vanish. Steel, who arrives too late, swears he will resume his search for Natasha.\n\nThey have recently reappeared briefly in the third issue of the ''Terror Titans'' mini-series imprisoned by Desaad. Towards the end of the miniseries, an undercover [[Miss Martian]] tips Irons off about their imprisonment in the Terror Titans' headquarters, leading to their release.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Membership ==\n\n=== ''Infinity Inc.'' ===\n\n==== Founding members ====\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n==== Proposed members ====\n[[File:IIHarlequin.png|150px|thumb|right|Gay male Harlequin from the original Infinity, Inc. pitch.]]\nIn the original pitch for the Infinity, Inc. series, creators [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jerry Ordway]] had planned on using a young [[homosexual|gay]] male as a new Harlequin.\n\nIn an interview with ''Alter Ego'', Ordway explains: ''\"Northwind is shown\u2014but at his side (see P. 33) is a new, young, male Harlequin, who Jerry's notes suggest might become \"comics' first gay character. Or we could just assume it.\" Not a bad idea, and maybe we should have played it that way; but we were already going to have two Green Lantern-derived heroes in Infinity, Inc.\"''\n\n[[File:LaGarro.jpg|thumb|left|La Garro appearing alongside the founding Infinitors in a promotion for ''Infinity, Inc.'' from ''All-Star Squadron'' #28.]]\nIn promotional material appearing in ''All-Star Squadron'' #28, a [[Catwoman]]-like figure, riding what is referred to as a cat-cycle, appears alongside the Infinity, Inc. group. A caption refers to her as \"La Garro\". She, however, never appears in any of the team's adventures, or its comics under this name. She was later developed into the future Infinitor, the second [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)]].\n\n[[Sandy Hawkins]] aka Sandy the Golden Boy, sidekick to the [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)]], is also referred to as a member, but does not end up being a member of the team. Roy Thomas briefly toyed with the idea of giving the character super-powers based on Sandy's time as a sand-monster but this was dropped because Thomas and others felt he could have ended up as the DC equivalent to Marvel's Sandman. This had the potential to further confuse a situation that had been a minor irritant between DC and Marvel from time to time. It was ultimately decided that with the cast as large as it had become Sandy was one of the characters that could be dropped.\n\n=== ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' ===\nAfter the events of the Crisis, the [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman no longer existed. This affected three Infinitors directly:\n\n* [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] remained in Infinity Inc., but was [[retcon]]ned into being the birth daughter of 'the Golden Age Fury' (a character created for the purpose of the retcon) and being raised by the 1940s heroine [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]].\n* [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|The Huntress]] was killed in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 and was retconned out of existence. Post-Crisis, a new Huntress appeared with no direct connection to the Batman. Her new origin was considered too different for her to have been an Infinitor, and she is no longer considered to have been a member.\n* [[Power Girl]]'s origin was [[retcon]]ned so that she was now the granddaughter of the [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] mage [[Arion (comics)|Arion]] and was sent into the future. She is still considered to have been an Infinitor, and  her initial origin as a Kryptonian from the alternate reality of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] and the cousin of the [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] has been restored.<ref>''JSA: Classified'' #1\u20134</ref>\n\n=== Later members ===\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n=== Allies ===\n* [[Pat Dugan]], formerly the hero Stripesy, acted as team's mechanic.<ref>''Infinity Inc'' (vol. 1) #28</ref>\n* [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], acted as Jade's protector.<ref>''Infinity Inc'' (vol. 1) #36</ref>\n* [[Jonni Thunder]], a female private detective.\n\n=== ''52'' ===\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n== In other media ==\nInfinity, Inc. was first mentioned in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]: [[Young Justice: Outsiders|Outsiders]]'' episode \"Unknown Factors\".

Several members have gone on to supporting roles in other comics series. [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] filled a pivotal role in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' and is the mother of [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Daniel Hall]]. [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], Nuklon (as [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]]), [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] (as [[Doctor Fate]]), and [[Power Girl]] eventually joined the 21st century incarnation of the JSA.\n\nOriginally, the series took place on the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] of [[Earth-Two]], but in [[1986 in comics|1986]] it was merged with the rest of DC continuity following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. From then on, they shared their spot as Los Angeles' superteam with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and were involved in a crossover with the [[Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]].\n\n==Fictional team biography==\n{{Cleanup-tense|section|date=December 2008}}\n\n===''Infinity, Inc.''

Annual'' #1). Taking pity on the youngsters, [[Star-Spangled Kid]] decides to leave the JSA to create a new group, and they are joined by [[Power Girl]], the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]], and [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave, Jr.]]. They call themselves \"Infinity, Inc.\"<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #1 (March 1984)</ref>\n\nThe team first faces the Justice Society of America, turned evil by the Stream of Ruthlessness, thanks to the [[Ultra-Humanite]].

The Star-Spangled Kid is able to form a partnership with the city of [[Los Angeles]] to commission his team as for-hire protectors and purchases Stellar Studios to revitalize its production of movies.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #12 (March 1985)</ref>\n\n====Helix====\nFury is kidnapped in an extortion attempt by the villains known as Helix, all products of invitro genetic manipulation by the mad scientist Doctor Love. The original members are Arak the Wind-walker, Baby Boom, Kritter, [[Mister Bones]], Penny Dreadful, and Tao Jones. They are defeated by the Infinitors, but manage to escape.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #16\u201318 (July \u2013 September 1985)</ref>\n\nLater, the second [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], [[Yolanda Montez]], learns that she is a cousin of new Helix member Carcharo and that they are products of the same genetic experiments as Helix.

Northwind returns and leads Infinity, Inc. into a final confrontation with the Silver Scarab at Hall Mansion, which, when burned down, reveals a topless pyramid inside. While Northwind confronts the Silver Scarab in a duel, Nuklon saves Fury.\n\nThe Eye of Ra denies the Silver Scarab control and flies away. The Silver Scarab is not pure enough in the eyes of Seketh the Egyptian god of Death, for the pureness of Hector's heart still lives on in his unborn child with Lyta. Therefore, he is not fully cleansed of his goodness and the Silver Scarab is thrown away by the Eye's power, the armor of [[Nth Metal]] an empty shell. Northwind is able to close the Eye of Ra, while Hath-Set escapes. Infinity, Inc. mourn the loss of Hector, and Northwind and Fury leave the team after his funeral.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #42\u201344 (September \u2013 November 1987)</ref>\n\nA very pregnant Lyta goes home to spend time with her parents. When Nuklon goes to visit her (and profess his love for her), she tells him she isn't over Hector yet and that she only has friendly feelings for him. Disappointed, he discovers that there is a prowler sneaking around the property peeking in on Lyta. Nuklon captures him and discovers him to be Hector Hall, the new Sandman. Hector reveals that his spirit wound up in the dream dimension after the scarab ejected it from his body. The former Sandman Garrett Sanford had died after years of service and his assistants Brute and Glob conscripted Hector to replace him. They put Hector into Garrett's body and gave him a new life. He can only come out of the dream stream for one hour a day, but it's enough for him and Lyta to rekindle their relationship.\n\n====Death in the Family====\nDuring the wedding of Hector and Lyta Trevor-Hall, [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]] (Marcie Cooper) uses deception to have Bones and Skyman meet at [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy's]] room.\n\nShe then deceives Solomon Grundy into grabbing Bones' arm and using him to kill Skyman with his [[cyanide]] touch. Upset, Bones leaves and Infinity, Inc. finds him with Helix. Dr. Love had gained control of Helix and orders them to kill Bones. Helix turns on Love, killing him instead. Helix then leaves in disgust, telling Bones he is no longer one of them. The Infinitors, though, granted Bones full membership in the team. Afterwards, the Infinitors decide to continue on in Skyman's memory, but apparently decided to disband some time after anyway.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #51\u201353 (June \u2013 August 1988)</ref>\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\nA post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' version of the original Infinity, Inc. appeared in ''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1 in 2008, and is known as the ''Justice Society Infinity'' after it merged with its world's Justice Society of America.

The therapy spawned six perfect specimens, to whom Luthor gave the identities purchased from the Pemberton Estate. Calling his new dream-team \"Infinity Inc.\", he created Starlight ([[Natasha Irons#Starlight|Natasha Irons]], the team's leader), a new [[Nuklon]], a male [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]], a new [[Skyman]], the shapeshifting [[Everyman (DC Comics)|Everyman]], and the rebellious speedster Trajectory.<ref>''52'' Week 21 (September 27, 2006)</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to the team, Luthor is able to \"shut off\" any of the team's powers at any time as he does to Trajectory during a battle, causing her death.

The book was written by [[Peter Milligan]] with art by Max Fiumara.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=DC NATION PANEL FROM WW:LA \n |publisher=[[Newsarama]] \n |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423 \n |date=2007-03-16 \n |accessdate=2007-03-18 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320015505/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423 \n |archivedate=2007-03-20 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nThe first issues focuses on Natasha Irons (formerly Starlight), Erik Strom (formerly Fury), and Gerome McKenna (formerly Nuklon), a year after the end of the Everyman Project.  Natasha is living with her uncle John Henry Irons and is in [[psychotherapy]] along with Erik, who refers to it as \"our national religion\" and Gerome. Another longtime patient, teenager Dale Smith, attacks his therapist and realizes his powers as a [[Energy vampire|psychic vampire]]. Smith takes the name \"Kid Empty\". Apparently, a side effect of the exogene therapy is that once the exogene itself is suppressed, the energies unleashed by the therapy remains, re-enabling the metagene in a different fashion.  As a result, Natasha finds herself turning to a mist-like substance, McKenna gains the ability to duplicate himself, and Strom gains a powerhouse, overconfident, female alter-ego. The group gain new members in [[Mercy Graves]] and Lucia, an Everyman subject who can psychically inflict pain on others. In #8, the team gains official costumes and codenames, and go on their first mission.\n\nIn issue #10, Mercy admits she is not ready to be on a team, and leaves.  Issue #11 begins a two issue arc that ties into the [[Dark Side Club]].\n\n[[Desaad]], under the false identity of \"Doctor Bud Fogel\", secretly manipulates McKenna (now using the codename of \"Double Trouble\") by nurturing a third personality created from McKenna's base and repressed instincts, and promising it the opportunity to take full control.\n\nWhen the splintered McKenna personality is able to wrest control over the main body (as shown when McKenna's main personality is transported in Desaad's labs, while his duplicate attempts to force himself on Lucia), the Infinitors try to stop him.\n\nHowever, the plan is revealed to be a trap. The duplicate fatally wounds McKenna in the hopes of possessing his body, but disappears with McKenna's weakening. The other subjects are trapped in a machine designed to take away the powers of the remaining Everymen without activating their metagene. Desaad admits he was forced to this course of action because the Everymen, even after turning into metahumans, are undetectable from Darkseid's minions, and they could be a wild card during the planned ''[[Final Crisis]]''.\n\nAs a side effect of the machine, the Infinitors vanish. Steel, who arrives too late, swears he will resume his search for Natasha.\n\nThey have recently reappeared briefly in the third issue of the ''Terror Titans'' mini-series imprisoned by Desaad. Towards the end of the miniseries, an undercover [[Miss Martian]] tips Irons off about their imprisonment in the Terror Titans' headquarters, leading to their release.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Membership ==\n\n=== ''Infinity Inc.'' ===\n\n==== Founding members ====\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n==== Proposed members ====\n[[File:IIHarlequin.png|150px|thumb|right|Gay male Harlequin from the original Infinity, Inc. pitch.]]\nIn the original pitch for the Infinity, Inc. series, creators [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jerry Ordway]] had planned on using a young [[homosexual|gay]] male as a new Harlequin.\n\nIn an interview with ''Alter Ego'', Ordway explains: ''\"Northwind is shown\u2014but at his side (see P. 33) is a new, young, male Harlequin, who Jerry's notes suggest might become \"comics' first gay character. Or we could just assume it.\" Not a bad idea, and maybe we should have played it that way; but we were already going to have two Green Lantern-derived heroes in Infinity, Inc.\"''\n\n[[File:LaGarro.jpg|thumb|left|La Garro appearing alongside the founding Infinitors in a promotion for ''Infinity, Inc.'' from ''All-Star Squadron'' #28.]]\nIn promotional material appearing in ''All-Star Squadron'' #28, a [[Catwoman]]-like figure, riding what is referred to as a cat-cycle, appears alongside the Infinity, Inc. group. A caption refers to her as \"La Garro\". She, however, never appears in any of the team's adventures, or its comics under this name. She was later developed into the future Infinitor, the second [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)]].\n\n[[Sandy Hawkins]] aka Sandy the Golden Boy, sidekick to the [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)]], is also referred to as a member, but does not end up being a member of the team. Roy Thomas briefly toyed with the idea of giving the character super-powers based on Sandy's time as a sand-monster but this was dropped because Thomas and others felt he could have ended up as the DC equivalent to Marvel's Sandman. This had the potential to further confuse a situation that had been a minor irritant between DC and Marvel from time to time. It was ultimately decided that with the cast as large as it had become Sandy was one of the characters that could be dropped.\n\n=== ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' ===\nAfter the events of the Crisis, the [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman no longer existed. This affected three Infinitors directly:\n\n* [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] remained in Infinity Inc., but was [[retcon]]ned into being the birth daughter of 'the Golden Age Fury' (a character created for the purpose of the retcon) and being raised by the 1940s heroine [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]].\n* [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|The Huntress]] was killed in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 and was retconned out of existence. Post-Crisis, a new Huntress appeared with no direct connection to the Batman. Her new origin was considered too different for her to have been an Infinitor, and she is no longer considered to have been a member.\n* [[Power Girl]]'s origin was [[retcon]]ned so that she was now the granddaughter of the [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] mage [[Arion (comics)|Arion]] and was sent into the future. She is still considered to have been an Infinitor, and  her initial origin as a Kryptonian from the alternate reality of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] and the cousin of the [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] has been restored.<ref>''JSA: Classified'' #1\u20134</ref>\n\n=== Later members ===\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n=== Allies ===\n* [[Pat Dugan]], formerly the hero Stripesy, acted as team's mechanic.<ref>''Infinity Inc'' (vol. 1) #28</ref>\n* [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], acted as Jade's protector.<ref>''Infinity Inc'' (vol. 1) #36</ref>\n* [[Jonni Thunder]], a female private detective.\n\n=== ''52'' ===\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n== In other media ==\nInfinity, Inc. was first mentioned in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]: [[Young Justice: Outsiders|Outsiders]]'' episode \"Unknown Factors\".
