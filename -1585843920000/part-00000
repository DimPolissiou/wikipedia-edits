Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of [[bison]].\n\nKansas was first settled by [[Americans]] in 1827 with the establishment of [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring [[Missouri]] rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was [[United States territorial acquisitions|acquired by the United States]] as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.\n\nIn 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W. Partin|year=1983|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] became law on May 30, 1854, establishing [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]], and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. [[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]\n\nMissouri and [[Arkansas]] sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]], who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]], these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of [[Bleeding Kansas]].\n\nKansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of \"[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].\n\nAt the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns\".\n\nIn response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Great Plains LCC (14285769265).jpg|thumb|The [[Great Plains]] of Kansas]]\n[[File:Kanopolissp.JPG|thumb|[[Kanopolis State Park]]]]\n[[File:Wabaunsee County View.JPG|thumb|[[Flint Hills]] in Wabaunsee County]]\n\nKansas is bordered by [[Nebraska]] on the north; [[Missouri]] on the east; [[Oklahoma]] on the south; and [[Colorado]] on the west.

A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to [[glaciation]] in the [[Pleistocene]] and is covered by [[glacial drift]] and [[loess]].\n\n===Topography===\n\nThe western two-thirds of the state, lying in the [[Great Plains|great central plain]] of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests. The land gradually rises from east to west; its altitude ranges from {{convert|684|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} along the [[Verdigris River]] at [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] in [[Montgomery County, Kansas|Montgomery County]], to {{convert|4039|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} at [[Mount Sunflower]], {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the Colorado border, in [[Wallace County, Kansas|Wallace County]].

The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a [[humid continental climate]], with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.\n\nThe western third of the state\u2014from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward\u2014has a [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off}} range.\n\nThe far south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.\n\nTemperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\n\nAlthough temperatures of {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and {{convert|114|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.\n\nPrecipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].\n\nKansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name=\"Annual Average Number of Tornadoes\">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953\u20132004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |accessdate = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archivedate = October 16, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]]. Alton and Lebanon are approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} apart.\n\nKansas's record high of {{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}} ties with [[North Dakota]] for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California ({{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Arizona]] ({{convert|128|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Nevada]] ({{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), and [[New Mexico]] ({{convert|122|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Kansas Cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n!

Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\n\nKansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]\u2014the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.\n\nMajor companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Sprint Corporation]] (with world headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita) . Telephone company [[Embarq]] formerly had its national headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] before its acquisition by [[CenturyTel]] in 2009, and still employs several hundred people in [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]].\n\nKansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During WWII, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.\n\n===Taxes===\n\nTax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].\n\nRevenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.\n\nThe state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March\u2013November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as \"[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]\" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax\u2014Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.\n\nAs of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%\u2014above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year; however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.\n\n{{Main|Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117}}\n\nDuring his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor [[Sam Brownback]] called for a complete \"phase out of Kansas's income tax\".<ref name=\"theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017\"/> In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the '''Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117'''.<ref name=\"HB2117\">{{cite web |title = Senate Substitute for HB 2117 by Committee on Taxation\u2014Reduction of income tax rates for individuals and determination of income tax credits; severance tax exemptions; homestead property tax refunds; food sales tax refunds |url = http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |accessdate = October 29, 2014 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002120/http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |archivedate = October 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> Starting in 2013, the \"ambitious tax overhaul\" trimmed income tax, eliminated some corporate taxes, and created [[Flow-through entity|pass-through income]] tax exemptions, he raised the sales tax by one percent to offset the loss to state revenues but that was inadequate.

It was written by Kansan [[Clare Vanderpool]].\n\n[[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] is the setting for a number of science fiction writer [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]]'s novels.\n\n===Film===\n\n{{See also|List of films set in Kansas}}\n[[File:Oldest movie theater in the world - Downtown Ottawa, Kansas.jpg|thumb|The Plaza Cinema in [[Ottawa, Kansas|Ottawa]] is the oldest operating movie theater in the world.]]\n[[File:Fox Theater, Hutchinson, KS.JPG|thumb|Fox Theater, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]]]]\n\nThe first film theater in Kansas was the [[Patee Theater]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]. Most theaters at the time showed films only as part of [[vaudeville]] acts but not as an exclusive and stand alone form of entertainment. Though the [[Patee family]] had been involved in [[vaudeville]], they believed films could carry the evening without other variety acts, but in order to show the films it was necessary for the Patee's to establish a generating plant (back in 1903 Lawrence was not yet fully electrified). The Patee Theater was one of the first of its kind west of the [[Mississippi River]]. The specialized equipment like the [[projector]] came from [[New York City|New York]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butters |first1=Gerald R. |title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915-1966 |publisher=University of Missouri Press}}</ref>\n\nKansas has been the setting of many award-winning and popular American films, as well as being the home of some of the oldest operating cinemas in the world.

However, Topeka was unable to support the team, and it disbanded after one year.\n\nThe first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930 when the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians beat the Independence Producers 13\u20133 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association with 1,500 fans attending the game.

The teams are rivals in the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nBoth KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking second in all-time victories among NCAA programs, behind [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. The Jayhawks have won five national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71\u201358. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.\n\nConversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12\u20131 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11\u20130) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.\n\n[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.\n\n=====NCAA Division II schools=====\n\nNotable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579\u2013301\u201348 overall mark.\n\n[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34\u20130 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.\n\nThe [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.\n\n[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.\n\n=====Junior Colleges=====\n\nThe [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.\n\n====High school====\n\nThe [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).\n\n==Notable people==\n\n{{Main|List of people from Kansas}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n{{Main|List of Kansas landmarks}}\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{portal|Kansas|United States}}\n* [[Index of Kansas-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Kansas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n<!--Note: the section name \"Bibliography\" is linked from other articles, posted in April 2018 by User:Sbmeirow-->\n{{See also|History of Kansas#Bibliography|l1=Longer list of books about the history of Kansas}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1911 to 1925 |date=1956 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212250/ }}; 559 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1886 to 1910 |date=1954 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212249/ }}; 535 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Wilder |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1541 to 1885 |date=1886 |publisher=Kansas Publishing House |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223666}}; 1204 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Connelley |editor-first=William E. |title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company |year=1918 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1918ks/toc.html }}; 5 volumes; 2731 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo00conn/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo02conn/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo03conn/ Vol3]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo04conn/ Vol4]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo05conn/ Vol5]); the 1919 edition contains additional biographies.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William E. |title=History of Kansas Newspapers: A History of the Newspapers and Magazines Published in Kansas from 1854 to 1916 |date=1916 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211020/ }}; 369 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Blackmar |editor-first=Frank W. |title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc |publisher = Standard Publishing Co |year=1912 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1912/ }}; 3 volumes; 2723 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyc01blac/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascycloped02blac/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyclopedia03blac/ Vol3])\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Everts |editor-first=Louis H. |title=Official State Atlas of Kansas |publisher=L.H.

Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of [[bison]].\n\nKansas was first settled by [[Americans]] in 1827 with the establishment of [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring [[Missouri]] rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was [[United States territorial acquisitions|acquired by the United States]] as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.\n\nIn 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W. Partin|year=1983|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] became law on May 30, 1854, establishing [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]], and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. [[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]\n\nMissouri and [[Arkansas]] sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]], who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]], these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of [[Bleeding Kansas]].\n\nKansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of \"[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].\n\nAt the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns\".\n\nIn response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Great Plains LCC (14285769265).jpg|thumb|The [[Great Plains]] of Kansas]]\n[[File:Kanopolissp.JPG|thumb|[[Kanopolis State Park]]]]\n[[File:Wabaunsee County View.JPG|thumb|[[Flint Hills]] in Wabaunsee County]]\n\nKansas is bordered by [[Nebraska]] on the north; [[Missouri]] on the east; [[Oklahoma]] on the south; and [[Colorado]] on the west.

A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to [[glaciation]] in the [[Pleistocene]] and is covered by [[glacial drift]] and [[loess]].\n\n===Topography===\n\nThe western two-thirds of the state, lying in the [[Great Plains|great central plain]] of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests.

Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.\n\nThe western third of the state\u2014from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward\u2014has a [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off}} range.\n\nThe far south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.\n\nTemperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\n\nAlthough temperatures of {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and {{convert|114|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.\n\nPrecipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].\n\nKansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name=\"Annual Average Number of Tornadoes\">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953\u20132004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |accessdate = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archivedate = October 16, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]]. Alton and Lebanon are approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} apart.\n\nKansas's record high of {{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}} ties with [[North Dakota]] for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California ({{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Arizona]] ({{convert|128|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Nevada]] ({{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), and [[New Mexico]] ({{convert|122|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Kansas Cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n!

Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\n\nKansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]\u2014the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.\n\nMajor companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Sprint Corporation]] (with world headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita) . Telephone company [[Embarq]] formerly had its national headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] before its acquisition by [[CenturyTel]] in 2009, and still employs several hundred people in [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]].\n\nKansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During WWII, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.\n\n===Taxes===\n\nTax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].\n\nRevenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.\n\nThe state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March\u2013November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as \"[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]\" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax\u2014Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.\n\nAs of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%\u2014above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year; however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.\n\n{{Main|Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117}}\n\nDuring his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor [[Sam Brownback]] called for a complete \"phase out of Kansas's income tax\".<ref name=\"theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017\"/> In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the '''Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117'''.<ref name=\"HB2117\">{{cite web |title = Senate Substitute for HB 2117 by Committee on Taxation\u2014Reduction of income tax rates for individuals and determination of income tax credits; severance tax exemptions; homestead property tax refunds; food sales tax refunds |url = http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |accessdate = October 29, 2014 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002120/http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |archivedate = October 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> Starting in 2013, the \"ambitious tax overhaul\" trimmed income tax, eliminated some corporate taxes, and created [[Flow-through entity|pass-through income]] tax exemptions, he raised the sales tax by one percent to offset the loss to state revenues but that was inadequate.

The following year the [[Kansas Legislature|Legislature]] enacted the Liquor Control Act which created a system of regulating, licensing, and taxing, and the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) was created to enforce the act. The power to regulate cereal malt beverage remains with the cities and counties. Liquor-by-the-drink did not become legal until passage of an amendment to the state's constitution in 1986 and additional legislation the following year. As of November 2006, Kansas still has 29 [[dry county|dry counties]] and only 17 counties have passed liquor-by-the-drink with no food sales requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcsupplierinfo.htm |title = Liquor Licensee and Supplier Information |publisher = Alcoholic Beverage Control, Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = January 18, 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208194850/http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcsupplierinfo.htm |archivedate = December 8, 2006 }}</ref> Today there are more than 2,600 liquor and 4,000 cereal malt beverage licensees in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ksrevenue.org/abchistory.htm |title = History of Alcoholic Beverages in Kansas |publisher = Alcoholic Beverage Control, Kansas Department of Revenue |year = 2000 |accessdate = January 18, 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070117070410/http://www.ksrevenue.org/abchistory.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\n{{Main|Education in Kansas}}\n\nEducation in Kansas is governed at the primary and secondary school level by the [[Kansas State Board of Education]]. The state's public colleges and universities are supervised by the [[Kansas Board of Regents]].\n\nTwice since 1999 the Board of Education has approved changes in the state science curriculum standards that encouraged the teaching of [[intelligent design]]. Both times, the standards were reversed after changes in the composition of the board in the next election.\n\n==Culture==\n\n[[File:Overland Theater.jpg|thumb|The Rio Theatre, [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]]]\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Main|Music of Kansas}}\n\nThe rock band [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] was formed in the state capital of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], the hometown of several of the band's members.\n\n[[Joe Walsh]], guitarist for the famous rock band the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], was born in Wichita.\n\n[[Danny Carey]], drummer for the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], was raised in Paola.\n\nSingers from Kansas include [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]] native [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Sharon, Kansas|Sharon]] native [[Martina McBride]], [[Chanute, Kansas|Chanute]] native [[Jennifer Knapp]] (whose first album was titled ''[[Kansas (Jennifer Knapp album)|Kansas]]''), [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] native [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]] native [[Jerrod Niemann]].\n\nThe state anthem is the American classic [[Home on the Range]], written by Kansan Brewster Higley. Another song, the official state march adopted by the Kansas Legislature in 1935 is called ''The Kansas March'', which features the lyrics, \"Blue sky above us, silken strands of heat, Rim of the far horizon, where earth and heaven meet, Kansas as a temple, stands in velvet sod, Shrine which the sunshine, sanctifies to God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/kansas-march/19109|title=Kansas March\u2014Kansapedia\u2014Kansas Historical Society|website=www.kshs.org}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n\n{{See also|Kansas Notable Book Awards}}\n\nThe state's most famous appearance in literature was as the home of Dorothy Gale, the main character in the novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (1900). [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]'s ''[[Little House on the Prairie (novel)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', published in 1935, is another well-known tale about Kansas.\n\nKansas was also the setting of the 1965 best-seller ''[[In Cold Blood]]'', described by its author [[Truman Capote]] as a \"nonfiction novel\". Mixing fact and fiction, the book chronicles the events and aftermath of the 1959 murder of a wealthy farmer and his family who lived in the small West Kansas town of [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]] in [[Finney County]].\n\nThe fictional town of [[Smallville]], Kansas is the childhood home of Clark Kent/[[Superman]] in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].\n\nThe winner of the 2011 [[Newbery Medal]] for excellence in children's literature, ''[[Moon Over Manifest]]'', tells the story of a young and adventurous girl named Abilene who is sent to the fictional town of Manifest, Kansas, by her father in the summer of 1936.

Most theaters at the time showed films only as part of [[vaudeville]] acts but not as an exclusive and stand alone form of entertainment. Though the [[Patee family]] had been involved in [[vaudeville]], they believed films could carry the evening without other variety acts, but in order to show the films it was necessary for the Patee's to establish a generating plant (back in 1903 Lawrence was not yet fully electrified). The Patee Theater was one of the first of its kind west of the [[Mississippi River]].

The teams are rivals in the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nBoth KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking second in all-time victories among NCAA programs, behind [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. The Jayhawks have won five national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71\u201358. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.\n\nConversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12\u20131 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11\u20130) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.\n\n[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.\n\n=====NCAA Division II schools=====\n\nNotable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579\u2013301\u201348 overall mark.\n\n[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34\u20130 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.\n\nThe [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.\n\n[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.\n\n=====Junior Colleges=====\n\nThe [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.\n\n====High school====\n\nThe [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).\n\n==Notable people==\n\n{{Main|List of people from Kansas}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n{{Main|List of Kansas landmarks}}\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{portal|Kansas|United States}}\n* [[Index of Kansas-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Kansas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n<!--Note: the section name \"Bibliography\" is linked from other articles, posted in April 2018 by User:Sbmeirow-->\n{{See also|History of Kansas#Bibliography|l1=Longer list of books about the history of Kansas}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1911 to 1925 |date=1956 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212250/ }}; 559 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1886 to 1910 |date=1954 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212249/ }}; 535 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Wilder |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1541 to 1885 |date=1886 |publisher=Kansas Publishing House |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223666}}; 1204 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Connelley |editor-first=William E. |title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company |year=1918 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1918ks/toc.html }}; 5 volumes; 2731 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo00conn/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo02conn/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo03conn/ Vol3]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo04conn/ Vol4]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo05conn/ Vol5]); the 1919 edition contains additional biographies.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William E. |title=History of Kansas Newspapers: A History of the Newspapers and Magazines Published in Kansas from 1854 to 1916 |date=1916 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211020/ }}; 369 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Blackmar |editor-first=Frank W. |title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc |publisher = Standard Publishing Co |year=1912 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1912/ }}; 3 volumes; 2723 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyc01blac/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascycloped02blac/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyclopedia03blac/ Vol3])\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Everts |editor-first=Louis H. |title=Official State Atlas of Kansas |publisher=L.H.

The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Music video==\nDirected by [[Chris Milk]], the award-winning music video for \"Doesn't Remind Me\" starts off with a blurred image of an [[Uncle Sam]] poster tacked to a wall of a young boy's bedroom as he plays with a toy fighter plane. This boy is played by Vinny Intrieri, a six-year-old boxer from [[Philadelphia]], who lives with his mother and sister, known better by his fight name, \"Kid Vicious\". Shot in a documentary-like style, this fictional story explores the world of Vinny's character. Throughout the video, Vinny enjoys playing with military planes and dedicates most of his free time to his boxing training. His obsession with planes becomes clearer when the audience sees a portrait of his father, an Air Force pilot, who died fighting in the [[Iraq War|Iraqi war]]. As a result, his widowed mother has been forced to raise him and his little sister. [[Tom Morello]] said, \"We were all against the war from the very beginning, but now, I think you're seeing more and more that Middle America is turning against the war for reasons that are described in this video. The real human cost, the human tally of this awful war is shown in a very subtle, very real and very humanistic way. That's why it has such a great weight to it, because it personalizes this tragedy that's happening halfway around the world.\"<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|title=MTV News - Audioslave Avoid Being Aerosmith Circa 1987 Thanks To Chris Milk|author=Harris, Chris|publisher=[[MTV]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510932/10052005/audioslave.jhtml|accessdate=May 20, 2007|date=October 5, 2005}}</ref>\n\nAll of Vinny's training has been for an upcoming fight. At one point during his training he runs up the [[Rocky Steps]], imitating [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s famous climb. The music video culminates with a fight between Vinny and another boy in front of a packed crowd. Some of the footage seen is of an actual fight that Vinny fought in at [[The Blue Horizon]]. When the \"junior match\" gets underway, Vinny comes out punching.  Between each of the punches, the video flashes back to images from Vinny's father's death. These images include: his father's fighter plane getting shot down over Iraq, his mother picking up the heart-breaking phone call, and the military funeral ceremony. The entire segment ends with Vinny winning the fight and celebrating with the crowd. The video parallels the song by showing the ways in which people find ways to forget about and move on from bad things.

The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Music video==\nDirected by [[Chris Milk]], the award-winning music video for \"Doesn't Remind Me\" starts off with a blurred image of an [[Uncle Sam]] poster tacked to a wall of a young boy's bedroom as he plays with a toy fighter plane. This boy is played by Vinny Intrieri, a six-year-old boxer from [[Philadelphia]], who live with his mother and sister, known better by his fight name, \"Kid Vicious\". Shot in a documentary-like style, this fictional story explores the world of Vinny's character. Throughout the video, Vinny enjoys playing with military planes and dedicates most of his free time to his boxing training. His obsession with planes becomes clearer when the audience sees a portrait of his father, an Air Force pilot, who died fighting in the [[Iraq War|Iraqi war]]. As a result, his widowed mother has been forced to raise him and his little sister. [[Tom Morello]] said, \"We were all against the war from the very beginning, but now, I think you're seeing more and more that Middle America is turning against the war for reasons that are described in this video. The real human cost, the human tally of this awful war is shown in a very subtle, very real and very humanistic way. That's why it has such a great weight to it, because it personalizes this tragedy that's happening halfway around the world.\"<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|title=MTV News - Audioslave Avoid Being Aerosmith Circa 1987 Thanks To Chris Milk|author=Harris, Chris|publisher=[[MTV]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510932/10052005/audioslave.jhtml|accessdate=May 20, 2007|date=October 5, 2005}}</ref>\n\nAll of Vinny's training has been for an upcoming fight. At one point during his training he runs up the [[Rocky Steps]], imitating [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s famous climb. The music video culminates with a fight between Vinny and another boy in front of a packed crowd. Some of the footage seen is of an actual fight that Vinny fought in at [[The Blue Horizon]]. When the \"junior match\" gets underway, Vinny comes out punching.  Between each of the punches, the video flashes back to images from Vinny's father's death. These images include: his father's fighter plane getting shot down over Iraq, his mother picking up the heart-breaking phone call, and the military funeral ceremony. The entire segment ends with Vinny winning the fight and celebrating with the crowd. The video parallels the song by showing the ways in which people find ways to forget about and move on from bad things.  In this case Vinny leaves behind his toy planes which remind him of his father and boxes to forget about the painful event of his death.\n\n[[Tim Commerford]]'s opinion about the video was, \"I think a lot of other people will cry when they see it, there aren't many videos that can do that to you\u2014and still have a blistering guitar solo and a killer, kick-ass beat...I didn't know Little League boxing existed, and it's real, little kids actually go box and people love it.

The Berlin Crisis started when the [[USSR]] launched an [[ultimatum]] demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in [[West Berlin]]. The crisis culminated in the city's ''de facto'' [[Partition (politics)|partition]] with the [[East Germany|East German]] erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]. \n\nThe [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\u2014the last to be attended by the [[Communist Party of China]]\u2014was held in [[Moscow]] during the crisis.\n\n==Background==\n===Emigration through Berlin \"loophole\"===\n{{Main|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc}}\nAfter the [[Soviet occupations|Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe]] at the end of [[World War II]], some of those living in the newly acquired areas of the [[Eastern Bloc]] aspired to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave.<ref name=\"thackeray188\">{{Harvnb|Thackeray|2004|p=188}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, over 1.5 million people emigrated from Soviet-occupied Eastern European countries to the West, although this figure is disputed.<ref name=\"bocker207\">McAdams 1993, p. 5</ref> Taking advantage of the ability to travel relatively freely into West Germany, the number of Eastern Europeans applying for political asylum in West Germany was 197,000 in 1950, 165,000 in 1951, 182,000 in 1952 and 331,000 in 1953.<ref name=\"loescher60\">{{Harvnb|Loescher|2001|p=60}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement, restricting emigration, was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany.<ref name=\"dowty114\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}</ref> Up until 1953, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places.<ref name=\"dowty121\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=121}}</ref> Consequently, the [[Inner German border]] between the two German states was closed, and a barbed-wire fence erected.

Khrushchev declared that, at the end of that period, the Soviet Union would turn over control of all lines of communication with West Berlin to East Germany, meaning the western powers would have access to West Berlin only when East Germany permitted it. In response, the United States, United Kingdom, and France clearly expressed their strong determination to remain in, and maintain their legal right of free access to, West Berlin.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/berlin.htm|title=Berlin Crisis|last=|first=|date=|website=GlobalSecurity.org|publisher=|access-date=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith tensions mounting, the United States, United Kingdom and France formed a covert group  with orders to plan for an eventual response to any aggression on West Berlin.

They did not come to any major agreements, but this process led to negotiations and to Khrushchev's September 1959 visit to the US, at the end of which he and US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] jointly asserted that general disarmament was of utmost importance and that such issues as that of Berlin \"should be settled, not by the application of force, but by peaceful means through negotiations.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEisenhower and Khrushchev had a few days together at the US presidential retreat [[Camp David]], where they talked frankly with each other. \"There was nothing more inadvisable in this situation,\" said Eisenhower, \"than to talk about ultimatums, since both sides knew very well what would happen if an ultimatum were to be implemented.\" Khrushchev responded that he did not understand how a peace treaty could be regarded by the American people as a \"threat to peace\". Eisenhower admitted that the situation in Berlin was \"abnormal\" and that \"human affairs got very badly tangled at times.\" \n\nKhrushchev came away with the impression that a deal was possible over Berlin, and they agreed to continue the dialogue at a summit in Paris in May 1960. However, the Paris Summit that was to resolve the Berlin question was cancelled in the fallout from [[1960 U-2 incident|Gary Powers's failed U-2 spy flight]] on 1 May 1960.\n\n==Escalation and crisis==\nAt the [[Vienna summit]] on 4 June 1961, tensions rose. Meeting with US President [[John F. Kennedy]], Premier Khrushchev reissued the Soviet ultimatum to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany and thus end the existing four-power agreements guaranteeing American, British, and French rights to access West Berlin and the occupation of East Berlin by Soviet forces.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, this time he did so by issuing a deadline of 31 December 1961. The three powers responded that any unilateral treaty could not affect their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the growing confrontation over the status of Berlin, Kennedy undercut his own bargaining position during his Vienna summit negotiations with Khrushchev in June 1961. Kennedy essentially conveyed US acquiescence to the permanent division of Berlin. This made his later, more assertive public statements less credible to the Soviets.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|p=247}}</ref>\n\nAs the confrontation over Berlin escalated, Kennedy delivered a television speech in Washington on [[Columbia Broadcast System|CBS]], and broadcast nationwide in the US, in which he reiterated that the United States was not looking for a fight and that he recognized the \"Soviet Union's historical concerns about their security in central and eastern Europe.\" He said he was willing to renew talks, but he also announced that he would ask Congress for an additional $3.25 billion for military spending, mostly on conventional weapons. He wanted six new divisions for the Army and two for the Marines, and he announced plans to triple the draft and to call up the reserves. Kennedy proclaimed: \"We seek peace, but we shall not surrender.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=RADIO AND TELEVISION REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE BERLIN CRISIS, JULY 25, 1961 |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/berlin-crisis-19610725 |website=John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum}}</ref>\n\nVacationing in the [[Black Sea]] resort of [[Sochi]], Khrushchev was reported to be angered by Kennedy's speech. [[John Jay McCloy]], Kennedy's disarmament adviser, who happened to be in the Soviet Union, was invited to join Khrushchev. It is reported that Khrushchev explained to McCloy that Kennedy's military build-up threatened war.\n\n==Berlin Wall==\n[[File:Berlin Wall 1961-11-20.jpg|thumb|right|East German construction workers building the Berlin Wall in 1961]]\n\nIn early 1961, the East German government sought a way to stop its population leaving for the West. [[Walter Ulbricht]], First Secretary of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) and [[Staatsrat]] chairman and thus East Germany's chief decision-maker, convinced the Soviet Union that force was necessary to stop this movement, although Berlin's four-power status required the allowance of free travel between zones and forbade the presence of German troops in Berlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe East German government began stockpiling building materials for the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]; this activity was widely known, but only a small circle of Soviet and East German planners believed that East Germans were aware of the purpose.<ref name=\":0\" /> This material included enough barbed wire to enclose the 156 km (97 mi) circumference of West Berlin. The regime managed to avoid suspicion by spreading out the purchases of barbed wire among several East German companies, which in turn spread their orders out among a range of firms in West Germany and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|p=324}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 June 1961, two months before the construction of the Berlin Wall started, Walter Ulbricht stated in an international press conference: \"''Niemand hat die Absicht, eine Mauer zu errichten!''\" (\"No one has the intention to erect a wall\"). It was the first time the term ''Mauer'' (wall) had been used in this context.\n\nOn 4\u20137 August 1961, the foreign ministers of the US, UK, France and West Germany secretly met in Paris to discuss how to respond to the Soviet actions{{explain|reason=what actions?|date=August 2017}} in West Berlin. They expressed a lack of willingness to engage in warfare. Within weeks, the [[KGB]] provided Khrushchev with descriptions of the Paris talks. These showed that US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], unlike the West Germans, supported talks with the Soviet Union, though the KGB and the [[GRU]] warned that the US were being pressured by other members of the alliance to consider [[economic sanctions]] against East Germany and other socialist countries and to move faster on plans for conventional and [[nuclear armament]] of their allies in Western Europe, such as the West German [[Bundeswehr]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.videofact.com/english/cia_kgb.html|title=Spy vs. Spy: The KGB vs. the CIA|last=Zubok|first=Vladislav M.|date=1994|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe West had advance intelligence about the construction of the Wall. On 6 August, a [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection) |HUMINT]] source, a functionary in the SED, provided the 513th Military Intelligence Group (Berlin) with the correct date of the start of construction. At a weekly meeting of the Berlin Watch Committee on 9 August 1961, the Chief of the US [[Military liaison missions|Military Liaison Mission]] to the Commander Group of Soviet Forces Germany predicted the construction of a wall. An [[Signals intelligence | intercept]] of SED communications on the same day informed the West that there were plans to begin blocking all foot traffic between East and West Berlin. The interagency intelligence Watch Committee assessment said that this intercept \"might be the first step in a plan to close the border\", which turned out to be correct.\n\nOn Saturday 12 August 1961, the leaders of East Germany attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in [[D\u00f6llnsee]], in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin, and Walter Ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a Wall.\n\nAt midnight, the army, police, and units of the East German army began to close the border and by morning on Sunday 13 August 1961 the border to West Berlin had been shut. East German troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the barrier to make them impassable to most vehicles, and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the {{convert|156|km|mi|abbr=on}} around the three western sectors and the {{convert|43|km|mi|abbr=on}} which actually divided West and East Berlin. Approximately 32,000 combat and engineer troops were employed for the building of the Wall, after which the Border Police became responsible for manning and improving it. To discourage Western interference and perhaps control potential riots, the Soviet Army was present.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 30 August 1961, in response to moves by the Soviet Union to cut off access to Berlin, President Kennedy ordered 148,000 Guardsmen and Reservists to active duty. In October and November, more [[Air National Guard]] units were mobilised, and 216 aircraft from the tactical fighter units flew to Europe in operation \"Stair Step\", the largest jet deployment in the history of the Air Guard. Most of the mobilised Air Guardsmen remained in the US, while some others had been trained for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons and had to be retrained in Europe for conventional operations.

But on 22 October 1961, just two months after the construction of the Wall, the US Chief of Mission in West Berlin, E. Allan Lightner, was stopped in his car (which had occupation forces license plates) while crossing at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] to go to a theatre in East Berlin. The former Army General [[Lucius D.

While probing in a vehicle clearly identified as belonging to a member of the US Mission in Berlin, Hemsing was stopped by East German police asking to see his passport. Once his identity became clear, US Military Police were rushed in. The Military Police escorted the diplomatic car as it drove into East Berlin and the shocked GDR police got out of the way.  The car continued and the soldiers returned to West Berlin.  A British diplomat \u2014 British cars were not immediately recognisable as belonging to the staff in Berlin \u2014 was stopped the next day and showed his identity card identifying him as a member of the British Military Government in Berlin, infuriating Clay.\n\nUS Commandant General Watson was outraged by the East Berlin police's attempt to control the passage of American military forces. He communicated to the Department of State on 25 October 1961 that Soviet Commandant Colonel Solovyev and his men were not doing their part to avoid disturbing actions during a time of peace negotiations, and demanded that the Soviet authorities take immediate steps to remedy the situation. Solovyev replied by describing American attempts to send armed soldiers across the checkpoint and keeping American tanks at sector boundary as an \"open provocation\" and a direct violation of GDR regulations. He insisted that properly identified American military could cross the sector border without impediments, and were only stopped when their nationality was not immediately clear to guards. Solovyev contended that requesting identifying paperwork from those crossing the border was not unreasonable control; Watson disagreed. In regard to the American military presence on the border, Solovyev warned:<blockquote>I am authorized to state that it is necessary to avoid actions of this kind. Such actions can provoke corresponding actions from our side. ''We have tanks too.'' We hate the idea of carrying out such actions, and are sure that you will re-examine your course.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v14/d192%7cUS|title=Department of State-Office of the Historian-Foreign Relations of The United States-Berlin Crisis-1961\u20131962-Document 192|author=|date=|website=state.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>Perhaps this contributed to Hemsing's decision to make the attempt again: on 27 October 1961, Mr. Hemsing again approached the zonal boundary in a diplomatic vehicle.  But Clay did not know how the Soviets would respond, so just in case, he had sent tanks with an infantry battalion to the nearby [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof]] airfield.  To everyone's relief the same routine was played out as before.  The US Military Police and Jeeps went back to West Berlin, and the tanks waiting behind also went home.\n{{externalimage|align=right|width=200px|image1=\n[https://www.webcitation.org/5ZGMjgJBb US tanks (foreground) face Soviet tanks at Checkpoint Charlie, on 27\u201328 October 1961]|image2=\n[https://www.webcitation.org/5ZGMau22R?url=http://farm1.static.flickr.com/135/345154333_807ba1c967.jpg?v=0 US Tanks facing Soviet Tanks in Berlin 27 October 1961]\n}}\n\nImmediately afterwards, 33 Soviet tanks drove to the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. Curiously, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev claimed in his memoirs that as he understood it, the American tanks had seen the Soviet tanks coming and retreated. Col. Jim Atwood, then Commander of the US Military Mission in West Berlin, disagreed in later statements. As one of the first to spot the tanks when they arrived, Lieutenant Vern Pike was ordered to verify whether they were indeed Soviet tanks.  He and tank driver Sam McCart drove over to East Berlin, where Pike took advantage of a temporary absence of any soldiers near the tanks to climb into one of them.  He came out with definitive evidence that the tanks were Soviet, including a Red Army newspaper.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=470\u2013471}}</ref>\n\nTen of these tanks continued to [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]], and stopped just 50 to 100 metres from the checkpoint on the Soviet side of the sector boundary.  The US tanks turned back towards the checkpoint, stopping an equal distance from it on the American side of the boundary. From 27 October 1961 at 17:00 until 28 October 1961 at about 11:00, the respective troops faced each other.  As per standing orders, both groups of tanks were loaded with live munitions. The alert levels of the US Garrison in West Berlin, then [[NATO]], and finally the US [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) were raised.\n\n[[File:Soviet tanks in Berlin 1961.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks at Checkpoint Charlie, October 27, 1961.]]\n\nIt was at this point that US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] conveyed to General Lucius Clay, the US commanding officer in Berlin, that \"We had long since decided that Berlin is not a vital interest which would warrant determined recourse to force to protect and sustain.\" Clay was convinced that having US tanks use bulldozer mounts to knock down parts of the Wall would have ended the Crisis to the greater advantage of the US and its allies without eliciting a Soviet military response.   Frederick Kempe argues that Rusk's views, and corresponding evidence that the Soviets may have backed down following this action, support a more unfavorable assessment of Kennedy's decisions during the crisis and his willingness to accept the Wall as the best solution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=474\u2013476}}</ref>\n\nWith KGB spy [[Georgi Bolshakov]] serving as the primary channel of communication, Khrushchev and Kennedy agreed to reduce tensions by withdrawing the tanks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref> The Soviet checkpoint had direct communications to [[Anatoly Gribkov|General Anatoly Gribkov]] at the Soviet Army High Command, who in turn was on the phone to Khrushchev. The US checkpoint contained a Military Police officer on the telephone to the HQ of the US Military Mission in Berlin, which in turn was in communication with the White House. Kennedy offered to go easy over Berlin in the future in return for the Soviets removing their tanks first. The Soviets agreed. Kennedy stated concerning the Wall: \"It's not a very nice solution, but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.\"<ref>Gaddis, John Lewis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (2005), p. 115.</ref>\n\nA Soviet tank moved about 5 metres backwards first; then an American tank followed suit.

Gen. Clarke's assessment may have been incomplete, however: Clay's firmness had a great effect on the German population, led by West Berlin Mayor [[Willy Brandt]] and West German [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Beschloss, Michael.

The Berlin Crisis started when the [[USSR]] launched an [[ultimatum]] demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in [[West Berlin]]. The crisis culminated in the city's ''de facto'' [[Partition (politics)|partition]] with the [[East Germany|East German]] erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]. \n\nThe [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\u2014the last to be attended by the [[Communist Party of China]]\u2014was held in [[Moscow]] during the crisis.\n\n==Background==\n===Emigration through Berlin \"loophole\"===\n{{Main|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc}}\nAfter the [[Soviet occupations|Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe]] at the end of [[World War II]], some of those living in the newly acquired areas of the [[Eastern Bloc]] aspired to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave.<ref name=\"thackeray188\">{{Harvnb|Thackeray|2004|p=188}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, over 1.5 million people emigrated from Soviet-occupied Eastern European countries to the West, although this figure is disputed.<ref name=\"bocker207\">McAdams 1993, p. 5</ref> Taking advantage of the ability to travel relatively freely into West Germany, the number of Eastern Europeans applying for political asylum in West Germany was 197,000 in 1950, 165,000 in 1951, 182,000 in 1952 and 331,000 in 1953.<ref name=\"loescher60\">{{Harvnb|Loescher|2001|p=60}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement, restricting emigration, was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany.<ref name=\"dowty114\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}</ref> Up until 1953, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places.<ref name=\"dowty121\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=121}}</ref> Consequently, the [[Inner German border]] between the two German states was closed, and a barbed-wire fence erected.

Khrushchev declared that, at the end of that period, the Soviet Union would turn over control of all lines of communication with West Berlin to East Germany, meaning the western powers would have access to West Berlin only when East Germany permitted it. In response, the United States, United Kingdom, and France clearly expressed their strong determination to remain in, and maintain their legal right of free access to, West Berlin.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/berlin.htm|title=Berlin Crisis|last=|first=|date=|website=GlobalSecurity.org|publisher=|access-date=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith tensions mounting, the United States, United Kingdom and France formed a covert group  with orders to plan for an eventual response to any aggression on West Berlin. The planning group was named [[LIVE OAK]], and staff from the three countries prepared land and air plans to guarantee access to and from West Berlin.<ref name=\"live oak\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_136184.htm|title=Code Name \u2013 LIVE OAK | publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe Soviet Union withdrew its deadline in May 1959, and the foreign ministers of the four countries spent three months meeting. They did not come to any major agreements, but this process led to negotiations and to Khrushchev's September 1959 visit to the US, at the end of which he and US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] jointly asserted that general disarmament was of utmost importance and that such issues as that of Berlin \"should be settled, not by the application of force, but by peaceful means through negotiations.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEisenhower and Khrushchev had a few days together at the US presidential retreat [[Camp David]], where they talked frankly with each other. \"There was nothing more inadvisable in this situation,\" said Eisenhower, \"than to talk about ultimatums, since both sides knew very well what would happen if an ultimatum were to be implemented.\" Khrushchev responded that he did not understand how a peace treaty could be regarded by the American people as a \"threat to peace\". Eisenhower admitted that the situation in Berlin was \"abnormal\" and that \"human affairs got very badly tangled at times.\" \n\nKhrushchev came away with the impression that a deal was possible over Berlin, and they agreed to continue the dialogue at a summit in Paris in May 1960. However, the Paris Summit that was to resolve the Berlin question was cancelled in the fallout from [[1960 U-2 incident|Gary Powers's failed U-2 spy flight]] on 1 May 1960.\n\n==Escalation and crisis==\nAt the [[Vienna summit]] on 4 June 1961, tensions rose. Meeting with US President [[John F. Kennedy]], Premier Khrushchev reissued the Soviet ultimatum to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany and thus end the existing four-power agreements guaranteeing American, British, and French rights to access West Berlin and the occupation of East Berlin by Soviet forces.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, this time he did so by issuing a deadline of 31 December 1961. The three powers responded that any unilateral treaty could not affect their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the growing confrontation over the status of Berlin, Kennedy undercut his own bargaining position during his Vienna summit negotiations with Khrushchev in June 1961. Kennedy essentially conveyed US acquiescence to the permanent division of Berlin. This made his later, more assertive public statements less credible to the Soviets.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|p=247}}</ref>\n\nAs the confrontation over Berlin escalated, Kennedy delivered a television speech in Washington on [[Columbia Broadcast System|CBS]], and broadcast nationwide in the US, in which he reiterated that the United States was not looking for a fight and that he recognized the \"Soviet Union's historical concerns about their security in central and eastern Europe.\" He said he was willing to renew talks, but he also announced that he would ask Congress for an additional $3.25 billion for military spending, mostly on conventional weapons. He wanted six new divisions for the Army and two for the Marines, and he announced plans to triple the draft and to call up the reserves. Kennedy proclaimed: \"We seek peace, but we shall not surrender.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=RADIO AND TELEVISION REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE BERLIN CRISIS, JULY 25, 1961 |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/berlin-crisis-19610725 |website=John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum}}</ref>\n\nVacationing in the [[Black Sea]] resort of [[Sochi]], Khrushchev was reported to be angered by Kennedy's speech. [[John Jay McCloy]], Kennedy's disarmament adviser, who happened to be in the Soviet Union, was invited to join Khrushchev. It is reported that Khrushchev explained to McCloy that Kennedy's military build-up threatened war.\n\n==Berlin Wall==\n[[File:Berlin Wall 1961-11-20.jpg|thumb|right|East German construction workers building the Berlin Wall in 1961]]\n\nIn early 1961, the East German government sought a way to stop its population leaving for the West. [[Walter Ulbricht]], First Secretary of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) and [[Staatsrat]] chairman and thus East Germany's chief decision-maker, convinced the Soviet Union that force was necessary to stop this movement, although Berlin's four-power status required the allowance of free travel between zones and forbade the presence of German troops in Berlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe East German government began stockpiling building materials for the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]; this activity was widely known, but only a small circle of Soviet and East German planners believed that East Germans were aware of the purpose.<ref name=\":0\" /> This material included enough barbed wire to enclose the 156 km (97 mi) circumference of West Berlin. The regime managed to avoid suspicion by spreading out the purchases of barbed wire among several East German companies, which in turn spread their orders out among a range of firms in West Germany and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|p=324}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 June 1961, two months before the construction of the Berlin Wall started, Walter Ulbricht stated in an international press conference: \"''Niemand hat die Absicht, eine Mauer zu errichten!''\" (\"No one has the intention to erect a wall\"). It was the first time the term ''Mauer'' (wall) had been used in this context.\n\nOn 4\u20137 August 1961, the foreign ministers of the US, UK, France and West Germany secretly met in Paris to discuss how to respond to the Soviet actions{{explain|reason=what actions?|date=August 2017}} in West Berlin. They expressed a lack of willingness to engage in warfare. Within weeks, the [[KGB]] provided Khrushchev with descriptions of the Paris talks. These showed that US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], unlike the West Germans, supported talks with the Soviet Union, though the KGB and the [[GRU]] warned that the US were being pressured by other members of the alliance to consider [[economic sanctions]] against East Germany and other socialist countries and to move faster on plans for conventional and [[nuclear armament]] of their allies in Western Europe, such as the West German [[Bundeswehr]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.videofact.com/english/cia_kgb.html|title=Spy vs. Spy: The KGB vs. the CIA|last=Zubok|first=Vladislav M.|date=1994|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe West had advance intelligence about the construction of the Wall. On 6 August, a [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection) |HUMINT]] source, a functionary in the SED, provided the 513th Military Intelligence Group (Berlin) with the correct date of the start of construction. At a weekly meeting of the Berlin Watch Committee on 9 August 1961, the Chief of the US [[Military liaison missions|Military Liaison Mission]] to the Commander Group of Soviet Forces Germany predicted the construction of a wall. An [[Signals intelligence | intercept]] of SED communications on the same day informed the West that there were plans to begin blocking all foot traffic between East and West Berlin. The interagency intelligence Watch Committee assessment said that this intercept \"might be the first step in a plan to close the border\", which turned out to be correct.\n\nOn Saturday 12 August 1961, the leaders of East Germany attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in [[D\u00f6llnsee]], in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin, and Walter Ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a Wall.\n\nAt midnight, the army, police, and units of the East German army began to close the border and by morning on Sunday 13 August 1961 the border to West Berlin had been shut. East German troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the barrier to make them impassable to most vehicles, and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the {{convert|156|km|mi|abbr=on}} around the three western sectors and the {{convert|43|km|mi|abbr=on}} which actually divided West and East Berlin. Approximately 32,000 combat and engineer troops were employed for the building of the Wall, after which the Border Police became responsible for manning and improving it. To discourage Western interference and perhaps control potential riots, the Soviet Army was present.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 30 August 1961, in response to moves by the Soviet Union to cut off access to Berlin, President Kennedy ordered 148,000 Guardsmen and Reservists to active duty. In October and November, more [[Air National Guard]] units were mobilised, and 216 aircraft from the tactical fighter units flew to Europe in operation \"Stair Step\", the largest jet deployment in the history of the Air Guard. Most of the mobilised Air Guardsmen remained in the US, while some others had been trained for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons and had to be retrained in Europe for conventional operations. The Air National Guard's ageing [[F-84]]s and [[F-86]]s required spare parts that the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] lacked.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Richard Bach]] wrote his book ''Stranger to the Ground'' centred around his experience as an Air National Guard pilot on this deployment.\n\n==Stand-off between US and Soviet tanks==\n[[File:EUCOM Checkpoint Charlie Standoff 1961.jpg|thumb|right|American tanks face an East German water cannon at [[Checkpoint Charlie]].]] \n\nThe four powers governing Berlin ([[Soviet Union]], United States, United Kingdom, and France) had agreed at the 1945 [[Potsdam Conference]] that Allied personnel could move freely in any sector of Berlin.  But on 22 October 1961, just two months after the construction of the Wall, the US Chief of Mission in West Berlin, E. Allan Lightner, was stopped in his car (which had occupation forces license plates) while crossing at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] to go to a theatre in East Berlin. The former Army General [[Lucius D. Clay]], US President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Special Advisor in West Berlin, decided to demonstrate American resolve. \n\nUS officers of the Berlin garrison drew up a plan to pull down the wire and barricades with bulldozers. This, however, was overruled by the troop commander, Brigadier General. Frederick O. Hartel.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/files/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/1961-berlin-crisis/overview/us-military-response.pdf The U. S.

While probing in a vehicle clearly identified as belonging to a member of the US Mission in Berlin, Hemsing was stopped by East German police asking to see his passport. Once his identity became clear, US Military Police were rushed in. The Military Police escorted the diplomatic car as it drove into East Berlin and the shocked GDR police got out of the way.  The car continued and the soldiers returned to West Berlin.  A British diplomat \u2014 British cars were not immediately recognisable as belonging to the staff in Berlin \u2014 was stopped the next day and showed his identity card identifying him as a member of the British Military Government in Berlin, infuriating Clay.\n\nUS Commandant General Watson was outraged by the East Berlin police's attempt to control the passage of American military forces. He communicated to the Department of State on 25 October 1961 that Soviet Commandant Colonel Solovyev and his men were not doing their part to avoid disturbing actions during a time of peace negotiations, and demanded that the Soviet authorities take immediate steps to remedy the situation. Solovyev replied by describing American attempts to send armed soldiers across the checkpoint and keeping American tanks at sector boundary as an \"open provocation\" and a direct violation of GDR regulations. He insisted that properly identified American military could cross the sector border without impediments, and were only stopped when their nationality was not immediately clear to guards. Solovyev contended that requesting identifying paperwork from those crossing the border was not unreasonable control; Watson disagreed. In regard to the American military presence on the border, Solovyev warned:<blockquote>I am authorized to state that it is necessary to avoid actions of this kind. Such actions can provoke corresponding actions from our side. ''We have tanks too.'' We hate the idea of carrying out such actions, and are sure that you will re-examine your course.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v14/d192%7cUS|title=Department of State-Office of the Historian-Foreign Relations of The United States-Berlin Crisis-1961\u20131962-Document 192|author=|date=|website=state.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>Perhaps this contributed to Hemsing's decision to make the attempt again: on 27 October 1961, Mr. Hemsing again approached the zonal boundary in a diplomatic vehicle.  But Clay did not know how the Soviets would respond, so just in case, he had sent tanks with an infantry battalion to the nearby [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof]] airfield.  To everyone's relief the same routine was played out as before.  The US Military Police and Jeeps went back to West Berlin, and the tanks waiting behind also went home.\n{{externalimage|align=right|width=200px|image1=\n[https://www.webcitation.org/5ZGMjgJBb US tanks (foreground) face Soviet tanks at Checkpoint Charlie, on 27\u201328 October 1961]|image2=\n[https://www.webcitation.org/5ZGMau22R?url=http://farm1.static.flickr.com/135/345154333_807ba1c967.jpg?v=0 US Tanks facing Soviet Tanks in Berlin 27 October 1961]\n}}\n\nImmediately afterwards, 33 Soviet tanks drove to the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. Curiously, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev claimed in his memoirs that as he understood it, the American tanks had seen the Soviet tanks coming and retreated. Col. Jim Atwood, then Commander of the US Military Mission in West Berlin, disagreed in later statements. As one of the first to spot the tanks when they arrived, Lieutenant Vern Pike was ordered to verify whether they were indeed Soviet tanks.  He and tank driver Sam McCart drove over to East Berlin, where Pike took advantage of a temporary absence of any soldiers near the tanks to climb into one of them.  He came out with definitive evidence that the tanks were Soviet, including a Red Army newspaper.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=470\u2013471}}</ref>\n\nTen of these tanks continued to [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]], and stopped just 50 to 100 metres from the checkpoint on the Soviet side of the sector boundary.  The US tanks turned back towards the checkpoint, stopping an equal distance from it on the American side of the boundary. From 27 October 1961 at 17:00 until 28 October 1961 at about 11:00, the respective troops faced each other.  As per standing orders, both groups of tanks were loaded with live munitions. The alert levels of the US Garrison in West Berlin, then [[NATO]], and finally the US [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) were raised.\n\n[[File:Soviet tanks in Berlin 1961.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks at Checkpoint Charlie, October 27, 1961.]]\n\nIt was at this point that US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] conveyed to General Lucius Clay, the US commanding officer in Berlin, that \"We had long since decided that Berlin is not a vital interest which would warrant determined recourse to force to protect and sustain.\" Clay was convinced that having US tanks use bulldozer mounts to knock down parts of the Wall would have ended the Crisis to the greater advantage of the US and its allies without eliciting a Soviet military response.   Frederick Kempe argues that Rusk's views, and corresponding evidence that the Soviets may have backed down following this action, support a more unfavorable assessment of Kennedy's decisions during the crisis and his willingness to accept the Wall as the best solution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=474\u2013476}}</ref>\n\nWith KGB spy [[Georgi Bolshakov]] serving as the primary channel of communication, Khrushchev and Kennedy agreed to reduce tensions by withdrawing the tanks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref> The Soviet checkpoint had direct communications to [[Anatoly Gribkov|General Anatoly Gribkov]] at the Soviet Army High Command, who in turn was on the phone to Khrushchev. The US checkpoint contained a Military Police officer on the telephone to the HQ of the US Military Mission in Berlin, which in turn was in communication with the White House. Kennedy offered to go easy over Berlin in the future in return for the Soviets removing their tanks first. The Soviets agreed. Kennedy stated concerning the Wall: \"It's not a very nice solution, but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.\"<ref>Gaddis, John Lewis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (2005), p. 115.</ref>\n\nA Soviet tank moved about 5 metres backwards first; then an American tank followed suit.  One by one the tanks withdrew.  But General [[Bruce C. Clarke]], then the Commander-in-Chief (CINC) of [[US Army Europe]] (USAREUR), was said to have been concerned about Clay's conduct{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} and Clay returned to the United States in May 1962.  Gen. Clarke's assessment may have been incomplete, however: Clay's firmness had a great effect on the German population, led by West Berlin Mayor [[Willy Brandt]] and West German [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Beschloss, Michael.
