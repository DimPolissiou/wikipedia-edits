In an interview with K Magazine, he said the title was inspired by a quote by [[Harlan Ellison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/spor-releases-new-ep.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808040809/http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/spor-releases-new-ep.html |archivedate= 8 August 2012 }}</ref> The album was well received by drum and bass fans, with two of the tracks from the album (\"Halogen\" and \"Kingdom\") being played on [[Andy C]]'s Nightlife 5 mix CD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/nightlife-5-tracklisting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701022413/http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/nightlife-5-tracklisting.html |archivedate= 1 July 2011 }}</ref> Spor has since then been playing his music at clubs across the world under the Lifted Music guise. Gooch was also involved in a second side project called \"Seventh Stitch\", which produced alternative [[intelligent dance music|IDM]]. Under this alias, he worked with another artist named Andrew Aker on a track entitled \"Oceans\".\n\nGooch also has an [[electro house]] and [[dubstep]] project: '''Feed Me'''. A two-track [[extended play|EP]] titled \"The Spell\" / \"Raw Chicken\" was released under [[deadmau5]]'s label, [[mau5trap]]. Another track, \"Mordez Moi\" was released on [[Noisia]]'s label Division alongside the group's original track \"B.R.U.L.\". He released a second EP under mau5trap on 25 December 2010, titled ''Feed Me's Big Adventure''. It featured eight tracks, including both electro house and dubstep. His third EP of four tracks called ''To the Stars'' was released on 3 June 2011. He released another EP titled ''Feed Me's Escape From Electric Mountain'' on 6 February 2012. It features six tracks, with vocals from [[Hadouken!]] and Lindsay.\n\nOn 20 August 2012, Gooch released a new single titled \"Little Cat Steps\". Soon after, it was revealed he was producing a full-length album. On 28 October, he released another single with folk band [[Crystal Fighters]], titled \"Love Is All I Got\". The EP also features four remixes, including Gooch's \"Matilda\" remix. On 20 December, he stated on [[Twitter]], \"One more single and two B sides, then it's album and tour time.\" The tracks were posted on his [[SoundCloud]], and were titled \"Death by Robot\", \"Dial-Up Days\" and \"Gravel\". The ''Death by Robot'' EP was released on 16 January 2013.\n\nOn 22 May 2013 Gooch released a series of statements on his Twitter informing his fans that, come Autumn, there will be a hiatus in his DJing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inthemix.com/news/feed-me-announces-djing-hiatus-and-makes-tommie-sunshine-grumpy/262|title=Feed Me announces DJing hiatus (and makes Tommie Sunshine grumpy)|publisher=inthemix|date=24 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145510/http://inthemix.com/news/feed-me-announces-djing-hiatus-and-makes-tommie-sunshine-grumpy/262|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He explained to his fans, 'What I really love doing is making music, art, telling stories; being creative. I don't want a situation where this becomes a back seat.' He later tweeted, 'Seems common to assume writing music means wanting to DJ - I started by accident? It's a fun and enriching social experience but not art.' He later confirmed via Facebook that he will resume touring in 2014 after he has spent time creating a short film featuring Feed Me, established his own label, working on artwork for his shows, and writing his next studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/youfeedme/posts/10151642174603361 |title=Feed Me - It's probably worth me clarifying a few things... |website=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nGooch has founded the record label '''Sotto Voce''' to release music under the Feed Me alias as well as provide a platform for new, aspiring artists to release their music.

In an interview with K Magazine, he said the title was inspired by a quote by [[Harlan Ellison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/spor-releases-new-ep.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808040809/http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/spor-releases-new-ep.html |archivedate= 8 August 2012 }}</ref> The album was well received by drum and bass fans, with two of the tracks from the album (\"Halogen\" and \"Kingdom\") being played on [[Andy C]]'s Nightlife 5 mix CD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/nightlife-5-tracklisting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701022413/http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/news/nightlife-5-tracklisting.html |archivedate= 1 July 2011 }}</ref> Spor has since then been playing his music at clubs across the world under the Lifted Music guise. Gooch was also involved in a second side project called \"Seventh Stitch\", which produced alternative [[intelligent dance music|IDM]]. Under this alias, he worked with another artist named Andrew Aker on a track entitled \"Oceans\".\n\nGooch also has an [[electro house]] and [[dubstep]] project: '''Feed Me'''. A two-track [[extended play|EP]] titled \"The Spell\" / \"Raw Chicken\" was released under [[deadmau5]]'s label, [[mau5trap]]. Another track, \"Mordez Moi\" was released on [[Noisia]]'s label Division alongside the group's original track \"B.R.U.L.\". He released a second EP under mau5trap on 25 December 2010, titled ''Feed Me's Big Adventure''. It featured eight tracks, including both electro house and dubstep. His third EP of four tracks called ''To the Stars'' was released on 3 June 2011. He released another EP titled ''Feed Me's Escape From Electric Mountain'' on 6 February 2012. It features six tracks, with vocals from [[Hadouken!]] and Lindsay.\n\nOn 20 August 2012, Gooch released a new single titled \"Little Cat Steps\". Soon after, it was revealed he was producing a full-length album. On 28 October, he released another single with folk band [[Crystal Fighters]], titled \"Love Is All I Got\". The EP also features four remixes, including Gooch's \"Matilda\" remix. On 20 December, he stated on [[Twitter]], \"One more single and two B sides, then it's album and tour time.\" The tracks were posted on his [[SoundCloud]], and were titled \"Death by Robot\", \"Dial-Up Days\" and \"Gravel\". The ''Death by Robot'' EP was released on 16 January 2013.\n\nOn 22 May 2013 Gooch released a series of statements on his Twitter informing his fans that, come Autumn, there will be a hiatus in his DJ-ing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inthemix.com/news/feed-me-announces-djing-hiatus-and-makes-tommie-sunshine-grumpy/262|title=Feed Me announces DJing hiatus (and makes Tommie Sunshine grumpy)|publisher=inthemix|date=24 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145510/http://inthemix.com/news/feed-me-announces-djing-hiatus-and-makes-tommie-sunshine-grumpy/262|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He explained to his fans, 'What I really love doing is making music, art, telling stories; being creative. I don't want a situation where this becomes a back seat.' He later tweeted, 'Seems common to assume writing music means wanting to DJ - I started by accident? It's a fun and enriching social experience but not art.' He later confirmed via Facebook that he will resume touring in 2014 after he has spent time creating a short film featuring Feed Me, established his own label, working on artwork for his shows, and writing his next studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/youfeedme/posts/10151642174603361 |title=Feed Me - It's probably worth me clarifying a few things... |website=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nGooch has founded the record label '''Sotto Voce''' to release music under the Feed Me alias as well as provide a platform for new, aspiring artists to release their music.

In 1979, he began going to nightclub [[Paradise Garage]], where DJ [[Larry Levan]]'s genre-less blend of music appealed to him. This was the club model Tenaglia would one day emulate: Levan's bold style, the venue's plain d\u00e9cor, and the party's warmth and inclusiveness.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nTenaglia left New York in 1985 and started DJing in [[Miami]] as a resident at Cheers nightclub, playing classic New York and Chicago house. He returned to New York five years later. At this time, he started to create some remixes, including [[Right Said Fred]]'s \"[[I'm Too Sexy]]\" (1991), [[Jamiroquai]]'s \"[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]\" (1993), and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]\" (1994).\n\n===DJ career===\nTenaglia's first mainstream success was with a remix of [[The Daou]]'s \"Surrender Yourself\" (1993). The title of his 1995 debut artist album on New York's TRIBAL America/IRS Records described the genre as ''Hard & Soul''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Tenaglia cited his influences ranged from [[Patti LaBelle]] to [[Kraftwerk]], with many lesser-known soul, R&B, Latin, samba and disco artists in between.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nSubsequent to this Tenaglia released three  label compilations - ''Mix This Pussy'' (1994) and ''Can Your Pussy Do The Dog?'' (1995) for TRIBAL, and ''Gag Me with a Tune'' (1996) for Maxi.\n\n===As a producer===\nIn 1996, after working for a short time at the New York nightclub Roxy, Tenaglia started a Saturday night residency at Twilo, a position that brought him some public attention. Contrary to the music popular in New York at the time, Tenaglia was producing the more minimal, tech-y grooves originating in European production studios. This period produced remixes like Grace's \"Not Over Yet\" (1996) and Janet Jackson's \"The Pleasure Principle\" (1996).  In 1998, he moved his residency over to NY club Tunnel.\n\nIn 1998, Danny released another full-length LP titled ''Tourism''.  The album featured the notable track \"Elements\". With his own warped voice providing the narration, \"Elements\" walked the listener through the different components of a dance track in real time, going from kick to drum loop to snare hit, letting each layer over the other until the track exploded with dark, drum-heavy energy.  \"Elements\" was #1 on the Billboard Dance Chart for two weeks in 1998. \"Music is the answer\" featuring Celeda (also on the LP Tourism) was on the top 40 charts in the UK. Next to ostentatious radio anthems, its simplicity was a revelation.\n\nThe release of his first installment in the UK-based Global Underground series of DJ mixes, titled Athens (2000), was well received. Back in New York, Tenaglia grew tired of Tunnel and sought a venue more similar to the Paradise Garage. He landed at Vinyl, a black-walled, single-environment, no-liquor club about one-quarter the size of Tunnel. He named the night \"Be Yourself,\" after the self-affirming, heavy-bottomed vocal track he had recently recorded with Chicago's Celeda.\n\nIn 2000, Tenaglia's annual party during Miami's Winter Music Conference outgrew its home at the cramped Groovejet and moved to just-opened superclub Space. DJ giants like Carl Cox danced on top of the speakers with the Deep Dish boys, Fatboy Slim mingled on the patio, and for a day the ego inherent to DJ culture evaporated: Tenaglia was hailed as the \"DJ's DJ.\" His revamp of Green Velvet's \"Flash\" won \"Best Remix\" at the UK's Muzik Awards, where he was also awarded the \"Best International DJ\" prize.\n\nIn the two years that followed, Tenaglia released another Global Underground installment titled London, remixed Billy Nichols' \"Give Your Body Up To The Music\" (a Garage anthem); got nominated for a Grammy (for his remix of Depeche Mode's \"I Feel Loved,\" also nominated for Best Dance Song) and won a Dancestar Lifetime Achievement award.\n\nIn 2003, Danny came full circle with the release of Choice: A Collection Of Classics, a two-CD mixed compilation that let him pay direct tribute to many of the artists who had influenced his sound and style. It featured artists such as Blaze, Adeva and Imagination, along with his own liner notes explaining the significance of each track. He also remixed another Garage classic (Yoko Ono's \"Walking On Thin Ice,\" which became her first Billboard number one ever), opened another Space during Winter Music Conference (the new location down the block), and took another Dancestar award, this time 'Best Party' for \"Be Yourself.\"\n\n\"Be Yourself\" took the same honor again in 2004, but by this time, Vinyl, now called Arc, had already been sold to condo developers. Danny closed the club on Sunday, April 25, 2004.\n\n=== Current events ===\n\nSince then Tenaglia has remained prolific in the clubs and has played in NYC locations including Avalon, Crobar, Pacha NYC, Roxy and Webster Hall. In 2007, Tenaglia participated in the [[Dance parade]]. After a long studio silence, Danny re-emerged in 2008 with a single on Tommy Boy Records, \"The Space Dance\". It was named in honor of his first weekly residency during the summer season of 2008 at renowned global clubbing institution Space Ibiza.  The track reached number 1 on the Billboard Club Charts during November 2008.\n\nImmediately following that, Tenaglia released his first compilation album in five years, entitled Futurism, also on Tommy Boy Records.  The compilation featured tracks from artists whom Tenaglia had been championing for several years including [[Davide Squillace]], The Wighnomy Brothers and Afefe Iku.  On January 24, 2016, Tenaglia was the closing DJ of another club, Pacha NYC. At the end of his 7-hour set, while taking requests, he made reference to his multiple club-closings, by rejecting some songs by stating that they were already played at the closing of Vinyl / Arc and others.\n\nTenaglia still continues to tour across the world. His commitment to playing new music and incorporating it with music from his past is still a very big part of his performances.\n\n==Awards and nominations ==\n===Grammy Awards===\nIncluded:<ref>{{cite web|title=Awards Winners and Nominees|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards|website=GRAMMY.com|publisher=Grammy Inc|accessdate=13 December 2017|language=en|date=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominated work\n!Category\n!Result\n|-\n| [[44th Grammy Awards|2002]]\n| [[Depeche Mode]]'s \"I Feel Loved\" <ref>{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=CBS|title=Complete List Of Grammy Nominees|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/complete-list-of-grammy-nominees/|accessdate=13 December 2017|work=CBS News|date=4 January 2002|language=en}}</ref>\n| Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\n| {{nom}}\n|}\n\n===DJ Awards===\nThe '''[[DJ Awards]]''' organizes the annual [[electronic music]] DJ awards event it is the only international ceremony for DJs and also the oldest, the awards are held once a year at [[Pacha Group|Pacha]] club in [[Ibiza]] [[Spain]] it is one of the most important accolades an artist can win or be honoured by.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Matthews Paul|first1=James|title=The Annual DJ Awards To Kick Off At Pacha Ibiza This Monday|url=http://www.hitthefloor.com/music/electronic/annual-dj-awards-kick-pacha-ibiza-monday/|website=Hit The Floor|publisher=Hit the Floor On-Line Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nTenaglia has won the ''Best Set of the Season Award'' 2 times and the ''DJ's DJ Award'' 1 time and received 5 nominations overall.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krarup|first1=Lenny|last2=Pascual|first2=Jose|title=DJ Awards Past Winners 1998 TO 2017|url=https://djawards.com/winners/|website=DJ Awards|publisher=DJ Awards SL|accessdate=13 December 2017|location=Ibiza, Spain}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Selected awards\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nominated work\n!Category\n!Result\n|-\n|2000 \n|rowspan=\"1\"|[[DJ Awards]]\n|  Danny Tenaglia\n| DJ's DJ <ref>{{cite web|last1=Karup|first1=Lenny|last2=Pacual|first2=Jose|title=DJ Awards 2000 Winners|url=https://djawards.com/winners/winners-2000/|website=DJ Awards|publisher=DJ Awards SL|accessdate=13 December 2017|location=Ibiza, Spain}}</ref>\n|{{Won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2000\n|rowspan=\"1\"| DJ Awards\n|  Danny Tenaglia\n|Best House DJ <ref>{{cite web|last1=Krarup|first1=Lenny|last2=Pascual|first2=Jose|title=DJ Awards 2000 Past Editions|url=https://djawards.com/past-editions/dj-awards-2000/|website=DJ Awards|publisher=DJ Awards SL|accessdate=13 December 2017|location=Ibiza, Spain}}</ref>\n|{{Nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2001\n|rowspan=\"1\"|DJ Awards\n|Danny Tenaglia\n|Best Set of the Season\n|{{Won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2002\n|rowspan=\"1\"|DJ Awards\n|Danny Tenaglia\n|Best Set of the Season\n|{{Won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2007\n|rowspan=\"1\"|DJ Awards\n|Danny Tenaglia\n|Best Progressive House DJ\n|{{Nom}}\n|-\n|}\n\n===International Dance Music Awards===\n\nTengalia has achieved 3 wins from 15 nominations overall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Music Conference : IDMA Archives Past Winners and Nominees|url=http://wintermusicconference.com/archives/|website=Winter Music Conference|publisher=WMC|accessdate=13 December 2017|location=Miami, USA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201231201/http://www.wintermusicconference.com/archives/|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Selected awards\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nominated work\n!Category\n!Result\n|-\n|2001\n|rowspan=\"1\"|[[IDMA]]\n|Danny Tenaglia\n| Best International DJ <ref>{{cite news|last1=CNN|first1=Cynthia Salinas|title=CNN.com -

In 1979, he began going to nightclub [[Paradise Garage]], where DJ [[Larry Levan]]'s genre-less blend of music appealed to him. This was the club model Tenaglia would one day emulate: Levan's bold style, the venue's plain d\u00e9cor, and the party's warmth and inclusiveness.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nTenaglia left New York in 1985 and started DJ-ing in [[Miami]] as a resident at Cheers nightclub, playing classic New York and Chicago house. He returned to New York five years later. At this time, he started to create some remixes, including [[Right Said Fred]]'s \"[[I'm Too Sexy]]\" (1991), [[Jamiroquai]]'s \"[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]\" (1993), and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]\" (1994).\n\n===DJ career===\nTenaglia's first mainstream success was with a remix of [[The Daou]]'s \"Surrender Yourself\" (1993). The title of his 1995 debut artist album on New York's TRIBAL America/IRS Records described the genre as ''Hard & Soul''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Tenaglia cited his influences ranged from [[Patti LaBelle]] to [[Kraftwerk]], with many lesser-known soul, R&B, Latin, samba and disco artists in between.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nSubsequent to this Tenaglia released three  label compilations - ''Mix This Pussy'' (1994) and ''Can Your Pussy Do The Dog?'' (1995) for TRIBAL, and ''Gag Me with a Tune'' (1996) for Maxi.\n\n===As a producer===\nIn 1996, after working for a short time at the New York nightclub Roxy, Tenaglia started a Saturday night residency at Twilo, a position that brought him some public attention. Contrary to the music popular in New York at the time, Tenaglia was producing the more minimal, tech-y grooves originating in European production studios. This period produced remixes like Grace's \"Not Over Yet\" (1996) and Janet Jackson's \"The Pleasure Principle\" (1996).  In 1998, he moved his residency over to NY club Tunnel.\n\nIn 1998, Danny released another full-length LP titled ''Tourism''.  The album featured the notable track \"Elements\". With his own warped voice providing the narration, \"Elements\" walked the listener through the different components of a dance track in real time, going from kick to drum loop to snare hit, letting each layer over the other until the track exploded with dark, drum-heavy energy.  \"Elements\" was #1 on the Billboard Dance Chart for two weeks in 1998. \"Music is the answer\" featuring Celeda (also on the LP Tourism) was on the top 40 charts in the UK. Next to ostentatious radio anthems, its simplicity was a revelation.\n\nThe release of his first installment in the UK-based Global Underground series of DJ mixes, titled Athens (2000), was well received.

[[Poppet valve|Valve]]s\n}}]]\n\nA '''reciprocating engine''', also often known as a '''piston engine''', is typically a [[heat engine]] (although there are also [[pneumatic motor|pneumatic]] and [[hydraulic motor|hydraulic]] reciprocating engines) that uses one or more [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] [[piston]]s to convert [[pressure]] into a [[Circular motion|rotating motion]]. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the [[internal combustion engine]], used extensively in motor vehicles; the [[steam engine]], the mainstay of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; and the niche application [[Stirling engine]]. Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a [[spark-ignition engine|spark-ignition (SI) engine]], where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a [[compression-ignition engine|compression-ignition (CI) engine]], where the air within the cylinder is compressed, [[Adiabatic process|thus heating it]], so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected [[diesel engine|then]] or [[hot bulb engine|earlier]].<ref name=\"Cengal\" >''Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach'' by Yunus A. Cengal and Michael A. Boles</ref>\n\n==Common features in all types==\nThere may be one or more pistons. Each piston is inside a [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], into which a gas is introduced, either already under pressure (e.g. [[steam engine]]), or heated inside the cylinder either by [[ignition system|ignition]] of a fuel air mixture ([[internal combustion engine]]) or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder ([[Stirling engine]]). The hot gases expand, pushing the piston to the bottom of the cylinder. This position is also known as the Bottom Dead Center (BDC), or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder. The piston is returned to the cylinder top ([[Top dead centre|Top Dead Centre]]) (TDC) by a [[flywheel]], the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or (in a [[Single- and Double-acting cylinder#Double-acting|double acting cylinder]]) by the same process acting on the other side of the piston. This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder. In most types the expanded or \"[[Exhaust gas|exhausted]]\" gases are removed from the cylinder by this [[Stroke (engines)|stroke]]. The exception is the [[Stirling engine]], which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas. The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC, or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction.\n\nIn some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder, in which case it is said to be [[Single- and Double-acting cylinder#Double-acting|double-acting]].\n\n[[Image:Steam engine nomenclature.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Steam piston engine'''<br>A labeled schematic diagram of a typical single-cylinder, simple expansion, double-acting high pressure steam engine. Power takeoff from the engine is by way of a belt.\n{{ordered list\n | Piston\n | Piston rod\n | Crosshead bearing\n | Connecting rod\n | Crank\n | Eccentric valve motion\n | Flywheel\n | Sliding valve\n | Centrifugal governor\n}}]]\n\nIn most types, the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a [[connecting rod]] and a [[crankshaft]] or by a [[swashplate]] or other suitable mechanism. A [[flywheel]] is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle. The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has, generally, the more vibration-free (smoothly) it can operate. The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons' displacement.\n\nA seal must be made between the sliding [[piston]] and the walls of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine. This seal is usually provided by one or more [[piston ring]]s. These are rings made of a hard metal, and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head. The rings fit closely in the groove and press lightly against the cylinder wall to form a seal, and more heavily when higher combustion pressure moves around to their inner surfaces.\n\nIt is common to classify such engines by the number and alignment of cylinders and total volume of [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of gas by the pistons moving in the cylinders usually measured in cubic centimetres (cm\u00b3 or cc) or [[litre]]s (l) or (L) (US: liter). For example, for internal combustion engines, single and two-cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as [[motorcycles]], while [[automobile]]s typically have between four and eight, and [[locomotive]]s, and [[ships]] may have a dozen cylinders or more. Cylinder capacities may range from 10&nbsp;cm\u00b3 or less in model engines up to thousands of liters in ships' engines.<ref>Hanlon, Mike. [http://www.gizmag.com/go/3263/ Most powerful diesel engine in the world] ''GizMag''. Accessed: 14 April 2017.</ref>\n\nThe [[compression ratio]] affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine. It is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder, when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke.\n\nThe [[Stroke ratio|bore/stroke ratio]] is the ratio of the diameter of the piston, or \"bore\", to the length of travel within the cylinder, or  \"stroke\". If this is around 1 the engine is said to be \"square\", if it is greater than 1, i.e. the bore is larger than the stroke, it is \"oversquare\". If it is less than 1, i.e. the stroke is larger than the bore, it is \"undersquare\".\n\nCylinders may be aligned [[Straight engine|in line]], in a [[V engine|V configuration]], [[Flat engine|horizontally opposite]] each other, or [[Radial engine|radially]] around the crankshaft. [[Opposed-piston engine]]s put two pistons working at opposite ends of the same cylinder and this has been extended into triangular arrangements such as the [[Napier Deltic]]. Some designs have set the cylinders in motion around the shaft, such as the [[Rotary engine]].\n\n[[Image:BetaStirlingTG4web.svg|thumb|250px|'''Stirling piston engine''' [[Rhombic drive|Rhombic Drive]] \u2013 Beta Stirling Engine Design, showing the second displacer piston (green) within the cylinder, which shunts the working gas between the hot and cold ends, but produces no power itself.\n{{ordered list\n | {{colorbox|#e47ab0}} Hot cylinder wall\n | {{colorbox|#fefefe}} Cold cylinder wall\n}}{{ordered list\n | start=5\n | {{colorbox|#7ff280}} Displacer piston\n | {{colorbox|#046fe2}} Power piston\n | {{colorbox|#74e0e0}} Flywheels\n}}]]\n\nIn steam engines and internal combustion engines, valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston's cycle. These are worked by cams, eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine. Early designs used the [[D slide valve]] but this has been largely superseded by [[Piston valve]] or [[Poppet valve]] designs. In steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the [[Cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]] and this can often be controlled to adjust the [[torque]] supplied by the engine and improve efficiency. In some steam engines, the action of the valves can be replaced by an [[oscillating cylinder]].\n\nInternal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder. These operations are repeated cyclically  and an engine is said to be [[Two-stroke cycle|2-stroke]], [[Four-stroke cycle|4-stroke]] or [[Six stroke engine|6-stroke]] depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle.\n\nIn some steam engines, the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam. This is then fed through one or more, increasingly larger bore cylinders successively, to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures. These engines are called [[Compound engine]]s.\n\nAside from looking at the power that the engine can produce, the Mean Effective Pressure (MEP), can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size. The mean effective pressure is the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle. This is shown by:\n: W<sub>net</sub> = MEP \u00d7 Piston Area \u00d7 Stroke = MEP \u00d7 Displacement Volume\n\nand therefore:\n: MEP = W<sub>net</sub> / Displacement Volume\n\nWhichever engine with the larger value of MEP produces more net work per cycle and performs more efficiently.<ref name=\"Cengal\" />\n\n==History==\n{{further information|History of the steam engine|History of the internal combustion engine}}\n\nAn early known example of rotary to reciprocating motion is the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] mechanism. The earliest hand-operated cranks appeared in [[China]] during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC\u2013220 AD).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 118\">Needham, Joseph. (1986).

Eventually crank-and-connecting rods were used in the inter-conversion of rotary and reciprocating motion for other applications such as flour-sifting, silk-reeling machines, treadle spinning wheels, and furnace bellows driven either by horses or waterwheels. <ref name=\"Yan\">{{cite book |author=Hong-Sen Yan, Marco Ceccarelli |title=International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dkq6_mdW43IC&pg=PA249&dq=han+dynasty+crank+and+connecting+rod&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6-NWPqbDnAhVPbKwKHcRaBJcQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-9484-2|page=235-249|year=2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 118\" /> Several [[saw mill]]s in [[Roman Asia]] and [[Byzantine Syria]] during the 3rd\u20136th centuries AD had a crank and [[connecting rod]] mechanism which converted the rotary motion of a [[water wheel]] into the linear movement of saw blades.<ref name=\"Tullia et al.

These were followed by the [[Stirling engine]] and [[internal combustion engine]] in the 19th century. Today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of [[petrol]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) or [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) and used to power [[motor vehicle]]s and [[engine power plant]]s.\n\nOne notable reciprocating engine from the World War II Era was the 28-cylinder, {{convert|3500|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]] \"Wasp Major\" radial engine. It powered the last generation of large piston-engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from 1944 onward. It had a total engine capacity of {{convert|71.5|L|cuin|abbr=on}}, and a high power-to-weight ratio.\n\nThe largest reciprocating engine in production at present, but not the largest ever built, is the [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer RTA96-C]]  turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine of 2006 built by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]]. It is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the [[Emma M\u00e6rsk]]. It is five stories high ({{convert|13.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), {{convert|27|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and weighs over {{convert|2,300|metric ton|short ton}} in its largest 14 cylinders version producing more than 84.42&nbsp;MW (114,800&nbsp;bhp). Each cylinder has a capacity of {{convert|1,820|L|cuft|0|abbr=on}}, making a total capacity of {{convert|25,480|L|cuft|0|abbr=on}} for the largest versions.\n\n== Engine capacity ==\nFor piston engines, an engine's capacity is the [[engine displacement]], in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement. It is generally measured in [[litre]]s (l) or cubic inches (c.i.d., cu&nbsp;in, ''or'' in\u00b3) for larger engines, and cubic centimetres (abbreviated cc) for smaller engines. All else being equal, engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly (although this is not true of every Reciprocating engine), although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement.\n\n==Power==\nReciprocating engines can be characterized by their [[power density|specific power]], which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of [[engine displacement]] (in the U.S. also [[horsepower]] per cubic inch). The result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine. This is not to be confused with [[fuel efficiency]], since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio, and thus lower power density. A modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of 75&nbsp;kW/L (1.65&nbsp;hp/in<sup>3</sup>).\n\n==Other modern non-internal combustion types==\nReciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air, steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution-free motive power. Most steam-driven applications use [[steam turbine]]s, which are more efficient than piston engines.\n\nThe French-designed FlowAIR vehicles use compressed air stored in a cylinder to drive a reciprocating engine in a local-pollution-free urban vehicle.<ref>[http://zeropollutionmotors.us/ AIRPod] manufactured by MDI SA. Accessed February 19, 2015</ref>\n\nTorpedoes may use a working gas produced by [[high test peroxide]] or [[Otto fuel II]], which pressurise without combustion. The {{convert|230|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Mark 46 torpedo]], for example, can travel {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} underwater at {{convert|74|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} fuelled by Otto fuel without [[oxidant]].\n\n==Reciprocating quantum heat engine==\n[[Quantum heat engines]] are devices that generate power from heat that flows from a hot to a cold reservoir.\nThe mechanism of operation of the engine can be described by the laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. \n[[Quantum refrigerators]] are devices that consume power with the purpose to pump heat from a cold to a hot reservoir.\n\nIn a reciprocating quantum heat engine, the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or a harmonic oscillator.\nThe [[Carnot cycle]] and [[Otto cycle]] are the ones most studied.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/8/5/083/fulltext/] Irreversible performance of a quantum harmonic heat engine, Rezek and Kosloff, New J.

This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the [[internal combustion engine]], used extensively in motor vehicles; the [[steam engine]], the mainstay of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; and the niche application [[Stirling engine]]. Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a [[spark-ignition engine|spark-ignition (SI) engine]], where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a [[compression-ignition engine|compression-ignition (CI) engine]], where the air within the cylinder is compressed, [[Adiabatic process|thus heating it]], so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected [[diesel engine|then]] or [[hot bulb engine|earlier]].<ref name=\"Cengal\" >''Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach'' by Yunus A. Cengal and Michael A. Boles</ref>\n\n==Common features in all types==\nThere may be one or more pistons. Each piston is inside a [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], into which a gas is introduced, either already under pressure (e.g. [[steam engine]]), or heated inside the cylinder either by [[ignition system|ignition]] of a fuel air mixture ([[internal combustion engine]]) or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder ([[Stirling engine]]). The hot gases expand, pushing the piston to the bottom of the cylinder. This position is also known as the Bottom Dead Center (BDC), or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder. The piston is returned to the cylinder top ([[Top dead centre|Top Dead Centre]]) (TDC) by a [[flywheel]], the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or (in a [[Single- and Double-acting cylinder#Double-acting|double acting cylinder]]) by the same process acting on the other side of the piston. This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder. In most types the expanded or \"[[Exhaust gas|exhausted]]\" gases are removed from the cylinder by this [[Stroke (engines)|stroke]]. The exception is the [[Stirling engine]], which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas. The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC, or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction.\n\nIn some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder, in which case it is said to be [[Single- and Double-acting cylinder#Double-acting|double-acting]].\n\n[[Image:Steam engine nomenclature.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Steam piston engine'''<br>A labeled schematic diagram of a typical single-cylinder, simple expansion, double-acting high pressure steam engine. Power takeoff from the engine is by way of a belt.\n{{ordered list\n | Piston\n | Piston rod\n | Crosshead bearing\n | Connecting rod\n | Crank\n | Eccentric valve motion\n | Flywheel\n | Sliding valve\n | Centrifugal governor\n}}]]\n\nIn most types, the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a [[connecting rod]] and a [[crankshaft]] or by a [[swashplate]] or other suitable mechanism. A [[flywheel]] is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle. The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has, generally, the more vibration-free (smoothly) it can operate. The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons' displacement.\n\nA seal must be made between the sliding [[piston]] and the walls of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine. This seal is usually provided by one or more [[piston ring]]s. These are rings made of a hard metal, and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head. The rings fit closely in the groove and press lightly against the cylinder wall to form a seal, and more heavily when higher combustion pressure moves around to their inner surfaces.\n\nIt is common to classify such engines by the number and alignment of cylinders and total volume of [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of gas by the pistons moving in the cylinders usually measured in cubic centimetres (cm\u00b3 or cc) or [[litre]]s (l) or (L) (US: liter). For example, for internal combustion engines, single and two-cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as [[motorcycles]], while [[automobile]]s typically have between four and eight, and [[locomotive]]s, and [[ships]] may have a dozen cylinders or more. Cylinder capacities may range from 10&nbsp;cm\u00b3 or less in model engines up to thousands of liters in ships' engines.<ref>Hanlon, Mike. [http://www.gizmag.com/go/3263/ Most powerful diesel engine in the world] ''GizMag''. Accessed: 14 April 2017.</ref>\n\nThe [[compression ratio]] affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine. It is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder, when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke.\n\nThe [[Stroke ratio|bore/stroke ratio]] is the ratio of the diameter of the piston, or \"bore\", to the length of travel within the cylinder, or  \"stroke\". If this is around 1 the engine is said to be \"square\", if it is greater than 1, i.e. the bore is larger than the stroke, it is \"oversquare\". If it is less than 1, i.e. the stroke is larger than the bore, it is \"undersquare\".\n\nCylinders may be aligned [[Straight engine|in line]], in a [[V engine|V configuration]], [[Flat engine|horizontally opposite]] each other, or [[Radial engine|radially]] around the crankshaft. [[Opposed-piston engine]]s put two pistons working at opposite ends of the same cylinder and this has been extended into triangular arrangements such as the [[Napier Deltic]]. Some designs have set the cylinders in motion around the shaft, such as the [[Rotary engine]].\n\n[[Image:BetaStirlingTG4web.svg|thumb|250px|'''Stirling piston engine''' [[Rhombic drive|Rhombic Drive]] \u2013 Beta Stirling Engine Design, showing the second displacer piston (green) within the cylinder, which shunts the working gas between the hot and cold ends, but produces no power itself.\n{{ordered list\n | {{colorbox|#e47ab0}} Hot cylinder wall\n | {{colorbox|#fefefe}} Cold cylinder wall\n}}{{ordered list\n | start=5\n | {{colorbox|#7ff280}} Displacer piston\n | {{colorbox|#046fe2}} Power piston\n | {{colorbox|#74e0e0}} Flywheels\n}}]]\n\nIn steam engines and internal combustion engines, valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston's cycle. These are worked by cams, eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine. Early designs used the [[D slide valve]] but this has been largely superseded by [[Piston valve]] or [[Poppet valve]] designs. In steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the [[Cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]] and this can often be controlled to adjust the [[torque]] supplied by the engine and improve efficiency. In some steam engines, the action of the valves can be replaced by an [[oscillating cylinder]].\n\nInternal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder. These operations are repeated cyclically  and an engine is said to be [[Two-stroke cycle|2-stroke]], [[Four-stroke cycle|4-stroke]] or [[Six stroke engine|6-stroke]] depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle.\n\nIn some steam engines, the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam. This is then fed through one or more, increasingly larger bore cylinders successively, to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures. These engines are called [[Compound engine]]s.\n\nAside from looking at the power that the engine can produce, the Mean Effective Pressure (MEP), can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size. The mean effective pressure is the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle. This is shown by:\n: W<sub>net</sub> = MEP \u00d7 Piston Area \u00d7 Stroke = MEP \u00d7 Displacement Volume\n\nand therefore:\n: MEP = W<sub>net</sub> / Displacement Volume\n\nWhichever engine with the larger value of MEP produces more net work per cycle and performs more efficiently.<ref name=\"Cengal\" />\n\n==History==\n{{further information|History of the steam engine|History of the internal combustion engine}}\n\nAn early known example of rotary to reciprocating motion is the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] mechanism. The earliest hand-operated cranks appeared in [[China]] during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC\u2013220 AD).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 118\">Needham, Joseph. (1986).

Eventually crank-and-connecting rods were used in the inter-conversion of rotary and reciprocating motion for other applications such as flour-sifting, silk-reeling machines, treadle spinning wheels, and furnace bellows driven either by horses or waterwheels. <ref name=\"Yan\">{{cite book |author=Hong-Sen Yan, Marco Ceccarelli |title=International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dkq6_mdW43IC&pg=PA249&dq=han+dynasty+crank+and+connecting+rod&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6-NWPqbDnAhVPbKwKHcRaBJcQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-9484-2|page=235-249|year=2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 118\">{{harvnb|Needham|1986|pp=118&ndash;119}}.</ref> Several [[saw mill]]s in [[Roman Asia]] and [[Byzantine Syria]] during the 3rd\u20136th centuries AD had a crank and [[connecting rod]] mechanism which converted the rotary motion of a [[water wheel]] into the linear movement of saw blades.<ref name=\"Tullia et al.

These were followed by the [[Stirling engine]] and [[internal combustion engine]] in the 19th century. Today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of [[petrol]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) or [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) and used to power [[motor vehicle]]s and [[engine power plant]]s.\n\nOne notable reciprocating engine from the World War II Era was the 28-cylinder, {{convert|3500|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]] \"Wasp Major\" radial engine. It powered the last generation of large piston-engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from 1944 onward. It had a total engine capacity of {{convert|71.5|L|cuin|abbr=on}}, and a high power-to-weight ratio.\n\nThe largest reciprocating engine in production at present, but not the largest ever built, is the [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer RTA96-C]]  turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine of 2006 built by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]]. It is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the [[Emma M\u00e6rsk]]. It is five stories high ({{convert|13.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), {{convert|27|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and weighs over {{convert|2,300|metric ton|short ton}} in its largest 14 cylinders version producing more than 84.42&nbsp;MW (114,800&nbsp;bhp). Each cylinder has a capacity of {{convert|1,820|L|cuft|0|abbr=on}}, making a total capacity of {{convert|25,480|L|cuft|0|abbr=on}} for the largest versions.\n\n== Engine capacity ==\nFor piston engines, an engine's capacity is the [[engine displacement]], in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement. It is generally measured in [[litre]]s (l) or cubic inches (c.i.d., cu&nbsp;in, ''or'' in\u00b3) for larger engines, and cubic centimetres (abbreviated cc) for smaller engines. All else being equal, engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly (although this is not true of every Reciprocating engine), although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement.\n\n==Power==\nReciprocating engines can be characterized by their [[power density|specific power]], which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of [[engine displacement]] (in the U.S. also [[horsepower]] per cubic inch). The result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine. This is not to be confused with [[fuel efficiency]], since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio, and thus lower power density. A modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of 75&nbsp;kW/L (1.65&nbsp;hp/in<sup>3</sup>).\n\n==Other modern non-internal combustion types==\nReciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air, steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution-free motive power. Most steam-driven applications use [[steam turbine]]s, which are more efficient than piston engines.\n\nThe French-designed FlowAIR vehicles use compressed air stored in a cylinder to drive a reciprocating engine in a local-pollution-free urban vehicle.<ref>[http://zeropollutionmotors.us/ AIRPod] manufactured by MDI SA. Accessed February 19, 2015</ref>\n\nTorpedoes may use a working gas produced by [[high test peroxide]] or [[Otto fuel II]], which pressurise without combustion. The {{convert|230|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Mark 46 torpedo]], for example, can travel {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} underwater at {{convert|74|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} fuelled by Otto fuel without [[oxidant]].\n\n==Reciprocating quantum heat engine==\n[[Quantum heat engines]] are devices that generate power from heat that flows from a hot to a cold reservoir.\nThe mechanism of operation of the engine can be described by the laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. \n[[Quantum refrigerators]] are devices that consume power with the purpose to pump heat from a cold to a hot reservoir.\n\nIn a reciprocating quantum heat engine, the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or a harmonic oscillator.\nThe [[Carnot cycle]] and [[Otto cycle]] are the ones most studied.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/8/5/083/fulltext/] Irreversible performance of a quantum harmonic heat engine, Rezek and Kosloff, New J.

In addition, these models can justify the assumptions of\n[[endoreversible thermodynamics]].\nA theoretical study has shown that it is possible and practical to build a reciprocating engine that is composed of a single oscillating atom.

He invited me over and he was playing a bunch of music because we were trying to get together on a track. And as the story goes, after playing me five or six tracks he was like, 'oh yeah, and I got this thing'. And I was like, 'God, dude I have to rap on that.' And he's like, 'that?' I was like, 'that's Phantom Planet'. I didn't even know it was an OC thing. And he sliced and diced it on his computer, left his verse on it and left a whole second verse for me to write my verse to. And I had that song for a year, no, six months. I was rolling on tour and then by accident we were playing Whistler, DJing and we were running out of songs and we played that song. The crowd was just like, 'I'm on the run!' and they'd never heard it before. And I was like, 'this is going to be on my next album,' and it was actually the last song that I added to the record. And so his verse is on it, and by default Nelly Furtado is on it. She's the one singing, 'can't really make you love me.'\"<ref>http://www.fazermagazine.com/2009/05/27/an-interview-with-k-os-may-5th-2009-in-toronto-ontario/</ref>\n\nAbout the title; \"The title came because I wanted to call it \u2014 I couldn't call it \"On the Run,\" because Soxx wanted to use that on his record and I couldn't call it \"I Can't Make You Love Me,\" because there's a Bonnie Raitt song called that and everyone thought it was like blasphemy for me to call it that. So I kept on putting off the title and one morning I was in my bed hungover and my publisher was like 'You've got to tell me a name right now.' I'm like 'I don't know, I wish I knew Natalie Portman.' It was like 'Are you serious right now?' I'm like 'Yeah, I wish I knew Natalie Portman.' And that was it.

It is his first album not to have his trademark \"tree logo\" on its cover.\n\nThe album was included on the longlist for the [[2009 Polaris Music Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://polarismusicprize.ca/2009longlist/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619034830/http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/2009longlist/ |archive-date=2009-06-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSpeaking on \"I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman\", k-os said, \"this song started because I went over to [[Saukrates]]' house. He invited me over and he was playing a bunch of music because we were trying to get together on a track. And as the story goes, after playing me five or six tracks he was like, 'oh yeah, and I got this thing'. And I was like, 'God, dude I have to rap on that.' And he's like, 'that?' I was like, 'that's Phantom Planet'. I didn't even know it was an OC thing. And he sliced and diced it on his computer, left his verse on it and left a whole second verse for me to write my verse to. And I had that song for a year, no, six months. I was rolling on tour and then by accident we were playing Whistler, DJ-ing and we were running out of songs and we played that song. The crowd was just like, 'I'm on the run!' and they'd never heard it before. And I was like, 'this is going to be on my next album,' and it was actually the last song that I added to the record. And so his verse is on it, and by default Nelly Furtado is on it. She's the one singing, 'can't really make you love me.'\"<ref>http://www.fazermagazine.com/2009/05/27/an-interview-with-k-os-may-5th-2009-in-toronto-ontario/</ref>\n\nAbout the title; \"The title came because I wanted to call it \u2014 I couldn't call it \"On the Run,\" because Soxx wanted to use that on his record and I couldn't call it \"I Can't Make You Love Me,\" because there's a Bonnie Raitt song called that and everyone thought it was like blasphemy for me to call it that. So I kept on putting off the title and one morning I was in my bed hungover and my publisher was like 'You've got to tell me a name right now.' I'm like 'I don't know, I wish I knew Natalie Portman.' It was like 'Are you serious right now?' I'm like 'Yeah, I wish I knew Natalie Portman.' And that was it. It wasn't even something I thought about.\"<ref>http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/k-os_2/Page/4</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n#\"Zambony\" - 3:46\n#*Main sample from \"Morning Hymn and Alleluia\" from the [[The Sound of Music (soundtrack)|Sound of Music Soundtrack]]\n#\"Astronaut\" - 3:14\n#\"Burning Bridges\" - 3:32\n#\"Uptown GirL\" (featuring [[Emily Haines]] & [[Murray Lightburn]]) - 3:38\n#*Contains a sample of \"[[Love Buzz]]\" by [[Shocking Blue]].\n#\"I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman\" (featuring [[Saukrates]] & [[Nelly Furtado]]) (Produced by Rich Kidd) - 3:10\n#*Originally a Saukrates and Nelly Furtado collaboration entitled \"On the Run\", this track is the only track that does not appear on the ''Yes!
