She began singing at school. Although her parents supported her talent, they did not think it was in keeping with the family's noble origins. She was supported in secret by her paternal uncle, who always believed in her talent. At age 15 she participated in a [[Zarzuela]] company and sang traditional songs. Jos\u00e9 put her in contact with influential musicians of her time, and at festivals she met people like [[Ruperto Chap\u00ed]] and [[Ger\u00f3nimo Gim\u00e9nez]].\n\n=== The Lucerito of Andaluc\u00eda and successes ===\nGarc\u00eda's powerful voice was an asset at a time when there were no microphones, but only in her later years was she able to make a few recordings. Nevertheless, she made her name in the 1860s, and remains known as a result of being widely featured in both the Spanish and Latin American press. In 1894 in [[Buenos Aires]] she appeared as Do\u00f1a Rita in ''[[La Verbena de la Paloma]]''.\n\nShe was later declared an adopted daughter of Buenos Aires, where a street was named in her honor. Her career spanned more than 50 years, from a role in a Zarzuela at the age of 12 until her retirement. She married very young, to the singer and actor from [[M\u00e1laga]], Don [[Salvador Videgain G\u00f3mez]], with whom she had two children. She retired in 1908 from the theater industry and in 1914, as a result of the misfortune of the fire of the Teatro Arriaga of [[Bilbao]], she made the decision to re-launch her career briefly as a singer, mainly in festivals.\n\n===Death===\nAntonia Garc\u00eda had suffered from diabetes since the late 1880s, which caused her to cancel some appearances. In 1918 she was diagnosed with severe diabetes; she died in her house in [[Madrid]] on June 25, 1924, and her remains are in the [[Cementerio de la Almudena]] in Madrid, in the same block as other famous artists of her time.\n \nHer style has influenced many female tango singers in Argentina, as well as many famous Spanish flamenco singers. She was a pioneer in international travel, having toured Brazil, [[Cuba]], [[Argentina]], Uruguay.

Military parachutists (troops) and parachutes were first used on a large scale during [[World War II]] for troop distribution and transportation. Paratroopers are often used in [[surprise attack]]s, to seize strategic objectives such as airfields or bridges.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 071208-F-5888B-041.jpg|thumb|right|200px|U.S. Army paratroopers with the 82nd Airborne Division parachute from a C-130 Hercules aircraft during Operation Toy Drop 2007 at [[Pope Air Force Base]]]]\nParatroopers jump out of airplanes and use parachutes to land safely on the ground.  This is one of the three types of \"forced entry\" strategic techniques for entering a [[theater (warfare)|theater of war]]; the other two being by land and by water.  Their tactical advantage of entering the battlefield from the air is that they can attack areas not directly accessible by other transport.  The ability of [[air assault]] to enter the battlefield from any location allows paratroopers to evade emplaced [[fortification]]s that guard from attack from a specific direction.  The possible use of paratroopers also forces defenders to spread out to protect other areas which would otherwise be safe.  Another common use for paratroopers is to establish an [[Airhead (warfare)|airhead]] for landing other units, as at the [[Battle of Crete]].\n\nThis doctrine was first practically applied to warfare by the [[Italy|Italians]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  The first operational military parachute jump was logged in the night of August 9/10 1918 by Italian assault troops, when  Lt. Alessandro Tandura dropped behind Austro-Hungarian lines near [[Vittorio Veneto]] on a reconnaissance and sabotage mission, followed on later nights by Lts. Ferruccio Nicoloso and Pier Arrigo Barnaba.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  \n\nThe first extensive use of paratroopers (''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'') was by the Germans during World War II. Later in the conflict paratroopers were used extensively by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].  Cargo aircraft of the period (for example the German [[Ju 52]] and the American [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]) being small, they rarely, if ever, jumped in groups much larger than 20 from one aircraft.  In English, this load of paratroopers is called a \"stick\", while any load of soldiers gathered for air movement is known as a \"chalk\".  The terms come from the common use of white chalk on the sides of aircraft and vehicles to mark and update numbers of personnel and equipment being emplaned.<ref name=valorwithoutarms>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2xKQ2DRiN0C&pg=PA102\n |title=Valor Without Arms: A History of the 316th Troop Carrier Group, 1942\u20131945\n |author=Michael N. Ingrisano |year=2001|publisher=Merriam Press|isbn=978-1-57638-339-1|page=102}}</ref>\n\nIn World War II, paratroopers most often used [[parachute]]s of a circular design. These parachutes could be steered to a small degree by pulling on the risers (four straps connecting the paratrooper's harness to the connectors) and suspension lines which attach to the parachute canopy itself. German paratroopers, whose harnesses had only a single riser attached at the back, could not manipulate their parachutes in such a manner. Today, paratroopers still use round parachutes, or round parachutes modified so as to be more fully controlled with toggles. The parachutes are usually deployed by a [[static line]]. Mobility of the parachutes is often deliberately limited to prevent scattering of the troops when a large number parachute together. \n\nSome military exhibition units and [[special forces]] units use [[ram-air parachute|\"ram-air\" parachutes]], which offer a high degree of maneuverability and are deployed manually (without a static line) from the desired altitude. Some use [[High-altitude military parachuting]], also deploying manually.\n\n==Paratrooper forces around the world==\n{{Main|List of paratrooper forces}}\nMany countries have one or several paratrooper units, usually associated to the national Army or Air Force, but in some cases to the Navy.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|List of paratrooper forces}}\n\n=== Argentina ===\n[[File:Military parachuting in Argentina.jpg|thumb|Military exhibition]]\nIn 1944, Argentina became the first country on the continent of South America to use Paratroopers.

From this, the French military created two combat units called ''Groupes d\u2019Infanterie de l\u2019Air''.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of France]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]] formed the 1re Compagnie d\u2019Infanterie de l\u2019Air in September 1940 from members of the [[Free French forces]] who had escaped to [[UK|Britain]]. It was transformed into the Compagnie de Chasseurs Parachutistes in October 1941. By June 1942, these units were fighting in Crete and [[Cyrenaica]] alongside the British [[Special Air Service|1st SAS Regiment]]. As part of the SAS Brigade, two independent French SAS units were also created in addition to the other French Airborne units. They operated until 1945.\n\n[[File:1er CEPML.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[1st Foreign Parachute Heavy Mortar Company]] in Indochina.]]\nIn May 1943, the 1er R\u00e9giment de Chasseurs Parachutistes was created from the 601e Groupe d'Infanterie de l'Air in [[Morocco]] and the 3e and 4e Bataillons d'Infanterie de l'Air (BIA) in [[England]] in the [[Special Air Service]]. The 2e and 3e R\u00e9giments de Chasseurs Parachutistes followed in July 1944.\nDuring the [[Operation Overlord|Invasion of Normandy]], French Airborne forces fought in [[Britanny]], ([[Operation Dingson]], [[Operation Samwest]]). The first Allied soldier to land in France was Free French SAS Captain Pierre Marienne who jumped into Brittany ([[Plumelec]], [[Morbihan]]) on June 5 with 17 [[Free French]] paratroopers. The first Allied soldier killed in the liberation of France was Free French SAS Corporal Emile Bou\u00e9tard of the 4e Bataillon d\u2019Infanterie de l\u2019Air, also in Brittany in Plumelec: June 6, 0 h 40. Captain Pierre Marienne was killed on July 12 in Plumelec. French SAS paratroopers also fought in the [[Loire Valley]] on September 1944, in [[Belgium]] on January, and in [[Netherlands]] on April 1945. The 1er R\u00e9giment Parachutiste de Choc carried out operations in [[Operation Dragoon|Provence]].\n\n[[File:VBL RHP Afghanistan.JPG|thumb|left|[[V\u00e9hicule Blind\u00e9 L\u00e9ger|VBL]] (armoured light vehicle) of the [[1st Parachute Hussar Regiment]] in Afghanistan.]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the post-war French military of the [[Fourth Republic (France)|Fourth Republic]] created several new airborne units. Among them were the Bataillon de Parachutistes Coloniaux (BPC) based in [[Arrondissement of Vannes|Vannes-Meucon]], the Metropolitan Paratroopers, and the Colonial Paratroopers and Bataillons \u00c9trangers de Parachutistes (French Foreign Legion), which coexisted until 1954. During the [[First Indochina War]], a Bataillon Parachutiste Viet Nam was created (BPVN) in southeast Asia. In total, 150 different airborne operations took place in Indochina between 1945 and 1954. These included five major combat missions against the [[Viet Minh]] strongholds and areas of concentration.\n\nWhen the French [[Operation Passage to Freedom|left Vietnam]] in 1954, all airborne battalions were upgraded to regiments over the next two years. Only the French Air Force's Commandos de l'Air (Air Force) were excluded. In 1956, the 2e R\u00e9giment de Parachutiste Coloniaux took part in the [[Suez Crisis]].\n\nNext, the [[French Army]] regrouped all its Army Airborne regiments into two parachute divisions in 1956. The 10th parachute division (''10e Division Parachutiste'', 10e DP) came under the command of General [[Jacques Massu]] and General Henri Sauvagnac took over the 25th Parachute Division (''25e Division Parachutiste'', 25e DP). Again the Commandos de l'Air were kept under command of the Air Force.\n\nBy the late 1950s, in [[Algeria]], the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] had launched its [[Algerian War|War of Independence]]. French paratroopers were used as counter insurgency units by the French Army. This was the first time in airborne operations troops used helicopters for [[Air Assault]] and [[Fire Support]].\n\nBut in the aftermath of the [[Algiers putsch]], the 10e and 25e Parachute divisions were disbanded and their regiments merged into the Light Intervention Division (''Division L\u00e9g\u00e8re d'Intervention''). This division became the 11th Parachute Division (''11e Division Parachutiste'', 11e DP) in 1971.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Cold War]], the French Army reorganised and the 11e DP become the 11th Parachute Brigade in 1999.\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}}\n==== Nazi Germany (1935\u201345) ====\n{{main| Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}}\n[[Nazi Germany]]\u00b4s ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' units made the first [[airborne forces|airborne invasion]] when invading [[Denmark]] on April 9, 1940 as part of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]. In the early morning hours they attacked and took control of the [[Masned\u00f8]] fort and [[Aalborg Air Base|Aalborg Airport]]. The Masned\u00f8 fort was positioned such as it guarded the [[Storstr\u00f8m Bridge]] between the islands of [[Falster]] and Masned\u00f8 \u2013 on the main road from the south to [[Copenhagen]]. Aalborg Airport played a key role acting as a refuel station for the [[Luftwaffe]] in the further invasion into [[Norway]]. In the same assault the bridges around [[Aalborg]] were taken. Fallschirmj\u00e4ger were also used in the Low Countries against the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], although their use against [[Battle for The Hague|The Hague]] was unsuccessful. Their most famous drop was the 1941 [[Battle of Crete]], though they suffered large casualties.\n[[File:Wiesel 1 MK20 (1991) Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden.jpg|thumb|left|Wiesel 1 MK20 (1991) of the ''Bundeswehr'' '' Fallschirmj\u00e4gertruppe'' in the Military History Museum, Dresden]]\nHence later in the war, the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Air Division's]] ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' assets were re-organised and used as the core of a new series of elite Luftwaffe Infantry divisions, numbered in a series beginning with the [[German 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Division|1st ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' Division]]. These formations were organised and equipped as [[motorized infantry|motorised infantry]] divisions, and often played a \"fire brigade\" role on the western front. Their constituents were often encountered on the battlefield as ad hoc [[Battlegroup (army)|battle groups]] (''[[Kampfgruppe]]n'') detached from a division or organised from miscellaneous available assets. In accord with standard German practice, these were called by their commander's name, such as ''Group Erdmann'' in France and the [[Ramcke Parachute Brigade|''Ramcke'' Parachute Brigade]] in [[Deutsches Afrikakorps|North Africa]].\n[[File:2684754 A German Bundeswehr soldier of 4th Paratrooper Company, 31st Paratrooper Regiment 2016.jpg|thumb|A German ''Bundeswehr'' soldier of 4th Paratrooper Company, 31st Paratrooper Regiment in 2016]]\n\nAfter mid-1944, ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were no longer trained as paratroops owing to the realities of the strategic situation, but retained the ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' honorific. Near the end of the war, the series of new ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' divisions extended to over a dozen, with a concomitant reduction in quality in the higher-numbered units of the series. Among these divisions was the 9th ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' Division, which was the final parachute division to be raised by Germany during [[World War II]]. The Russian army destroyed the division during the [[Battle of Berlin]] in April 1945. The ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were issued specialist weapons such as the [[FG 42]] and specially designed helmets.\n\n==== Federal Republic of Germany ====\n\nIn the modern [[Germany|German]] ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', the ''Fallschirmj\u00e4gertruppe'' continue to form the core of special operations units. The division has two brigade equivalents and several independent companies and battalions. All told, about 10,000 troops served in that division in 2010, most of them support or logistics personnel. The Fallschirmj\u00e4gertruppe currently uses the Wiesel Armoured Weapons Carrier (AWC), a light air-transportable [[armoured fighting vehicle]], more specifically a lightly armoured weapons carrier. It is quite similar to historical scouting [[tankette]]s in size, form and function, and is the only true modern tankette in use in Western Europe.<ref name=Tank>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/West_Germany/Wiesel_AWC.php |title=Wiesel AWC |publisher=Tanks Encyclopedia |accessdate=7 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608001141/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/West_Germany/Wiesel_AWC.php |archive-date=8 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Parachute Regiment (India)}}\n\nThe Parachute Regiment is the Special Forces/airborne regiment of the Indian Army. Regiment was formed in 1952\n\nThe regiment has a total of 14 regular, one [[Rashtriya Rifles]] and two [[Territorial Army (India)]] battalions; of the regular bns, five are Airborne battalions, while nine are Special Forces battalions. Formerly designated \"Commando\" units, they are now designated Special Forces:\n\nThree of the Special Forces battalions were originally trained for use in certain environments; 1st Bn [strategic reserve], 9th Bn [mountain] and 10th Bn [desert].  Subsequently, the 21st Bn was raised for [[jungle warfare]].  Currently, all Special Forces battalions are cross trained for all environments.\n\n[[Image:India Para2.jpg|thumb|right|Elite soldiers of Indian Army's 9 Para Commandos]]\n\nThe 8th Battalion became 16th Battalion, Mahar Regiment in 1976 before reconverting to the 12th Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment. A sizable part of the battalion was retained in the airborne role for some time, forming the armoured element of the 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade and equipped with their [[BMP-2]] Infantry Combat Vehicles.  But due to administrative and logistic reasons, it was discontinued and their role being taken over by the para battalions themselves, with a platoon strength of each battalion being trained and equipped for the mechanized role within the brigade.\n\nThe 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade comprises the following units:\n\n* 03 Airborne battalions\n* 01 Parachute Field Regiment (Artillery) (9 & 17 Parachute Field Regiments in rotation)\n* 60 Parachute Field Hospital\n* 411 (Independent) Parachute Field Company (Bombay Sappers)\n* 622 Parachute Composite Company (ASC)\n* 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade OFP (Ordnance)\n* 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade Signal Company\n* 2 (Independent) Parachute Field Workshop Company (EME)\n* 252 (Para) Air Defence Battery\n( 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade Provost Section.\n\nThe President's Body Guard also forms part of the brigade as the pathfinders company.\n\nThree Airborne units in rotation form part of the Parachute Brigade alternatively serving their field tenures in counter-insurgency/high altitude areas.  One of the two field regiments (9 Para Fd Regt and 17 Para Fd Regt) also forms part of the brigade while the other serves out its field tenure on rotation.\n\nThe two Territorial Army battalions, 106th (Bangalore) and 116th (Deolali) form the airborne element of the Terriers (as the Territorial Army is popularly known) and are presently involved in COIN operations.\n\n31st Battalion (Commando), Rashtriya Rifles, is also affiliated to the Parachute Regiment, for special operations conducted by the counter-insurgency force.\n\n===Israel===\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - First Operational Parachuting Drill in 15 Years (21).jpg|thumb|35th Brigade during training.]]\n[[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) paratroopers have a history of carrying out special forces-style missions dating back to the 1950s. Paratrooper Brigade soldiers wear [[maroon berets]] with the infantry pin and reddish-brown boots. Distinct from all other soldiers of the IDF, Paratroopers wear a tunic and belt over the shirt. The IDF has one active paratrooper brigade and four reserve brigades consisting of personnel who served their mandatory time in the 35th brigade, and who are mostly relatively recently discharged, aside from officers. The IDF paratrooper brigades include:\n* 35th [[Paratroopers Brigade]] - Has been active since 1955 and is part of [[Central Command (Israel)|Central Command]]\n* [[55th Paratroopers Brigade|55th Paratroopers Brigade (Reserve)]]\n* 226th Paratroopers Brigade (Reserve)\n* 551st Paratroopers Brigade (Reserve)\n* 646th Paratroopers Brigade (Reserve)\n\n=== Italy ===\n{{Main|Paracadutisti}}\n[[Image:2june 2007 172.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian paratroopers of the [[Carabinieri Regiment \"Tuscania\"]]]]\n[[File:Sky Soldiers , Italian allies conduct Emergency Deployment Readiness Exercise in Pordenone 150114-A-MM054-020.jpg|thumb|Paratroopers of the [[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore|Brigade Folgore]]]]\nThe [[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore]] is the largest unit of paratroopers of the [[Italian Army]]. A second smaller unit is the [[4th Alpini Parachutist Regiment]] \"Monte Cervino\".\n\nThe Folgore operates as [[Light Infantry]] with airborne drop and air transport capability, equipped with modest mechanization that is framed in the Forces of Projection to the dependencies of 1\u00b0Commando FOD.\n\nThe first units of Italian parachutists were trained and formed shortly before the Second World War in [[RAF Castel Benito|Castel Benito]], near [[Tripoli]], where the first Military school of Parachuting was located.\n\nThe first troops trained were two [[Libya]]n battalions of the [[Royal Colonial Corps]]. These were added to the first battalion of Italian troops and the [[Carabinieri Regiment \"Tuscania\"]].\n\nLater in Italy, the staff at Castelbenito was expanded into the School at [[Tarquinia]] and became the first elements of the future Division Folgore.\n\nIn 1941, a Parachutist division was completed and was designated the [[185th Parachute Division Folgore]].  It was trained for the assault on [[Malta]] in [[Operation Hercules]] and was engaged in ground combat operations in the [[North African Campaign]].  During the [[Second battle of El Alamein]], it resisted the attack of six British divisions, thus provoking the respect and admiration of the British. \n\nThe 185th Regiment is included in the Brigade Parachutists Folgore and is generally in charge of the training and preparation of units; but it can be converted to other tasks depending on the technical and functional plan, from employment on land with the Commando Operations of Special Forces (COFS) and other units of river basin FS/FOS of the Army, with the [[Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei e Incursori Teseo Tesei]] (GOI) of the Navy (Marina Militare), with the [[17\u00ba Stormo Incursori]] Unit of the Air Force and for some functions also with the [[Gruppo di Intervento Speciale]] (GIS) of the Carabinieri officers.\n\nUnits from Parachute Artillery Regiments form the basis of the Special Operations component of the Regiment, from the moment that recon became part of its own tasks, as well as the acquisition of targets and the guidance of laser and precision munitions deployed by air.\n\nOfficers, non-commissioned officers and Troops of the unit (all volunteers) are recruited by public competitions announced by the Army, with candidates (pending verification of psycho-physical requirements) coming from other units of the Italian Army. An intensive course of the duration of approximately two years is required to obtain the qualification of \"Acquisitore\" (Target Acquisitor).\n\n*The Regiment has been engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq\n*The Brigade has been employed in numerous peacekeeping missions in the recent years.\n\n====Operations====\nIn 1982 the Italian Brigade Folgore landed in [[Beirut]] with the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]].\nIn 1991, a Parachutist Tactical group was deployed to [[Kurdistan]]. Its mission was to provide humanitarian aid. From July 1992, the Brigade supplied personnel to [[Operation Vespri Siciliani]]. The Folgore participated in [[Operation Restore Hope]] in [[Somalia]] from 3 December 1992 to September 1993. Parts of the Brigade have been employed many times in the [[Balkans]] (IFOR/SFOR in [[Bosnia]] and KFOR in [[Kosovo]]), with MNF in [[Albania]] and [[INTERFET]] in [[East Timor]]. The Folgore participated from August 2005 to September 2005 in [[Operation Opera|Operation Babylon]] in [[Iraq]] and to December 2014 in [[Afghanistan]].\n\nIn August 2007, the Folgore took part in [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]], under aegis of the [[United Nations]] (Resolution 1701), as a result of the war between [[Israel]] and [[Hezbollah]] of summer 2006.\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{Main|Teishin Shudan}}\n\n{{Nihongo|'''''Teishin Shudan'''''|\u633a\u9032\u96c6\u56e3|Raiding Group}} was a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[special forces]]/[[airborne forces|airborne]] unit during [[World War II]]. The unit was a [[division (military)|division]]-level force, and was part of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] (IJAAF).\n\nIt was commanded by a [[major general]], and was organized as follows:\n\n* headquarters company (220 personnel)\n* aviation brigade\n* raiding brigade\n* two glider infantry regiments\n* raiding artillery company (120 personnel)\n* raiding signals company (140 personnel)\n* raiding engineer company (250 personnel)\n\nNotably, Japanese troopers fought in the [[Battle of Palembang]] and in the takeover of Celebes in the Dutch East Indies.\n\n=== Peru ===\n{{Main|Paratrooper Company}}\n\nDuring the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], the Peruvian army had also established its own paratrooper unit and used it to great effect by seizing the Ecuadorian port city of [[Puerto Bol\u00edvar]], on July 27, 1941, marking the first time in the Americas that [[airborne forces|airborne]] troops were used in combat.<ref>The paratroopers were dropped from Italian [[Caproni Ca.111]] bomber-transports.

The British government, however, pressured the Poles into allowing the unit to be used in the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western theatre of war]]. [[Operation Market Garden]] eventually saw the unit sent into action in support of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]] at the [[Battle of Arnhem]] in 1944. The Poles were initially landed by glider from 18 September, whilst, due to bad weather over England, the parachute section of the Brigade was held up, and jumped on 21 September at [[Driel]] on the South bank of the Rhine. The Poles suffered significant casualties during the next few days of fighting, but still were able, by their presence, to cause around 2,500 German troops to be diverted to deal with them for fear of them supporting the remnants of 1st Airborne trapped over the lower Rhine in Oosterbeek.\n\nThe Brigade was originally trained close to [[RAF Ringway]] and later in [[Upper Largo]] in Scotland. It was finally based in Lincolnshire, close to [[RAF Spitalgate]] (Grantham) where it continued training until its eventual departure for Europe after D-Day.\n\nThe Brigade was formed by the Polish High Command in exile with the aim of it being used to support the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish resistance]] during the [[Operation Tempest|nationwide uprising]], a plan that encountered opposition from the British, who argued they would not be able to support it properly.<ref name=\"ZalogaHook1982\">{{cite book|author1=Steven J.

This left Sosabowski without any anti-tank capability. The light artillery battery was left behind in England due to a shortage of gliders. Owing to bad weather and a shortage of transport planes, the drop into [[Driel]] was delayed by two days, to 21 September. The British units which were supposed to cover the landing zone were in a bad situation and out of radio contact with the main Allied forces.<ref name=\"ZalogaHook1982\"/> Finally, the 2nd Battalion, and elements of the 3rd Battalion, with support troops from the Brigade's Medical Company, Engineer Company and HQ Company, were dropped under German fire east of Driel. They overran Driel, after it was realised that the Heveadorp ferry had been destroyed. In Driel, the Polish paratroopers set up a defensive \"hedgehog\" position, from which over the next two nights further attempts were made to cross the Rhine.\n\nThe following day, the Poles were able to produce some makeshift boats and attempt a crossing. With great difficulty and under German fire from the heights of Westerbouwing on the north bank of the river, the 8th Parachute Company and, later, additional troops from 3rd Battalion, managed to cross the Rhine in two attempts. In total, about 200 Polish paratroopers made it across in two days, and were able to cover the subsequent withdrawal of the remnants of the [[British 1st Airborne Division]].\n\nOn 26 September 1944, the Brigade (now including the 1st Battalion and elements of the 3rd Battalion, who were parachuted near to Grave on 23 September) was ordered to march towards [[Nijmegen]]. The Brigade had lost 25% of its fighting strength, amounting to 590 casualties.<ref name=\"ZalogaHook1982\"/>\n\nIn 1945, the Brigade was attached to the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]] and undertook occupation duties in Northern Germany until it was disbanded on 30 June 1947. The majority of its soldiers chose to stay in exile rather than hazard returning to the [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)|new Communist Poland]].\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main|Portuguese Paratroopers}}\nThe first Portuguese paratroopers were part of a small [[commando]] unit, organized in [[Australia]], during World War II, with the objective to be dropped in the rearguard of the Japanese troops that were occupying [[Portuguese Timor]].\n\nHowever, the first regular parachute unit was only created in 1955, by the [[Portuguese Air Force]], as the Parachute ''[[Ca\u00e7adores]]'' Battalion. This unit adopted the [[green beret]], which has become, since then, the principal emblem of the Portuguese paratroopers. The Battalion was expanded to a Regiment and additional parachute battalions were created in the Portuguese overseas territories of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]]. These units were actively engaged in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], from 1961 to 1975, being involved both in airborne and air assault operations. In addition to the regular units of paratroopers, in Mozambique were also created the [[Special Groups (Portugal)|Parachute Special Groups]], composed of African irregular troops who wore a [[maroon beret]].\n\nWith the end of the Colonial War, the Portuguese parachute troops were reorganized as the Paratroopers Corps, with the Light Parachute Brigade as its operational unit. In 1993, the Paratroopers Corps was transferred from the Portuguese Air Force to the [[Portuguese Army]] and become the Airborne Troops Command, with the Independent Airborne Brigade as its operational unit.\n\nThe reorganization of the Portuguese Army in 2006 caused the extinction of the Airborne Troops Command. The Independent Airborne Brigade was transformed in the present [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade|Rapid Reaction Brigade]], which now includes not only parachute troops but also [[Special Operations Troops Centre|special operations]] and [[Portuguese Army Commandos|commando troops]].\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Russian Airborne Troops}}\n[[Image:Russian paratroopers 106th VDD.JPG|thumb|left|Russian paratroopers]]\n[[Russian Airborne Troops]] were first formed in the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] during the mid-1930s and arguably were the first regular paratrooper units in the world. They were massively expanded during [[World War II]], forming ten Airborne Corps plus numerous Independent Airborne Brigades, with most or all achieving [[Russian Guards|Guards]] status. The 9th Guards Army was eventually formed with three Guards Rifle Corps (37,38,39) of Airborne divisions. One of the new units was the [[Soviet 100th Guards Rifle Division|100th Airborne Division]].\n\nAt the end of the war they were reconstituted as Guards Rifle Divisions. They were later rebuilt during the [[Cold War]], eventually forming seven Airborne Divisions, an Independent Airborne regiment and sixteen Air Assault Brigades. These divisions were formed into their own VDV commands (Vozdushno-Desantnye Voyska) to give the Soviets a rapid strike force to spearhead strategic military operations.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a reduction in airborne divisions. Three [[Russian Airborne Troops|VDV]] divisions have been disbanded, as well as one brigade and a brigade-sized training centre. Nevertheless, Russian Airborne Troops are still the largest in the world.\n\nVDV troops participated in the rapid deployment of Russian forces in and around [[Pristina]] airport during the [[Kosovo War]]. They were also deployed in [[Chechnya]] as an active bridgehead for other forces to follow.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{main|1 Parachute Battalion}}\n[[File:Para Course Image 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]\n\n===Spain===\nIn Spain, the three branches of the Armed Forces have paratrooper units, the biggest in number being the Army's Paratrooper Brigade in Paracuellos de Jarama [[Paratrooper Brigade (Spain)|BRIPAC]]. All members of the special forces in the Navy (Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial), the Army and the Air Force must be certified as paratrooper and pass the HALO-HAHO examinations each year.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====British Army====\n\nThe [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] has its origins in the elite force of [[British Commandos|Commandos]] set up by the [[British Army]] at the request of [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], during the initial phase of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Churchill had been an enthusiast of the concept of airborne warfare since the [[World War I|First World War]], when he had proposed the creation of a force that might assault the German flanks deep behind the trenches of the static [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref>Reproduced in Blunt, Victor, ''The User of Air Power''. Military Service Publishing Company; Harrisburg, 1943: ppv-ix.</ref> In 1940 and in the aftermath of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]], Churchill's interest was caught again by the idea of taking the fight back to Europe \u2013 the airborne was now a means ''to be able to storm a series of water obstacles... everywhere from the Channel to the Mediterranean and in the East''.<ref>Browning, F. \"Airborne Forces\", RUSI Journal 89, no. 556 (1944): pp350-361.</ref>\n[[File:British Paratroops inside one of the C-47 transport aircraft.jpg|thumb|British paratroopers inside one of the C-47 transport aircraft, September 1944]]\nEnthusiasts within the British armed forces were inspired in the creation of airborne forces (including the Parachute Regiment, [[Air Landing Regiment]], and the [[Glider Pilot Regiment]]) by the example of the German Luftwaffe's [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]], which had a major role in the invasions of Norway, and the Low Countries, particularly the attack on [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium, and a pivotal, but costly role in the [[Battle of Crete|invasion of Crete]]. From the perspective of others, however, the proposed airborne units had a key weakness: they required exactly the same resources as the new strategic bomber capability, another high priority, and would also compete with the badly stretched strategic air lift capability, essential to Churchill's strategy in the Far East.<ref>Slessor, John \"Some Reflections on Airborne Forces\" ''Army Quarterly'', 1948, p161.</ref> It took the continued reintervention of Churchill to ensure that sufficient aircraft were devoted to the airborne project to make it viable.\n\nBritain's first airborne assault took place on February 10, 1941 when, what was then known as II [[Special Air Service]] (some 37 men of 500 trained in [[No. 2 Commando]] plus three Italian interpreters), parachuted into Italy to blow up an aqueduct in a daring raid named [[Operation Colossus]]. After the Battle of Crete, it was agreed that Britain would need many more paratroopers for similar operations. No 2 Commando were tasked with specialising in airborne assault and became the nucleus of the Parachute Regiment, becoming the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st Battalion]]. The larger scale drops in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] by the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] in 1943 met with mixed success, and some commanders concluded the airborne experiment was a failure.<ref>Hand, Roger \"Overlord and Operational Art\" ''Military Review'', 1995:87</ref> Once again, it took the reintervention of senior British political leaders, looking ahead to the potential needs of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], to continue the growth in British airborne resources.\n\nExtensive successful drops were made during the [[Normandy landings]] by the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] (see [[Operation Tonga]]), under the command of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Richard Gale (British Army officer)|Richard Nelson Gale]], but [[Operation Market Garden]] against [[Battle of Arnhem|Arnhem]] with the 1st Airborne Division under [[Roy Urquhart]] were less successful, and proved, in the famous phrase, to be ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge too far]]'' and the 1st Airborne was virtually destroyed. Later large scale drops, such as those on the Rhine under [[Operation Varsity]] and involving the British 6th and the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|US 17th]], were successful, but less ambitious in their intent to seize ground. After the war, there was fierce debate within the cash-strapped British armed forces as to the value of airborne forces.

Military parachutists (troops) and parachutes were first used on a large scale during [[World War II]] for troop distribution and transportation. Paratroopers are often used in [[surprise attack]]s, to seize strategic objectives such as airfields or bridges.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 071208-F-5888B-041.jpg|thumb|right|200px|U.S. Army paratroopers with the 82nd Airborne Division parachute from a C-130 Hercules aircraft during Operation Toy Drop 2007 at [[Pope Air Force Base]]]]\nParatroopers jump out of airplanes and use parachutes to land safely on the ground.  This is one of the three types of \"forced entry\" strategic techniques for entering a [[theater (warfare)|theater of war]]; the other two being by land and by water.  Their tactical advantage of entering the battlefield from the air is that they can attack areas not directly accessible by other transport.  The ability of [[air assault]] to enter the battlefield from any location allows paratroopers to evade emplaced [[fortification]]s that guard from attack from a specific direction.  The possible use of paratroopers also forces defenders to spread out to protect other areas which would otherwise be safe.  Another common use for paratroopers is to establish an [[Airhead (warfare)|airhead]] for landing other units, as at the [[Battle of Crete]].\n\nThis doctrine was first practically applied to warfare by the [[Italy|Italians]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  The first operational military parachute jump was logged in the night of August 9/10 1918 by Italian assault troops, when  Lt. Alessandro Tandura dropped behind Austro-Hungarian lines near [[Vittorio Veneto]] on a reconnaissance and sabotage mission, followed on later nights by Lts. Ferruccio Nicoloso and Pier Arrigo Barnaba.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  \n\nThe first extensive use of paratroopers (''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'') was by the Germans during World War II. Later in the conflict paratroopers were used extensively by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].  Cargo aircraft of the period (for example the German [[Ju 52]] and the American [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]) being small, they rarely, if ever, jumped in groups much larger than 20 from one aircraft.  In English, this load of paratroopers is called a \"stick\", while any load of soldiers gathered for air movement is known as a \"chalk\".  The terms come from the common use of white chalk on the sides of aircraft and vehicles to mark and update numbers of personnel and equipment being emplaned.<ref name=valorwithoutarms>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2xKQ2DRiN0C&pg=PA102\n |title=Valor Without Arms: A History of the 316th Troop Carrier Group, 1942\u20131945\n |author=Michael N.

These parachutes could be steered to a small degree by pulling on the risers (four straps connecting the paratrooper's harness to the connectors) and suspension lines which attach to the parachute canopy itself. German paratroopers, whose harnesses had only a single riser attached at the back, could not manipulate their parachutes in such a manner. Today, paratroopers still use round parachutes, or round parachutes modified so as to be more fully controlled with toggles. The parachutes are usually deployed by a [[static line]]. Mobility of the parachutes is often deliberately limited to prevent scattering of the troops when a large number parachute together. \n\nSome military exhibition units and [[special forces]] units use [[ram-air parachute|\"ram-air\" parachutes]], which offer a high degree of maneuverability and are deployed manually (without a static line) from the desired altitude. Some use [[High-altitude military parachuting]], also deploying manually.\n\n==Paratrooper forces around the world==\n{{Main|List of paratrooper forces}}\nMany countries have one or several paratrooper units, usually associated to the national Army or Air Force, but in some cases to the Navy.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|List of paratrooper forces}}\n\n=== Argentina ===\n[[File:Military parachuting in Argentina.jpg|thumb|Military exhibition]]\nIn 1944, Argentina became the first country on the continent of South America to use Paratroopers.

From this, the French military created two combat units called ''Groupes d\u2019Infanterie de l\u2019Air''.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of France]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]] formed the 1re Compagnie d\u2019Infanterie de l\u2019Air in September 1940 from members of the [[Free French forces]] who had escaped to [[UK|Britain]]. It was transformed into the Compagnie de Chasseurs Parachutistes in October 1941. By June 1942, these units were fighting in Crete and [[Cyrenaica]] alongside the British [[Special Air Service|1st SAS Regiment]]. As part of the SAS Brigade, two independent French SAS units were also created in addition to the other French Airborne units. They operated until 1945.\n\n[[File:1er CEPML.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[1st Foreign Parachute Heavy Mortar Company]] in Indochina.]]\nIn May 1943, the 1er R\u00e9giment de Chasseurs Parachutistes was created from the 601e Groupe d'Infanterie de l'Air in [[Morocco]] and the 3e and 4e Bataillons d'Infanterie de l'Air (BIA) in [[England]] in the [[Special Air Service]]. The 2e and 3e R\u00e9giments de Chasseurs Parachutistes followed in July 1944.\nDuring the [[Operation Overlord|Invasion of Normandy]], French Airborne forces fought in [[Britanny]], ([[Operation Dingson]], [[Operation Samwest]]). The first Allied soldier to land in France was Free French SAS Captain Pierre Marienne who jumped into Brittany ([[Plumelec]], [[Morbihan]]) on June 5 with 17 [[Free French]] paratroopers. The first Allied soldier killed in the liberation of France was Free French SAS Corporal Emile Bou\u00e9tard of the 4e Bataillon d\u2019Infanterie de l\u2019Air, also in Brittany in Plumelec: June 6, 0 h 40. Captain Pierre Marienne was killed on July 12 in Plumelec. French SAS paratroopers also fought in the [[Loire Valley]] on September 1944, in [[Belgium]] on January, and in [[Netherlands]] on April 1945. The 1er R\u00e9giment Parachutiste de Choc carried out operations in [[Operation Dragoon|Provence]].\n\n[[File:VBL RHP Afghanistan.JPG|thumb|left|[[V\u00e9hicule Blind\u00e9 L\u00e9ger|VBL]] (armoured light vehicle) of the [[1st Parachute Hussar Regiment]] in Afghanistan.]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the post-war French military of the [[Fourth Republic (France)|Fourth Republic]] created several new airborne units. Among them were the Bataillon de Parachutistes Coloniaux (BPC) based in [[Arrondissement of Vannes|Vannes-Meucon]], the Metropolitan Paratroopers, and the Colonial Paratroopers and Bataillons \u00c9trangers de Parachutistes (French Foreign Legion), which coexisted until 1954. During the [[First Indochina War]], a Bataillon Parachutiste Viet Nam was created (BPVN) in southeast Asia. In total, 150 different airborne operations took place in Indochina between 1945 and 1954. These included five major combat missions against the [[Viet Minh]] strongholds and areas of concentration.\n\nWhen the French [[Operation Passage to Freedom|left Vietnam]] in 1954, all airborne battalions were upgraded to regiments over the next two years. Only the French Air Force's Commandos de l'Air (Air Force) were excluded. In 1956, the 2e R\u00e9giment de Parachutiste Coloniaux took part in the [[Suez Crisis]].\n\nNext, the [[French Army]] regrouped all its Army Airborne regiments into two parachute divisions in 1956. The 10th parachute division (''10e Division Parachutiste'', 10e DP) came under the command of General [[Jacques Massu]] and General Henri Sauvagnac took over the 25th Parachute Division (''25e Division Parachutiste'', 25e DP). Again the Commandos de l'Air were kept under command of the Air Force.\n\nBy the late 1950s, in [[Algeria]], the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] had launched its [[Algerian War|War of Independence]]. French paratroopers were used as counter insurgency units by the French Army. This was the first time in airborne operations troops used helicopters for [[Air Assault]] and [[Fire Support]].\n\nBut in the aftermath of the [[Algiers putsch]], the 10e and 25e Parachute divisions were disbanded and their regiments merged into the Light Intervention Division (''Division L\u00e9g\u00e8re d'Intervention''). This division became the 11th Parachute Division (''11e Division Parachutiste'', 11e DP) in 1971.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Cold War]], the French Army reorganised and the 11e DP become the 11th Parachute Brigade in 1999.\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}}\n==== Nazi Germany (1935\u201345) ====\n{{main| Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}}\n[[Nazi Germany]]\u00b4s ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' units made the first [[airborne forces|airborne invasion]] when invading [[Denmark]] on April 9, 1940 as part of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]. In the early morning hours they attacked and took control of the [[Masned\u00f8]] fort and [[Aalborg Air Base|Aalborg Airport]]. The Masned\u00f8 fort was positioned such as it guarded the [[Storstr\u00f8m Bridge]] between the islands of [[Falster]] and Masned\u00f8 \u2013 on the main road from the south to [[Copenhagen]]. Aalborg Airport played a key role acting as a refuel station for the [[Luftwaffe]] in the further invasion into [[Norway]]. In the same assault the bridges around [[Aalborg]] were taken. Fallschirmj\u00e4ger were also used in the Low Countries against the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], although their use against [[Battle for The Hague|The Hague]] was unsuccessful. Their most famous drop was the 1941 [[Battle of Crete]], though they suffered large casualties.\n[[File:Wiesel 1 MK20 (1991) Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden.jpg|thumb|left|Wiesel 1 MK20 (1991) of the ''Bundeswehr'' '' Fallschirmj\u00e4gertruppe'' in the Military History Museum, Dresden]]\nHence later in the war, the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Air Division's]] ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' assets were re-organised and used as the core of a new series of elite Luftwaffe Infantry divisions, numbered in a series beginning with the [[German 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Division|1st ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' Division]]. These formations were organised and equipped as [[motorized infantry|motorised infantry]] divisions, and often played a \"fire brigade\" role on the western front. Their constituents were often encountered on the battlefield as ad hoc [[Battlegroup (army)|battle groups]] (''[[Kampfgruppe]]n'') detached from a division or organised from miscellaneous available assets. In accord with standard German practice, these were called by their commander's name, such as ''Group Erdmann'' in France and the [[Ramcke Parachute Brigade|''Ramcke'' Parachute Brigade]] in [[Deutsches Afrikakorps|North Africa]].\n[[File:2684754 A German Bundeswehr soldier of 4th Paratrooper Company, 31st Paratrooper Regiment 2016.jpg|thumb|A German ''Bundeswehr'' soldier of 4th Paratrooper Company, 31st Paratrooper Regiment in 2016]]\n\nAfter mid-1944, ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were no longer trained as paratroops owing to the realities of the strategic situation, but retained the ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' honorific. Near the end of the war, the series of new ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' divisions extended to over a dozen, with a concomitant reduction in quality in the higher-numbered units of the series. Among these divisions was the 9th ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' Division, which was the final parachute division to be raised by Germany during [[World War II]]. The Russian army destroyed the division during the [[Battle of Berlin]] in April 1945. The ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were issued specialist weapons such as the [[FG 42]] and specially designed helmets.\n\n==== Federal Republic of Germany ====\n\nIn the modern [[Germany|German]] ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', the ''Fallschirmj\u00e4gertruppe'' continue to form the core of special operations units. The division has two brigade equivalents and several independent companies and battalions. All told, about 10,000 troops served in that division in 2010, most of them support or logistics personnel. The Fallschirmj\u00e4gertruppe currently uses the Wiesel Armoured Weapons Carrier (AWC), a light air-transportable [[armoured fighting vehicle]], more specifically a lightly armoured weapons carrier. It is quite similar to historical scouting [[tankette]]s in size, form and function, and is the only true modern tankette in use in Western Europe.<ref name=Tank>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/West_Germany/Wiesel_AWC.php |title=Wiesel AWC |publisher=Tanks Encyclopedia |accessdate=7 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608001141/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/West_Germany/Wiesel_AWC.php |archive-date=8 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Parachute Regiment (India)}}\n\nThe Parachute Regiment is the Special Forces/airborne regiment of the Indian Army.

Currently, all Special Forces battalions are cross trained for all environments.\n\n[[Image:India Para2.jpg|thumb|right|Elite soldiers of Indian Army's 9 Para Commandos]]\n\nThe 8th Battalion became 16th Battalion, Mahar Regiment in 1976 before reconverting to the 12th Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment. A sizable part of the battalion was retained in the airborne role for some time, forming the armoured element of the 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade and equipped with their [[BMP-2]] Infantry Combat Vehicles.  But due to administrative and logistic reasons, it was discontinued and their role being taken over by the para battalions themselves, with a platoon strength of each battalion being trained and equipped for the mechanized role within the brigade.\n\nThe 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade comprises the following units:\n\n* 03 Airborne battalions\n* 01 Parachute Field Regiment (Artillery) (9 & 17 Parachute Field Regiments in rotation)\n* 60 Parachute Field Hospital\n* 411 (Independent) Parachute Field Company (Bombay Sappers)\n* 622 Parachute Composite Company (ASC)\n* 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade OFP (Ordnance)\n* 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade Signal Company\n* 2 (Independent) Parachute Field Workshop Company (EME)\n* 252 (Para) Air Defence Battery\n( 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade Provost Section.\n\nThe President's Body Guard also forms part of the brigade as the pathfinders company.\n\nThree Airborne units in rotation form part of the Parachute Brigade alternatively serving their field tenures in counter-insurgency/high altitude areas.  One of the two field regiments (9 Para Fd Regt and 17 Para Fd Regt) also forms part of the brigade while the other serves out its field tenure on rotation.\n\nThe two Territorial Army battalions, 106th (Bangalore) and 116th (Deolali) form the airborne element of the Terriers (as the Territorial Army is popularly known) and are presently involved in COIN operations.\n\n31st Battalion (Commando), Rashtriya Rifles, is also affiliated to the Parachute Regiment, for special operations conducted by the counter-insurgency force.\n\n===Israel===\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - First Operational Parachuting Drill in 15 Years (21).jpg|thumb|35th Brigade during training.]]\n[[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) paratroopers have a history of carrying out special forces-style missions dating back to the 1950s. Paratrooper Brigade soldiers wear [[maroon berets]] with the infantry pin and reddish-brown boots. Distinct from all other soldiers of the IDF, Paratroopers wear a tunic and belt over the shirt. The IDF has one active paratrooper brigade and four reserve brigades consisting of personnel who served their mandatory time in the 35th brigade, and who are mostly relatively recently discharged, aside from officers.

A second smaller unit is the [[4th Alpini Parachutist Regiment]] \"Monte Cervino\".\n\nThe Folgore operates as [[Light Infantry]] with airborne drop and air transport capability, equipped with modest mechanization that is framed in the Forces of Projection to the dependencies of 1\u00b0Commando FOD.\n\nThe first units of Italian parachutists were trained and formed shortly before the Second World War in [[RAF Castel Benito|Castel Benito]], near [[Tripoli]], where the first Military school of Parachuting was located.\n\nThe first troops trained were two [[Libya]]n battalions of the [[Royal Colonial Corps]]. These were added to the first battalion of Italian troops and the [[Carabinieri Regiment \"Tuscania\"]].\n\nLater in Italy, the staff at Castelbenito was expanded into the School at [[Tarquinia]] and became the first elements of the future Division Folgore.\n\nIn 1941, a Parachutist division was completed and was designated the [[185th Parachute Division Folgore]].  It was trained for the assault on [[Malta]] in [[Operation Hercules]] and was engaged in ground combat operations in the [[North African Campaign]].  During the [[Second battle of El Alamein]], it resisted the attack of six British divisions, thus provoking the respect and admiration of the British. \n\nThe 185th Regiment is included in the Brigade Parachutists Folgore and is generally in charge of the training and preparation of units; but it can be converted to other tasks depending on the technical and functional plan, from employment on land with the Commando Operations of Special Forces (COFS) and other units of river basin FS/FOS of the Army, with the [[Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei e Incursori Teseo Tesei]] (GOI) of the Navy (Marina Militare), with the [[17\u00ba Stormo Incursori]] Unit of the Air Force and for some functions also with the [[Gruppo di Intervento Speciale]] (GIS) of the Carabinieri officers.\n\nUnits from Parachute Artillery Regiments form the basis of the Special Operations component of the Regiment, from the moment that recon became part of its own tasks, as well as the acquisition of targets and the guidance of laser and precision munitions deployed by air.\n\nOfficers, non-commissioned officers and Troops of the unit (all volunteers) are recruited by public competitions announced by the Army, with candidates (pending verification of psycho-physical requirements) coming from other units of the Italian Army. An intensive course of the duration of approximately two years is required to obtain the qualification of \"Acquisitore\" (Target Acquisitor).\n\n*The Regiment has been engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq\n*The Brigade has been employed in numerous peacekeeping missions in the recent years.\n\n====Operations====\nIn 1982 the Italian Brigade Folgore landed in [[Beirut]] with the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]].\nIn 1991, a Parachutist Tactical group was deployed to [[Kurdistan]]. Its mission was to provide humanitarian aid. From July 1992, the Brigade supplied personnel to [[Operation Vespri Siciliani]]. The Folgore participated in [[Operation Restore Hope]] in [[Somalia]] from 3 December 1992 to September 1993. Parts of the Brigade have been employed many times in the [[Balkans]] (IFOR/SFOR in [[Bosnia]] and KFOR in [[Kosovo]]), with MNF in [[Albania]] and [[INTERFET]] in [[East Timor]]. The Folgore participated from August 2005 to September 2005 in [[Operation Opera|Operation Babylon]] in [[Iraq]] and to December 2014 in [[Afghanistan]].\n\nIn August 2007, the Folgore took part in [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]], under aegis of the [[United Nations]] (Resolution 1701), as a result of the war between [[Israel]] and [[Hezbollah]] of summer 2006.\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{Main|Teishin Shudan}}\n\n{{Nihongo|'''''Teishin Shudan'''''|\u633a\u9032\u96c6\u56e3|Raiding Group}} was a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[special forces]]/[[airborne forces|airborne]] unit during [[World War II]].

The British government, however, pressured the Poles into allowing the unit to be used in the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western theatre of war]]. [[Operation Market Garden]] eventually saw the unit sent into action in support of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]] at the [[Battle of Arnhem]] in 1944. The Poles were initially landed by glider from 18 September, whilst, due to bad weather over England, the parachute section of the Brigade was held up, and jumped on 21 September at [[Driel]] on the South bank of the Rhine. The Poles suffered significant casualties during the next few days of fighting, but still were able, by their presence, to cause around 2,500 German troops to be diverted to deal with them for fear of them supporting the remnants of 1st Airborne trapped over the lower Rhine in Oosterbeek.\n\nThe Brigade was originally trained close to [[RAF Ringway]] and later in [[Upper Largo]] in Scotland. It was finally based in Lincolnshire, close to [[RAF Spitalgate]] (Grantham) where it continued training until its eventual departure for Europe after D-Day.\n\nThe Brigade was formed by the Polish High Command in exile with the aim of it being used to support the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish resistance]] during the [[Operation Tempest|nationwide uprising]], a plan that encountered opposition from the British, who argued they would not be able to support it properly.<ref name=\"ZalogaHook1982\">{{cite book|author1=Steven J.

It was slotted to take part in several operations after the [[invasion of Normandy]], but all of them were cancelled.<ref name=\"ZalogaHook1982\"/> On 27 July, aware of the imminent [[Warsaw Uprising]], the [[Polish government in exile]] asked the British government for air support, including dropping the Brigade in the vicinity of Warsaw.<ref name=\"Ciechanowski2002\">{{cite book|author=Jan M.

This left Sosabowski without any anti-tank capability. The light artillery battery was left behind in England due to a shortage of gliders. Owing to bad weather and a shortage of transport planes, the drop into [[Driel]] was delayed by two days, to 21 September. The British units which were supposed to cover the landing zone were in a bad situation and out of radio contact with the main Allied forces.<ref name=\"ZalogaHook1982\"/> Finally, the 2nd Battalion, and elements of the 3rd Battalion, with support troops from the Brigade's Medical Company, Engineer Company and HQ Company, were dropped under German fire east of Driel. They overran Driel, after it was realised that the Heveadorp ferry had been destroyed. In Driel, the Polish paratroopers set up a defensive \"hedgehog\" position, from which over the next two nights further attempts were made to cross the Rhine.\n\nThe following day, the Poles were able to produce some makeshift boats and attempt a crossing. With great difficulty and under German fire from the heights of Westerbouwing on the north bank of the river, the 8th Parachute Company and, later, additional troops from 3rd Battalion, managed to cross the Rhine in two attempts. In total, about 200 Polish paratroopers made it across in two days, and were able to cover the subsequent withdrawal of the remnants of the [[British 1st Airborne Division]].\n\nOn 26 September 1944, the Brigade (now including the 1st Battalion and elements of the 3rd Battalion, who were parachuted near to Grave on 23 September) was ordered to march towards [[Nijmegen]]. The Brigade had lost 25% of its fighting strength, amounting to 590 casualties.<ref name=\"ZalogaHook1982\"/>\n\nIn 1945, the Brigade was attached to the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]] and undertook occupation duties in Northern Germany until it was disbanded on 30 June 1947. The majority of its soldiers chose to stay in exile rather than hazard returning to the [[History of Poland (1945\u201389)|new Communist Poland]].\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main|Portuguese Paratroopers}}\nThe first Portuguese paratroopers were part of a small [[commando]] unit, organized in [[Australia]], during World War II, with the objective to be dropped in the rearguard of the Japanese troops that were occupying [[Portuguese Timor]].\n\nHowever, the first regular parachute unit was only created in 1955, by the [[Portuguese Air Force]], as the Parachute ''[[Ca\u00e7adores]]'' Battalion. This unit adopted the [[green beret]], which has become, since then, the principal emblem of the Portuguese paratroopers. The Battalion was expanded to a Regiment and additional parachute battalions were created in the Portuguese overseas territories of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]]. These units were actively engaged in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], from 1961 to 1975, being involved both in airborne and air assault operations. In addition to the regular units of paratroopers, in Mozambique were also created the [[Special Groups (Portugal)|Parachute Special Groups]], composed of African irregular troops who wore a [[maroon beret]].\n\nWith the end of the Colonial War, the Portuguese parachute troops were reorganized as the Paratroopers Corps, with the Light Parachute Brigade as its operational unit. In 1993, the Paratroopers Corps was transferred from the Portuguese Air Force to the [[Portuguese Army]] and become the Airborne Troops Command, with the Independent Airborne Brigade as its operational unit.\n\nThe reorganization of the Portuguese Army in 2006 caused the extinction of the Airborne Troops Command. The Independent Airborne Brigade was transformed in the present [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade|Rapid Reaction Brigade]], which now includes not only parachute troops but also [[Special Operations Troops Centre|special operations]] and [[Portuguese Army Commandos|commando troops]].\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Russian Airborne Troops}}\n[[Image:Russian paratroopers 106th VDD.JPG|thumb|left|Russian paratroopers]]\n[[Russian Airborne Troops]] were first formed in the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] during the mid-1930s and arguably were the first regular paratrooper units in the world. They were massively expanded during [[World War II]], forming ten Airborne Corps plus numerous Independent Airborne Brigades, with most or all achieving [[Russian Guards|Guards]] status. The 9th Guards Army was eventually formed with three Guards Rifle Corps (37,38,39) of Airborne divisions. One of the new units was the [[Soviet 100th Guards Rifle Division|100th Airborne Division]].\n\nAt the end of the war they were reconstituted as Guards Rifle Divisions. They were later rebuilt during the [[Cold War]], eventually forming seven Airborne Divisions, an Independent Airborne regiment and sixteen Air Assault Brigades. These divisions were formed into their own VDV commands (Vozdushno-Desantnye Voyska) to give the Soviets a rapid strike force to spearhead strategic military operations.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a reduction in airborne divisions. Three [[Russian Airborne Troops|VDV]] divisions have been disbanded, as well as one brigade and a brigade-sized training centre. Nevertheless, Russian Airborne Troops are still the largest in the world.\n\nVDV troops participated in the rapid deployment of Russian forces in and around [[Pristina]] airport during the [[Kosovo War]]. They were also deployed in [[Chechnya]] as an active bridgehead for other forces to follow.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{main|1 Parachute Battalion}}\n[[File:Para Course Image 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]\n\n===Spain===\nIn Spain, the three branches of the Armed Forces have paratrooper units, the biggest in number being the Army's Paratrooper Brigade in Paracuellos de Jarama [[Paratrooper Brigade (Spain)|BRIPAC]]. All members of the special forces in the Navy (Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial), the Army and the Air Force must be certified as paratrooper and pass the HALO-HAHO examinations each year.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====British Army====\n\nThe [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] has its origins in the elite force of [[British Commandos|Commandos]] set up by the [[British Army]] at the request of [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], during the initial phase of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Churchill had been an enthusiast of the concept of airborne warfare since the [[World War I|First World War]], when he had proposed the creation of a force that might assault the German flanks deep behind the trenches of the static [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref>Reproduced in Blunt, Victor, ''The User of Air Power''. Military Service Publishing Company; Harrisburg, 1943: ppv-ix.</ref> In 1940 and in the aftermath of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]], Churchill's interest was caught again by the idea of taking the fight back to Europe \u2013 the airborne was now a means ''to be able to storm a series of water obstacles... everywhere from the Channel to the Mediterranean and in the East''.<ref>Browning, F. \"Airborne Forces\", RUSI Journal 89, no. 556 (1944): pp350-361.</ref>\n[[File:British Paratroops inside one of the C-47 transport aircraft.jpg|thumb|British paratroopers inside one of the C-47 transport aircraft, September 1944]]\nEnthusiasts within the British armed forces were inspired in the creation of airborne forces (including the Parachute Regiment, [[Air Landing Regiment]], and the [[Glider Pilot Regiment]]) by the example of the German Luftwaffe's [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]], which had a major role in the invasions of Norway, and the Low Countries, particularly the attack on [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium, and a pivotal, but costly role in the [[Battle of Crete|invasion of Crete]]. From the perspective of others, however, the proposed airborne units had a key weakness: they required exactly the same resources as the new strategic bomber capability, another high priority, and would also compete with the badly stretched strategic air lift capability, essential to Churchill's strategy in the Far East.<ref>Slessor, John \"Some Reflections on Airborne Forces\" ''Army Quarterly'', 1948, p161.</ref> It took the continued reintervention of Churchill to ensure that sufficient aircraft were devoted to the airborne project to make it viable.\n\nBritain's first airborne assault took place on February 10, 1941 when, what was then known as II [[Special Air Service]] (some 37 men of 500 trained in [[No. 2 Commando]] plus three Italian interpreters), parachuted into Italy to blow up an aqueduct in a daring raid named [[Operation Colossus]]. After the Battle of Crete, it was agreed that Britain would need many more paratroopers for similar operations. No 2 Commando were tasked with specialising in airborne assault and became the nucleus of the Parachute Regiment, becoming the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st Battalion]]. The larger scale drops in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] by the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] in 1943 met with mixed success, and some commanders concluded the airborne experiment was a failure.<ref>Hand, Roger \"Overlord and Operational Art\" ''Military Review'', 1995:87</ref> Once again, it took the reintervention of senior British political leaders, looking ahead to the potential needs of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], to continue the growth in British airborne resources.\n\nExtensive successful drops were made during the [[Normandy landings]] by the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] (see [[Operation Tonga]]), under the command of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Richard Gale (British Army officer)|Richard Nelson Gale]], but [[Operation Market Garden]] against [[Battle of Arnhem|Arnhem]] with the 1st Airborne Division under [[Roy Urquhart]] were less successful, and proved, in the famous phrase, to be ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge too far]]'' and the 1st Airborne was virtually destroyed. Later large scale drops, such as those on the Rhine under [[Operation Varsity]] and involving the British 6th and the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|US 17th]], were successful, but less ambitious in their intent to seize ground. After the war, there was fierce debate within the cash-strapped British armed forces as to the value of airborne forces. Many noted the unique contribution they had made within the campaign.<ref>See for example, Gale, Richard, ''With the 6th Airborne Division in Normandy'', Sampson Low: London, 1948.</ref> Others pointed to the extreme costs involved and the need for strict prioritisation.<ref>Slessor, John \"Some Reflections on Airborne Forces\" ''Army Quarterly'', 1948, p164.</ref> During the debate, the contribution of British airborne forces in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Far Eastern theatres]] was perhaps underplayed,<ref>See for example their contribution to General Slim's [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim#Burma campaign|Burma campaign.]]</ref> to the long term detriment of the argument.\n\n====Royal Air Force====\nSeveral parachute squadrons of the [[Royal Air Force Regiment]] were formed in World War II in order to secure airfields for the [[RAF]] \u2013 this capability is currently operated by [[No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment|II Squadron]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafregiment/roles/|title=RAF Regiment Roles|publisher=Raf.mod.uk|accessdate=2014-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309182202/https://www.raf.mod.uk/rafregiment/roles/|archive-date=2014-03-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[Image:Paratroopers fsa 8e00223.jpg|thumb|left|WWII U.S. paratroopers]]\nIn 1930, the U.S. Army experimented with the concept of parachuting three-man heavy-machine-gun teams.

The platoon leader was [[William T. Ryder|1st Lieutenant William T. Ryder]], who made the first jump on August 16, 1940 at Lawson Field, Fort Benning, Georgia from a [[B-18 Bolo|B-18 Bomber]]. He was immediately followed by Private William N.

It was strictly an ad hoc test of principle and not a recognized official airborne unit.</ref><ref>While the United States had the first official airborne unit in the Americas the title for the first combat use of airborne forces in the Americas goes to Peru which had a small unit of paratroopers trained by Italy which during the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War#War|Zarumilla War]] of 1941 dropped on 27 July a small number of paratroopers to seize the river port of Port Bolivar in disputed territory. The paratroopers were dropped from [[Caproni Ca.111|Ca. 111 R.C.]] aircraft. See [[Paratrooper#External links|external links]] for Peruvian article translated.</ref>\n\nAlthough airborne units were not popular with the top U.S. Armed Forces commanders, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sponsored the concept, and Major General [[William C. Lee]] organized the first paratroop platoon. This led to the Provisional Parachute Group, and then the [[United States Army Airborne Command]]. General Lee was the first commander at the new parachute school at [[Fort Benning]], in west-central [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\nThe U.S. Armed Forces regards [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William C.

The veracity of this claim is difficult to ascertain, though some recent ethnohistorians specialising in early Spanish/Nahua relations have discarded it as post-conquest mythicalisation.<ref>Restall 2003, chapter 6</ref>\n\nMuch of the idea of Cort\u00e9s being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex, written some 50 years after the conquest. In the codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cort\u00e9s, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which as described verbatim in the codex (written by Sahag\u00fan's Tlatelolcan informants) included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as, \"You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you,\" and, \"You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth.\" While some historians such as [[Warren H. Carroll]] consider this as evidence that Moctezuma was at least open to the possibility that the Spaniards were divinely sent based on the [[Quetzalcoatl]] legend, others such as Matthew Restall argue that Moctezuma politely offering his throne to Cort\u00e9s (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean, as politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority.<ref>Restall, 2003, p. 97</ref> Other parties have also propagated the idea that the Native Americans believed the conquistadors to be gods, most notably the historians of the [[Franciscan]] order such as [[Friar|Fray]] [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Mendieta]].<ref>Mart\u00ednez 1980</ref> [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]], who compiled the Florentine Codex, was also a Franciscan priest.\n\n===Indigenous accounts of omens and Moctezuma's beliefs===\n[[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] (1499\u20131590) includes in Book 12 of the [[Florentine Codex]] eight events said to have occurred prior to the arrival of the Spanish. These were purportedly interpreted as signs of a possible disaster, e.g. a comet, the burning of a temple, a crying ghostly woman, and others. Some speculate that the Aztecs were particularly susceptible to such ideas of doom and disaster because the particular year in which the Spanish arrived coincided with a \"tying of years\" ceremony at the end of a 52-year cycle in the Aztec calendar, which in Aztec belief was linked to changes, rebirth, and dangerous events. The belief of the Aztecs being rendered passive by their own superstition is referred to by Matthew Restall as part of \"The Myth of Native Desolation\" to which he dedicates chapter 6 in his book [[Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest]].<ref>Restall, 2003, chapter 6</ref> These legends are likely a part of the post-conquest rationalization by the Aztecs of their defeat, and serve to show Moctezuma as indecisive, vain, and superstitious, and ultimately the cause of the fall of the Aztec Empire.<ref name=\"Lockhart 1993, pp. 17\u201319\" />\n\nEthnohistorian [[Susan Gillespie]] has argued that the Nahua understanding of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests. In this interpretation the description of Moctezuma, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire prior to the Spanish conquest, was tailored to fit the role of earlier rulers of ending dynasties\u2014for example Quetzalcoatl, the mythical last ruler of the [[Toltec]]s.<ref>Gillespie, 1989, Chapter 5.</ref> In any case it is within the realm of possibility that the description of Moctezuma in post-conquest sources was colored by his role as a monumental closing figure of Aztec history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Contact with the Spanish ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] -->\n{{See also|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Fall of Tenochtitlan}}\n\n===First interactions with the Spanish===\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Monumento de Moctezuma y Hernan Cort\u00e9s.jpg|left|thumb|Meeting place of Moctezuma and Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]\n\nIn 1517, Moctezuma received the first reports of Europeans landing on the east coast of his empire; this was the expedition of [[Juan de Grijalva]] who had landed on [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], which although within [[Totonac]] territory was under the auspices of the Aztec Empire. Moctezuma ordered that he be kept informed of any new sightings of foreigners at the coast and posted extra watch guards to accomplish this.<ref>D\u00edaz del Castillo 1963: 220</ref>\n\n[[File:COM_V2_D091_2_The_swollen_tide_of_their_passions_broke_through_all_barriers_of_ancient_reverence.png|thumb|left|200px|The swollen tide of their passions broke through all barriers of ancient reverence 2]]\n\nWhen Cort\u00e9s arrived in 1519, Moctezuma was immediately informed and he sent emissaries to meet the newcomers; one of them known to be an Aztec noble named Tentlil in the Nahuatl language but referred to in the writings of Cort\u00e9s and Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo as \"Tendile\". As the Spaniards approached Tenochtitlan they made an alliance with the [[Tlaxcaltec]]a, who were enemies of the Aztec Triple Alliance, and they helped instigate revolt in many towns under Aztec dominion. Moctezuma was aware of this and he sent gifts to the Spaniards, probably in order to show his superiority to the Spaniards and Tlaxcalteca.<ref>Restall, Matthew. ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''. [[Oxford University Press]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-19-516077-0}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 1519, Moctezuma met Cort\u00e9s on the causeway leading into Tenochtitlan and the two leaders exchanged gifts. Moctezuma gave Cort\u00e9s the gift of an Aztec calendar, one disc of crafted gold and another of silver. Cort\u00e9s later melted these down for their monetary value.<ref>D\u00edaz del Castillo 1963: 216\u201319</ref>\n\nAccording to Cortes, Moctezuma immediately volunteered to cede his entire realm to Charles V, King of Spain. Though some indigenous accounts written in the 1550s partly supported his words, it is still unbelievable for several reasons. As Aztec rulers spoke an overly polite language that needed translation for his subjects to understand, it is difficult to find out what Moctezuma really said. According to an indigenous account, he said to Cortes: \"You have come to sit on your seat of authority, which I have kept for a while for you, where I have been in charge for you, for your agents the rulers...\"However, these words might be a polite expression that was meant to convey the opposite meaning, which was common in Nahua culture. What Moctezuma really meant could be to assert his own stature and multigenerational legitimacy. Also, according to the Spanish law, the king had no right to demand that foreign peoples become his subjects, but he had every right to bring rebels to heel. Therefore, to give the Spanish the necessary legitimacy to wage war against the indigenous people, Cortes might just have said what the Spanish king needed to hear.<ref>Townsend, Camilla.

Moctezuma continued to govern his empire and even undertook conquests of new territory during the Spaniards' stay at Tenochtitlan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nAt some time during that period, Moctezuma became a prisoner in his own house. Exactly why this happened is not clear from the extant sources. The Aztec nobility reportedly became increasingly displeased with the large Spanish army staying in Tenochtitlan, and Moctezuma told Cort\u00e9s that it would be best if they left. Shortly thereafter, Cort\u00e9s left to fight [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]. During his absence, tensions between Spaniards and Aztecs exploded into the [[Massacre in the Great Temple]], and Moctezuma became a hostage used by the Spaniards to ensure their security.<ref group=\"N.B.\">See the account of Moctezuma's captivity, as given in D\u00edaz del Castillo (1963, pp.&nbsp;245\u2013299).</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:The Florentine Codex- Moctezuma's Death and Cremation .tif|thumb|left|Death and cremation of Moctezuma as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]], Book 12]]\nIn the subsequent battles with the Spaniards after Cort\u00e9s' return, Moctezuma was killed.

Four leaders of the Aztec army met with Moctezuma to talk, urging their countrymen to cease their constant firing upon the stronghold for a time. D\u00edaz states:\n\n\"Many of the Mexican Chieftains and Captains knew him well and at once ordered their people to be silent and not to discharge darts, stones or arrows, and four of them reached a spot where Montezuma could speak to them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=D\u00edaz|first1=Bernal|editor1-last=Carrasco|editor1-first=Dav\u00edd|title=The History of the Conquest of New Spain|date=2008|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-4287-4|page=222|url=https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1479413/files/57622696/download|accessdate=22 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nD\u00edaz alleges that the Aztecs informed Moctezuma that a relative of his had risen to the throne and ordered their attack to continue until all of the Spanish were annihilated, but expressed remorse at Moctezuma's captivity and stated that they intended to revere him even more if they could rescue him. Regardless of the earlier orders to hold fire, however, the discussion between Moctezuma and the Aztec leaders was immediately followed by an outbreak of violence. The Aztecs, disgusted by the actions of their leader, renounced Moctezuma and named Cuitlahuac in his place. In an effort to pacify his people, and undoubtedly pressured by the Spanish, Moctezuma was struck dead by a rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Montezuma/|title=Montezuma|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|date=October 10, 2013|website=www.ancient.eu|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> Bernal D\u00edaz gives this account:\n\n\"They had hardly finished this speech when suddenly such a shower of stones and darts were discharged that (our men who were shielding him having neglected for a moment their duty, because they saw how the attack ceased while he spoke to them) he was hit by three stones, one on the head, another on the arm and another on the leg, and although they begged him to have the wounds dressed and to take food, and spoke kind words to him about it, he would not.

In Book 12 of the twelve-volume [[Florentine Codex]], the account in Spanish and Nahuatl is accompanied by illustrations by natives. One is of the death of Moctezuma II, which the indigenous assert was due to the Spaniards. According to the Codex, the bodies of Moctezuma and [[Itzquauhtzin]] were cast out of the Palace by the Spanish; the body of Moctezuma was gathered up and cremated at [[Copulco]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Spaniards were forced to flee the city and they took refuge in Tlaxcala, and signed a treaty with them to conquer Tenochtitlan, offering to the Tlaxcalans freedom from any kind of tribute and the control of Tenochtitlan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nardo |first1=Don |title=The Spanish Conquistadors |date=2009 |publisher=Lucent Books |page=57}}</ref>\n\nMoctezuma was then succeeded by his brother [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]], who died shortly after during a [[smallpox]] epidemic. He was succeeded by his adolescent nephew, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]]. During the siege of the city, the sons of Moctezuma were murdered by the Aztecs, possibly because they wanted to surrender. By the following year, the Aztec empire had fallen to an army of Spanish and their Native American allies, primarily [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcala]]ns who were traditional enemies of the Aztecs.\n\nFollowing the conquest, Moctezuma's daughter, Techichpotzin (or Tecuichpoch), became known as [[Isabel Moctezuma]].

The veracity of this claim is difficult to ascertain, though some recent ethnohistorians specialising in early Spanish/Nahua relations have discarded it as post-conquest mythicalisation.<ref>Restall 2003, chapter 6</ref>\n\nMuch of the idea of Cort\u00e9s being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex, written some 50 years after the conquest. In the codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cort\u00e9s, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which as described verbatim in the codex (written by Sahag\u00fan's Tlatelolcan informants) included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as, \"You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you,\" and, \"You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth.\" While some historians such as [[Warren H. Carroll]] consider this as evidence that Moctezuma was at least open to the possibility that the Spaniards were divinely sent based on the [[Quetzalcoatl]] legend, others such as Matthew Restall argue that Moctezuma politely offering his throne to Cort\u00e9s (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean, as politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority.<ref>Restall, 2003, p. 97</ref> Other parties have also propagated the idea that the Native Americans believed the conquistadors to be gods, most notably the historians of the [[Franciscan]] order such as [[Friar|Fray]] [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Mendieta]].<ref>Mart\u00ednez 1980</ref> [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]], who compiled the Florentine Codex, was also a Franciscan priest.\n\n===Indigenous accounts of omens and Moctezuma's beliefs===\n[[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] (1499\u20131590) includes in Book 12 of the [[Florentine Codex]] eight events said to have occurred prior to the arrival of the Spanish. These were purportedly interpreted as signs of a possible disaster, e.g. a comet, the burning of a temple, a crying ghostly woman, and others. Some speculate that the Aztecs were particularly susceptible to such ideas of doom and disaster because the particular year in which the Spanish arrived coincided with a \"tying of years\" ceremony at the end of a 52-year cycle in the Aztec calendar, which in Aztec belief was linked to changes, rebirth, and dangerous events. The belief of the Aztecs being rendered passive by their own superstition is referred to by Matthew Restall as part of \"The Myth of Native Desolation\" to which he dedicates chapter 6 in his book [[Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest]].<ref>Restall, 2003, chapter 6</ref> These legends are likely a part of the post-conquest rationalization by the Aztecs of their defeat, and serve to show Moctezuma as indecisive, vain, and superstitious, and ultimately the cause of the fall of the Aztec Empire.<ref name=\"Lockhart 1993, pp. 17\u201319\" />\n\nEthnohistorian [[Susan Gillespie]] has argued that the Nahua understanding of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests. In this interpretation the description of Moctezuma, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire prior to the Spanish conquest, was tailored to fit the role of earlier rulers of ending dynasties\u2014for example Quetzalcoatl, the mythical last ruler of the [[Toltec]]s.<ref>Gillespie, 1989, Chapter 5.</ref> In any case it is within the realm of possibility that the description of Moctezuma in post-conquest sources was colored by his role as a monumental closing figure of Aztec history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Contact with the Spanish ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] -->\n{{See also|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Fall of Tenochtitlan}}\n\n===First interactions with the Spanish===\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Monumento de Moctezuma y Hernan Cort\u00e9s.jpg|left|thumb|Meeting place of Moctezuma and Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]\n\nIn 1517, Moctezuma received the first reports of Europeans landing on the east coast of his empire; this was the expedition of [[Juan de Grijalva]] who had landed on [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], which although within [[Totonac]] territory was under the auspices of the Aztec Empire.

As the Spaniards approached Tenochtitlan they made an alliance with the [[Tlaxcaltec]]a, who were enemies of the Aztec Triple Alliance, and they helped instigate revolt in many towns under Aztec dominion. Moctezuma was aware of this and he sent gifts to the Spaniards, probably in order to show his superiority to the Spaniards and Tlaxcalteca.<ref>Restall, Matthew. ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''. [[Oxford University Press]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-19-516077-0}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 1519, Moctezuma met Cort\u00e9s on the causeway leading into Tenochtitlan and the two leaders exchanged gifts. Moctezuma gave Cort\u00e9s the gift of an Aztec calendar, one disc of crafted gold and another of silver. Cort\u00e9s later melted these down for their monetary value.<ref>D\u00edaz del Castillo 1963: 216\u201319</ref>\n\nAccording to Cortes, Moctezuma immediately volunteered to cede his entire realm to Charles V, King of Spain. Though some indigenous accounts written in the 1550s partly supported his words, it is still unbelievable for several reasons. As Aztec rulers spoke an overly polite language that needed translation for his subjects to understand, it is difficult to find out what Moctezuma really said. According to an indigenous account, he said to Cortes: \"You have come to sit on your seat of authority, which I have kept for a while for you, where I have been in charge for you, for your agents the rulers...\"However, these words might be a polite expression that was meant to convey the opposite meaning, which was common in Nahua culture. What Moctezuma really meant could be to assert his own stature and multigenerational legitimacy. Also, according to the Spanish law, the king had no right to demand that foreign peoples become his subjects, but he had every right to bring rebels to heel. Therefore, to give the Spanish the necessary legitimacy to wage war against the indigenous people, Cortes might just have said what the Spanish king needed to hear.<ref>Townsend, Camilla.

Moctezuma continued to govern his empire and even undertook conquests of new territory during the Spaniards' stay at Tenochtitlan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nAt some time during that period, Moctezuma became a prisoner in his own house. Exactly why this happened is not clear from the extant sources. The Aztec nobility reportedly became increasingly displeased with the large Spanish army staying in Tenochtitlan, and Moctezuma told Cort\u00e9s that it would be best if they left. Shortly thereafter, Cort\u00e9s left to fight [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]. During his absence, tensions between Spaniards and Aztecs exploded into the [[Massacre in the Great Temple]], and Moctezuma became a hostage used by the Spaniards to ensure their security.<ref group=\"N.B.\">See the account of Moctezuma's captivity, as given in D\u00edaz del Castillo (1963, pp.&nbsp;245\u2013299).</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:The Florentine Codex- Moctezuma's Death and Cremation .tif|thumb|left|Death and cremation of Moctezuma as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]], Book 12]]\nIn the subsequent battles with the Spaniards after Cort\u00e9s' return, Moctezuma was killed.

Four leaders of the Aztec army met with Moctezuma to talk, urging their countrymen to cease their constant firing upon the stronghold for a time. D\u00edaz states:\n\n\"Many of the Mexican Chieftains and Captains knew him well and at once ordered their people to be silent and not to discharge darts, stones or arrows, and four of them reached a spot where Montezuma could speak to them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=D\u00edaz|first1=Bernal|editor1-last=Carrasco|editor1-first=Dav\u00edd|title=The History of the Conquest of New Spain|date=2008|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-4287-4|page=222|url=https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1479413/files/57622696/download|accessdate=22 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nD\u00edaz alleges that the Aztecs informed Moctezuma that a relative of his had risen to the throne and ordered their attack to continue until all of the Spanish were annihilated, but expressed remorse at Moctezuma's captivity and stated that they intended to revere him even more if they could rescue him. Regardless of the earlier orders to hold fire, however, the discussion between Moctezuma and the Aztec leaders was immediately followed by an outbreak of violence. The Aztecs, disgusted by the actions of their leader, renounced Moctezuma and named Cuitlahuac in his place. In an effort to pacify his people, and undoubtedly pressured by the Spanish, Moctezuma was struck dead by a rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Montezuma/|title=Montezuma|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|date=October 10, 2013|website=www.ancient.eu|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> Bernal D\u00edaz gives this account:\n\n\"They had hardly finished this speech when suddenly such a shower of stones and darts were discharged that (our men who were shielding him having neglected for a moment their duty, because they saw how the attack ceased while he spoke to them) he was hit by three stones, one on the head, another on the arm and another on the leg, and although they begged him to have the wounds dressed and to take food, and spoke kind words to him about it, he would not.

In Book 12 of the twelve-volume [[Florentine Codex]], the account in Spanish and Nahuatl is accompanied by illustrations by natives. One is of the death of Moctezuma II, which the indigenous assert was due to the Spaniards. According to the Codex, the bodies of Moctezuma and [[Itzquauhtzin]] were cast out of the Palace by the Spanish; the body of Moctezuma was gathered up and cremated at [[Copulco]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Spaniards were forced to flee the city and they took refuge in Tlaxcala, and signed a treaty with them to conquer Tenochtitlan, offering to the Tlaxcalans freedom from any kind of tribute and the control of Tenochtitlan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nardo |first1=Don |title=The Spanish Conquistadors |date=2009 |publisher=Lucent Books |page=57}}</ref>\n\nMoctezuma was then succeeded by his brother [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]], who died shortly after during a [[smallpox]] epidemic. He was succeeded by his adolescent nephew, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]]. During the siege of the city, the sons of Moctezuma were murdered by the Aztecs, possibly because they wanted to surrender.

Accessed: November 2, 2018.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Syracuse, New York}}\n\nThe name ''Onondaga'' derives from the name of the Native American [[tribe (Native American)|tribe]] who lived in this area at the time of European contact, one of the original [[Iroquois|Five Nations]] of the ''Haudenosaunee''. They called themselves ([[Endonym|autonym]]) [[Onondaga people|''Onoda'gega'']], sometimes spelled ''Onontakeka.'' The word means \"People of the Hills.\" Sometimes the term was ''Onondagaono'' (\"The People of the Hills\"). The federally recognized Onondaga Nation has a {{convert|9.3|sqmi|km2|0}} [[Indian reservation|reservation]] within the county, on which they have self-government.\n\nWhen counties were established in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1683, the present Onondaga County was part of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This enormous county included the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extended westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\n[[Image:Oneida Lake seen from Yacht Club in Cicero New York.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Oneida Lake borders Onondaga County to the northeast. It is the largest lake wholly within the state of New York. This picture was taken from the town of Cicero, a northern suburban town in the northeast part of Onondaga County.]]\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the [[Loyalists]] in [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]] fled to [[Canada]]. The Onondaga were among four Iroquois tribes that allied with the British against the American colonists, as they hoped to end their encroachment. Instead, they were forced to cede most of their land in New York to the United States after the war. Many Onondaga went with [[Joseph Brant]] and other nations to [[Canada]], where they received land grants in compensation and formed the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]].\n\nIn 1784, after a peace treaty ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[name]] of Tryon County was changed to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]]. It honored General [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]], and replaced the name of the hated British governor.\n\nIn 1789, Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne Counties]].\n\nIn 1791, Herkimer County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]], and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]]). This was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.\n\nIn 1794, Onondaga County was split off from Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], and part of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego Counties]].\n\nIn 1799, [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] was split off from Onondaga.\n\nIn 1808, [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]] was split off from Onondaga.\n\nIn 1816, parts of Oneida and Onondaga Counties were taken to form the new [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]].\n\nAt the time Onondaga County was organized, it was divided into eleven towns: Homer, Pompey, Manlius, Lysander, Marcellus, Ulysses, Milton, Scipio, Ovid, Aurelius and Romulus.<ref name=\"original\">{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofonondag00clay/historyofonondag00clay_djvu.txt|title=History of Onondaga County|accessdate=2010-08-25|publisher=Professor W.

Migration was largely from the east, mostly from New England states. The [[Genesee Road]], which became the [[Seneca Turnpike]] in 1800, provided access. Generally settlers preferred higher land, since they associated lowlands with disease. Over time, as early clearing and farming eroded hillside soil, valley lands were more fertile and highly prized for agriculture as well as for water power, which was the origin of many communities. An early settler of 1823 was [[James Hutchinson Woodworth]], a native of Washington County, NY. He helped clear land for his family's farm in this region before he moved to [[Chicago]] where he became Mayor. The completion of the [[Erie Canal]] across New York state in 1825 accelerated trade, development and migration.\n\nThe city of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]] developed relatively late, due to its marshy situation. It was incorporated as a village in 1825 and as a city in 1847; by contrast, the [[Manlius (village), New York|Village of Manlius]], along the [[Cherry Valley Turnpike|Cherry Valley]] and [[Seneca Turnpike]]s, was incorporated in 1813. The population of these rural towns was greatest in the late nineteenth century, when more people cultivated land and farms were relatively small, supporting large households.\n\nSince that time, agriculture has declined in the county. Some Onondaga County towns like [[Spafford|Spafford, New York]] were largely depopulated and many villages became veritable ghost towns. Onondaga County highlands now are more heavily reforested, with public parks and preserves providing recreation. Two [[Finger Lakes]] in the county, Skaneateles and Otisco, also attract visitors. The village of [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles]] on scenic [[Route 20]] has become a major tourist destination.\n\nAt the turn of the twenty-first century, population declined in the City of Syracuse while suburban communities generally grew, particularly with tract developments north of the city. Elsewhere, scattered commuter houses appeared, generally on fairly large parcels. The rapid development of the village of Skaneateles and shores of Skaneateles Lake led to increased demand for property and property values.\n\n[[Image:Onondaga Lake Park.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Onondaga Lake Park in the northern suburbs of Syracuse.

[[Onondaga Lake]] is bordered by many of the larger communities in the county.\n\nThe northern part of the county is fairly level lake plain, extending northward to [[Lake Ontario]]. [[Oneida Lake]] three rivers, as well as the Erie and subsequent Barge Canals are in the lake plain. The main line of the [[New York Central Railroad]] and the [[New York State Thruway]] extend east and west across the county through the lake plain. The southern part of the county is [[Appalachian Plateau]], with high hills rising at the southern edge of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. This is the eastern part of the [[Finger Lakes]] region. [[Skaneateles Lake]] and [[Otisco Lake]] are both in Onondaga County. [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US 20]] extends east and west across the county, traversing dramatic hill-and-valley terrain. Between the lake plain and Appalachian highlands is a zone noted for [[drumlins]], smaller, scattered hills formed as mounds of debris left by the last glacier. [[Tully (town), New York|Tully]] is geologically noted for the terminal moraine deposited there by the glacier, filling the deep Tully Valley, which might have been another Finger Lake had the moraine been left closer to Syracuse, impounding water. Tully is at the divide between two major watersheds, one flowing northward to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and the other southward to the ocean via the [[Susquehanna River]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ny.water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri014166/wrir01-4166.pdf|title=Hydrogeology of the Tully Lakes Area in Southern Onondaga and Northern Cortland Counties, New York|last=Kappel|first=William|last2=Miller|first2=Todd|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|access-date=2016-04-04|last3=Hetcher|first3=Kari|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221072029/http://ny.water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri014166/wrir01-4166.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-21}}</ref>  Oneida Lake, the Finger Lakes, and smaller bodies of water provide recreation.

The [[population density]] was 587 people per square mile (227/km\u00b2). There were 196,633 housing units at an average density of 252 per square&nbsp;mile (97/km\u00b2). The county's [[Race (United States Census)|racial makeup]] was 84.78% White, 9.38% African American, 0.86% Native American, 2.09% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.89% from other races, and 1.97% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 2.44% of the population. About 17.5% were of [[Italian people|Italian]], 16.2% [[Irish people|Irish]], 12.4% [[Germans|German]], 9.4% [[English people|English]], and 6.0% [[Polish people|Polish]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]], and 91.4% spoke [[English language|English]], 2.4% [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and 1.1% [[Italian language|Italian]] as their first language.\n\nOf the 181,153 households, 31.90% had children under age 18 living with them, 46.90% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 12.90% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.30% were not families. About 29.40% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.07.\n\n25.80% of the county's population was under age 18, 9.50% was from age 18 to 24, 28.80% was from age 25 to 44, 22.10% was from age 45 to 64, and 13.80% was age 65 or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.70 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.70 males.\n\nThe county's median household income was $40,847, and the median family income was $51,876. Males had a median income of $39,048 versus $27,154 for females. The county's [[per capita income]] was $21,336. About 8.60% of families and 12.20% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 15.50% of those under age 18 and 7.10% of those age 65 or over.\n\nDemographic trends (2006): The county population has decreased from a high in 1970. The increasing number of housing units apparently is due to smaller family units and more individuals living alone. While the City of Syracuse population has declined, some suburban towns have grown.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Government and politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Currently, there are 11 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 6 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].\n\nHistorically, Onondaga County was a Republican stronghold: from 1884-1988, the GOP carried the county in all but one presidential election. Beginning in 1992, the county has gone Democratic in presidential elections. At the state and local level, it is a swing county. Democratic strength is concentrated in Syracuse, while Republicans do well in the suburbs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''Onondaga County Executives'''\n! Name\n! Party\n!

Accessed: November 2, 2018.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Syracuse, New York}}\n\nThe name ''Onondaga'' derives from the name of the Native American [[tribe (Native American)|tribe]] who lived in this area at the time of European contact, one of the original [[Iroquois|Five Nations]] of the ''Haudenosaunee''. They called themselves ([[Endonym|autonym]]) [[Onondaga people|''Onoda'gega'']], sometimes spelled ''Onontakeka.'' The word means \"People of the Hills.\" Sometimes the term was ''Onondagaono'' (\"The People of the Hills\"). The federally recognized Onondaga Nation has a {{convert|9.3|sqmi|km2|0}} [[Indian reservation|reservation]] within the county, on which they have self-government.\n\nWhen counties were established in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1683, the present Onondaga County was part of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This enormous county included the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extended westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\n[[Image:Oneida Lake seen from Yacht Club in Cicero New York.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Oneida Lake borders Onondaga County to the northeast. It is the largest lake wholly within the state of New York. This picture was taken from the town of Cicero, a northern suburban town in the northeast part of Onondaga County.]]\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the [[Loyalists]] in [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]] fled to [[Canada]]. The Onondaga were among four Iroquois tribes that allied with the British against the American colonists, as they hoped to end their encroachment. Instead, they were forced to cede most of their land in New York to the United States after the war. Many Onondaga went with [[Joseph Brant]] and other nations to [[Canada]], where they received land grants in compensation and formed the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]].\n\nIn 1784, after a peace treaty ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[name]] of Tryon County was changed to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]]. It honored General [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]], and replaced the name of the hated British governor.\n\nIn 1789, Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne Counties]].\n\nIn 1791, Herkimer County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]], and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]]). This was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.\n\nIn 1794, Onondaga County was split off from Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], and part of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego Counties]].\n\nIn 1799, [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] was split off from Onondaga.\n\nIn 1808, [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]] was split off from Onondaga.\n\nIn 1816, parts of Oneida and Onondaga Counties were taken to form the new [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]].\n\nAt the time Onondaga County was organized, it was divided into eleven towns: Homer, Pompey, Manlius, Lysander, Marcellus, Ulysses, Milton, Scipio, Ovid, Aurelius and Romulus.<ref name=\"original\">{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofonondag00clay/historyofonondag00clay_djvu.txt|title=History of Onondaga County|accessdate=2010-08-25|publisher=Professor W.

Migration was largely from the east, mostly from New England states. The [[Genesee Road]], which became the [[Seneca Turnpike]] in 1800, provided access. Generally settlers preferred higher land, since they associated lowlands with disease. Over time, as early clearing and farming eroded hillside soil, valley lands were more fertile and highly prized for agriculture as well as for water power, which was the origin of many communities. An early settler of 1823 was [[James Hutchinson Woodworth]], a native of Washington County, NY. He helped clear land for his family's farm in this region before he moved to [[Chicago]] where he became Mayor. The completion of the [[Erie Canal]] across New York state in 1825 accelerated trade, development and migration.\n\nThe city of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]] developed relatively late, due to its marshy situation. It was incorporated as a village in 1825 and as a city in 1847; by contrast, the [[Manlius (village), New York|Village of Manlius]], along the [[Cherry Valley Turnpike|Cherry Valley]] and [[Seneca Turnpike]]s, was incorporated in 1813. The population of these rural towns was greatest in the late nineteenth century, when more people cultivated land and farms were relatively small, supporting large households.\n\nSince that time, agriculture has declined in the county. Some Onondaga County towns like [[Spafford|Spafford, New York]] were largely depopulated and many villages became veritable ghost towns. Onondaga County highlands now are more heavily reforested, with public parks and preserves providing recreation. Two [[Finger Lakes]] in the county, Skaneateles and Otisco, also attract visitors. The village of [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles]] on scenic [[Route 20]] has become a major tourist destination.\n\nAt the turn of the twenty-first century, population declined in the City of Syracuse while suburban communities generally grew, particularly with tract developments north of the city. Elsewhere, scattered commuter houses appeared, generally on fairly large parcels. The rapid development of the village of Skaneateles and shores of Skaneateles Lake led to increased demand for property and property values.\n\n[[Image:Onondaga Lake Park.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Onondaga Lake Park in the northern suburbs of Syracuse.

[[Onondaga Lake]] is bordered by many of the larger communities in the county.\n\nThe northern part of the county is fairly level lake plain, extending northward to [[Lake Ontario]]. [[Oneida Lake]] three rivers, as well as the Erie and subsequent Barge Canals are in the lake plain. The main line of the [[New York Central Railroad]] and the [[New York State Thruway]] extend east and west across the county through the lake plain. The southern part of the county is [[Appalachian Plateau]], with high hills rising at the southern edge of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. This is the eastern part of the [[Finger Lakes]] region. [[Skaneateles Lake]] and [[Otisco Lake]] are both in Onondaga County. [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US 20]] extends east and west across the county, traversing dramatic hill-and-valley terrain. Between the lake plain and Appalachian highlands is a zone noted for [[drumlins]], smaller, scattered hills formed as mounds of debris left by the last glacier. [[Tully (town), New York|Tully]] is geologically noted for the terminal moraine deposited there by the glacier, filling the deep Tully Valley, which might have been another Finger Lake had the moraine been left closer to Syracuse, impounding water. Tully is at the divide between two major watersheds, one flowing northward to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and the other southward to the ocean via the [[Susquehanna River]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ny.water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri014166/wrir01-4166.pdf|title=Hydrogeology of the Tully Lakes Area in Southern Onondaga and Northern Cortland Counties, New York|last=Kappel|first=William|last2=Miller|first2=Todd|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|access-date=2016-04-04|last3=Hetcher|first3=Kari|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221072029/http://ny.water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri014166/wrir01-4166.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-21}}</ref>  Oneida Lake, the Finger Lakes, and smaller bodies of water provide recreation.

The [[population density]] was 587 people per square mile (227/km\u00b2). There were 196,633 housing units at an average density of 252 per square&nbsp;mile (97/km\u00b2). The county's [[Race (United States Census)|racial makeup]] was 84.78% White, 9.38% African American, 0.86% Native American, 2.09% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.89% from other races, and 1.97% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 2.44% of the population. About 17.5% were of [[Italian people|Italian]], 16.2% [[Irish people|Irish]], 12.4% [[Germans|German]], 9.4% [[English people|English]], and 6.0% [[Polish people|Polish]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]], and 91.4% spoke [[English language|English]], 2.4% [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and 1.1% [[Italian language|Italian]] as their first language.\n\nOf the 181,153 households, 31.90% had children under age 18 living with them, 46.90% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 12.90% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.30% were not families. About 29.40% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.07.\n\n25.80% of the county's population was under age 18, 9.50% was from age 18 to 24, 28.80% was from age 25 to 44, 22.10% was from age 45 to 64, and 13.80% was age 65 or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.70 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.70 males.\n\nThe county's median household income was $40,847, and the median family income was $51,876. Males had a median income of $39,048 versus $27,154 for females. The county's [[per capita income]] was $21,336. About 8.60% of families and 12.20% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 15.50% of those under age 18 and 7.10% of those age 65 or over.\n\nDemographic trends (2006): The county population has decreased from a high in 1970. The increasing number of housing units apparently is due to smaller family units and more individuals living alone. While the City of Syracuse population has declined, some suburban towns have grown.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Government and politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Currently, there are 11 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 6 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].\n\nHistorically, Onondaga County was a Republican stronghold: from 1884-1988, the GOP carried the county in all but one presidential election. Beginning in 1992, the county has gone Democratic in presidential elections. At the state and local level, it is a swing county. Democratic strength is concentrated in Syracuse, while Republicans do well in the suburbs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''Onondaga County Executives'''\n! Name\n! Party\n!

A recipe for baumkuchen appears in ''Ein new Kochbuch'' (literally \"A New Cookbook\"), published in 1581, the first [[cookbook]] written for professional chefs by [[Marx Rumpolt]].<ref name=\"oxford\">Alan Davidson and Tom Jaine (2006). ''The Oxford companion to food''. Oxford University Press, USA, 2006. p. 805 {{ISBN|0192806815}}.</ref> Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia. In 1682, a rural medic working for [[Johann Sigismund Elsholtz]] prepared a similar dessert.\n\nAside from the above mentioned recent history, baumkuchen was already known in [[Ancient Greece]] and the latter [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Roman conquerors brought the method for baking cakes on logs over an open fire to what is today Germany and its surroundings.<ref name=\"bakingsol\" /><ref name=\"corsoela\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:Baumkuchen BMK.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Baking demonstration in Germany, here: application of the [[couverture chocolate]].]]\n[[Image:S\u0119kacz.JPG|thumb|left|190px|S\u0119kacz in Poland.]]\n[[Image:Rodez market.JPG|thumb|right|190px|G\u00e2teau \u00e0 la broche, Market of [[Rodez]], [[Aveyron]], [[Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]]]\n\nThis labor-intensive, and thus rather expensive, specialty is made on a spit by evenly brushing on thin layers of batter, then rotating the spit over a heat source, traditionally a wood fire. Each layer is allowed to dry before another layer of batter is poured over the previous.<ref name=\"treecake\">[http://www.germanculture.com.ua/recipes/blxmas13.htm Baumkuchen \u2013 the King of Cakes!]. Germanculture.com.ua (2007-11-28). Retrieved on 2013-02-04.</ref> When the cake is removed and sliced, each layer is divided from the next by a golden line, resembling the [[tree rings|growth rings]] on a crosscut tree. A typical baumkuchen is made up of 15 to 20 layers of batter.<ref name=\"corsoela\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070506075310/http://www.corsoela.de/english/baumkuchen.php Baumkuchen (Pyramid cake)]. corsoela.de</ref> Baumkuchen can be large: skilled pastry chefs have been known to create cakes with 25 layers and weighing over 100 pounds.<ref name=\"treecake\" />  When cooked on a spit, it is not uncommon for a finished baumkuchen to be 3 to 4 feet tall.<ref name=\"newyorker\">Mimi Sheraton (November 23, 2009) [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/11/23/091123fa_fact_sheraton How to bake spit cake]. The New Yorker. Retrieved on 2013-02-04.</ref>\n\nBaumkuchen ingredients are typically butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and flour. Baking powder is not considered a traditional ingredient. The ratio of flour, butter and eggs is typically 1:1:2 respectively (i.e., 100 grams of [[flour]], 100 grams of [[butter]], and 200 grams of [[egg (food)|egg]]s). The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling.<ref name=\"bakingsol\" /> Additionally, baumkuchen may be covered with sugar or chocolate [[glaze (cooking technique)|glaze]]. With some recipes, the fully baked and cooled baumkuchen is first coated with [[marmalade]] or [[jam]], and then covered with chocolate.\n\n===Baumkuchenspitzen===\nBaumkuchenspitzen, German for \"tree cake tips\", are miniature versions of baumkuchen that are created from the cake when it is cut in slices and then into pieces that are referred to as \"Spitzen\". These pieces are typically coated in chocolate and sold individually.\n\n===Schichttorte===\nA simpler horizontally layered version of the cake is called a \"Schichttorte\". It is baked without a spit, which results in horizontal layers instead of circular rings. The Schichttorte is more like a conventional cake in shape and can be baked in a conventional home oven that has a [[Grilling#Overhead grilling|broiler]] inside, whereas the traditional spit version requires special equipment normally not available in an average home. Compared to the spit variant, the Schichttorte's cross section is less reminiscent of tree rings.\n\n==In Japan==\nBaumkuchen is one of the most popular pastries in Japan, where it is called {{Nihongo||\u30d0\u30fc\u30e0\u30af\u30fc\u30d8\u30f3|b\u0101muk\u016bhen}}. It is a popular return present in Japan for wedding guests because of its typical [[wedding ring|ring]] shape.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anja Hankel |url=http://www.topia.ne.jp/awalife/awalife_nov2009.pdf |title=Loanwords in Japanese |journal=Awa Life |publisher=TOPIA |date=November 2009 |volume=232 |page=6 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722115625/http://www.topia.ne.jp/awalife/awalife_nov2009.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 }}</ref>\n\nIt was first introduced to Japan by the German [[Karl Joseph Wilhelm Juchheim]].

After the war, he chose to remain in Japan. Continued success allowed him to move to [[Yokohama]] and open a bakery, but its destruction in the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] caused him to move his operations to [[Kobe]], where he stayed until his death just before the end of [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Some years later, his wife returned to help a Japanese company open a chain of bakeries under the Juchheim name that further helped spread baumkuchen's popularity in Japan.\n\n==Other regional variations==\n[[File:Spettekaka Trdeln\u00edk Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen Baumstriezel K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs Raguolis Baumkuchen K\u00fcrt\u0151sf\u00e1nk.jpg|right|320px|thumb|The family of European Spitcakes]]\n* Austria \u2013 Baumkuchen are known as ''Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen''\n* Czech Republic \u2013 Popular under the name ''[[Trdelnik]]''\n* France \u2013 ''[[G\u00e2teau \u00e0 la broche]]''\n* Luxembourg \u2013 ''Baamkuch'' has become a traditional dish served mostly on special occasions, such as weddings, christenings, etc. Yet, the cake is available all year around in certain supermarkets.\n* Poland \u2013 Known as [[S\u0119kacz]]\n* Lithuania \u2013 [[\u0160akotis]] or Raguolis (Bankuchenas as known in western Lithuania, itself word is loanword from German ''Baumkuchen'') is a similar cake also cooked on a spit, normally over an open fire\n* Sweden \u2013 [[Spettekaka]] with the [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU)#Protected geographical indication (PGI)|protected geographical indication]] (PGI) registered by the [[European Union|EU]]\n* Hungary \u2013 ''[[K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs]]'' is a similar cake also cooked on a spit\n* Slovakia \u2013 ''[[Trdelnik|Skalick\u00fd trdeln\u00edk]]'' with the protected geographical indication (PGI) registered by the EU\n* Turkey \u2013 ''[[Makara tatl\u0131s\u0131]]'' is a similar cake also cooked on a spit.\n* Indonesia \u2013 ''[[Spekkoek]] ([[kue lapis legit]] or [[spekuk]]\uff09'' was developed during colonial times in the Dutch East Indies.

A recipe for baumkuchen appears in ''Ein new Kochbuch'' (literally \"A New Cookbook\"), published in 1581, the first [[cookbook]] written for professional chefs by [[Marx Rumpolt]].<ref name=\"oxford\">Alan Davidson and Tom Jaine (2006). ''The Oxford companion to food''. Oxford University Press, USA, 2006. p. 805 {{ISBN|0192806815}}.</ref> Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia. In 1682, a rural medic working for [[Johann Sigismund Elsholtz]] prepared a similar dessert.\n\nAside from the above mentioned recent history, baumkuchen was already known in [[Ancient Greece]] and the latter [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Roman conquerors brought the method for baking cakes on logs over an open fire to what is today Germany and its surroundings.<ref name=\"bakingsol\" /><ref name=\"corsoela\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:Baumkuchen BMK.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Baking demonstration in Germany, here: application of the [[couverture chocolate]].]]\n[[Image:S\u0119kacz.JPG|thumb|left|190px|S\u0119kacz in Poland.]]\n[[Image:Rodez market.JPG|thumb|right|190px|G\u00e2teau \u00e0 la broche, Market of [[Rodez]], [[Aveyron]], [[Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]]]\n\nThis labor-intensive, and thus rather expensive, specialty is made on a spit by evenly brushing on thin layers of batter, then rotating the spit over a heat source, traditionally a wood fire. Each layer is allowed to dry before another layer of batter is poured over the previous.<ref name=\"treecake\">[http://www.germanculture.com.ua/recipes/blxmas13.htm Baumkuchen \u2013 the King of Cakes!]. Germanculture.com.ua (2007-11-28). Retrieved on 2013-02-04.</ref> When the cake is removed and sliced, each layer is divided from the next by a golden line, resembling the [[tree rings|growth rings]] on a crosscut tree. A typical baumkuchen is made up of 15 to 20 layers of batter.<ref name=\"corsoela\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070506075310/http://www.corsoela.de/english/baumkuchen.php Baumkuchen (Pyramid cake)]. corsoela.de</ref> What is more, the method involved in creating the baumkuchen allows the cakes to become quite large: skilled pastry chefs have been known to create cakes with 25 layers and weighing over 100 pounds.<ref name=\"treecake\" />  When cooked on a spit, it is not uncommon for a finished baumkuchen to be 3 to 4 feet tall.<ref name=\"newyorker\">Mimi Sheraton (November 23, 2009) [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/11/23/091123fa_fact_sheraton How to bake spit cake].

The ratio of flour, butter and eggs is typically 1:1:2 respectively (i.e., 100 grams of [[flour]], 100 grams of [[butter]], and 200 grams of [[egg (food)|egg]]s). The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling.<ref name=\"bakingsol\" /> Additionally, baumkuchen may be covered with sugar or chocolate [[glaze (cooking technique)|glaze]]. With some recipes, the fully baked and cooled baumkuchen is first coated with [[marmalade]] or [[jam]], and then covered with chocolate.\n\n===Baumkuchenspitzen===\nBaumkuchenspitzen, German for \"tree cake tips\", are miniature versions of baumkuchen that are created from the cake when it is cut in slices and then into pieces that are referred to as \"Spitzen\". These pieces are typically coated in chocolate and sold individually.\n\n===Schichttorte===\nA simpler horizontally layered version of the cake is called a \"Schichttorte\". It is baked without a spit, which results in horizontal layers instead of circular rings. The Schichttorte is more like a conventional cake in shape and can be baked in a conventional home oven that has a [[Grilling#Overhead grilling|broiler]] inside, whereas the traditional spit version requires special equipment normally not available in an average home. Compared to the spit variant, the Schichttorte's cross section is less reminiscent of tree rings.\n\n==In Japan==\nBaumkuchen is one of the most popular pastries in Japan, where it is called {{Nihongo||\u30d0\u30fc\u30e0\u30af\u30fc\u30d8\u30f3|b\u0101muk\u016bhen}}. It is a popular return present in Japan for wedding guests because of its typical [[wedding ring|ring]] shape.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anja Hankel |url=http://www.topia.ne.jp/awalife/awalife_nov2009.pdf |title=Loanwords in Japanese |journal=Awa Life |publisher=TOPIA |date=November 2009 |volume=232 |page=6 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722115625/http://www.topia.ne.jp/awalife/awalife_nov2009.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 }}</ref>\n\nIt was first introduced to Japan by the German [[Karl Joseph Wilhelm Juchheim]]. Juchheim was in the Chinese city of [[Tsingtao]] during [[World War&nbsp;I]] when Britain and Japan laid siege to Tsingtao. He and his wife were then interned at Okinawa.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20100110cs.html Origins of baumkuchen, cheap onsen trips and this week\u2019s CM: Final Fantasy XIII | The Japan Times Online].

After the war, he chose to remain in Japan. Continued success allowed him to move to [[Yokohama]] and open a bakery, but its destruction in the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] caused him to move his operations to [[Kobe]], where he stayed until his death just before the end of [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Some years later, his wife returned to help a Japanese company open a chain of bakeries under the Juchheim name that further helped spread baumkuchen's popularity in Japan.\n\n==Other regional variations==\n[[File:Spettekaka Trdeln\u00edk Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen Baumstriezel K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs Raguolis Baumkuchen K\u00fcrt\u0151sf\u00e1nk.jpg|right|320px|thumb|The family of European Spitcakes]]\n* Austria \u2013 Baumkuchen are known as ''Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen''\n* Czech Republic \u2013 Popular under the name ''[[Trdelnik]]''\n* France \u2013 ''[[G\u00e2teau \u00e0 la broche]]''\n* Luxembourg \u2013 ''Baamkuch'' has become a traditional dish served mostly on special occasions, such as weddings, christenings, etc. Yet, the cake is available all year around in certain supermarkets.\n* Poland \u2013 Known as [[S\u0119kacz]]\n* Lithuania \u2013 [[\u0160akotis]] or Raguolis (Bankuchenas as known in western Lithuania, itself word is loanword from German ''Baumkuchen'') is a similar cake also cooked on a spit, normally over an open fire\n* Sweden \u2013 [[Spettekaka]] with the [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU)#Protected geographical indication (PGI)|protected geographical indication]] (PGI) registered by the [[European Union|EU]]\n* Hungary \u2013 ''[[K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs]]'' is a similar cake also cooked on a spit\n* Slovakia \u2013 ''[[Trdelnik|Skalick\u00fd trdeln\u00edk]]'' with the protected geographical indication (PGI) registered by the EU\n* Turkey \u2013 ''[[Makara tatl\u0131s\u0131]]'' is a similar cake also cooked on a spit.\n* Indonesia \u2013 ''[[Spekkoek]] ([[kue lapis legit]] or [[spekuk]]\uff09'' was developed during colonial times in the Dutch East Indies.
