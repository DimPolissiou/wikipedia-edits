IX.</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris enjoyed the right to the noble guard, called for them the bourgeois guard.\n\n== Birth of the bourgeoisie in Paris ==\nThe oldest [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporations]] or [[guild]]s in Paris were [[Tailor|clothiers]], [[grocers]], [[haberdasher]]s, and [[Fur clothing|furriers]].\n\nWith the water merchants, heirs of the ''nautes of Lut\u00e8ce'' who exercise the [[monopoly]] that holds the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] for the trade along the [[Seine]], and the ''Grande Boucherie'' (Big Butchery), which reunites the owners of farms of the suburbs and those of salting workshops intra and extramurals, they constitute alongside the [[clergy]] and the [[French nobility|nobility]] a [[Third estate|third power]] that will consecrate in 1357 the Great Ordinance of the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[\u00c9tienne Marcel|Etienne Marcel]], and which will become financially decisive, as the will illustrate the [[Cabochien revolt]].\n\nIn 1190, before going on a crusade, [[Philip II of France|King Philippe Auguste]] wrote his [[Will and testament|will]] and placed six \"loyal men\" at the head of the provost: Thibaut Le Riche, Athon de Greve, Evrouin Le Changeur, Robert de Chartres, Baudouin Bruneau and Nicolas Boucel.<ref>Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris'', \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, coll. \u00ab Bouquins \u00bb, 1996, 1 590 <abbr>p.</abbr> ({{ISBN|978-2221078624}}).</ref>\n\nThe ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers'' (Book of [[Tradesman|Trades]]) and the ''Livre de la taille'' (Book of the [[Taille]]), written under the provost of [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]], allow us to better understand this rising bourgeoisie. Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Latin antiquity]], others were founded around the year one thousand.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Les villes du Moyen \u00c2ge, essai d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'', Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

Pop music often borrows elements from other styles such as [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[dance music|dance]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], and [[country music|country]]; nevertheless, there are many key elements that define pop music. Identifying factors usually include short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the [[verse\u2013chorus form|verse-chorus structure]]), as well as common use of repeated choruses, melodic tunes and [[hook (music)|hooks]].\n\n==Definitions and etymology{{anchor|Etymology}}==\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|left|The 1960s [[British Invasion]] marked a period when the US charts were inundated with British acts such as [[the Beatles]] (pictured 1964).]]\n\nDavid Hatch and Stephen Millward define pop music as \"a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk musics\".<ref>D.

Corden had previously appeared as Fred's ''singing'' voice in the theatrical film ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966) and the television specials ''[[Alice in Wonderland or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?]]'' (1966) and ''[[Energy: A National Issue]]'' (1977).

The opening title sequence was a composite, using clips from the openings of the various series, along with a new title theme song.

The program is also broadcast worldwide on the [[Armed Forces Radio Network]].\n\nRadio broadcasting shifted from AM to FM in the 1970s because of the opportunity to broadcast music in stereo with better fidelity. Limbaugh's show was first nationally syndicated in August 1988, on the AM radio band. Limbaugh's popularity paved the way for other conservative talk radio programming to become commonplace on AM radio. The show increased its audience in the 1990s to the extent that even some FM stations picked it up. AM's poor sound quality and lack of stereo make a talk show format like Limbaugh's preferable for AM radio. {{As of|2019|1|post=}} about half of Limbaugh's affiliate stations are on the FM dial.\n\nIn March 2006, [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL]] in [[Baltimore]] became the first major market radio station in the country to drop Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio program.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hiaasen | first = Rob | title = WBAL Radio Cancels Rush Limbaugh: Station is First to Drop Show, Wants to Focus on Local News | newspaper = The Baltimore Sun | date = March 14, 2006 | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/427188/wbal_radio_cancels_rush_limbaugh_station_is_first_to_drop/index.html }}</ref> In 2007, ''Talkers Magazine'' again named him No.{{nbsp}}1 in its \"Heavy Hundred\" most important talk show hosts.\n\nLimbaugh frequently mentions the EIB (Excellence In Broadcasting) Network, trademarked in 1990.

McLaughlin, former president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], who founded EFM Media in 1988, with Limbaugh's show as his first product. In 1997, McLaughlin sold EFM to [[Jacor Communications]], which was ultimately bought up by Clear Channel Communications.

The program is also broadcast worldwide on the [[Armed Forces Radio Network]].\n\nRadio broadcasting shifted from AM to FM in the 1970s because of the opportunity to broadcast music in stereo with better fidelity. Limbaugh's show was first nationally syndicated in August 1988, on the AM radio band. Limbaugh's popularity paved the way for other conservative talk radio programming to become commonplace on AM radio. The show increased its audience in the 1990s to the extent that even some FM stations picked it up. AM's poor sound quality and lack of stereo make a talk show format like Limbaugh's preferable for AM radio. {{As of|2019|1|post=}} about half of Limbaugh's affiliate stations are on the FM dial.\n\nIn March 2006, [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL]] in [[Baltimore]] became the first major market radio station in the country to drop Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio program.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hiaasen | first = Rob | title = WBAL Radio Cancels Rush Limbaugh: Station is First to Drop Show, Wants to Focus on Local News | newspaper = The Baltimore Sun | date = March 14, 2006 | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/427188/wbal_radio_cancels_rush_limbaugh_station_is_first_to_drop/index.html }}</ref> In 2007, ''Talkers Magazine'' again named him No.{{nbsp}}1 in its \"Heavy Hundred\" most important talk show hosts.\n\nLimbaugh frequently mentions the EIB (Excellence In Broadcasting) Network, trademarked in 1990.

McLaughlin, former president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], who founded EFM Media in 1988, with Limbaugh's show as his first product. In 1997, McLaughlin sold EFM to [[Jacor Communications]], which was ultimately bought up by Clear Channel Communications.

The music needed to \"get where the radio didn't reach\" because Jamaicans oftentimes were outside without radios.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henriques|first=Julian|date=2008|title=Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/4259/1/HenriquesSonicDiaspora%2A%2A.pdf|journal=African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal|volume=|pages=215\u2013236|via=Routledge: Taylor and Francis Group|access-date=2019-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221054807/http://research.gold.ac.uk/4259/1/HenriquesSonicDiaspora**.pdf|archive-date=2019-02-21|url-status=live}}</ref> Especially because the audience of dancehall sessions were lower-class people, it was extremely important that they be able to hear music. Sound systems allowed people to listen to music without having to buy a radio. Therefore, the dancehall culture grew as the use of technology and sound systems got better.\n\nThe Jamaican dancehall scene was one created out of creativity and a desire for accessibility, and one that is inseparable from sound system culture. The term \u2018Dancehall\u2019, while now typically used in reference to the specific and uniquely Jamaican genre of music, originally referred to a physical location. This location was always an open-air venue from which DJs and later \u201cToasters\u201d, a precursor to MCs, could perform their original mixes and songs for their audience via their sound systems.<ref>Henriques, J. (2008). Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session. African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal, 1(2), 215-236.</ref> The openness of the venue paired with the innately mobile nature of the sound system, allowed performers to come to the people. At the onset of the dancehall scene, sound systems were the only way that some Jamaican audiences might hear the latest songs from popular artist. Through time, it transformed to where the purveyors of the sound systems were the artists themselves and they became whom the people came to see along with their own original sounds. With the extreme volume and low bass frequencies of the sound systems local people might very well feel the vibrations of the sounds before they could even hear them, though the sound itself did travel for miles.<ref>Natal, B. (2009). Dub echoes. Soul Jazz Records, 1.</ref> This visceral sensory pleasure acted as an auditory beacon, redefining musical experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henriques|first=Julian|date=July 2008|title=Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17528630802224163|journal=African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=215\u2013236|doi=10.1080/17528630802224163|issn=1752-8631}}</ref>\n\nJamaica was one of the first cultures to pioneer the concept of remixing. As a result, production level and sound system quality were critical to Jamaica's budding music industry. Since many locals couldn't afford sound systems in their home, listening to one at a dance party or at a festival was their entry into audible bliss. Writer Brougtton and Brewster's book ''[[Last Night a DJ Saved My Life (book)|Last Night a DJ Saved My Life]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groveatlantic.com/book/last-night-a-dj-saved-my-life/|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life - Grove Atlantic|accessdate=19 March 2019|website=Groveatlantic.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414180435/https://groveatlantic.com/book/last-night-a-dj-saved-my-life/|archive-date=14 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> states that sound systems were a product of Jamaican social lifestyle. The success of music wasn't just in the hands of one person anymore, it was a factor of the DJ, speaking poetic words to the audience, the Selector, harmonizing beats in an aesthetically pleasing way, and the Sound Engineer, wiring the sound systems to handle deeper and louder bass tones. Music became a factor of many elements and the physicality of that sound was a strategic puzzle left for musicians to solve.<ref>Brewster, Bill, and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: the History of the Disc Jockey''. Grove Press, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Dancehall 1980s==\n[[King Jammy]]'s 1985 hit, \"[[Sleng Teng|(Under Me) Sleng Teng]]\" by [[Wayne Smith (musician)|Wayne Smith]], with an entirely-digital rhythm hook took the dancehall reggae world by storm. Many credit this song as being the first digital rhythm in reggae, featuring a rhythm from a [[Casio MT-40]] keyboard. However, this is not entirely correct since there are earlier examples of digital productions, such as Horace Ferguson's single \"Sensi Addict\" (Ujama) produced by [[Prince Jazzbo]] in 1984.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The \"Sleng Teng\" rhythm was used in over 200 subsequent recordings. This deejay-led, largely synthesized chanting with musical accompaniment departed from traditional conceptions of Jamaican popular musical entertainment.\n\n[[Dub poetry|Dub poet]] [[Mutabaruka]] said, \"if 1970s reggae was red, green and gold, then in the next decade it was gold chains\". It was far removed from reggae's gentle roots and culture, and there was much debate among purists as to whether it should be considered an extension of reggae.\n\nThis shift in style again saw the emergence of a new generation of artists, such as [[Buccaneer (musician)|Buccaneer]], [[Capleton]] and [[Shabba Ranks]], who became the biggest [[ragga]] star in silage the world. A new set of producers also came to prominence: [[Philip \"Fatis\" Burrell]], [[Dave Kelly (producer)|Dave \"Rude Boy\" Kelly]], [[George Phang]], [[Hugh \"Redman\" James]], [[Donovan Germain]], [[Robert Dixon (musician)|Bobby Digital]], Wycliffe \"Steely\" Johnson and Cleveland \"Clevie\" Brown (aka [[Steely & Clevie]]) rose to challenge [[Sly & Robbie]]'s position as Jamaica's leading rhythm section.\n\n==Dancehall 2000s==\nBy the early 2000s, Dancehall had gained mainstream popularity in Jamaica, as well as in the United States, Canada, Australasia and Western parts of Europe. This was first seen with artists such as [[Sean Paul]], whose single \"[[Get Busy]]\" (2003) became the first dancehall single to reach number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nUnlike earlier Dancehall, this new evolution was characterized by structures of music commonly heard in mainstream [[pop music]], such as repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Some lyrics were cleaner and featured less sexual content and profanity.\n\nSome of the artists who popularised this new era of Dancehall were [[Bounty Killer]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Shalkal]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Popcaan]], [[Vybz Kartel]], [[Konshens]], [[Mr. Vegas]], [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]], [[Ward 21]], Lady Saw and [[Spice (musician)|Spice]], some of whom saw international success.\n\n==Dancehall 2015-Present==\n\nDancehall saw a new wave of popularity in Western markets in the mid-late 2010s, with immense commercial success being achieved by a number of dancehall-pop singles, including  Rihanna's \"[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]\" (2016) and Drake's \"[[One Dance]]\" and \"[[Controlla]]\" (2016).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/drakes-new-tracks-one-dance-pop-style-reviewed-9729|title=Drake's New Tracks 'One Dance' and 'Pop Style' Reviewed|date=2016-04-05|access-date=2017-01-12|language=en-US|newspaper=NME|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116192102/http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/drakes-new-tracks-one-dance-pop-style-reviewed-9729|archive-date=2017-01-16|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|title=Meet the Producers Who Brought Dancehall Back to the Charts In 2016|access-date=2017-01-12|newspaper=Billboard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118173817/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA variety of western artists have spoken of being inspired by Dancehall music, including [[Major Lazer]], whose commercially successful singles [[Lean On]] (2015), [[Light It Up (Major Lazer song)|Light It Up]] (2015) and [[Run Up]] (2017) all heavily rely upon dancehall music.

This saw huge commercial success and went on to receive a UK MOBO award for Best Reggae Album in 2015. The year of 2016 saw Popcaan\u2019s rival-artist [[Alkaline]] release his debut album 'New Level Unlocked' under DJ Frass Records, which topped the charts in Jamaica, as well as being well received in the US and UK.\n\n[[Popcaan]] and [[Alkaline]] have always been rival music artists in [[Jamaica]] and it is much debated who the new Dancehall King, since [[Vybz Kartel]] was incarcerated in 2011. It has been said that Popcaan's success is largely due to early support from [[Vybz Kartel]] and more recent support from [[Drake (musician)|Drake]].\n\nBy 2016, Dancehall had re-emerged into global popularity, artists such as [[Alkaline]], [[Popcaan]], [[Masicka]], [[Aidonia]] and [[Rygin King]] are known as some of the most profound and active artists of this period to date, as well as UK Dancehall artists such as [[Stefflon Don]]. Competition is fierce in Jamaican Dancehall music as an active Dancehall artist might have to release over 12 singles per year to keep up.\n\nSince 2017, Dancehall artists from Jamaica have been frequently collaborating with UK acts such as [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]], [[Stefflon Don]] and [[J Hus]]. This is well in-tune with the boost of urban acts in the UK rising up, and the re-birth of Grime in 2014.<ref name=\"re-birth of Grime in 2014\">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/second-coming-of-grime-dizzee-rascal-wiley The second coming of grime] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425165236/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/second-coming-of-grime-dizzee-rascal-wiley |date=2019-04-25 }}, The Guardian, 27 March 2014</ref>\n\nThe changing sounds in dancehall have largely been down to the producers behind the tracks. The most notable producers creating the new sound of Jamaica today are: [[DJ Frass]], [[Notnice]] and [[Lee Milla]].\n\n==Culture==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2008}}\n\n[[Donna P. Hope]] defines dancehall culture as a \"space for the cultural creation and dissemination of symbols and ideologies that reflect the lived realities of its adherents, particularly those from the inner cities of Jamaica.\"<ref>Donna P. Hope Inna di Dancehall: Popular Culture and the Politics of Identity in Jamaica. UWI Press, 2006</ref> Dancehall culture actively creates a space for its \"affectors\" (creators of dancehall culture) and its \"affectees\" (consumers of dancehall culture) to take control of their own representation, contest conventional relationships of power, and exercise some level of cultural, social and even political autonomy.\n\nKingsley Stewart outlines ten of the major cultural imperatives or principles that constitute the dancehall worldview. They are:\n# It involves the dynamic interweaving of [[God]] and [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]]\n# It acts as a form of stress release or psycho-physiological relief\n# It acts as a medium for economic advancement\n# The quickest way to an object is the preferred way (i.e., the speed imperative)\n# The end justifies the means\n# It strives to make the unseen visible\n# Objects and events that are external to the body are more important than internal processes; what is seen is more important than what is thought (i.e., the pre-eminence of the external)\n# The importance of the external self; the self is consciously publicly constructed and validated\n# The ideal self is shifting, fluid, adaptive, and malleable, and\n# It involves the socioexistential imperative to transcend the normal (i.e., there is an emphasis on ''not'' being normal).<ref>Kingsley Stewart \"So Wha, Mi Nuh Fi Live To?: Interpreting Violence in Jamaica Through Dancehall Culture\", ''Ideaz'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2002: pp. 17-28</ref>\n\nSuch a drastic change in the popular music of the region generated an equally radical transformation in fashion trends, specifically those of its female faction. In lieu of traditional, modest \"rootsy\" styles, as dictated by Rastafari-inspired gender roles; women began donning flashy, revealing \u2013 sometimes X-rated outfits. This transformation is said to coincide with the influx of ''slack'' lyrics within dancehall, which objectified women as apparatuses of pleasure. These women would team up with others to form \"modeling posses\", or \"dancehall model\" groups, and informally compete with their rivals.\n\nThis newfound materialism and conspicuity was not, however, exclusive to women or manner of dress. Appearance at dance halls was exceedingly important to acceptance by peers and encompassed everything from clothing and jewelry, to the types of vehicles driven, to the sizes of each respective gang or \"crew\", and was equally important to both sexes.\n\nOne major theme behind dancehall is that of space. Sonjah Stanley-Niaah, in her article \"Mapping Black Atlantic Performance Geographies\", says\n<blockquote>\nDancehall occupies multiple spatial dimensions (urban, street, police, marginal, gendered, performance, liminal, memorializing, communal), which are revealed through the nature and type of events and venues, and their use and function. Most notable is the way in which dancehall occupies a liminal space between what is celebrated and at the same time denigrated in Jamaica and how it moves from private community to public and commercial enterprise.<ref>''Mapping Black Performance Geographies'' By Stanley-Niaah</ref><ref>''A Story of Space and Celebration'', by Sonjah Stanley-Niaah.</ref></blockquote>\nIn ''Kingston's Dancehall: A Story of Space and Celebration'', she writes:\n<blockquote>\nDancehall is ultimately a celebration of the disenfranchised selves in postcolonial Jamaica that occupy and creatively sustain that space. Structured by the urban, a space that is limited, limiting, and marginal yet central to communal, even national, identity, dancehall's identity is as contradictory and competitive as it is sacred. Some of Jamaica's significant memories of itself are inscribed in the dancehall space, and therefore dancehall can be seen as a site of collective memory that functions as ritualized memorializing, a memory bank of the old, new, and dynamic bodily movements, spaces, performers, and performance aesthetics of the New World and Jamaica in particular.<ref>Sonjah Stanley-Niaah ''Kingston's Dancehall: A Story of Space and Celebration'', ''Space and Culture'', Vol. 7, No. 1 2004: pp. 102 -118</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Girl dancing Holi feest 2008.jpg|thumb|301x301px|Dancehall-inspired dancing to a music<br />]]\nThese same notions of dancehall as a cultural space are echoed in Norman Stolzoff's ''Wake the Town and Tell the People''. He notes that dancehall is not merely a sphere of passive consumerism, but rather is an alternative sphere of active cultural production that acts as a means through which black lower-class youth articulate and project a distinct identity in local, national, and global contexts. Through dancehall, ghetto youths attempt to deal with the endemic problems of poverty, racism, and violence, and in this sense the dancehall acts as a communication center, a relay station, a site where black lower-class culture attains its deepest expression.<ref>Norman Stolzoff, ''Wake the Town and Tell the People: Dancehall Culture in Jamaica'' Durham: Duke UP, 2000. pp. 1 & 7.</ref> Thus, dancehall in Jamaica is yet another example of the way that the music and dance cultures of the African diaspora have challenged the passive consumerism of mass cultural forms, such as recorded music, by creating a sphere of active cultural production that potentially may transform the prevailing hegemony of society.<ref>Norman Stolzoff, ''Wake the Town and Tell the People: Dancehall Culture in Jamaica'' Durham: Duke UP, 2000. pp. 14-15</ref>\n\nIn ''Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall'' Nadia Ellis explicates the culture of combined homophobia and unabashed queerness within Jamaican dancehall culture. She details the particular importance of the phrase \"out and bad\" to Jamaica when she writes, \u201cThis phrase is of queer hermeneutical possibility in Jamaican dancehall because it registers a dialectic between queer and gay that is never resolved, that relays back and forth, producing an uncertainty about sexual identity and behavior that is usefully maintained in the Jamaican popular cultural context.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Nadia|date=July 2011|title=Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall|url=|journal=Project Muse|volume=15| issue = 2|pages=7\u201323|via=Project MUSE}}</ref> In discussion of the possibility of a self identifying homosexual dancer performing to homophobic music she writes, \u201cIn appropriating the culture and working from within its very center, he produces a bodily performance that gains him power. It is the power or mastery, of parody, and of getting away with it.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEllis not only examines the intersection of queerness and masculinity within the Jamaican dancehall scene, but suggests that the overt homophobia of certain dancehall music actually creates a space for queer expression. In general, homosexuality and queerness are still stigmatized in dancehalls. In fact, some of the songs used during dancehall sessions contain blatant homophobic lyrics. Ellis argues, however, this explicit, violent rhetoric is what creates a space for queer expression in Jamaica. She describes the phenomenon of all male dance groups that have sprung up within the dancehall scene. These crews dress in matching, tight clothing, often paired with makeup and dyed hair, traditional hallmarks of queerness within Jamaican culture. When they perform together, it is the bodily performance that give the homosexual dancers power.<ref>Ellis, Nadia, \u201cOut and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall.\u201d</ref>\n\n===Dances===\nThe popularity of dancehall has spawned dance moves that help to make parties and stage performances more energetic. Dancing is an integral part of bass culture genres. As people felt the music in the crowded dancehall venues, they would do a variety of dances. Eventually, dancehall artists started to create songs that either invented new dances or formalized some moves done by dancehall goers. Many dance moves seen in hip hop videos are actually variations of dancehall dances. Examples of such dances are: \"[[Like Glue]]\", \"[[Bogle]]\", \"Whine & Dip\", \"Tek Weh Yuhself\", \"[[Whine Up]]\", \"Shake It With Shaun\" (a mix of various genres), \"Boosie Bounce\", \"Drive By\", \"Shovel It\", \"To Di World\", \"[[Dutty Wine]]\", \"Sweep\", \"Nuh Behavior\", \"Nuh Linga\", \"Skip to My Lou\", \"Gully Creepa\", \"[[Breakdancing]]\" ,\"Bad Man Forward Bad Man Pull Up\", \"Keeping it Jiggy\", \"Pon Di River\", \"One Drop\", \"Whine & Kotch\", \"Bubbling\", \"Tic Toc\", \"Willie Bounce\", \"Wacky Dip\", \"Screetchie\", \"One Vice\" and \"[[Daggering]]\".<ref>Niaah, Stanley, ''DanceHall: From Slave Ship to Ghetto''(Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press, 2010)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/intl/42967/Spate_of_broken_penises_caused_by_dance_style_daggering |title=International News - Spate of broken penises caused by dance style \"daggering\" |website=Inthemix.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118224919/http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/intl/42967/Spate_of_broken_penises_caused_by_dance_style_daggering |archive-date=2010-01-18 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Kate |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25580440-17102,00.html |title=Erotic \"daggering\" dance craze causing bodily harm - The Courier-Mail |website=News.com.au |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608161902/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25580440-17102,00.html |archive-date=2009-06-08 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dancehall.tours |title=The Origins of Dancehall Reggae &#124; Dancehall Reggae |website=Dancehall.tours |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708054910/https://www.dancehall.tours/ |archivedate=July 8, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_385317.html |title=Dance craze causes bodily harm |website=Straitstimes.com |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218140732/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_385317.html |archive-date=2010-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n===Cultural elements===\nDancehall combines elements of American gangster materialism and stories of hardships of Kingston, Jamaica.<ref>Kingsley Stewart \"So Wha, Mi Nuh Fi Live To?: Interpreting Violence in Jamaica Through Dancehall Culture\", Ideaz Vol. 1, No. 1, 2002: pp. 17-28</ref> This is seen in the use of gun talk by artists like [[Buju Banton]] and [[Capleton]], or the sporting of [[bling-bling]] by \"Gangsta Ras\" artists like [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]] and Munga.<ref>Donna P.

Donna P. Hope argues that this trend is related to the rise of market [[capitalism]] as a dominant feature of life in Jamaica, coupled with the role of new media and a liberalized media landscape, where images become of increasing importance in the lives of ordinary Jamaicans who strive for celebrity and superstar status on the stages of dancehall and Jamaican popular culture.<ref>Donna P. Hope. Man Vibes: Masculinities in the Jamaican Dancehall. Kingston: Ian Randle Publishers, 2010</ref>\n\nAnother point of dissension of dancehall from reggae, and from its non-western roots in Jamaica, is on the focus on materialism. Dancehall has also became popular in regions such as Ghana and Panama. Prominent males in the dancehall scene are expected to dress in very expensive casual wear, indicative of European urban styling and high fashion that suggest wealth and status.<ref>Donna P. Hope \"The British Link Up Crew \u2013 Consumption Masquerading as Masculinity in the Dancehall\" in Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies Special Issue on Jamaican Popular Culture, 6.1: April, 2004, pp. 101-117.</ref> Since the late 1990s, males in the dancehall culture have rivalled their female counterparts to look fashioned and styled.<ref>Donna P.

Hope argues that dancehall culture's anti-homosexual lyrics formed part of a macho discussion that advanced the interest of the heterosexual male in Jamaica, which is a Christian society with strong [[Rastafari movement]] influence as well. Even while dancehall culture in Jamaica sported images of men in pseudo-gay poses and costumes, the cultural, religious, social and gendered imperatives of the society advanced and promoted the ideal man as macho and heterosexual and men who are homosexual were identified as inadequate and impure portraits of true masculinity.<ref>Donna P.

In her paper \"Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall\", Nadia Ellis explains that queer masculine expression is allowed in specific situations within Jamaican culture with \u201chomophobic lyrics actually opening up a space for increasingly free expression\u201d. Explicitly homophobic songs such as \u201cBoom Bye Bye\u201d are constantly replayed at dancehall venues, despite the fact that the culture is defined by constant renewal and the search for the new. These songs, despite often being over ten years old, are actually necessary to \u201cconsecrate\u201d the spaces as straight and masculine. Once a song like \u201cBoom Bye Bye\u201d is played, the area is open to expression of queerness because the song acts as a disclaimer or a free pass, blessing anyone participating with a stamp of straightness and normalcy. Ellis sums it up succinctly: \u201cThe songs are played; no one is \u2018gay\u2019; everyone can turn a blind eye.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Nadia|date=July 2011|title=Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall|url=|journal=Small Axe|volume=15|pages=7\u201323|via=Project Muse}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Dancehall music has played into and with this divide in an extreme and lyrically graphic fashion that has been rendered politically incorrect in many places globally but remains culturally relevant in Jamaica.<ref>Thompson, Christopher.

A new generation of singers and deejays emerged that harked back to the roots reggae era, notably [[Garnett Silk]], [[Tony Rebel]], [[Sanchez (singer)|Sanchez]], [[Luciano (singer)|Luciano]], [[Anthony B]] and [[Sizzla]].

Danger, a dancehall queen and the winner of the International Dancehall Queen Competition in 2014, expresses her power through dancehalls as she explains: \u201cWe are queens, we are not afraid to go out there to do what we want to, demand what we want, and to live how we want, and represent women all over the world and to let them know it is okay to be yourself and that it is ok to not hold back\u201d <ref>Refinery 29, \u201cHow Jamaican Dancehall Queens Twerk For A Living | Style Out There | Refinery29.\u201d Youtube, hosted by Connie Wang, April 6, 2019, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNtELN4xw0] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525205918/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNtELN4xw0 |date=2019-05-25 }}</ref> Raquel, also known as Dancing Princess, describes her ability to communicate through the dancehall: \u201cWhat you\u2019ve lived, what you feel, put it in the dance.

Sound systems allowed people to listen to music without having to buy a radio. Therefore, the dancehall culture grew as the use of technology and sound systems got better.\n\nThe Jamaican dancehall scene was one created out of creativity and a desire for accessibility, and one that is inseparable from sound system culture. The term \u2018Dancehall\u2019, while now typically used in reference to the specific and uniquely Jamaican genre of music, originally referred to a physical location. This location was always an open-air venue from which DJs and later \u201cToasters\u201d, a precursor to MCs, could perform their original mixes and songs for their audience via their sound systems.<ref>Henriques, J. (2008). Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session. African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal, 1(2), 215-236.</ref> The openness of the venue paired with the innately mobile nature of the sound system, allowed performers to come to the people. At the onset of the dancehall scene, sound systems were the only way that some Jamaican audiences might hear the latest songs from popular artist. Through time, it transformed to where the purveyors of the sound systems were the artists themselves and they became whom the people came to see along with their own original sounds. With the extreme volume and low bass frequencies of the sound systems local people might very well feel the vibrations of the sounds before they could even hear them, though the sound itself did travel for miles.<ref>Natal, B. (2009). Dub echoes. Soul Jazz Records, 1.</ref> This visceral sensory pleasure acted as an auditory beacon, redefining musical experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henriques|first=Julian|date=July 2008|title=Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17528630802224163|journal=African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=215\u2013236|doi=10.1080/17528630802224163|issn=1752-8631}}</ref>\n\nJamaica was one of the first cultures to pioneer the concept of remixing. As a result, production level and sound system quality were critical to Jamaica's budding music industry. Since many locals couldn't afford sound systems in their home, listening to one at a dance party or at a festival was their entry into audible bliss. Writer Brougtton and Brewster's book ''[[Last Night a DJ Saved My Life (book)|Last Night a DJ Saved My Life]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groveatlantic.com/book/last-night-a-dj-saved-my-life/|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life - Grove Atlantic|accessdate=19 March 2019|website=Groveatlantic.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414180435/https://groveatlantic.com/book/last-night-a-dj-saved-my-life/|archive-date=14 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> states that sound systems were a product of Jamaican social lifestyle. The success of music wasn't just in the hands of one person anymore, it was a factor of the DJ, speaking poetic words to the audience, the Selector, harmonizing beats in an aesthetically pleasing way, and the Sound Engineer, wiring the sound systems to handle deeper and louder bass tones. Music became a factor of many elements and the physicality of that sound was a strategic puzzle left for musicians to solve.<ref>Brewster, Bill, and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: the History of the Disc Jockey''. Grove Press, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Dancehall 1980s==\n[[King Jammy]]'s 1985 hit, \"[[Sleng Teng|(Under Me) Sleng Teng]]\" by [[Wayne Smith (musician)|Wayne Smith]], with an entirely-digital rhythm hook took the dancehall reggae world by storm. Many credit this song as being the first digital rhythm in reggae, featuring a rhythm from a [[Casio MT-40]] keyboard. However, this is not entirely correct since there are earlier examples of digital productions, such as Horace Ferguson's single \"Sensi Addict\" (Ujama) produced by [[Prince Jazzbo]] in 1984.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The \"Sleng Teng\" rhythm was used in over 200 subsequent recordings. This deejay-led, largely synthesized chanting with musical accompaniment departed from traditional conceptions of Jamaican popular musical entertainment.\n\n[[Dub poetry|Dub poet]] [[Mutabaruka]] said, \"if 1970s reggae was red, green and gold, then in the next decade it was gold chains\". It was far removed from reggae's gentle roots and culture, and there was much debate among purists as to whether it should be considered an extension of reggae.\n\nThis shift in style again saw the emergence of a new generation of artists, such as [[Buccaneer (musician)|Buccaneer]], [[Capleton]] and [[Shabba Ranks]], who became the biggest [[ragga]] star in silage the world. A new set of producers also came to prominence: [[Philip \"Fatis\" Burrell]], [[Dave Kelly (producer)|Dave \"Rude Boy\" Kelly]], [[George Phang]], [[Hugh \"Redman\" James]], [[Donovan Germain]], [[Robert Dixon (musician)|Bobby Digital]], Wycliffe \"Steely\" Johnson and Cleveland \"Clevie\" Brown (aka [[Steely & Clevie]]) rose to challenge [[Sly & Robbie]]'s position as Jamaica's leading rhythm section.\n\n==Dancehall 2000s==\nBy the early 2000s, Dancehall had gained mainstream popularity in Jamaica, as well as in the United States, Canada, Australasia and Western parts of Europe. This was first seen with artists such as [[Sean Paul]], whose single \"[[Get Busy]]\" (2003) became the first dancehall single to reach number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nUnlike earlier Dancehall, this new evolution was characterized by structures of music commonly heard in mainstream [[pop music]], such as repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Some lyrics were cleaner and featured less sexual content and profanity.\n\nSome of the artists who popularised this new era of Dancehall were [[Bounty Killer]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Shalkal]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Popcaan]], [[Vybz Kartel]], [[Konshens]], [[Mr. Vegas]], [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]], [[Ward 21]], Lady Saw and [[Spice (musician)|Spice]], some of whom saw international success.\n\n==Dancehall 2015-Present==\n\nDancehall saw a new wave of popularity in Western markets in the mid-late 2010s, with immense commercial success being achieved by a number of dancehall-pop singles, including  Rihanna's \"[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]\" (2016) and Drake's \"[[One Dance]]\" and \"[[Controlla]]\" (2016).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/drakes-new-tracks-one-dance-pop-style-reviewed-9729|title=Drake's New Tracks 'One Dance' and 'Pop Style' Reviewed|date=2016-04-05|access-date=2017-01-12|language=en-US|newspaper=NME|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116192102/http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/drakes-new-tracks-one-dance-pop-style-reviewed-9729|archive-date=2017-01-16|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|title=Meet the Producers Who Brought Dancehall Back to the Charts In 2016|access-date=2017-01-12|newspaper=Billboard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118173817/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA variety of western artists have spoken of being inspired by Dancehall music, including [[Major Lazer]], whose commercially successful singles [[Lean On]] (2015), [[Light It Up (Major Lazer song)|Light It Up]] (2015) and [[Run Up]] (2017) all heavily rely upon dancehall music.

It has been said that Popcaan's success is largely due to early support from [[Vybz Kartel]] and more recent support from [[Drake (musician)|Drake]].\n\nBy 2016, Dancehall had re-emerged into global popularity, artists such as [[Alkaline]], [[Popcaan]], [[Masicka]], [[Aidonia]] and [[Rygin King]] are known as some of the most profound and active artists of this period to date, as well as UK Dancehall artists such as [[Stefflon Don]]. Competition is fierce in Jamaican Dancehall music as an active Dancehall artist might have to release over 12 singles per year to keep up.\n\nSince 2017, Dancehall artists from Jamaica have been frequently collaborating with UK acts such as [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]], [[Stefflon Don]] and [[J Hus]]. This is well in-tune with the boost of urban acts in the UK rising up, and the re-birth of Grime in 2014.<ref name=\"re-birth of Grime in 2014\">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/second-coming-of-grime-dizzee-rascal-wiley The second coming of grime] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425165236/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/second-coming-of-grime-dizzee-rascal-wiley |date=2019-04-25 }}, The Guardian, 27 March 2014</ref>\n\nThe changing sounds in dancehall have largely been down to the producers behind the tracks. The most notable producers creating the new sound of Jamaica today are: [[DJ Frass]], [[Notnice]] and [[Lee Milla]].\n\n==Culture==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2008}}\n\n[[Donna P. Hope]] defines dancehall culture as a \"space for the cultural creation and dissemination of symbols and ideologies that reflect the lived realities of its adherents, particularly those from the inner cities of Jamaica.\"<ref>Donna P. Hope Inna di Dancehall: Popular Culture and the Politics of Identity in Jamaica. UWI Press, 2006</ref> Dancehall culture actively creates a space for its \"affectors\" (creators of dancehall culture) and its \"affectees\" (consumers of dancehall culture) to take control of their own representation, contest conventional relationships of power, and exercise some level of cultural, social and even political autonomy.\n\nKingsley Stewart outlines ten of the major cultural imperatives or principles that constitute the dancehall worldview. They are:\n# It involves the dynamic interweaving of [[God]] and [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]]\n# It acts as a form of stress release or psycho-physiological relief\n# It acts as a medium for economic advancement\n# The quickest way to an object is the preferred way (i.e., the speed imperative)\n# The end justifies the means\n# It strives to make the unseen visible\n# Objects and events that are external to the body are more important than internal processes; what is seen is more important than what is thought (i.e., the pre-eminence of the external)\n# The importance of the external self; the self is consciously publicly constructed and validated\n# The ideal self is shifting, fluid, adaptive, and malleable, and\n# It involves the socioexistential imperative to transcend the normal (i.e., there is an emphasis on ''not'' being normal).<ref>Kingsley Stewart \"So Wha, Mi Nuh Fi Live To?: Interpreting Violence in Jamaica Through Dancehall Culture\", ''Ideaz'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2002: pp. 17-28</ref>\n\nSuch a drastic change in the popular music of the region generated an equally radical transformation in fashion trends, specifically those of its female faction. In lieu of traditional, modest \"rootsy\" styles, as dictated by Rastafari-inspired gender roles; women began donning flashy, revealing \u2013 sometimes X-rated outfits. This transformation is said to coincide with the influx of ''slack'' lyrics within dancehall, which objectified women as apparatuses of pleasure. These women would team up with others to form \"modeling posses\", or \"dancehall model\" groups, and informally compete with their rivals.\n\nThis newfound materialism and conspicuity was not, however, exclusive to women or manner of dress. Appearance at dance halls was exceedingly important to acceptance by peers and encompassed everything from clothing and jewelry, to the types of vehicles driven, to the sizes of each respective gang or \"crew\", and was equally important to both sexes.\n\nOne major theme behind dancehall is that of space. Sonjah Stanley-Niaah, in her article \"Mapping Black Atlantic Performance Geographies\", says\n<blockquote>\nDancehall occupies multiple spatial dimensions (urban, street, police, marginal, gendered, performance, liminal, memorializing, communal), which are revealed through the nature and type of events and venues, and their use and function. Most notable is the way in which dancehall occupies a liminal space between what is celebrated and at the same time denigrated in Jamaica and how it moves from private community to public and commercial enterprise.<ref>''Mapping Black Performance Geographies'' By Stanley-Niaah</ref><ref>''A Story of Space and Celebration'', by Sonjah Stanley-Niaah.</ref></blockquote>\nIn ''Kingston's Dancehall: A Story of Space and Celebration'', she writes:\n<blockquote>\nDancehall is ultimately a celebration of the disenfranchised selves in postcolonial Jamaica that occupy and creatively sustain that space. Structured by the urban, a space that is limited, limiting, and marginal yet central to communal, even national, identity, dancehall's identity is as contradictory and competitive as it is sacred. Some of Jamaica's significant memories of itself are inscribed in the dancehall space, and therefore dancehall can be seen as a site of collective memory that functions as ritualized memorializing, a memory bank of the old, new, and dynamic bodily movements, spaces, performers, and performance aesthetics of the New World and Jamaica in particular.<ref>Sonjah Stanley-Niaah ''Kingston's Dancehall: A Story of Space and Celebration'', ''Space and Culture'', Vol. 7, No. 1 2004: pp. 102 -118</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Girl dancing Holi feest 2008.jpg|thumb|301x301px|Dancehall-inspired dancing to a music<br />]]\nThese same notions of dancehall as a cultural space are echoed in Norman Stolzoff's ''Wake the Town and Tell the People''. He notes that dancehall is not merely a sphere of passive consumerism, but rather is an alternative sphere of active cultural production that acts as a means through which black lower-class youth articulate and project a distinct identity in local, national, and global contexts. Through dancehall, ghetto youths attempt to deal with the endemic problems of poverty, racism, and violence, and in this sense the dancehall acts as a communication center, a relay station, a site where black lower-class culture attains its deepest expression.<ref>Norman Stolzoff, ''Wake the Town and Tell the People: Dancehall Culture in Jamaica'' Durham: Duke UP, 2000. pp. 1 & 7.</ref> Thus, dancehall in Jamaica is yet another example of the way that the music and dance cultures of the African diaspora have challenged the passive consumerism of mass cultural forms, such as recorded music, by creating a sphere of active cultural production that potentially may transform the prevailing hegemony of society.<ref>Norman Stolzoff, ''Wake the Town and Tell the People: Dancehall Culture in Jamaica'' Durham: Duke UP, 2000. pp. 14-15</ref>\n\nIn ''Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall'' Nadia Ellis explicates the culture of combined homophobia and unabashed queerness within Jamaican dancehall culture. She details the particular importance of the phrase \"out and bad\" to Jamaica when she writes, \u201cThis phrase is of queer hermeneutical possibility in Jamaican dancehall because it registers a dialectic between queer and gay that is never resolved, that relays back and forth, producing an uncertainty about sexual identity and behavior that is usefully maintained in the Jamaican popular cultural context.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Nadia|date=July 2011|title=Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall|url=|journal=Project Muse|volume=15| issue = 2|pages=7\u201323|via=Project MUSE}}</ref> In discussion of the possibility of a self identifying homosexual dancer performing to homophobic music she writes, \u201cIn appropriating the culture and working from within its very center, he produces a bodily performance that gains him power. It is the power or mastery, of parody, and of getting away with it.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEllis not only examines the intersection of queerness and masculinity within the Jamaican dancehall scene, but suggests that the overt homophobia of certain dancehall music actually creates a space for queer expression. In general, homosexuality and queerness are still stigmatized in dancehalls. In fact, some of the songs used during dancehall sessions contain blatant homophobic lyrics. Ellis argues, however, this explicit, violent rhetoric is what creates a space for queer expression in Jamaica. She describes the phenomenon of all male dance groups that have sprung up within the dancehall scene. These crews dress in matching, tight clothing, often paired with makeup and dyed hair, traditional hallmarks of queerness within Jamaican culture. When they perform together, it is the bodily performance that give the homosexual dancers power.<ref>Ellis, Nadia, \u201cOut and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall.\u201d</ref>\n\n===Dances===\nThe popularity of dancehall has spawned dance moves that help to make parties and stage performances more energetic. Dancing is an integral part of bass culture genres. As people felt the music in the crowded dancehall venues, they would do a variety of dances. Eventually, dancehall artists started to create songs that either invented new dances or formalized some moves done by dancehall goers. Many dance moves seen in hip hop videos are actually variations of dancehall dances. Examples of such dances are: \"[[Like Glue]]\", \"[[Bogle]]\", \"Whine & Dip\", \"Tek Weh Yuhself\", \"[[Whine Up]]\", \"Shake It With Shaun\" (a mix of various genres), \"Boosie Bounce\", \"Drive By\", \"Shovel It\", \"To Di World\", \"[[Dutty Wine]]\", \"Sweep\", \"Nuh Behavior\", \"Nuh Linga\", \"Skip to My Lou\", \"Gully Creepa\", \"[[Breakdancing]]\" ,\"Bad Man Forward Bad Man Pull Up\", \"Keeping it Jiggy\", \"Pon Di River\", \"One Drop\", \"Whine & Kotch\", \"Bubbling\", \"Tic Toc\", \"Willie Bounce\", \"Wacky Dip\", \"Screetchie\", \"One Vice\" and \"[[Daggering]]\".<ref>Niaah, Stanley, ''DanceHall: From Slave Ship to Ghetto''(Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press, 2010)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/intl/42967/Spate_of_broken_penises_caused_by_dance_style_daggering |title=International News - Spate of broken penises caused by dance style \"daggering\" |website=Inthemix.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118224919/http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/intl/42967/Spate_of_broken_penises_caused_by_dance_style_daggering |archive-date=2010-01-18 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Kate |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25580440-17102,00.html |title=Erotic \"daggering\" dance craze causing bodily harm - The Courier-Mail |website=News.com.au |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608161902/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25580440-17102,00.html |archive-date=2009-06-08 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dancehall.tours |title=The Origins of Dancehall Reggae &#124; Dancehall Reggae |website=Dancehall.tours |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708054910/https://www.dancehall.tours/ |archivedate=July 8, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_385317.html |title=Dance craze causes bodily harm |website=Straitstimes.com |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218140732/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_385317.html |archive-date=2010-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n===Cultural elements===\nDancehall combines elements of American gangster materialism and stories of hardships of Kingston, Jamaica.<ref>Kingsley Stewart \"So Wha, Mi Nuh Fi Live To?: Interpreting Violence in Jamaica Through Dancehall Culture\", Ideaz Vol. 1, No. 1, 2002: pp. 17-28</ref> This is seen in the use of gun talk by artists like [[Buju Banton]] and [[Capleton]], or the sporting of [[bling-bling]] by \"Gangsta Ras\" artists like [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]] and Munga.<ref>Donna P.

Donna P. Hope argues that this trend is related to the rise of market [[capitalism]] as a dominant feature of life in Jamaica, coupled with the role of new media and a liberalized media landscape, where images become of increasing importance in the lives of ordinary Jamaicans who strive for celebrity and superstar status on the stages of dancehall and Jamaican popular culture.<ref>Donna P. Hope. Man Vibes: Masculinities in the Jamaican Dancehall. Kingston: Ian Randle Publishers, 2010</ref>\n\nAnother point of dissension of dancehall from reggae, and from its non-western roots in Jamaica, is on the focus on materialism. Dancehall has also became popular in regions such as Ghana and Panama. Prominent males in the dancehall scene are expected to dress in very expensive casual wear, indicative of European urban styling and high fashion that suggest wealth and status.<ref>Donna P. Hope \"The British Link Up Crew \u2013 Consumption Masquerading as Masculinity in the Dancehall\" in Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies Special Issue on Jamaican Popular Culture, 6.1: April, 2004, pp. 101-117.</ref> Since the late 1990s, males in the dancehall culture have rivalled their female counterparts to look fashioned and styled.<ref>Donna P.

Hope argues that dancehall culture's anti-homosexual lyrics formed part of a macho discussion that advanced the interest of the heterosexual male in Jamaica, which is a Christian society with strong [[Rastafari movement]] influence as well. Even while dancehall culture in Jamaica sported images of men in pseudo-gay poses and costumes, the cultural, religious, social and gendered imperatives of the society advanced and promoted the ideal man as macho and heterosexual and men who are homosexual were identified as inadequate and impure portraits of true masculinity.<ref>Donna P.

In her paper \"Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall\", Nadia Ellis explains that queer masculine expression is allowed in specific situations within Jamaican culture with \u201chomophobic lyrics actually opening up a space for increasingly free expression\u201d. Explicitly homophobic songs such as \u201cBoom Bye Bye\u201d are constantly replayed at dancehall venues, despite the fact that the culture is defined by constant renewal and the search for the new. These songs, despite often being over ten years old, are actually necessary to \u201cconsecrate\u201d the spaces as straight and masculine. Once a song like \u201cBoom Bye Bye\u201d is played, the area is open to expression of queerness because the song acts as a disclaimer or a free pass, blessing anyone participating with a stamp of straightness and normalcy. Ellis sums it up succinctly: \u201cThe songs are played; no one is \u2018gay\u2019; everyone can turn a blind eye.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Nadia|date=July 2011|title=Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall|url=|journal=Small Axe|volume=15|pages=7\u201323|via=Project Muse}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Dancehall music has played into and with this divide in an extreme and lyrically graphic fashion that has been rendered politically incorrect in many places globally but remains culturally relevant in Jamaica.<ref>Thompson, Christopher.
