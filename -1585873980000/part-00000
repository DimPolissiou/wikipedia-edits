The ICJ settles disputes between states and gives [[advisory opinions]] on international legal issues referred to it by the [[UN organs|UN]]. Through its opinions and rulings, it serves as [[Sources of international law|a source of international law]].\n\nThe ICJ is the successor of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] (PCIJ), which was established by the [[League of Nations]] in 1920. After the Second World War, both the League and the PCIJ were succeeded by the United Nations and ICJ, respectively. The Statute of the ICJ draws heavily from that of its predecessor, and the latter's decisions remain valid. All [[Member states of the United Nations|members of the UN]] are party to the ICJ Statute.\n\nThe ICJ comprises a panel of 15 judges elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] for nine-year terms. The court is seated in the [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, making it the only principal U.N. organ not located in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Court {{!}} International Court of Justice|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/court|website=www.icj-cij.org|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110090149/http://www.icj-cij.org/en/court|archive-date=10 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its official working languages are English and French.\n\n== History ==\nThe first permanent institution established for the purpose of settling international disputes was the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (PCA), which was created by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Peace Conference]] of 1899. Initiated by Russian Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II,]] the conference involved all the world's major powers, as well as several smaller states, resulted in the first multilateral treaties concerned with the conduct of warfare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hag99-01.asp|title=The Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907; a series of lectures delivered before the Johns Hopkins University in the year 1908|last=Scott|first=James Brown|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> Among these was the ''Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes'', which set forth the institutional and procedural framework for arbitral proceedings, which would take place in [[The Hague|The Hague, Netherlands]]. Although the proceedings would be supported by a permanent bureau\u2014whose functions would be equivalent to that of a secretariat or court registry\u2014the arbitrators would be appointed by the disputing states from a larger pool provided by each member of the Convention. The PCA was established in 1900 and began proceedings in 1902.\n\nA [[second Hague Peace Conference]] in 1907, which involved most of the world's sovereign states, revised the Convention and enhanced the rules governing arbitral proceedings before the PCA. During this conference, the United States, Great Britain and Germany submitted a joint proposal for a permanent court whose judges would serve full-time. As the delegates could not agree as to how the judges would be selected, the matter was temporarily shelved pending an agreement to be adopted at a later convention.\n\nThe Hague Peace Conferences, and the ideas that emerged therefrom, influenced the creation of the [[Central American Court of Justice]], which was established in 1908 as one of the earliest regional judicial bodies. Various plans and proposals were made between 1911 and 1919 for the establishment of an international judicial tribunal, which would not be realized into the formation of a new international system following the First World War.\n\n=== The Permanent Court of International Justice ===\nThe unprecedented bloodshed of the First World War led to the creation of the [[League of Nations]], established by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919 as the first worldwide intergovernmental organization aimed at maintaining peace and collective security. Article 14 League's [[Covenant of the League of Nations|Covenant]] called for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), which would be responsible for adjudicating any international dispute submitted to it by the contesting parties, as well as to provide an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the League of Nations.\n\nIn December 1920, following several drafts and debates, the Assembly of the League unanimously adopted the Statute of the PCIJ, which was signed and ratified the following year by a majority of members. Among other things, the new Statute resolved the contentious issues of selecting judges by providing that the judges be elected by both the Council and the Assembly of the League concurrently but independently. The makeup of the PCIJ would reflect the \"main forms of civilization and the principal legal systems of the world\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icj-cij.org/en/history|title=History {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> The PCIJ would be permanently placed at the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague, alongside Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\nThe PCIJ represented a major innovation in international jurisprudence in several ways:\n\n* Unlike previous international arbitral tribunals, it was a permanent body governed by its own statutory provisions and rules of procedure\n* It had a permanent registry that served as a liaison with governments and international bodies;\n* Its proceedings were largely public, including pleadings, oral arguments, and all documentary evidence;\n* It was accessible to all states and could be declared by states to have compulsory jurisdiction over disputes; \n* The PCIJ Statute was the first to list sources of law it would draw upon, which in turn became sources of international law\n* Judges were more representative of the world and its legal systems than any prior international judicial body.\n* As a permanent body, the PCIJ would, over time, make a series decisions and rulings that would develop international law\n\nUnlike the ICJ, the PCIJ was not part of the League, nor were members of the League automatically a party to its Statute. The United States, which played a key role in both the second Hague Peace Conference and the Paris Peace Conference, was notably not a member of the League, although several of its nationals served as judges of the Court.\n\nFrom its first session in 1922 until 1940, the PCIJ dealt with 29 interstate disputes and issued 27 advisory opinions. The Court's widespread acceptance was reflected by the fact that several hundred international treaties and agreements conferred jurisdiction upon it over specified categories of disputes. In addition to helping resolve several serious international disputes, the PCIJ helped clarify several ambiguities in international law that contributed to its development.\n\nThe United States played a major role in setting up the World Court but never joined.<ref>David S.

The [[Second world war|Second World War]] effectively put an end to the Court, which held its last public session on December 1939 and issued its last orders on February 1940. In 1942 the United States and United Kingdom jointly declared support for establishing or re-establishing an international court after the war, and in 1943, the U.K. chaired a panel of jurists from around the world, the \"Inter-Allied Committee\", to discuss the matter. Its 1944 report recommended that:\n\n* The statute of any new international court should be based on that of the PCIJ;\n* The new court should retain an advisory jurisdiction;\n* Acceptance of the new court's jurisdiction should be voluntary;\n* The court should deal only with judicial and not political matters\n\nSeveral months later, a conference of the major Allied Powers\u2014China, the USSR, the U.K., and the U.S.\u2014issued a joint declaration recognizing the necessity \u201cof establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/moscow.asp|title=The Moscow Conference, October 1943|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nThe following Allied conference at [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference|Dumbarton Oaks]], in the United States, published a proposal in October 1944 that called for the establishment of an intergovernmental organization that would include an international court. A meeting was subsequently convened in Washington, D.C. in April 1945, involving 44 jurists from around the world to draft a statute for the proposed court. The draft statute was substantially similar to that of the PCIJ, and it was questioned whether a new court should even be created. During the [[San Francisco Conference]], which took place from 25 April to 26 June 1945 and involved 50 countries, it was decided that an entirely new court should be established as a principal organ of the new United Nations. The statute of this court would form an integral part of the [[United Nations Charter]], which, to maintain continuity, expressly held that the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was based upon that of the PCIJ.\n\nConsequently, the PCIJ convened for the last time in October 1945 and resolved to transfer its archives to its successor, which would take its place at the Peace Palace. The judges of the PCIJ all resigned on 31 January 1946, with the election of the first members of the ICJ taking place the following February at the [[First session of the United Nations General Assembly|First Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council]]. In April 1946, the PCIJ was formally dissolved, and the ICJ, in its first meeting, elected as President [[Jos\u00e9 Gustavo Guerrero]] of El Salvador, who had served as the last President of the PCIJ. The Court also appointed members of its Registry, drawn largely from that of the PCIJ, and held an inaugural public sitting later that month.\n\nThe first case was submitted in May 1947 by the United Kingdom against Albania concerning [[Corfu Channel case|incidents in the Corfu Channel]].\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague, Netherlands, seat of the ICJ]]\nEstablished in 1945 by the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]], the court began work in 1946 as the successor to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].

After the court ruled that the [[United States]]'s covert war against [[Nicaragua]] was in violation of international law (''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]''), the United States withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a discretionary basis.<ref>Churchill, Ward.

The election process is set out in Articles 4\u201319 of the ICJ Statute. Elections are staggered, with five judges elected every three years to ensure continuity within the court. Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally been to elect a judge in a special election to complete the term.\n\nNo two judges may be nationals of the same country. According to Article 9, the membership of the court is supposed to represent the \"main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world\". Essentially, that has meant [[common law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[socialist law]] (now post-communist law).\n\nThere is an informal understanding that the seats will be distributed [[United Nations Regional Groups|by geographic regions]] so that there are five seats for Western countries, three for [[Africa|African states]] (including one judge of [[francophone]] civil law, one of Anglophone common law and one Arab), two for Eastern European states, three for Asian states and two for Latin American and Caribbean states.<ref>Harris, D. ''Cases and Materials on International Law, 7th ed.'' (2012, London) p. 839.</ref> For most of the court's history, the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] (France, USSR, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have always had a judge serving, thereby occupying three of the Western seats, one of the Asian seats and one of the Eastern European seats. Exceptions have been China not having a judge on the court from 1967 to 1985, during which time it did not put forward a candidate, and British judge Sir Christopher Greenwood being withdrawn as a candidate for election for a second nine-year term on the bench in 2017, leaving no judges from the United Kingdom on the court.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\">{{cite news|title=International Court of Justice: UK abandons bid for seat on UN bench|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42061028|accessdate=21 November 2017|agency=BBC}}</ref> Greenwood had been supported by the UN Security Council but failed to get a majority in the UN General Assembly.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\" /> Indian judge Dalveer Bhandari instead took the seat.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\" />\n\nArticle 6 of the Statute provides that all judges should be \"elected regardless of their nationality among persons of high moral character\" who are either qualified for the highest judicial office in their home states or known as lawyers with sufficient competence in international law. Judicial independence is dealt with specifically in Articles 16\u201318. Judges of the ICJ are not able to hold any other post or act as counsel. In practice, members of the court have their own interpretation of these rules and allow them to be involved in outside arbitration and hold professional posts as long as there is no conflict of interest. A judge can be dismissed only by a unanimous vote of the other members of the court.<ref>ICJ Statute, Article 18(1)</ref> Despite these provisions, the independence of ICJ judges has been questioned. For example, during the [[Nicaragua v. United States|''Nicaragua'' case]], the United States issued a communiqu\u00e9 suggesting that it could not present sensitive material to the court because of the presence of judges from the Soviet bloc.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua'' (Nicaragua v USA), [1986] ICJ Reports 14, 158\u201360 (Merits) per Judge Lachs.</ref>\n\nJudges may deliver joint judgments or give their own separate opinions. Decisions and [[advisory opinion]]s are by majority, and, in the event of an equal division, the President's vote becomes decisive, which occurred  in the ''Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict'' (Opinion requested by WHO), [1996] ICJ Reports 66. Judges may also deliver separate dissenting opinions.\n\n===''Ad hoc'' judges===\nArticle 31 of the statute sets out a procedure whereby ''[[ad hoc]]'' judges sit on contentious cases before the court. The system allows any party to a contentious case (if it otherwise does not have one of that party's nationals sitting on the court) to select one additional person to sit as a judge on that case only. It is thus possible that as many as seventeen judges may sit on one case.\n\nThe system may seem strange when compared with domestic court processes, but its purpose is to encourage states to submit cases. For example, if a state knows that it will have a judicial officer who can participate in deliberation and offer other judges local knowledge and an understanding of the state's perspective, it may be more willing to submit to the jurisdiction of the court. Although this system does not sit well with the judicial nature of the body, it is usually of little practical consequence. ''Ad hoc'' judges usually (but not always) vote in favour of the state that appointed them and thus cancel each other out.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Posner, E. A., and De Figueiredo, M. F.

Articles 26\u201329 of the statute allow the court to form smaller chambers, usually 3 or 5 judges, to hear cases. Two types of chambers are contemplated by Article 26: firstly, chambers for special categories of cases, and second, the formation of ''ad hoc'' chambers to hear particular disputes. In 1993, a special chamber was established, under Article 26(1) of the ICJ statute, to deal specifically with environmental matters (although it has never been used).\n\n''Ad hoc'' chambers are more frequently convened. For example, chambers were used to hear the ''Gulf of Maine Case'' (Canada/US).<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ibasicdocuments/ibasictext/ibasicrulesofcourt_20050929.htm Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice 1978] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126131908/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ibasicdocuments/ibasictext/ibasicrulesofcourt_20050929.htm |date=26 November 2005 }} (as amended on 5 December 2000).

Judgments of chambers may have either less authority than full Court judgments or diminish the proper interpretation of universal international law informed by a variety of cultural and legal perspectives. On the other hand, the use of chambers might encourage greater recourse to the court and thus enhance international [[dispute resolution]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Schwebel S \"Ad Hoc Chambers of the International Court of Justice\" (1987) 81 ''American Journal of International Law'' 831.</ref>\n\n===Current composition===\n{{As of|2018|June|22}}, the composition of the court is as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/current-members|title=Current Members {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129084039/http://www.icj-cij.org/en/current-members|archive-date=29 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=United Nations |title=General Assembly, Security Council Elect Judge to International Court of Justice |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/ga12029.doc.htm |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[United Nations]] |agency=[[United Nations General Assembly]] |date=22 June 2018 |accessdate=26 June 2018|author-link=United Nations }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, being a party to the statute does not automatically give the court jurisdiction over disputes involving those parties. The issue of [[jurisdiction]] is considered in the three types of ICJ cases: contentious issues, incidental jurisdiction, and advisory opinions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dispute Settlement|last=J. G. Merrills|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0521153393|location=New York|pages=116\u2013134}}</ref>\n\n===Contentious issues===\n[[File:Eerste na-oorlogse zitting van het Internationaal Hof van Justititie Weeknummer 48-09 - Open Beelden - 30541.ogv|thumb|First gathering after Second World War, Dutch newsreel from 1946]]\nIn contentious cases (adversarial proceedings seeking to settle a dispute), the ICJ produces a binding ruling between states that agree to submit to the ruling of the court. Only [[Sovereign state|states]] may be parties in contentious cases. Individuals, corporations, component parts of a federal state, NGOs, UN organs and [[self-determination]] groups are excluded from direct participation in cases although the court may receive information from public [[international organization]]s. That does not preclude non-state interests from being the subject of proceedings if a state brings the case against another. For example, a state may, in cases of \"diplomatic protection\", bring a case on behalf of one of its nationals or corporations.<ref>See the ''Nottebohm Case'' (Liechtenstein v Guatemala), [1955] ICJ Reports 4.</ref>\n\nJurisdiction is often a crucial question for the court in contentious cases. (See [[International Court of Justice#Procedure|Procedure]] below.) The key principle is that the ICJ has jurisdiction only on the basis of consent. Article 36 outlines four bases on which the court's jurisdiction may be founded:\n* First, 36(1) provides that parties may refer cases to the court (jurisdiction founded on \"special agreement\" or \"''compromis''\"). This method is based on explicit consent rather than true compulsory jurisdiction. It is, perhaps, the most effective basis for the court's jurisdiction because the parties concerned have a desire for the dispute to be resolved by the court and are thus more likely to comply with the court's judgment.\n* Second, 36(1) also gives the court jurisdiction over \"matters specifically provided for... in treaties and conventions in force\". Most modern [[treaty|treaties]] contain a compromissory clause, providing for dispute resolution by the ICJ.<ref>See [[List of treaties that confer jurisdiction on the ICJ]].</ref> Cases founded on compromissory clauses have not been as effective as cases founded on special agreement since a state may have no interest in having the matter examined by the court and may refuse to comply with a judgment. For example, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], Iran refused to participate in a case brought by the US based on a compromissory clause contained in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] and did not comply with the judgment.<ref>''Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran'' (USA v Iran), [1979] ICJ Reports 7.</ref> Since the 1970s, the use of such clauses has declined. Many modern treaties set out their own dispute resolution regime, often based on forms of [[arbitration]].<ref>See Charney J \"Compromissory Clauses and the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\" (1987) 81 ''American Journal of International Law'' 855.</ref>\n* Third, Article 36(2) allows states to make optional clause declarations accepting the court's jurisdiction. The label \"compulsory\" sometimes placed on Article 36(2) jurisdiction is misleading since declarations by states are voluntary. Furthermore, many declarations contain reservations, such as exclusion from jurisdiction certain types of disputes (\"''ratione materia''\").<ref>See Alexandrov S ''Reservations in Unilateral Declarations Accepting the Compulsory Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice'' (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff, 1995).</ref> The principle of [[reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] may further limit jurisdiction. As of February 2011, sixty-six states had a declaration in force.<ref>For a complete list of countries and their stance with the ICJ, see [http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/index.php?p1=5&p2=1&p3=3 Declarations Recognizing as Compulsory the Jurisdiction of the Court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194034/http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/index.php?p1=5&p2=1&p3=3 |date=29 June 2011 }}. Retrieved 21 February 2011.</ref> Of the permanent Security Council members, only the United Kingdom has a declaration. In the court's early years, most declarations were made by industrialized countries. Since the ''[[Nicaragua v. United States|Nicaragua]]'' case, declarations made by developing countries have increased, reflecting a growing confidence in the court since the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Industrialized countries, however, have sometimes increased exclusions or removed their declarations in recent years. Examples include the United States, as mentioned previously, and Australia, which modified its declaration in 2002 to exclude disputes on [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] (most likely to prevent an impending challenge from East Timor, which gained their independence two months later).<ref>Burton, Bob (17 May 2005).

Retrieved 21 April 2006.</ref>\n* Finally, 36(5) provides for jurisdiction on the basis of declarations made under the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]'s statute. Article 37 of the Statute similarly transfers jurisdiction under any compromissory clause in a treaty that gave jurisdiction to the PCIJ.\n* In addition, the court may have jurisdiction on the basis of tacit consent (''[[forum prorogatum]]''). In the absence of clear jurisdiction under Article 36, jurisdiction is established if the respondent accepts ICJ jurisdiction explicitly or simply pleads [[on the merits]]. The notion arose in the [[Corfu Channel Case]] (UK v Albania) (1949), in which the court held that a letter from Albania stating that it submitted to the jurisdiction of the ICJ was sufficient to grant the court jurisdiction.\n\n=== Incidental jurisdiction ===\nUntil rendering a final judgment, the court has competence to order interim measures for the protection of the rights of a party to a dispute. One or both parties to a dispute may apply the ICJ for issuing interim measures. In the ''Frontier Dispute'' Case, both parties to the dispute, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]], submitted an application to the court to indicate interim measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/69/9961.pdf|title=Provisional measures are indicated in the case of the Frontier Dispute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209093847/http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/69/9961.pdf|archive-date=9 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Incidental jurisdiction of the court derives from the Article 41 of the Statute of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute|title=Statute of the Court {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307151033/http://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute|archive-date=7 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Such as the final judgment, the order for interim measures of the court are binding on state parties to the dispute.

The UN Charter grants the General Assembly or the Security Council a power to request the court to issue an advisory opinion on any legal question. Other organs of the UN rather than GA and SC may not request an  advisory opinion of the ICJ unless the General Assembly authorizes them. Other organs of the UN only request an advisory opinion of the court regarding the matters falling into the scope of their activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-xiv/index.html|title=Chapter XIV|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref> On receiving a request, the court decides which states and organizations might provide useful information and gives them an opportunity to present written or oral statements. Advisory opinions were intended as a means by which UN agencies could seek the court's help in deciding complex legal issues that might fall under their respective mandates.\n\nIn principle, the court's advisory opinions are only consultative in character but they are influential and widely respected. Certain instruments or regulations can provide in advance that the advisory opinion shall be specifically binding on particular agencies or states, but inherently, they are non-binding under the Statute of the Court. This non-binding character does not mean that advisory opinions are without legal effect, because the legal reasoning embodied in them reflects the court's authoritative views on important issues of international law. In arriving at them, the court follows essentially the same rules and procedures that govern its binding judgments delivered in contentious cases submitted to it by sovereign states.\n\nAn advisory opinion derives its status and authority from the fact that it is the official pronouncement of the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/8/issue/27/un-general-assembly-requests-world-court-advisory-opinion-israels |title=The UN General Assembly Requests a World Court Advisory Opinion On Israel's Separation Barrier |author=Pieter H.F. Bekker |date=12 December 2003 |publisher=American Society of International Law |accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAdvisory opinions have often been controversial because the questions asked are controversial or the case was pursued as an indirect way of bringing what is really a contentious case before the court. Examples of advisory opinions can be found in the section [[List of International Court of Justice cases#Advisory opinions|advisory opinions]] in the [[List of International Court of Justice cases]] article. One such well-known advisory opinion is the ''[[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Weapons Case]]''.\n\n==Examples of cases they have fixed==\n{{Main|List of International Court of Justice cases}}\n\n* A complaint by the United States in 1980 that Iran was detaining American diplomats in [[Tehran]] in violation of international law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/64/6291.pdf|title=Reports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders|date=24 May 1980|publisher=International Court of Justice|access-date=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033844/http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/64/6291.pdf|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* A dispute between Tunisia and Libya over the [[delimitation]] of the continental shelf between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/71/6527.pdf|title=Application for Revision and Interpretation of the Judgment of 24 February 1982 in the Case Concerning the Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)|date=10 December 1985|publisher=International Court of Justice|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111085227/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/71/6527.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* A complaint by Iran after the shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by a [[United States Navy]] guided missile cruiser.<ref>\"[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&k=9c&case=79&code=irus&p3=0 Aerial Incident of 3 July 1988 (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

If parties do not comply, the issue may be taken before the Security Council for enforcement action. There are obvious problems with such a method of enforcement. If the judgment is against one of the permanent five members of the Security Council or its allies, any resolution on enforcement would then be vetoed. That occurred, for example, after the [[Nicaragua v. United States|''Nicaragua'' case]], when Nicaragua brought the issue of the United States' noncompliance with the court's decision before the Security Council.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Furthermore, if the Security Council refuses to enforce a judgment against any other state, there is no method of forcing the state to comply. Furthermore, the most effective form to take action for the Security Council, coercive action under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], can be justified only if [[International Peace and Security|international peace and security]] are at stake. The Security Council has never done that so far.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe relationship between the ICJ and the [[Security Council]], and the separation of their powers, was considered by the court in 1992 in the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|''Pan Am'' case]]. The court had to consider an application from Libya for the order of [[provisional measures of protection]] to safeguard its rights, which, it alleged, were being infringed by the threat of economic sanctions by the United Kingdom and United States. The problem was that these sanctions had been authorized by the Security Council, which resulted in a potential conflict between the Chapter VII functions of the Security Council and the judicial function of the court. The court decided, by eleven votes to five, that it could not order the requested provisional measures because the rights claimed by Libya, even if legitimate under the [[Montreal Convention]], could not be ''[[prima facie]]'' regarded as appropriate since the action was ordered by the Security Council. In accordance with Article 103 of the UN Charter, obligations under the Charter took precedence over other treaty obligations. Nevertheless, the court declared the application admissible in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=173&code=lus&p1=3&p2=3&p3=6&case=89&k=82 |title=''Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v.

The court stated in the ''Nicaragua'' case that there is no necessary inconsistency between action by the Security Council and adjudication by the ICJ. However, when there is room for conflict, the balance appears to be in favour of the Security Council.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nShould either party fail \"to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court\", the Security Council may be called upon to \"make recommendations or decide upon measures\" if the Security Council deems such actions necessary. In practice, the court's powers have been limited by the unwillingness of the losing party to abide by the court's ruling and by the Security Council's unwillingness to impose consequences. However, in theory, \"so far as the parties to the case are concerned, a judgment of the Court is binding, final and without appeal\", and \"by signing the Charter, a State Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with any decision of the International Court of Justice in a case to which it is a party.\"{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nFor example, the United States had previously accepted the court's compulsory jurisdiction upon its creation in 1946 but in 1984, after ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'', withdrew its acceptance following the court's judgment that called on the US to \"cease and to refrain\" from the \"unlawful use of force\" against the government of Nicaragua. The court ruled (with only the American judge dissenting) that the United States was \"in breach of its obligation under the Treaty of Friendship with Nicaragua not to use force against Nicaragua\" and ordered the United States to pay [[war reparation]]s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Law applied==\n{{Main|Sources of international law}}\n\nWhen deciding cases, the court applies international law as summarized in [[s:Statute of the International Court of Justice#Article 38|Article 38]] of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice|ICJ Statute]], which provides that in arriving at its decisions the court shall apply international conventions, international custom and the \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.\" It may also refer to academic writing (\"the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations\") and previous judicial decisions to help interpret the law although the court is not formally bound by its previous decisions under the doctrine of [[stare decisis]]. [[s:Statute of the International Court of Justice#Article 59|Article 59]] makes clear that the [[common law]] notion of [[precedent]] or ''[[stare decisis]]'' does not apply to the decisions of the ICJ. The court's decision binds only the parties to that particular controversy. Under 38(1)(d), however, the court may consider its own previous decisions.\n\nIf the parties agree, they may also grant the court the liberty to decide ''[[ex aequo et bono]]'' (\"in justice and fairness\"),<ref>Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38(2)</ref> granting the ICJ the freedom to make an equitable decision based on what is fair under the circumstances. That provision has not been used in the court's history. So far, the International Court of Justice has dealt with about 130 cases.\n\n==Procedure==\nThe ICJ is vested with the power to make its own rules. Court procedure is set out in the ''Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice 1978'' (as amended on 29 September 2005).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nCases before the ICJ will follow a standard pattern. The case is lodged by the applicant, which files a written memorial setting out the basis of the court's jurisdiction and the merits of its claim. The respondent may accept the court's jurisdiction and file its own memorial on the merits of the case.\n\n===Preliminary objections===\nA respondent that does not wish to submit to the jurisdiction of the court may raise preliminary objections. Any such objections must be ruled upon before the court can address the merits of the applicant's claim. Often, a separate public hearing is held on the preliminary objections and the court will render a judgment. Respondents normally file preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the court and/or the admissibility of the case. Inadmissibility refers to a range of arguments about factors the court should take into account in deciding jurisdiction, such as the fact that the issue is not justiciable or that it is not a \"legal dispute\".\n\nIn addition, objections may be made because all necessary parties are not before the court. If the case necessarily requires the court to rule on the rights and obligations of a state that has not consented to the court's jurisdiction, the court does not proceed to issue a judgment on the merits.\n\nIf the court decides it has jurisdiction and the case is admissible, the respondent then is required to file a Memorial addressing the merits of the applicant's claim. Once all written arguments are filed, the court holds a public hearing on the merits.\n\nOnce a case has been filed, any party (usually the applicant) may seek an order from the court to protect the ''status quo'' pending the hearing of the case. Such orders are known as Provisional (or Interim) Measures and are analogous to interlocutory [[injunction]]s in [[United States law]]. Article 41 of the statute allows the court to make such orders. The court must be satisfied to have ''[[prima facie]]'' jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case before it grants provisional measures.\n\n===Applications to intervene===\nIn cases in which a third state's interests are affected, that state may be permitted to intervene in the case and participate as a full party. Under Article 62, a state \"with an interest of a legal nature\" may apply; however, it is within the court's discretion whether or not to allow the intervention. Intervention applications are rare, and the first successful application occurred only in 1991.\n\n===Judgment and remedies===\nOnce deliberation has taken place, the court issues a majority opinion. Individual judges may issue concurring opinions (if they agree with the outcome reached in the judgment of the court but differ in their reasoning) or dissenting opinions (if they disagree with the majority). No appeal is possible, but any party may ask for the court to clarify if there is a dispute as to the meaning or scope of the court's judgment.<ref>Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 60</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2015}}\nThe International Court has been criticized with respect to its rulings, its procedures, and its authority. As with [[criticisms of the United Nations]], many of these criticisms refer more to the general authority assigned to the body by member states through its charter than to specific problems with the composition of judges or their rulings. Major criticisms include the following:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ogbodo|first1=S.

According to the sovereignty principle of international law, no nation is superior or inferior against another. Therefore, there is no entity that could force the states into practice of the law or punish the states in case any violation of international law occurs. Therefore, the absence of binding force means that the {{UNnum}} member states of the ICJ do not necessarily have to accept the jurisdiction. Moreover, membership in the UN and ICJ does not give the court automatic jurisdiction over the member states, but it is the consent of each state to follow the jurisdiction that matters.\n* Organizations, private enterprises, and individuals cannot have their cases taken to the International Court or appeal a national supreme court's ruling. UN agencies likewise cannot bring up a case except in advisory opinions (a process initiated by the court and non-binding). Only states can bring the cases and become the defendants of the cases. This also means that the potential victims of crimes against humanity, such as minor ethnic groups or indigenous peoples, may not have appropriate backing by a state.\n* Other existing international thematic courts, such as the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], are not under the umbrella of the International Court. Unlike ICJ, international thematic courts like ICC work independently from United Nations. Such dualistic structure between various international courts sometimes makes it hard for the courts to engage in effective and collective jurisdiction.\n* The International Court does not enjoy a full [[separation of powers]], with permanent members of the Security Council being able to veto enforcement of cases, even those to which they consented to be bound.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871831,00.html |title=\"World Court: Completing the Circle\" ''Time'', 28 November 1960 |work=Time |date=28 November 1960 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Because the jurisdiction does not have binding force itself, in many cases, the instances of aggression are adjudicated by Security Council by adopting a resolution, etc. There is, therefore, a likelihood for the permanent member states of Security Council to avoid the legal responsibility brought up by International Court of Justice, as shown in the example of ''[[Nicaragua v.

organ of the [[United Nations]] (UN). The ICJ settles disputes between states and gives [[advisory opinions]] on international legal issues referred to it by the [[UN organs|UN]]. Through its opinions and rulings, it serves as [[Sources of international law|a source of international law]].\n\nThe ICJ is the successor of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] (PCIJ), which was established by the [[League of Nations]] in 1920. After the Second World War, both the League and the PCIJ were succeeded by the United Nations and ICJ, respectively. The Statute of the ICJ draws heavily from that of its predecessor, and the latter's decisions remain valid. All [[Member states of the United Nations|members of the UN]] are party to the ICJ Statute.\n\nThe ICJ comprises a panel of 15 judges elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] for nine-year terms. The court is seated in the [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, making it the only principal U.N. organ not located in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Court {{!}} International Court of Justice|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/court|website=www.icj-cij.org|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110090149/http://www.icj-cij.org/en/court|archive-date=10 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its official working languages are English and French.\n\n== History ==\nThe first permanent institution established for the purpose of settling international disputes was the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (PCA), which was created by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Peace Conference]] of 1899. Initiated by Russian Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II,]] the conference involved all the world's major powers, as well as several smaller states, resulted in the first multilateral treaties concerned with the conduct of warfare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hag99-01.asp|title=The Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907; a series of lectures delivered before the Johns Hopkins University in the year 1908|last=Scott|first=James Brown|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> Among these was the ''Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes'', which set forth the institutional and procedural framework for arbitral proceedings, which would take place in [[The Hague|The Hague, Netherlands]]. Although the proceedings would be supported by a permanent bureau\u2014whose functions would be equivalent to that of a secretariat or court registry\u2014the arbitrators would be appointed by the disputing states from a larger pool provided by each member of the Convention. The PCA was established in 1900 and began proceedings in 1902.\n\nA [[second Hague Peace Conference]] in 1907, which involved most of the world's sovereign states, revised the Convention and enhanced the rules governing arbitral proceedings before the PCA. During this conference, the United States, Great Britain and Germany submitted a joint proposal for a permanent court whose judges would serve full-time. As the delegates could not agree as to how the judges would be selected, the matter was temporarily shelved pending an agreement to be adopted at a later convention.\n\nThe Hague Peace Conferences, and the ideas that emerged therefrom, influenced the creation of the [[Central American Court of Justice]], which was established in 1908 as one of the earliest regional judicial bodies. Various plans and proposals were made between 1911 and 1919 for the establishment of an international judicial tribunal, which would not be realized into the formation of a new international system following the First World War.\n\n=== The Permanent Court of International Justice ===\nThe unprecedented bloodshed of the First World War led to the creation of the [[League of Nations]], established by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919 as the first worldwide intergovernmental organization aimed at maintaining peace and collective security. Article 14 League's [[Covenant of the League of Nations|Covenant]] called for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), which would be responsible for adjudicating any international dispute submitted to it by the contesting parties, as well as to provide an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the League of Nations.\n\nIn December 1920, following several drafts and debates, the Assembly of the League unanimously adopted the Statute of the PCIJ, which was signed and ratified the following year by a majority of members. Among other things, the new Statute resolved the contentious issues of selecting judges by providing that the judges be elected by both the Council and the Assembly of the League concurrently but independently. The makeup of the PCIJ would reflect the \"main forms of civilization and the principal legal systems of the world\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icj-cij.org/en/history|title=History {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> The PCIJ would be permanently placed at the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague, alongside Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\nThe PCIJ represented a major innovation in international jurisprudence in several ways:\n\n* Unlike previous international arbitral tribunals, it was a permanent body governed by its own statutory provisions and rules of procedure\n* It had a permanent registry that served as a liaison with governments and international bodies;\n* Its proceedings were largely public, including pleadings, oral arguments, and all documentary evidence;\n* It was accessible to all states and could be declared by states to have compulsory jurisdiction over disputes; \n* The PCIJ Statute was the first to list sources of law it would draw upon, which in turn became sources of international law\n* Judges were more representative of the world and its legal systems than any prior international judicial body.\n* As a permanent body, the PCIJ would, over time, make a series decisions and rulings that would develop international law\n\nUnlike the ICJ, the PCIJ was not part of the League, nor were members of the League automatically a party to its Statute. The United States, which played a key role in both the second Hague Peace Conference and the Paris Peace Conference, was notably not a member of the League, although several of its nationals served as judges of the Court.\n\nFrom its first session in 1922 until 1940, the PCIJ dealt with 29 interstate disputes and issued 27 advisory opinions. The Court's widespread acceptance was reflected by the fact that several hundred international treaties and agreements conferred jurisdiction upon it over specified categories of disputes. In addition to helping resolve several serious international disputes, the PCIJ helped clarify several ambiguities in international law that contributed to its development.\n\nThe United States played a major role in setting up the World Court but never joined.<ref>David S. Patterson, \"The United States and the origins of the world court.\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' 91.2 (1976): 279-295.

The [[Second world war|Second World War]] effectively put an end to the Court, which held its last public session on December 1939 and issued its last orders on February 1940. In 1942 the United States and United Kingdom jointly declared support for establishing or re-establishing an international court after the war, and in 1943, the U.K. chaired a panel of jurists from around the world, the \"Inter-Allied Committee\", to discuss the matter. Its 1944 report recommended that:\n\n* The statute of any new international court should be based on that of the PCIJ;\n* The new court should retain an advisory jurisdiction;\n* Acceptance of the new court's jurisdiction should be voluntary;\n* The court should deal only with judicial and not political matters\n\nSeveral months later, a conference of the major Allied Powers\u2014China, the USSR, the U.K., and the U.S.\u2014issued a joint declaration recognizing the necessity \u201cof establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/moscow.asp|title=The Moscow Conference, October 1943|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nThe following Allied conference at [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference|Dumbarton Oaks]], in the United States, published a proposal in October 1944 that called for the establishment of an intergovernmental organization that would include an international court. A meeting was subsequently convened in Washington, D.C. in April 1945, involving 44 jurists from around the world to draft a statute for the proposed court. The draft statute was substantially similar to that of the PCIJ, and it was questioned whether a new court should even be created. During the [[San Francisco Conference]], which took place from 25 April to 26 June 1945 and involved 50 countries, it was decided that an entirely new court should be established as a principal organ of the new United Nations. The statute of this court would form an integral part of the [[United Nations Charter]], which, to maintain continuity, expressly held that the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was based upon that of the PCIJ.\n\nConsequently, the PCIJ convened for the last time in October 1945 and resolved to transfer its archives to its successor, which would take its place at the Peace Palace. The judges of the PCIJ all resigned on 31 January 1946, with the election of the first members of the ICJ taking place the following February at the [[First session of the United Nations General Assembly|First Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council]]. In April 1946, the PCIJ was formally dissolved, and the ICJ, in its first meeting, elected as President [[Jos\u00e9 Gustavo Guerrero]] of El Salvador, who had served as the last President of the PCIJ. The Court also appointed members of its Registry, drawn largely from that of the PCIJ, and held an inaugural public sitting later that month.\n\nThe first case was submitted in May 1947 by the United Kingdom against Albania concerning [[Corfu Channel case|incidents in the Corfu Channel]].\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague, Netherlands, seat of the ICJ]]\nEstablished in 1945 by the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]], the court began work in 1946 as the successor to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].

United States]]''), the United States withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a discretionary basis.<ref>Churchill, Ward.

The election process is set out in Articles 4\u201319 of the ICJ Statute. Elections are staggered, with five judges elected every three years to ensure continuity within the court. Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally been to elect a judge in a special election to complete the term.\n\nNo two judges may be nationals of the same country. According to Article 9, the membership of the court is supposed to represent the \"main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world\". Essentially, that has meant [[common law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[socialist law]] (now post-communist law).\n\nThere is an informal understanding that the seats will be distributed [[United Nations Regional Groups|by geographic regions]] so that there are five seats for Western countries, three for [[Africa|African states]] (including one judge of [[francophone]] civil law, one of Anglophone common law and one Arab), two for Eastern European states, three for Asian states and two for Latin American and Caribbean states.<ref>Harris, D. ''Cases and Materials on International Law, 7th ed.'' (2012, London) p. 839.</ref> For most of the court's history, the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] (France, USSR, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have always had a judge serving, thereby occupying three of the Western seats, one of the Asian seats and one of the Eastern European seats. Exceptions have been China not having a judge on the court from 1967 to 1985, during which time it did not put forward a candidate, and British judge Sir Christopher Greenwood being withdrawn as a candidate for election for a second nine-year term on the bench in 2017, leaving no judges from the United Kingdom on the court.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\">{{cite news|title=International Court of Justice: UK abandons bid for seat on UN bench|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42061028|accessdate=21 November 2017|agency=BBC}}</ref> Greenwood had been supported by the UN Security Council but failed to get a majority in the UN General Assembly.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\" /> Indian judge Dalveer Bhandari instead took the seat.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\" />\n\nArticle 6 of the Statute provides that all judges should be \"elected regardless of their nationality among persons of high moral character\" who are either qualified for the highest judicial office in their home states or known as lawyers with sufficient competence in international law. Judicial independence is dealt with specifically in Articles 16\u201318. Judges of the ICJ are not able to hold any other post or act as counsel. In practice, members of the court have their own interpretation of these rules and allow them to be involved in outside arbitration and hold professional posts as long as there is no conflict of interest. A judge can be dismissed only by a unanimous vote of the other members of the court.<ref>ICJ Statute, Article 18(1)</ref> Despite these provisions, the independence of ICJ judges has been questioned. For example, during the [[Nicaragua v. United States|''Nicaragua'' case]], the United States issued a communiqu\u00e9 suggesting that it could not present sensitive material to the court because of the presence of judges from the Soviet bloc.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua'' (Nicaragua v USA), [1986] ICJ Reports 14, 158\u201360 (Merits) per Judge Lachs.</ref>\n\nJudges may deliver joint judgments or give their own separate opinions. Decisions and [[advisory opinion]]s are by majority, and, in the event of an equal division, the President's vote becomes decisive, which occurred  in the ''Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict'' (Opinion requested by WHO), [1996] ICJ Reports 66. Judges may also deliver separate dissenting opinions.\n\n===''Ad hoc'' judges===\nArticle 31 of the statute sets out a procedure whereby ''[[ad hoc]]'' judges sit on contentious cases before the court. The system allows any party to a contentious case (if it otherwise does not have one of that party's nationals sitting on the court) to select one additional person to sit as a judge on that case only. It is thus possible that as many as seventeen judges may sit on one case.\n\nThe system may seem strange when compared with domestic court processes, but its purpose is to encourage states to submit cases. For example, if a state knows that it will have a judicial officer who can participate in deliberation and offer other judges local knowledge and an understanding of the state's perspective, it may be more willing to submit to the jurisdiction of the court. Although this system does not sit well with the judicial nature of the body, it is usually of little practical consequence. ''Ad hoc'' judges usually (but not always) vote in favour of the state that appointed them and thus cancel each other out.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Posner, E. A., and De Figueiredo, M. F.

Articles 26\u201329 of the statute allow the court to form smaller chambers, usually 3 or 5 judges, to hear cases. Two types of chambers are contemplated by Article 26: firstly, chambers for special categories of cases, and second, the formation of ''ad hoc'' chambers to hear particular disputes. In 1993, a special chamber was established, under Article 26(1) of the ICJ statute, to deal specifically with environmental matters (although it has never been used).\n\n''Ad hoc'' chambers are more frequently convened. For example, chambers were used to hear the ''Gulf of Maine Case'' (Canada/US).<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ibasicdocuments/ibasictext/ibasicrulesofcourt_20050929.htm Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice 1978] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126131908/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ibasicdocuments/ibasictext/ibasicrulesofcourt_20050929.htm |date=26 November 2005 }} (as amended on 5 December 2000).

Judgments of chambers may have either less authority than full Court judgments or diminish the proper interpretation of universal international law informed by a variety of cultural and legal perspectives. On the other hand, the use of chambers might encourage greater recourse to the court and thus enhance international [[dispute resolution]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Schwebel S \"Ad Hoc Chambers of the International Court of Justice\" (1987) 81 ''American Journal of International Law'' 831.</ref>\n\n===Current composition===\n{{As of|2018|June|22}}, the composition of the court is as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/current-members|title=Current Members {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129084039/http://www.icj-cij.org/en/current-members|archive-date=29 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=United Nations |title=General Assembly, Security Council Elect Judge to International Court of Justice |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/ga12029.doc.htm |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[United Nations]] |agency=[[United Nations General Assembly]] |date=22 June 2018 |accessdate=26 June 2018|author-link=United Nations }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, being a party to the statute does not automatically give the court jurisdiction over disputes involving those parties. The issue of [[jurisdiction]] is considered in the three types of ICJ cases: contentious issues, incidental jurisdiction, and advisory opinions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dispute Settlement|last=J. G. Merrills|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0521153393|location=New York|pages=116\u2013134}}</ref>\n\n===Contentious issues===\n[[File:Eerste na-oorlogse zitting van het Internationaal Hof van Justititie Weeknummer 48-09 - Open Beelden - 30541.ogv|thumb|First gathering after Second World War, Dutch newsreel from 1946]]\nIn contentious cases (adversarial proceedings seeking to settle a dispute), the ICJ produces a binding ruling between states that agree to submit to the ruling of the court. Only [[Sovereign state|states]] may be parties in contentious cases. Individuals, corporations, component parts of a federal state, NGOs, UN organs and [[self-determination]] groups are excluded from direct participation in cases although the court may receive information from public [[international organization]]s. That does not preclude non-state interests from being the subject of proceedings if a state brings the case against another. For example, a state may, in cases of \"diplomatic protection\", bring a case on behalf of one of its nationals or corporations.<ref>See the ''Nottebohm Case'' (Liechtenstein v Guatemala), [1955] ICJ Reports 4.</ref>\n\nJurisdiction is often a crucial question for the court in contentious cases. (See [[International Court of Justice#Procedure|Procedure]] below.) The key principle is that the ICJ has jurisdiction only on the basis of consent. Article 36 outlines four bases on which the court's jurisdiction may be founded:\n* First, 36(1) provides that parties may refer cases to the court (jurisdiction founded on \"special agreement\" or \"''compromis''\"). This method is based on explicit consent rather than true compulsory jurisdiction. It is, perhaps, the most effective basis for the court's jurisdiction because the parties concerned have a desire for the dispute to be resolved by the court and are thus more likely to comply with the court's judgment.\n* Second, 36(1) also gives the court jurisdiction over \"matters specifically provided for... in treaties and conventions in force\". Most modern [[treaty|treaties]] contain a compromissory clause, providing for dispute resolution by the ICJ.<ref>See [[List of treaties that confer jurisdiction on the ICJ]].</ref> Cases founded on compromissory clauses have not been as effective as cases founded on special agreement since a state may have no interest in having the matter examined by the court and may refuse to comply with a judgment. For example, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], Iran refused to participate in a case brought by the US based on a compromissory clause contained in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] and did not comply with the judgment.<ref>''Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran'' (USA v Iran), [1979] ICJ Reports 7.</ref> Since the 1970s, the use of such clauses has declined. Many modern treaties set out their own dispute resolution regime, often based on forms of [[arbitration]].<ref>See Charney J \"Compromissory Clauses and the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\" (1987) 81 ''American Journal of International Law'' 855.</ref>\n* Third, Article 36(2) allows states to make optional clause declarations accepting the court's jurisdiction. The label \"compulsory\" sometimes placed on Article 36(2) jurisdiction is misleading since declarations by states are voluntary. Furthermore, many declarations contain reservations, such as exclusion from jurisdiction certain types of disputes (\"''ratione materia''\").<ref>See Alexandrov S ''Reservations in Unilateral Declarations Accepting the Compulsory Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice'' (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff, 1995).</ref> The principle of [[reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] may further limit jurisdiction. As of February 2011, sixty-six states had a declaration in force.<ref>For a complete list of countries and their stance with the ICJ, see [http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/index.php?p1=5&p2=1&p3=3 Declarations Recognizing as Compulsory the Jurisdiction of the Court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194034/http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/index.php?p1=5&p2=1&p3=3 |date=29 June 2011 }}. Retrieved 21 February 2011.</ref> Of the permanent Security Council members, only the United Kingdom has a declaration. In the court's early years, most declarations were made by industrialized countries. Since the ''[[Nicaragua v. United States|Nicaragua]]'' case, declarations made by developing countries have increased, reflecting a growing confidence in the court since the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Industrialized countries, however, have sometimes increased exclusions or removed their declarations in recent years. Examples include the United States, as mentioned previously, and Australia, which modified its declaration in 2002 to exclude disputes on [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] (most likely to prevent an impending challenge from East Timor, which gained their independence two months later).<ref>Burton, Bob (17 May 2005).

Retrieved 21 April 2006.</ref>\n* Finally, 36(5) provides for jurisdiction on the basis of declarations made under the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]'s statute. Article 37 of the Statute similarly transfers jurisdiction under any compromissory clause in a treaty that gave jurisdiction to the PCIJ.\n* In addition, the court may have jurisdiction on the basis of tacit consent (''[[forum prorogatum]]''). In the absence of clear jurisdiction under Article 36, jurisdiction is established if the respondent accepts ICJ jurisdiction explicitly or simply pleads [[on the merits]]. The notion arose in the [[Corfu Channel Case]] (UK v Albania) (1949), in which the court held that a letter from Albania stating that it submitted to the jurisdiction of the ICJ was sufficient to grant the court jurisdiction.\n\n=== Incidental jurisdiction ===\nUntil rendering a final judgment, the court has competence to order interim measures for the protection of the rights of a party to a dispute. One or both parties to a dispute may apply the ICJ for issuing interim measures. In the ''Frontier Dispute'' Case, both parties to the dispute, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]], submitted an application to the court to indicate interim measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/69/9961.pdf|title=Provisional measures are indicated in the case of the Frontier Dispute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209093847/http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/69/9961.pdf|archive-date=9 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Incidental jurisdiction of the court derives from the Article 41 of the Statute of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute|title=Statute of the Court {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307151033/http://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute|archive-date=7 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Such as the final judgment, the order for interim measures of the court are binding on state parties to the dispute.

The UN Charter grants the General Assembly or the Security Council a power to request the court to issue an advisory opinion on any legal question. Other organs of the UN rather than GA and SC may not request an  advisory opinion of the ICJ unless the General Assembly authorizes them. Other organs of the UN only request an advisory opinion of the court regarding the matters falling into the scope of their activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-xiv/index.html|title=Chapter XIV|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref> On receiving a request, the court decides which states and organizations might provide useful information and gives them an opportunity to present written or oral statements. Advisory opinions were intended as a means by which UN agencies could seek the court's help in deciding complex legal issues that might fall under their respective mandates.\n\nIn principle, the court's advisory opinions are only consultative in character but they are influential and widely respected. Certain instruments or regulations can provide in advance that the advisory opinion shall be specifically binding on particular agencies or states, but inherently, they are non-binding under the Statute of the Court. This non-binding character does not mean that advisory opinions are without legal effect, because the legal reasoning embodied in them reflects the court's authoritative views on important issues of international law. In arriving at them, the court follows essentially the same rules and procedures that govern its binding judgments delivered in contentious cases submitted to it by sovereign states.\n\nAn advisory opinion derives its status and authority from the fact that it is the official pronouncement of the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/8/issue/27/un-general-assembly-requests-world-court-advisory-opinion-israels |title=The UN General Assembly Requests a World Court Advisory Opinion On Israel's Separation Barrier |author=Pieter H.F.

Examples of advisory opinions can be found in the section [[List of International Court of Justice cases#Advisory opinions|advisory opinions]] in the [[List of International Court of Justice cases]] article.

If parties do not comply, the issue may be taken before the Security Council for enforcement action. There are obvious problems with such a method of enforcement. If the judgment is against one of the permanent five members of the Security Council or its allies, any resolution on enforcement would then be vetoed. That occurred, for example, after the [[Nicaragua v. United States|''Nicaragua'' case]], when Nicaragua brought the issue of the United States' noncompliance with the court's decision before the Security Council.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Furthermore, if the Security Council refuses to enforce a judgment against any other state, there is no method of forcing the state to comply. Furthermore, the most effective form to take action for the Security Council, coercive action under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], can be justified only if [[International Peace and Security|international peace and security]] are at stake. The Security Council has never done that so far.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe relationship between the ICJ and the [[Security Council]], and the separation of their powers, was considered by the court in 1992 in the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|''Pan Am'' case]]. The court had to consider an application from Libya for the order of [[provisional measures of protection]] to safeguard its rights, which, it alleged, were being infringed by the threat of economic sanctions by the United Kingdom and United States. The problem was that these sanctions had been authorized by the Security Council, which resulted in a potential conflict between the Chapter VII functions of the Security Council and the judicial function of the court. The court decided, by eleven votes to five, that it could not order the requested provisional measures because the rights claimed by Libya, even if legitimate under the [[Montreal Convention]], could not be ''[[prima facie]]'' regarded as appropriate since the action was ordered by the Security Council. In accordance with Article 103 of the UN Charter, obligations under the Charter took precedence over other treaty obligations. Nevertheless, the court declared the application admissible in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=173&code=lus&p1=3&p2=3&p3=6&case=89&k=82 |title=''Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v.

The court stated in the ''Nicaragua'' case that there is no necessary inconsistency between action by the Security Council and adjudication by the ICJ. However, when there is room for conflict, the balance appears to be in favour of the Security Council.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nShould either party fail \"to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court\", the Security Council may be called upon to \"make recommendations or decide upon measures\" if the Security Council deems such actions necessary. In practice, the court's powers have been limited by the unwillingness of the losing party to abide by the court's ruling and by the Security Council's unwillingness to impose consequences. However, in theory, \"so far as the parties to the case are concerned, a judgment of the Court is binding, final and without appeal\", and \"by signing the Charter, a State Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with any decision of the International Court of Justice in a case to which it is a party.\"{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nFor example, the United States had previously accepted the court's compulsory jurisdiction upon its creation in 1946 but in 1984, after ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'', withdrew its acceptance following the court's judgment that called on the US to \"cease and to refrain\" from the \"unlawful use of force\" against the government of Nicaragua. The court ruled (with only the American judge dissenting) that the United States was \"in breach of its obligation under the Treaty of Friendship with Nicaragua not to use force against Nicaragua\" and ordered the United States to pay [[war reparation]]s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Law applied==\n{{Main|Sources of international law}}\n\nWhen deciding cases, the court applies international law as summarized in [[s:Statute of the International Court of Justice#Article 38|Article 38]] of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice|ICJ Statute]], which provides that in arriving at its decisions the court shall apply international conventions, international custom and the \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.\" It may also refer to academic writing (\"the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations\") and previous judicial decisions to help interpret the law although the court is not formally bound by its previous decisions under the doctrine of [[stare decisis]]. [[s:Statute of the International Court of Justice#Article 59|Article 59]] makes clear that the [[common law]] notion of [[precedent]] or ''[[stare decisis]]'' does not apply to the decisions of the ICJ. The court's decision binds only the parties to that particular controversy. Under 38(1)(d), however, the court may consider its own previous decisions.\n\nIf the parties agree, they may also grant the court the liberty to decide ''[[ex aequo et bono]]'' (\"in justice and fairness\"),<ref>Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38(2)</ref> granting the ICJ the freedom to make an equitable decision based on what is fair under the circumstances. That provision has not been used in the court's history. So far, the International Court of Justice has dealt with about 130 cases.\n\n==Procedure==\nThe ICJ is vested with the power to make its own rules. Court procedure is set out in the ''Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice 1978'' (as amended on 29 September 2005).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nCases before the ICJ will follow a standard pattern. The case is lodged by the applicant, which files a written memorial setting out the basis of the court's jurisdiction and the merits of its claim. The respondent may accept the court's jurisdiction and file its own memorial on the merits of the case.\n\n===Preliminary objections===\nA respondent that does not wish to submit to the jurisdiction of the court may raise preliminary objections. Any such objections must be ruled upon before the court can address the merits of the applicant's claim. Often, a separate public hearing is held on the preliminary objections and the court will render a judgment. Respondents normally file preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the court and/or the admissibility of the case. Inadmissibility refers to a range of arguments about factors the court should take into account in deciding jurisdiction, such as the fact that the issue is not justiciable or that it is not a \"legal dispute\".\n\nIn addition, objections may be made because all necessary parties are not before the court. If the case necessarily requires the court to rule on the rights and obligations of a state that has not consented to the court's jurisdiction, the court does not proceed to issue a judgment on the merits.\n\nIf the court decides it has jurisdiction and the case is admissible, the respondent then is required to file a Memorial addressing the merits of the applicant's claim. Once all written arguments are filed, the court holds a public hearing on the merits.\n\nOnce a case has been filed, any party (usually the applicant) may seek an order from the court to protect the ''status quo'' pending the hearing of the case. Such orders are known as Provisional (or Interim) Measures and are analogous to interlocutory [[injunction]]s in [[United States law]]. Article 41 of the statute allows the court to make such orders. The court must be satisfied to have ''[[prima facie]]'' jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case before it grants provisional measures.\n\n===Applications to intervene===\nIn cases in which a third state's interests are affected, that state may be permitted to intervene in the case and participate as a full party. Under Article 62, a state \"with an interest of a legal nature\" may apply; however, it is within the court's discretion whether or not to allow the intervention. Intervention applications are rare, and the first successful application occurred only in 1991.\n\n===Judgment and remedies===\nOnce deliberation has taken place, the court issues a majority opinion. Individual judges may issue concurring opinions (if they agree with the outcome reached in the judgment of the court but differ in their reasoning) or dissenting opinions (if they disagree with the majority). No appeal is possible, but any party may ask for the court to clarify if there is a dispute as to the meaning or scope of the court's judgment.<ref>Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 60</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2015}}\nThe International Court has been criticized with respect to its rulings, its procedures, and its authority. As with [[criticisms of the United Nations]], many of these criticisms refer more to the general authority assigned to the body by member states through its charter than to specific problems with the composition of judges or their rulings. Major criticisms include the following:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ogbodo|first1=S.

According to the sovereignty principle of international law, no nation is superior or inferior against another. Therefore, there is no entity that could force the states into practice of the law or punish the states in case any violation of international law occurs. Therefore, the absence of binding force means that the {{UNnum}} member states of the ICJ do not necessarily have to accept the jurisdiction. Moreover, membership in the UN and ICJ does not give the court automatic jurisdiction over the member states, but it is the consent of each state to follow the jurisdiction that matters.\n* Organizations, private enterprises, and individuals cannot have their cases taken to the International Court or appeal a national supreme court's ruling. UN agencies likewise cannot bring up a case except in advisory opinions (a process initiated by the court and non-binding). Only states can bring the cases and become the defendants of the cases. This also means that the potential victims of crimes against humanity, such as minor ethnic groups or indigenous peoples, may not have appropriate backing by a state.\n* Other existing international thematic courts, such as the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], are not under the umbrella of the International Court. Unlike ICJ, international thematic courts like ICC work independently from United Nations. Such dualistic structure between various international courts sometimes makes it hard for the courts to engage in effective and collective jurisdiction.\n* The International Court does not enjoy a full [[separation of powers]], with permanent members of the Security Council being able to veto enforcement of cases, even those to which they consented to be bound.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871831,00.html |title=\"World Court: Completing the Circle\" ''Time'', 28 November 1960 |work=Time |date=28 November 1960 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Because the jurisdiction does not have binding force itself, in many cases, the instances of aggression are adjudicated by Security Council by adopting a resolution, etc. There is, therefore, a likelihood for the permanent member states of Security Council to avoid the legal responsibility brought up by International Court of Justice, as shown in the example of ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|Law}}\n* [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]]\n* [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]\n* [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]]\n* [[List of International Court of Justice cases]]\n* [[List of treaties that confer jurisdiction on the International Court of Justice]]\n* [[Supranational aspects of international organizations]]\n* [[Universal jurisdiction]]\n* [[Provisional measure of protection]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Accinelli, R.

The pending confrontation is interrupted by a volley of arrows fired from ships which have just sailed into the port.\n| LineColor           = 8A00C5\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 =Blade of the Immortal (2019 TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 23\n| Title               = Act Twenty Three \u2013 100 Spectacular Dances\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u7109\u821e\u767e\u666f \u2500\u3048\u3093\u3076\u3072\u3083\u3063\u3051\u3044\u2500\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|18}}\n| ShortSummary        = Arrows are fired from ships offshore which shower everyone on the wharves and they run for cover. Rin slips and falls behind, but Anotsu appears and saves her, instructing her to follow him. Kagimura assigns some of his fighters to target Manji and Rin, others to attack Makie, while he prepares to fight Anotsu Kagehisa alone. Meanwhile, Magatsu finds the badly wounded Ryo in the snow and rescues her. Arashino cuts Manji to pieces, but Rin pleads for his life. This provides enough time for Manji to partially repair himself and he attacks and kills Arashino. Anotsu and Kagimura fight each other to a standstill and Ryo intercedes on behalf of her father, but  he insists on fighting without her aid.  Makie approaches them having defeated her opponents, but she is suddenly felled by a volley of gunshots. \n| LineColor           = 8A00C5\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 =Blade of the Immortal (2019 TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 24\n| Title               = Final Act \u2013 Blade of the Immortal\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u7121\u9650\u306e\u4f4f\u4eba\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = The people shooting at the group on the wharves are revealed to be working for Hanabusa, including the shinobi Meguro and Tanpopo. Although, badly wounded and dying, Makie attacks Hanabusa\u2019s small force, killing them all. Hanabusa flees through the snow, but is captured by Anotsu and sliced in two, with the tacit approval of Kagimura. Anotsu and Kagimura then face off to continue their duel, but Kagimura is killed in Anotsu's first attack. Manji then attacks Anotsu to fulfill his promise to Rin who watches on with Hyakurin. Manji, defeats Anotsu, severing his right arm but allowing him to live. Manji tells Rin that Anotsu is dead, but allows him to leave and never return. However, as Anotsu boards a ship to depart, Rin rushes forward and stabs him to death. In the aftermath of these events, Magatsu settles down to farming and Renzo goes back to painting under master Sori, much to the annoyance of Sori's daughter Tatsubo. Far away, in the [[Shimabara, Nagasaki|Shimbara region]], Isaku and Doa settle down and also begin farming, joined later by Ozuhan, while Manji is banished from Edo. After paying her respects at her family's grave, Rin decides to apologize to the family members of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b that she and Manji killed, and the heavily pregnant Hyakurin offers to accompany her. Eighty years later, in the city of Tokyo, Manji buries his weapons watched by Yaobikuni and he recalls his encounter with the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b only as a vague memory. Yaobikuni asks him to protect Fuyu, the grandchild of an old friend whose family is engaged in a dispute over leadership. After the young girl hands him a sheathed knife and drawing, he realizes that she is Rin's granddaughter and he agrees.\n| LineColor           = 8A00C5\n}}\n|}</onlyinclude>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Blade of the Immortal}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes|Blade of the Immortal (2019 TV series)]]\n", "name_user": "Rifatul", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correction of typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_of_the_Immortal_(2019_TV_series)"}

Instead of approximating {{math|''n''!}}, one considers its [[natural logarithm]] as this is a [[slowly varying function]]:\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = \\ln 1 + \\ln 2 + \\cdots + \\ln n.</math>\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation minus\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\ln 1 + \\ln n) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n</math>\n\nis the approximation by the [[trapezoid rule]] of the integral\n\n:<math>\\ln n! - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x\\,{\\rm d}x = n \\ln n - n + 1,</math>\n\nand the error in this approximation is given by the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\ln n! - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n & = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln 1 + \\ln 2 + \\ln 3 + \\cdots + \\ln(n-1) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n\\\\\n& = n \\ln n - n + 1 + \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^{k-1}} - 1 \\right) + R_{m,n},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|B<sub>k</sub>}} is a [[Bernoulli number]], and {{math|''R''<sub>''m'',''n''</sub>}} is the remainder term in the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula. Take limits to find that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\ln n! - n \\ln n + n - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n \\right) = 1 - \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} + \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R_{m,n}.</math>\n\nDenote this limit as {{mvar|y}}.  Because the remainder {{math|''R''<sub>''m'',''n''</sub>}} in the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]] satisfies\n\n:<math>R_{m,n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R_{m,n} + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n^m} \\right),</math>\n\nwhere we use [[big-O notation]], combining the equations above yields the approximation formula in its logarithmic form:\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = n \\ln \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n + y + \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)n^{k-1}} + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n^m} \\right).</math>\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides and choosing any positive integer {{mvar|m}}, we get a formula involving an unknown quantity {{mvar|e<sup>y</sup>}}. For {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, the formula is\n\n:<math>n! = e^y \\sqrt{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n \\left( 1 + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\right).</math>\n\nThe quantity {{mvar|e<sup>y</sup>}} can be found by taking the limit on both sides as {{mvar|n}} tends to infinity and using [[Wallis product|Wallis' product]], which shows that {{math|''e<sup>y</sup>'' {{=}} {{sqrt|2''\u03c0''}}}}. Therefore, we get Stirling's formula:\n\n:<math>n! = \\sqrt{2 \\pi n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n \\left( 1 + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\right).</math>\n\n== An alternative derivation ==\nAn alternative formula for {{math|''n''!}} using the [[gamma function]] is\n:<math> n! = \\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-x}\\,{\\rm d}x.</math>\n(as can be seen by repeated integration by parts). Rewriting and changing variables {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''ny''}}, one gets\n:<math> n! = \\int_0^\\infty e^{n\\ln x-x}\\,{\\rm d}x = e^{n \\ln n} n \\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y -y)}\\,{\\rm d}y.</math>\nApplying [[Laplace's method]] we have\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y -y)}\\,{\\rm d}y \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n},</math>\nwhich recovers Stirling's formula:\n:<math>n! \\sim e^{n \\ln n} n \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\n= \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.\n</math>\nIn fact, further corrections can also be obtained using Laplace's method. For example, computing two-order expansion using Laplace's method yields\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y-y)}\\,{\\rm d}y \\sim  \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{12 n}\\right)</math>\nand gives Stirling's formula to two orders:\n:<math> n! \\sim e^{n \\ln n} n \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{12 n}\\right)\n= \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{12 n}\\right).\n</math>\n\nA complex-analysis version of this method<ref>Phillipe Flajolet and Robert Sedgewick, ''[[Analytic Combinatorics]]'', p.\u00a0555.</ref> is to consider <math>\\frac{1}{n!}</math> as a [[Taylor series|Taylor coefficient]] of the exponential function <math>e^z = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{z^n}{n!}</math>, computed by [[Cauchy's integral formula]] as\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{n!} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint\\limits_{|z|=r} \\frac{e^z}{z^{n+1}} \\, \\mathrm dz. </math>\n\nThis line integral can then be approximated using the [[Method of steepest descent|saddle-point method]] with an appropriate choice of countour radius <math>r = r_n</math>. The dominant portion of the integral near the saddle point is then approximated by a real integral and Laplace's method, while the remaining portion of the integral can be bounded above to give an error term.\n\n== Speed of convergence and error estimates ==\n[[File:Stirling series relative error.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The relative error in a truncated Stirling series vs. {{mvar|n}}, for 0 to 5 terms.

These follow from the more [[Stirling's approximation#Speed of convergence and error estimates|precise error bounds]] discussed below.\n\n== Derivation ==\nRoughly speaking, the simplest version of Stirling's formula can be quickly obtained by approximating the sum\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln j</math>\n\nwith an [[integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln j \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x \\,{\\rm d}x = n\\ln n - n + 1.</math>\n\nThe full formula, together with precise estimates of its error, can be derived as follows. Instead of approximating {{math|''n''!}}, one considers its [[natural logarithm]] as this is a [[slowly varying function]]:\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = \\ln 1 + \\ln 2 + \\cdots + \\ln n.</math>\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation minus\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\ln 1 + \\ln n) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n</math>\n\nis the approximation by the [[trapezoid rule]] of the integral\n\n:<math>\\ln n! - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x\\,{\\rm d}x = n \\ln n - n + 1,</math>\n\nand the error in this approximation is given by the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\ln n! - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n & = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln 1 + \\ln 2 + \\ln 3 + \\cdots + \\ln(n-1) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n\\\\\n& = n \\ln n - n + 1 + \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^{k-1}} - 1 \\right) + R_{m,n},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|B<sub>k</sub>}} is a [[Bernoulli number]], and {{math|''R''<sub>''m'',''n''</sub>}} is the remainder term in the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula. Take limits to find that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\ln n! - n \\ln n + n - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n \\right) = 1 - \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} + \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R_{m,n}.</math>\n\nDenote this limit as {{mvar|y}}.  Because the remainder {{math|''R''<sub>''m'',''n''</sub>}} in the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]] satisfies\n\n:<math>R_{m,n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R_{m,n} + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n^m} \\right),</math>\n\nwhere we use [[big-O notation]], combining the equations above yields the approximation formula in its logarithmic form:\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = n \\ln \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n + y + \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)n^{k-1}} + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n^m} \\right).</math>\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides and choosing any positive integer {{mvar|m}}, we get a formula involving an unknown quantity {{mvar|e<sup>y</sup>}}. For {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, the formula is\n\n:<math>n! = e^y \\sqrt{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n \\left( 1 + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\right).</math>\n\nThe quantity {{mvar|e<sup>y</sup>}} can be found by taking the limit on both sides as {{mvar|n}} tends to infinity and using [[Wallis product|Wallis' product]], which shows that {{math|''e<sup>y</sup>'' {{=}} {{sqrt|2''\u03c0''}}}}. Therefore, we get Stirling's formula:\n\n:<math>n! = \\sqrt{2 \\pi n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n \\left( 1 + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\right).</math>\n\n== An alternative derivation ==\nAn alternative formula for {{math|''n''!}} using the [[gamma function]] is\n:<math> n! = \\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-x}\\,{\\rm d}x.</math>\n(as can be seen by repeated integration by parts). Rewriting and changing variables {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''ny''}} one gets\n:<math> n! = \\int_0^\\infty e^{n\\ln x-x}\\,{\\rm d}x = e^{n \\ln n} n \\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y -y)}\\,{\\rm d}y.</math>\nApplying [[Laplace's method]] we have:\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y -y)}\\,{\\rm d}y \\sim  \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}</math>\nwhich recovers Stirling's formula,\n:<math> n! \\sim   e^{n \\ln n} n \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\n= \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.\n</math>\nIn fact further corrections can also be obtained using Laplace's method. For example, computing two-order expansion using Laplace's method yields\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y-y)}\\,{\\rm d}y \\sim  \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{12 n}\\right)</math>\nand gives Stirling's formula to two orders,\n:<math> n! \\sim   e^{n \\ln n} n \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{12 n}\\right)\n= \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n \\left(1+ \\frac{1}{12 n}\\right).\n</math>\n\nA complex-analysis version of this method<ref>Phillipe Flajolet and Robert Sedgewick, ''[[Analytic Combinatorics]]'', p. 555</ref> is to consider <math>\\frac{1}{n!}</math> as a [[Taylor series|Taylor coefficient]] of the exponential function <math>e^z = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{z^n}{n!}</math>, computed by [[Cauchy's integral formula]] as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{n!} \\ = \\ \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!|z|=r}\\, \\frac{e^z}{z^{n+1}} \\, \\mathrm dz. </math>\n\nThis line integral can then be approximated using the [[Method of steepest descent|saddle point method]] with an appropriate choice of countour radius <math>r=r_n</math>. The dominant portion of the integral near the saddle point is then approximated by a real integral and Laplace's method, while the remaining portion of the integral can be bounded above to give an error term.\n\n== Speed of convergence and error estimates ==\n[[File:Stirling series relative error.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The relative error in a truncated Stirling series vs. {{mvar|n}}, for 0 to 5 terms.
