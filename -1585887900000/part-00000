It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light, shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry, open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], and between a line from [[Charters Towers]] south to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

The Australian team won thirteen matches, drew one and lost four but notably won all four of their international matches.\n\nThe 1984 Wallabies were the first and only Australian side to achieve a [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] doing so in four Tests against the [[Home Nations]]. This feat had been achieved five times previously, by the 1978 New Zealand All Blacks and by the South African Springboks during their tours of 1912\u201313, 1931\u201332, 1951\u201352 and 1960\u201361. Australia's classy five-eighth [[Mark Ella]] managed to score a try in every Test. The tour confirmed Australia's coming of age as a world-class rugby nation, marking the end of three difficult decades of inconsistent international performances from 1950 onwards.\n\n==The squad's leadership==\n[[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] was widely experienced as a schoolboy coach but had had only one season coaching first-grade before his rise to the national position. He steered [[Manly RUFC|Manly]] to a surprise victory in the 1983 [[Shute Shield|Sydney 1st Grade Premiership]] over the strong [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick club]]. He was practically unknown in Australian rugby at point but set his sights on the national representative coaching job at a time when the incumbent [[Bob Dwyer]] was becoming increasingly vulnerable.<ref>Fitzsimmons ''Nick Farr-Jones'' p74</ref> Under Dwyer in 1983 the Wallabies lost a two Test series against the [[France national rugby union team|French]], tipping Dwyer's career record to the negative with six losses, five wins and a draw. Jones publicly announced his intentions to stand against Dwyer in early 1984 and ran a media campaign that befitted his experience as a former Prime Ministerial speech writer. In February 1984 he was installed as the national coach and he set out from that point to select, train, guide and strategise Australian rugby to the summit of international success.\n\nAfter failing to wrestle the [[Bledisloe Cup]] away from the [[All Blacks]] in mid-1984 (a 1\u20132 series loss), Jones set his sights on glory from the British Isles tour and the specific goal of winning all four of the Test matches and to eclipse the one win, three loss record of the 1981\u201382 Wallabies. To assist he called upon his friend, the affable Queenslander Alec Evans, who had coached rugby union at Brisbane Grammar School whilst Jones was a teacher  and was a man of enormous rugby experience and knowledge. Evans became the first Assistant-Coach in the history of Wallaby tours. Tour Manager was former Wallaby Captain [[Charles Wilson (rugby)|Charles \"Chilla\" Wilson]] who managed in the style of a \"benevolent, big brother\".<ref>Howell p164</ref> Howell quotes Mark Ella ''\"I couldn't think of a better manager. I played for Australia for six years. Thank God I had Chilla Wilson for three of them. With Jonesy up there dominating everything, Chilla was the perfect foil. He was quiet, unobtrusive and didn't make a lot of noise. In fact, you wouldn't know Chilla was the manager until the time came for somebody to get up and say the right thing\"''<ref>Ella ''Path to Victory'' quoted in Howell p165</ref>\n\n[[Mark Ella]] had captained Australia in ten Tests prior to 1984, including the eleven match [[1983 Australia rugby union tour of Italy and France]]. However Jones had resolved that whichever side won the 1984 interstate series would provide the captain and so [[Andrew Slack]] took up the tour captaincy<ref name=\"Howell p220\">Howell p220</ref> Howell reports that he was a popular captain, a calm organiser both on and off the field. Quiet thoughtful and intelligent but also able to pull out his guitar and bring everyone together with a few songs.<ref name=\"Howell p220\"/> Ella is also quoted ''\"Slacky was probably the only person who could have handled the captaincy in the British Isles. Every team needs a cornerstone and Slacky was it. We all had lots of respect for him....[on-field] his role was to settle the play down, be the link man. Not be happy-go-lucky or adventurous. Slack did it to perfection and always seemed to be there when he was wanted.\"'''<ref>Ella ''Path to Victory'' quoted in Howell</ref>\n\nJones also made a thoughtful choice in appointing his [[Manly RUFC|Manly]] club charge [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Steve Williams]] as vice-captain drawing on his front-foot leadership and strength as an enforcer. Ella is quoted again ''\"When Alan Jones made Steve the senior forward, it was the best thing that could have happened. He took the responsibility and really drove the forwards. [With his] sensational jumping ....our line-out was complete\"''<ref>Ella ''Path to Victory'' quoted in Howell p227</ref>\n\n==Tour itinerary==\nBy 1984 the nine-month-long Wallaby tours of Britain, France and North America were a thing of the past. Quick and cheap air-travel meant that a Test tour of the four [[Home Nations]] could be completed in two months but with only eighteen matches played instead of the thirty of earlier years. Varsity teams were no longer part of the schedule which favoured quality City or regional representative sides for the mid-week fixtures. The traditions of a game against Combined Services and a final tour match against the [[Barbarians FC|Barbarians]] were continued.\n\nTradition was also maintained with a visit by the touring party to [[Buckingham Palace]] to meet [[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]]. During the audience Wallaby breakaway Chris Roche leant on an antique table which broke and crashed to the ground.

Twenty-five metres from the English line, [[Mark Ella|Ella]] received the ball from the scrum base and began to drift across the field with the ball in hand. Lynagh, Gould and [[David Campese]] all ran decoys off Ella at varying angles and the English defence were indecisive. Ella himself then changed pace and slid through the tiniest of openings for a try under the posts.<ref>FitzSimons p105</ref> Lynagh converted and later scored a try himself.\nThe final try was a brilliant team effort. Farr-Jones had received the ball from the line-out and passed to Gould who threw a long wayward pass which Ella salvaged in safe hands while running and leaning forward at the same time. Finding the English defence lacking in numbers, Ella passed to Campese who took off to out-sprint English winger [[Rory Underwood]]. Ella was in support but marked by English debutant [[Stuart Barnes]]. Running out of space and about to be bundled into touch, Campese lofted a pass to [[Simon Poidevin]], who scored the final try.\n\n<small>'''AUSTRALIA''': Roger Gould, [[David Campese]], [[Andrew Slack]] (c), [[Michael Lynagh]], [[Brendan Moon]], [[Mark Ella]], [[Nick Farr-Jones]], [[Enrique Rodr\u00edguez (rugby union)|Topo Rodriguez]], [[Tom Lawton|Tom Lawton Jnr]], Andy McIntyre, [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Steve Williams]], Steve Cutler, [[Simon Poidevin]], [[Steve Tuynman]], [[David Codey]].

Lawton's first try was scored within seven minutes resulting from a rehearsed move practised many times in training. Cutler won the jump in a short line-out, Poidevin set up the maul and [[Nick Farr-Jones]] made a blind-side run, putting Gould through a gap who passed to Peter Grigg. When Grigg was cornered he tossed a pass infield to Lawton who plunged over for the try.<ref>Prenter/Smithp45</ref>\n\nLyngah made it 13\u20130 when he scored between the posts after Farr-Jones again escaped up the short side from a scrum to set up a dazzling break by Campese.

The Wallaby call \"Samson\" was made for an eight-man pushover and the Australian pack driven by its giant locks [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Williams]] and Steve Cutler set out to humiliate the Welsh eight and shove them back over the try line. The ground was taken and with the ball secure at the feet of the Wallaby second-row, Steve Tunyman fell onto it for a try and a 19\u20133 lead.<ref>Fitzsimmons p110</ref> Gould converted, then kicked a penalty goal.\n\nHowever, Wales was not finished. Following a line-out close to the Australian line, Welsh halfback [[David Bishop (rugby player born 1960)|David Bishop]] leapt acrobatically to score a try, the only try scored against the Australians during the four grandslam tests. The rumour in Australia at the time was that [[David Bishop (rugby player born 1960)|David Bishop]] had been released from gaol in the previous week, to play in this match. Subsequently, Australia 'ran away' with it when Ella scored a final intercept try, to take the final score to 28\u20139.\n\n<small>'''AUSTRALIA''': [[Roger Gould (rugby)|Roger Gould]], [[David Campese]], [[Andrew Slack]] (c), [[Michael Lynagh]], Peter Grigg, [[Mark Ella]], [[Nick Farr-Jones]], [[Topo Rodriguez]], [[Tom Lawton|Tom Lawton Jnr]], Andy McIntyre, [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Steve Williams]], Steve Cutler, [[Simon Poidevin]], Steve Tuynman, [[David Codey]].

The Australian team won thirteen matches, drew one and lost four but notably won all four of their international matches.\n\nThe 1984 Wallabies were the first and only Australian side to achieve a [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] doing so in four Tests against the [[Home Nations]]. This feat had been achieved five times previously, by the 1978 New Zealand All Blacks and by the South African Springboks during their tours of 1912\u201313, 1931\u201332, 1951\u201352 and 1960\u201361. Australia's classy five-eighth [[Mark Ella]] managed to score a try in every Test. The tour confirmed Australia's coming of age as a world-class rugby nation, marking the end of three difficult decades of inconsistent international performances from 1950 onwards.\n\n==The squad's leadership==\n[[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] was widely experienced as a schoolboy coach but had had only one season coaching first-grade before his rise to the national position. He steered [[Manly RUFC|Manly]] to a surprise victory in the 1983 [[Shute Shield|Sydney 1st Grade Premiership]] over the strong [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick club]]. He was practically unknown in Australian rugby at point but set his sights on the national representative coaching job at a time when the incumbent [[Bob Dwyer]] was becoming increasingly vulnerable.<ref>Fitzsimmons ''Nick Farr-Jones'' p74</ref> Under Dwyer in 1983 the Wallabies lost a two Test series against the [[France national rugby union team|French]], tipping Dwyer's career record to the negative with six losses, five wins and a draw. Jones publicly announced his intentions to stand against Dwyer in early 1984 and ran a media campaign that befitted his experience as a former Prime Ministerial speech writer. In February 1984 he was installed as the national coach and he set out from that point to select, train, guide and strategise Australian rugby to the summit of international success.\n\nAfter failing to wrestle the [[Bledisloe Cup]] away from the [[All Blacks]] in mid-1984 (a 1\u20132 series loss), Jones set his sights on glory from the British Isles tour and the specific goal of winning all four of the Test matches and to eclipse the one win, three loss record of the 1981\u201382 Wallabies. To assist he called upon his friend, the affable Queenslander Alec Evans, who had coached rugby union at Brisbane Grammar School whilst Jones was a teacher  and was a man of enormous rugby experience and knowledge. Evans became the first Assistant-Coach in the history of Wallaby tours. Tour Manager was former Wallaby Captain [[Charles Wilson (rugby)|Charles \"Chilla\" Wilson]] who managed in the style of a \"benevolent, big brother\".<ref>Howell p164</ref> Howell quotes Mark Ella ''\"I couldn't think of a better manager. I played for Australia for six years. Thank God I had Chilla Wilson for three of them. With Jonesy up there dominating everything, Chilla was the perfect foil. He was quiet, unobtrusive and didn't make a lot of noise. In fact, you wouldn't know Chilla was the manager until the time came for somebody to get up and say the right thing\"''<ref>Ella ''Path to Victory'' quoted in Howell p165</ref>\n\n[[Mark Ella]] had captained Australia in ten Tests prior to 1984, including the eleven match [[1983 Australia rugby union tour of Italy and France]]. However Jones had resolved that whichever side won the 1984 interstate series would provide the captain and so [[Andrew Slack]] took up the tour captaincy<ref name=\"Howell p220\">Howell p220</ref> Howell reports that he was a popular captain, a calm organiser both on and off the field. Quiet thoughtful and intelligent but also able to pull out his guitar and bring everyone together with a few songs.<ref name=\"Howell p220\"/> Ella is also quoted ''\"Slacky was probably the only person who could have handled the captaincy in the British Isles. Every team needs a cornerstone and Slacky was it. We all had lots of respect for him....[on-field] his role was to settle the play down, be the link man. Not be happy-go-lucky or adventurous. Slack did it to perfection and always seemed to be there when he was wanted.\"'''<ref>Ella ''Path to Victory'' quoted in Howell</ref>\n\nJones also made a thoughtful choice in appointing his [[Manly RUFC|Manly]] club charge [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Steve Williams]] as vice-captain drawing on his front-foot leadership and strength as an enforcer. Ella is quoted again ''\"When Alan Jones made Steve the senior forward, it was the best thing that could have happened. He took the responsibility and really drove the forwards. [With his] sensational jumping ....our line-out was complete\"''<ref>Ella ''Path to Victory'' quoted in Howell p227</ref>\n\n==Tour itinerary==\nBy 1984 the nine-month-long Wallaby tours of Britain, France and North America were a thing of the past. Quick and cheap air-travel meant that a Test tour of the four [[Home Nations]] could be completed in two months but with only eighteen matches played instead of the thirty of earlier years. Varsity teams were no longer part of the schedule which favoured quality City or regional representative sides for the mid-week fixtures. The traditions of a game against Combined Services and a final tour match against the [[Barbarians FC|Barbarians]] were continued.\n\nTradition was also maintained with a visit by the touring party to [[Buckingham Palace]] to meet [[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]]. During the audience Wallaby breakaway Chris Roche leant on an antique table which broke and crashed to the ground. [[Nick Farr-Jones]] related that Her Majesty put the visitors at ease with a laugh and a resumption of conversation.<ref>Fitzsimmons p102</ref>\n\n==Matches of the Tour==\n:''Scores and results list Australia's points tally first.''\n{|border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Location\n!Result\n!Score\n|-\n|[[#London Division|Match 1]]\n|17 October\n|London Division\n|[[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], London\n|Won\n|22\u20133\n|-\n|[[#South and South West Division|Match 2]]\n|20 October\n|South and South West Division\n|[[County Ground Stadium|County Ground]], [[Exeter]]\n|Drew\n|12\u201312\n|-\n|[[#Cardiff|Match 3]]\n|24 October\n|[[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff]]\n|[[Cardiff Arms Park]], Cardiff\n|Lost\n|12\u201326\n|-\n|[[#Combined Services|Match 4]]\n|27 October\n|Combined Services\n|[[Aldershot Military Stadium]], Aldershot\n|Won\n|44\u20139\n|-\n|[[#Swansea|Match 5]]\n|30 October\n|[[Swansea RFC|Swansea]]\n|[[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|St Helen's]], Swansea\n|Won\n|17\u20137\n|-bgcolor=Gold\n|[[#England|Match 6]]\n|3 November\n|[[England national rugby union team|ENGLAND]]\n|[[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], London\n|Won\n|19\u20133\n|-\n|[[#Midlands|Match 7]]\n|6 November\n|Midlands Division\n|[[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]], Leicester\n|Won\n|21\u20138\n|-bgcolor=Gold\n|[[#Ireland|Match 8]]\n|10 November\n|[[Ireland national rugby union team|IRELAND]] <ref name=\"greenandgoldrugby121109\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenandgoldrugby.com/great-wallaby-tries-84-grand-slam-v-ireland/|title=Great Wallaby Tries: 84 Grand Slam v Ireland|publisher=www.greenandgoldrugby.com|accessdate=17 February 2019|date=12 November 2009}}</ref>\n|[[Lansdowne Road]], Dublin\n|Won\n|16\u20139\n|-\n|[[#Ulster|Match 9]]\n|14 November\n|[[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] <ref name=\"belfasttelegraph111109\">{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/rugby/down-memory-lane-ulster-heroes-of-84-are-reunited-one-more-time-28502352.html|title=Down Memory Lane: Ulster heroes of 84 are reunited one more time|publisher=www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk|accessdate=17 February 2019|date=11 November 2009}}</ref> \n|[[Ravenhill Stadium|Ravenhill]], Belfast\n|Lost\n|13\u201315\n|-\n|[[#Munster|Match 10]]\n|17 November\n|[[Munster Rugby|Munster]]\n|[[Thomond Park]], Limerick\n|Won\n|31\u201319\n|-\n|[[#Llanelli|Match 11]]\n|20 November\n|[[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]]\n|[[Stradey Park]], Llanelli\n|Lost\n|16\u201319\n|-bgcolor=Gold\n|[[#Wales|Match 12]]\n|24 November\n|[[Wales national rugby union team|WALES]]\n|[[Cardiff Arms Park]], Cardiff\n|Won\n|28\u20139\n|-\n|[[#Northern Division|Match 13]]\n|28 November\n|Northern Division\n|St Anthony's Road, [[Blundellsands]]\n|Won\n|19\u201312\n|-\n|[[#South of Scotland|Match 14]]\n|1 December\n|[[South of Scotland rugby union team|South of Scotland]]\n|[[Mansfield Park, Hawick|Mansfield Park]], Hawick\n|Lost\n|6\u20139\n|-\n|[[#Glasgow|Match 15]][https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y7ZAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vaUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3511%2C979733]\n|4 December\n|[[Glasgow District (rugby union)|Glasgow]]\n|[[Hughenden, Glasgow|Hughenden]], Glasgow\n|Won\n|26\u201312\n|-bgcolor=Gold\n|[[#Scotland|Match 16]]\n|8 December\n|[[Scotland national rugby union team|SCOTLAND]]\n|[[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]], Edinburgh\n|Won\n|37\u201312\n|-\n|[[#Pontypool|Match 17]]\n|12 December\n|[[Pontypool RFC|Pontypool]]\n|[[Pontypool Park]], Pontypool\n|Won\n|24\u201318\n|-\n|[[#Barbarians|Match 18]]\n|15 December\n|[[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]]\n|[[Cardiff Arms Park]], Cardiff\n|Won\n|37\u201330\n|-\n|}\n''The match against Swansea was abandoned after 60 minutes due to floodlight failure.''\n\n==Test matches==\n\n===England===\n{{rugbybox |\ndate = ''' 3 November 1984'''|\nhome = {{ru-rt|ENG}} |\nscore = 3\u201319 |\naway = {{ru|AUS}} |\nhomescore = [[Stuart Barnes|Barnes]] ('''3''' \u2013 1pg) |\nawayscore = ('''4''' \u2013 1t) [[Mark Ella|Ella]] <br> ('''4''' \u2013 1t) [[Simon Poidevin|Poidevin]] <br> ('''11''' \u2013 1t, 2c, 1pg) [[Michael Lynagh|Lynagh]] |\nstadium = [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], London |\nattendance = 65,000 |\nreferee = Bob Francis ([[New Zealand Rugby Union|NZRFU]]) }}\n\nBy half-time the score was 3\u20130 to Australia from a [[Michael Lynagh]] penalty goal but soon after the break came the first try of the match. Twenty-five metres from the English line, [[Mark Ella|Ella]] received the ball from the scrum base and began to drift across the field with the ball in hand. Lynagh, Gould and [[David Campese]] all ran decoys off Ella at varying angles and the English defence were indecisive. Ella himself then changed pace and slid through the tiniest of openings for a try under the posts.<ref>FitzSimons p105</ref> Lynagh converted and later scored a try himself.\nThe final try was a brilliant team effort. Farr-Jones had received the ball from the line-out and passed to Gould who threw a long wayward pass which Ella salvaged in safe hands while running and leaning forward at the same time. Finding the English defence lacking in numbers, Ella passed to Campese who took off to out-sprint English winger [[Rory Underwood]]. Ella was in support but marked by English debutant [[Stuart Barnes]]. Running out of space and about to be bundled into touch, Campese lofted a pass to [[Simon Poidevin]], who scored the final try.\n\n<small>'''AUSTRALIA''': Roger Gould, [[David Campese]], [[Andrew Slack]] (c), [[Michael Lynagh]], [[Brendan Moon]], [[Mark Ella]], [[Nick Farr-Jones]], [[Enrique Rodr\u00edguez (rugby union)|Topo Rodriguez]], [[Tom Lawton|Tom Lawton Jnr]], Andy McIntyre, [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Steve Williams]], Steve Cutler, [[Simon Poidevin]], [[Steve Tuynman]], [[David Codey]].

Lawton's first try was scored within seven minutes resulting from a rehearsed move practised many times in training. Cutler won the jump in a short line-out, Poidevin set up the maul and [[Nick Farr-Jones]] made a blind-side run, putting Gould through a gap who passed to Peter Grigg. When Grigg was cornered he tossed a pass infield to Lawton who plunged over for the try.<ref>Prenter/Smithp45</ref>\n\nLyngah made it 13\u20130 when he scored between the posts after Farr-Jones again escaped up the short side from a scrum to set up a dazzling break by Campese.

The Wallaby call \"Samson\" was made for an eight-man pushover and the Australian pack driven by its giant locks [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Williams]] and Steve Cutler set out to humiliate the Welsh eight and shove them back over the try line. The ground was taken and with the ball secure at the feet of the Wallaby second-row, Steve Tunyman fell onto it for a try and a 19\u20133 lead.<ref>Fitzsimmons p110</ref> Gould converted, then kicked a penalty goal.\n\nHowever, Wales was not finished. Following a line-out close to the Australian line, Welsh halfback [[David Bishop (rugby player born 1960)|David Bishop]] leapt acrobatically to score a try, the only try scored against the Australians during the four grandslam tests. The rumour in Australia at the time was that [[David Bishop (rugby player born 1960)|David Bishop]] had been released from gaol in the previous week, to play in this match. Subsequently, Australia 'ran away' with it when Ella scored a final intercept try, to take the final score to 28\u20139.\n\n<small>'''AUSTRALIA''': [[Roger Gould (rugby)|Roger Gould]], [[David Campese]], [[Andrew Slack]] (c), [[Michael Lynagh]], Peter Grigg, [[Mark Ella]], [[Nick Farr-Jones]], [[Topo Rodriguez]], [[Tom Lawton|Tom Lawton Jnr]], Andy McIntyre, [[Steve Williams (rugby player Australia)|Steve Williams]], Steve Cutler, [[Simon Poidevin]], Steve Tuynman, [[David Codey]].

It is classified as 'High Sufficiency' by [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]], with some of the most prominent infrastructures in Taiwan. The [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is the largest and busiest harbour in Taiwan while [[Kaohsiung International Airport]] is the second busiest airport in number of passengers. The city is well-connected to other major cities by [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|high speed]] and [[Taiwan Railways Administration|conventional]] rail, as well as several national freeways. It also hosts the [[Republic of China Navy]] fleet headquarters and its [[Republic of China Naval Academy|naval academy]]. More recent public works such as [[Pier-2 Art Center]], [[National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts]] and Kaohsiung Music Center have been aimed at growing the tourism and [[cultural industries]] of the city.\n\n{{anchor|Names|Etymology|Toponymy}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Map of Taiwan (Formosa) in 1880, from- Stanford's map of the empires of China and Japan with the adjacent parts of the Russian Empire, India, Burma etc. LOC 2006458442 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Taiwan including Takau (Kaohsiung) (1880)]]\n[[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] immigrants to the area during the 16th and 17th centuries called the region ''Takau'' ({{zh|c=\u6253\u72d7 |poj=T\u00e1-k\u00e1u|links=no}}). The surface meaning of the associated [[Chinese characters]] was \"beat the dog\". According to one theory, the name Takau originates from the aboriginal [[Siraya language]] and translates as \"bamboo forest\". According to another theory, the name evolved via [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from the name of the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] tribe, who inhabited the area at the time of European and Hoklo settlement. The Makatao are considered to be part of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonization]] of southern Taiwan, the area was known as ''Tancoia'' to the western world for a period of about three decades.{{Specify|reason=Which three decades?|date=January 2019}} In 1662, the Dutch were expelled by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], founded by Ming loyalists of [[Koxinga]]. His son, [[Zheng Jing]], renamed the village ''Banlian-chiu'' ({{zh|t=\u842c\u5e74\u5dde |poj=B\u0101n-li\u00e2n-chiu |links=no |l=ten-thousand-year region (''[[Zhou (country subdivision)|zhou]]'')}}) in 1664.\n\nThe name of \"Takau\" was restored in the late 1670s, when the town expanded drastically with immigrants from [[mainland China]], and was kept through Taiwan's cession to the Japanese Empire in 1895. In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa [[James W. Davidson]] relates that \"Takow\" was already a well-known name in English.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |authorlink=James W.

While the new name had quite a different surface meaning, its pronunciation in Japanese sounded more or less the same as the old name spoken in [[Hokkien]].\n\nAfter Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, the name did not change, but the official romanization became Kaohsiung ({{zh|w=Kao\u00b9-hsiung\u00b2|p=G\u0101oxi\u00f3ng}}), derived from the [[Wade-Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation for {{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u96c4}}.\n\nThe name ''Takau'' remains the official name of the city in [[Formosan languages|Austronesian languages]] of Taiwan such as [[Rukai language|Rukai]], although these are not widely spoken in the city. The name also remains popular locally in the naming of businesses, associations, and events.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Kaohsiung}}\n{{See also|History of Taiwan|North-South divide in Taiwan#Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:Harbor Takao.jpg|thumb|right|Port of Ta-kau (1893)]]\nThe written history of Kaohsiung can be traced back to the early 17th century, through archaeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7,000 years ago. Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] people of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe, who settled on what they named Takau Isle (translated to \u6253\u72d7\u5dbc by Ming Chinese explorers); \"Takau\" meaning \"bamboo forest\" in the aboriginal language.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Makatao.jpg|right|thumb|Sketch of the Makatao people during the [[Qing dynasty]]]]\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4,700\u20135,200 years ago. Most of the discovered remnants were located in the hills surrounding [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]]. Artifacts were found at [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan]], Longquan Temple, Taoziyuan, [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]], Houjing, Fudingjin and [[Fengbitou Archaeological Site|Fengbitou]]. The prehistoric [[Dabenkeng culture|Dapenkeng]], Niuchouzi, [[Tahu Culture|Dahu]], and [[Niaosung Culture|Niaosong]] civilizations were known to inhabit the region. Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal [[Makatao people|Makatao]] civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter. Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved. Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies. Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present.\n\nThe first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by [[Chen Di]], a member of [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and [[Penghu]] of pirates. In his report on the \"Eastern Barbarian Lands\" (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:\n\n{{quote|It is unknown when the barbarians ([[Taiwanese aborigines]]) arose on this island in the ocean beyond [[Penghu]], but they are present at Keeong Harbor (nowaday's [[Budai, Chiayi]]), the bay of Galaw ([[Anping, Tainan]]), Laydwawan ([[Tainan City]]), Yaw Harbor ([[Cheting District|Cheting, Kaohsiung]]), Takau Isle (Kaohsiung City), Little Tamsui ([[Donggang, Pingtung]]), Siangkeykaw ([[Puzi]], Chiayi), Gali forest ([[Jiali District]], Tainan), the village of Sabah ([[Tamsui, Taipei]]), and Dwabangkang ([[Bali District|Bali, New Taipei City]]).}}\n\n===Dutch Formosa===\nTaiwan became a [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colony]] in 1624, after the [[Dutch East India Company]] was ejected from [[Penghu]] by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces. At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan. The Dutch named the place ''Tankoya'', and the harbor ''Tancoia''. The Dutch missionary [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] named Takau Mountain \"Ape Berg\", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century. ''Tankoia'' was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping, Tainan]]) by sail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William |authorlink=William Campbell (missionary) |title=Formosa under the Dutch: described from contemporary records, with explanatory notes and a bibliography of the island |year=1903 |publisher=Kegan Paul |location=London |oclc=644323041 |ref=harv |chapter=Explanatory Notes |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/formosaunderdut01campgoog#page/n554/mode/2up |page=548}}</ref> At the time, a wide shallow bay existed there, sufficient for small vessels. However, constant [[Siltation|silting]] changed the coastline.\n\nDuring this time, Taiwan was divided into five administrative districts, with Takau belonging to the southernmost district. In 1630, the first large scale immigration of [[Han Chinese]] to Taiwan began due to famine in [[Fujian]], with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.\n\n===Qing dynasty===\n[[File:2010 07 \u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23\u820a\u57ce\u5357\u9580\u5713\u74b0.jpg|right|thumb|South Gate of Fengshan County]]\nIn 1684, the [[Qing dynasty]] annexed [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Taiwan]] and renamed the town Fengshan County ({{zh|c=\u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23|p=F\u00e8ngsh\u0101n Xi\u00e0n}}), considering it a part of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].

Administrative control of the city was moved from New Fongshan Castle to the Fongshan Sub-District of {{nihongo||\u81fa\u5357\u5ef3|Tainan Ch\u014d}}. In November 1901, twenty ''ch\u014d'' were established in total; {{nihongo4||\u9cf3\u5c71\u5ef3|H\u014dzan Ch\u014d}} was established nearby. In 1909, H\u014dzan Ch\u014d was abolished, and Takow was merged into Tainan Ch\u014d.\n\nIn 1920, during the tenure of 8th Governor-General [[Den Kenjir\u014d]], districts were abolished in favor of prefectures. Thus the city was administered as {{nihongo4|Takao City|\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02|Takao-shi}} under [[Takao Prefecture]].\n\nThe Japanese developed Takao, especially the harbor that became the foundation of Kaohsiung to be a port city. Takao was then systematically modernized and connected to the end of [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|North-South Railway]]. Forming a north-south regional economic corridor from Taipei to Kaohsiung in the 1930s, Japan's Southward Policy set Kaohsiung to become an industrial center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taiwaninsight.org/2019/02/09/taiwans-cultural-plurality-and-immigration-policy/|title=Taiwan's Cultural Plurality and Immigration Policy|last=Editor|date=2019-02-09|website=Taiwan Insight|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]] was also developed starting from 1894.

New industries such as refinery, machinery, shipbuilding and cementing were also introduced.\n\nBefore and during [[World War II]] it handled a growing share of Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan, and was also a major base for Japan's campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Extremely ambitious plans for the construction of a massive modern port were drawn up. Toward the end of the war, the Japanese promoted some industrial development at Kaohsiung, establishing an aluminum industry based on the abundant [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] produced by the [[Sun Moon Lake]] project in the mountains.\n\nThe city was heavily bombed by [[Task Force 38]] and [[Far East Air Force (United States)|FEAF]] during World War II between 1944 and 1945.\n\n\n===Post-war===\n[[File:\u9f13\u5c71\u5fe0\u70c8\u7960.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaohsiung Martyrs' Shrine]]]]\n[[File:Kaohsiung_Tuntex_Sky_Tower_Innen_Bild_2_(2).jpg|thumb|right|The restored [[Port of Kaohsiung]], which was badly damaged in [[World War II]].]]\n\nAfter control of Taiwan was [[History of Taiwan since 1945|handed over from Japan]] to the government of the [[Republic of China]] on 25 October 1945, Kaohsiung City and [[Kaohsiung County]] were established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] and a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] of [[Taiwan Province]] respectively on 25 December 1945.

The port, badly damaged in [[World War II]], was restored. It also became a fishing port for boats sailing to [[Philippines|Philippine]] and Indonesian waters. Largely because of its climate, Kaohsiung overtook [[Keelung]] as Taiwan's major port. Kaohsiung also surpassed Tainan to become the second largest city of Taiwan in the late 1970s and Kaohsiung City was upgraded from a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] to [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] on 1 July 1979, by the [[Executive Yuan]] with a total of 11 districts. The additional district is [[Siaogang District]], which was annexed from Siaogang Township of [[Kaohsiung County]].\n\nThe [[Kaohsiung Incident]], where the government suppressed a commemoration of International [[Human Rights Day]], occurred on 10 December 1979. Since then, Kaohsiung gradually grew into a political center of the [[Pan-Green]] population of Taiwan, in opposition to [[Taipei]] where the majority population is [[Kuomintang]] supporters.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, Kaohsiung City merged with Kaohsiung County to form a larger [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] with [[Lingya District]] and [[Fongshan District|Fengshan District]] becoming the capital city, ending the administration of Kaohsiung County.\n\nOn 31 July 2014, a series of [[2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions|gas explosions]] occurred in the [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]] and [[Lingya District]]s of the city, killing 31 and injuring more than 300.

As an exporting center, Kaohsiung serves the agricultural interior of southern Taiwan, as well as the mountains of the southeast. Major [[raw material]] exports include rice, sugar, bananas, [[pineapple]]s, peanuts (groundnuts) and [[citrus fruit]]s. The {{convert|2200|ha|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Linhai Industrial Park]], on the waterfront, was completed in the mid-1970s and includes a [[steel mill]], [[shipyard]], [[petrochemical]] complex, and other industries. The city has an [[oil refinery]], aluminum and cement works, [[fertilizer]] factories, sugar refineries, brick and tile works, canning factories, salt-manufacturing factories, and [[papermaking]] plants. Designated an [[export-processing zone]] in the late 1970s, Kaohsiung also attracted foreign investment to process locally purchased raw materials for export.\n\nThe ongoing Nansing Project is a plan to [[Land reclamation|reclaim]] {{convert|250|ha|abbr=off}} of land along the coast by 2011.<ref name=\"nansing\">{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201006190006|title=Kaohsiung City to open solar energy industrial zone|publisher=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=27 June 2010|accessdate=9 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725172550/http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201006190006|archive-date=25 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau plans to buy 49 hectares of the reclaimed land to establish a solar energy industrial district that would be in the harbor's free trade zone.<ref name=\"nansing\" />\n\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) in nominal terms of Kaohsiung City is estimated to be around US$45&nbsp;billion, and US$90&nbsp;billion for the metropolitan region. {{As of|2008}}, the GDP per capita in nominal terms was approximately US$24,000.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nDespite early success and heavy governmental investment, the city suffers from the economic [[north\u2013south divide in Taiwan]], which continues to be the centre of political debate.<ref>{{cite web |last1=News |first1=Taiwan |title=Major Kaohsiung mayoral candidates face off i... |url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3579295 |website=Taiwan News |accessdate=11 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212070602/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3579295 |archive-date=12 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> There has been public aims to shift the local economy towards tourism and [[cultural industries]], with projects such as [[Pier-2 Art Center]], [[National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts]] and Kaohsiung Music Center.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe main agricultural [[produce]] in Kaohsiung are vegetables, fruits and rice with a total [[arable land]] of 473&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, which accounts to 16% of the total area of the municipality.

The year-round warm climate allows [[coral reefs]] to grow along the coasts around [[Kaohsiung Harbor]], with [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan Mountain]] being a small mountain completely made up of coral reefs and [[calcium carbonate]], while the mountainous districts in the northeast include Taiwan's highest mountain, [[Yushan (mountain)|Yushan]]. Other notable natural attractions include the [[Mount Banping]], [[Lotus Lake]], and [[Dongsha Atoll National Park]], which is currently inaccessible by the public due to military occupation.\n\n====Historical sites====\n[[File:Former British Consulate at Takao.jpg|thumb|[[Former British Consulate at Takao]]]]\nA large number of historical sites and monuments were left in the city after the colonization of the Dutch in the 17th century, the Qing dynasty during the 18th and 19th century and the Japanese empire from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.  The city government has protected various sites and monuments from further damage and many have been opened to the public since the early 1980s.

Due to the success of its Taiwan operation, the French retailer expanded throughout the country and Asia.

Nowadays, only elder Hakka people mostly living in [[Meinong District|Meinong]], [[Liouguei District|Liouguei]], [[Shanlin District|Shanlin]] and [[Jiasian District|Jiasian]] districts can communicate in Hakka and elder Taiwanese aborigines living mostly in the rural districts of [[Namasia District|Namasia]] and [[Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung|Taoyuan]] can communicate with the aboriginal languages.

The same applies to Kaohsiung city. Kaohsiung also hosts the largest [[Buddhist temple]] in Taiwan, the [[Foguangshan]] Temple.\n\n===Taoism===\nAround 33% of the Taiwanese population are Taoist, making it the second largest religion of Taiwan. Most people who believe in Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the [[Chinese folk religion|folk]] [[sea goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], who is variously [[syncretized]] as a [[Taoist immortal]] or avatar of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]]. [[Chi Jin Mazu Temple|Her temple on Cijin Island]] is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed the center of the city's early settlement.<ref name=herry>{{citation |contribution-url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/Heritage.aspx?KeyID=740a98f3-eb1e-4e3b-aca2-29561ae6cd51 |contribution=Tianhou Temple at Cihou |url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |title=Official site |year=2008 |publisher=Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the Kaohsiung City Government |location=Kaohsiung |access-date=16 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006000307/http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}. {{in lang|zh}}{{nbsp}}& {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nChristianity is a growing religion in Taiwan. It was first brought onto the island when the Dutch and Spanish colonized Taiwan during the 17th century, mostly to the aboriginals. Kaohsiung currently hosts around 56,000 Christians.\n\n===Islam===\nBesides the majority population of Buddhists and Taoists, Kaohsiung also includes a rather small population of [[Muslims]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled [[mainland China]] with the [[Kuomintang]] to Taiwan. During the 1980s, another few thousand Muslims from [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]], whom are mostly descendants of [[Nationalist Chinese|Nationalist]] soldiers who fled [[Yunnan]] as a result of the communist takeover, migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life, resulting in an increase of Muslim population within the country. More recently, with the rise of Indonesian workers working in Taiwan, an estimated number of 88,000 Indonesian Muslims currently live in the country, in addition to the existing 53,000 Taiwanese Muslims. Combining all demographics, Taiwan hosts around 140,000 Muslims, with around 25,000 living in Kaohsiung. [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] is the largest mosque in Kaohsiung and the main gathering site of Muslims within the city.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fo Guang Shan.jpg|[[Foguangshan]] Temple\nFile:\u65d7\u5f8c\u5929\u540e\u5bae.jpg|Cijing Tianhou Temple\nFile:\u73ab\u7470\u8056\u6bcd\u4e3b\u6559\u5ea7\u5802.JPG|[[Holy Rosary Cathedral, Kaohsiung|Holy Rosary Cathedral]]\nFile:Kaohsiung Mosque.JPG|[[Kaohsiung Mosque]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Politics==\n===Government===\n{{main|Kaohsiung City Government|Kaohsiung City Council}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Kaohsiung|List of county magistrates of Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02\u9577 \u97d3\u570b\u745c.jpg|thumb|[[Han Kuo-yu]], the incumbent [[Mayor of Kaohsiung]]]]\n\nSometimes Kaohsiung used to be seen as the political opposite Taipei. While northern Taiwan leans towards the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] in the state-level elections, southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung, leaned towards the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] since the late 1990s. [[Frank Hsieh]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was reelected twice as Mayor of Kaohsiung, where he was widely credited for transforming the city from an industrial sprawl into an attractive modern metropolis. Hsieh resigned from the office of mayor to take up the office of [[Premier of the Republic of China]] in 2005. The [[2006 Republic of China municipal elections|municipal election, held on 9 December 2006]], resulted in a victory for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s candidate [[Chen Chu]], the first elected female mayor of [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] in Taiwan, defeating her [[Kuomintang]] rival and former deputy mayor, Huang Chun-ying. The current mayor of Kaohsiung City is [[Han Kuo-yu]] of the [[Kuomintang]].\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Kaohsiung City Hall (Dec 2010).JPG\n|alt1=Kaohsiung City Hall\n|[[Kaohsiung City Government]] \u2013

Cijin island lighthouse hill.]]\n\nA major port, through which pass most of Taiwan's marine imports and exports, is located at the city but is not managed by the city government. Also known as the \"Harbour Capital\" of Taiwan, Kaohsiung has always had a strong link with the ocean and maritime transportation. [[Ferries]] play a key role in everyday transportation, especially for transportation across the harbour. With five terminals and 23 berths, the ''Port of Kaohsiung'' is Taiwan's largest [[container port]] and the 13th largest in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|title=Top 50 World Container Ports {{!}} World Shipping Council|website=www.worldshipping.org|access-date=4 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115163646/http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007 the port reached its handling capacity with a record trade volume of {{TEU|10.2&nbsp;million|first=yes}}.<ref name=\"LLDCN\">{{cite news| last =Dale |first =Jamie |title =Kaohsiung container port hits full capacity | work =Lloyd's List Daily Commercial News | page =16 | publisher =Informa Australia | date =17 January 2008}}</ref> A new container terminal is under construction, increasing future handling capacity by {{TEU|2 million}} by 2013.<ref name=\"LLDCN\"/>\n\nThe [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is not officially a part of Kaohsiung City, instead it is administrated by Kaohsiung Port Authority, under Ministry of Transportation. There is a push for Kaohsiung City to annex the Port of Kaohsiung to facilitate better regional planning.\n\nKaohsiung is one of the biggest ports in the world for importing [[Shark finning|shark fins]], sold at high prices in the restaurants and shops of Taiwan and China. They are brought in from overseas and are placed out to dry in the sun on residential rooftops near the port.\n\n===Kaohsiung International Airport===\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u570b\u969b\u6a5f\u5834.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kaohsiung International Airport]]]]\n\nKaohsiung City is also home to Taiwan's second largest international airport, the [[Kaohsiung International Airport]], located in [[Siaogang District]] near the city's center. It one of the three major international airports of Taiwan, serving passengers of the entire southern and southeastern part of the country. However, the size of the airport is relatively small with short runways compared to other major airports of Taiwan due to its age and its location near the city center, making it impossible for large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A380]] to land at the airport. As a result, plans for runway expansion or building a new airport in replacement have been proposed.\n\n===Rapid transit===\n[[File:Kaohsiung MRT Train at World Games Station.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaohsiung MRT]]]]\n[[File:KMRT_CAF_train_2016-08-27.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Circular Line (KMRT)|Kaohsiung Circular Light Rail]]]]\n\n[[Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit]] opened for service in March 2008.

It is classified as 'High Sufficiency' by [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]], with some of the most prominent infrastructures in Taiwan. The [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is the largest and busiest harbour in Taiwan while [[Kaohsiung International Airport]] is the second busiest airport in number of passengers. The city is well-connected to other major cities by [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|high speed]] and [[Taiwan Railways Administration|conventional]] rail, as well as several national freeways. It also hosts the [[Republic of China Navy]] fleet headquarters and its [[Republic of China Naval Academy|naval academy]].

According to another theory, the name evolved via [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from the name of the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] tribe, who inhabited the area at the time of European and Hoklo settlement. The Makatao are considered to be part of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonization]] of southern Taiwan, the area was known as ''Tancoia'' to the western world for a period of about three decades.{{Specify|reason=Which three decades?|date=January 2019}} In 1662, the Dutch were expelled by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], founded by Ming loyalists of [[Koxinga]].

In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa [[James W.

While the new name had quite a different surface meaning, its pronunciation in Japanese sounded more or less the same as the old name spoken in [[Hokkien]].\n\nAfter Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, the name did not change, but the official romanization became Kaohsiung ({{zh|w=Kao\u00b9-hsiung\u00b2|p=G\u0101oxi\u00f3ng}}), derived from the [[Wade-Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation for {{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u96c4}}.\n\nThe name ''Takau'' remains the official name of the city in [[Formosan languages|Austronesian languages]] of Taiwan such as [[Rukai language|Rukai]], although these are not widely spoken in the city. The name also remains popular locally in the naming of businesses, associations, and events.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Kaohsiung}}\n{{See also|History of Taiwan|North-South divide in Taiwan#Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:Harbor Takao.jpg|thumb|right|Port of Ta-kau (1893)]]\nThe written history of Kaohsiung can be traced back to the early 17th century, through archaeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7,000 years ago. Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] people of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe, who settled on what they named Takau Isle (translated to \u6253\u72d7\u5dbc by Ming Chinese explorers); \"Takau\" meaning \"bamboo forest\" in the aboriginal language.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Makatao.jpg|right|thumb|Sketch of the Makatao people during the [[Qing dynasty]]]]\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4,700\u20135,200 years ago. Most of the discovered remnants were located in the hills surrounding [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]]. Artifacts were found at [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan]], Longquan Temple, Taoziyuan, [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]], Houjing, Fudingjin and [[Fengbitou Archaeological Site|Fengbitou]]. The prehistoric [[Dabenkeng culture|Dapenkeng]], Niuchouzi, [[Tahu Culture|Dahu]], and [[Niaosung Culture|Niaosong]] civilizations were known to inhabit the region. Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal [[Makatao people|Makatao]] civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter. Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved. Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies. Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present.\n\nThe first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by [[Chen Di]], a member of [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and [[Penghu]] of pirates. In his report on the \"Eastern Barbarian Lands\" (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:\n\n{{quote|It is unknown when the barbarians ([[Taiwanese aborigines]]) arose on this island in the ocean beyond [[Penghu]], but they are present at Keeong Harbor (nowaday's [[Budai, Chiayi]]), the bay of Galaw ([[Anping, Tainan]]), Laydwawan ([[Tainan City]]), Yaw Harbor ([[Cheting District|Cheting, Kaohsiung]]), Takau Isle (Kaohsiung City), Little Tamsui ([[Donggang, Pingtung]]), Siangkeykaw ([[Puzi]], Chiayi), Gali forest ([[Jiali District]], Tainan), the village of Sabah ([[Tamsui, Taipei]]), and Dwabangkang ([[Bali District|Bali, New Taipei City]]).}}\n\n===Dutch Formosa===\nTaiwan became a [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colony]] in 1624, after the [[Dutch East India Company]] was ejected from [[Penghu]] by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces. At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan. The Dutch named the place ''Tankoya'', and the harbor ''Tancoia''. The Dutch missionary [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] named Takau Mountain \"Ape Berg\", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century. ''Tankoia'' was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping, Tainan]]) by sail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William |authorlink=William Campbell (missionary) |title=Formosa under the Dutch: described from contemporary records, with explanatory notes and a bibliography of the island |year=1903 |publisher=Kegan Paul |location=London |oclc=644323041 |ref=harv |chapter=Explanatory Notes |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/formosaunderdut01campgoog#page/n554/mode/2up |page=548}}</ref> At the time, a wide shallow bay existed there, sufficient for small vessels. However, constant [[Siltation|silting]] changed the coastline.\n\nDuring this time, Taiwan was divided into five administrative districts, with Takau belonging to the southernmost district. In 1630, the first large scale immigration of [[Han Chinese]] to Taiwan began due to famine in [[Fujian]], with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.\n\n===Qing dynasty===\n[[File:2010 07 \u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23\u820a\u57ce\u5357\u9580\u5713\u74b0.jpg|right|thumb|South Gate of Fengshan County]]\nIn 1684, the [[Qing dynasty]] annexed [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Taiwan]] and renamed the town Fengshan County ({{zh|c=\u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23|p=F\u00e8ngsh\u0101n Xi\u00e0n}}), considering it a part of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].

Administrative control of the city was moved from New Fongshan Castle to the Fongshan Sub-District of {{nihongo||\u81fa\u5357\u5ef3|Tainan Ch\u014d}}. In November 1901, twenty ''ch\u014d'' were established in total; {{nihongo4||\u9cf3\u5c71\u5ef3|H\u014dzan Ch\u014d}} was established nearby. In 1909, H\u014dzan Ch\u014d was abolished, and Takow was merged into Tainan Ch\u014d.\n\nIn 1920, during the tenure of 8th Governor-General [[Den Kenjir\u014d]], districts were abolished in favor of prefectures. Thus the city was administered as {{nihongo4|Takao City|\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02|Takao-shi}} under [[Takao Prefecture]].\n\nThe Japanese developed Takao, especially the harbor that became the foundation of Kaohsiung to be a port city. Takao was then systematically modernized and connected to the end of [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|North-South Railway]]. Forming a north-south regional economic corridor from Taipei to Kaohsiung in the 1930s, Japan's Southward Policy set Kaohsiung to become an industrial center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taiwaninsight.org/2019/02/09/taiwans-cultural-plurality-and-immigration-policy/|title=Taiwan's Cultural Plurality and Immigration Policy|last=Editor|date=2019-02-09|website=Taiwan Insight|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]] was also developed starting from 1894.

New industries such as refinery, machinery, shipbuilding and cementing were also introduced.\n\nBefore and during [[World War II]] it handled a growing share of Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan, and was also a major base for Japan's campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Extremely ambitious plans for the construction of a massive modern port were drawn up. Toward the end of the war, the Japanese promoted some industrial development at Kaohsiung, establishing an aluminum industry based on the abundant [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] produced by the [[Sun Moon Lake]] project in the mountains.\n\nThe city was heavily bombed by [[Task Force 38]] and [[Far East Air Force (United States)|FEAF]] during World War II between 1944 and 1945.\n\n\n===Post-war===\n[[File:\u9f13\u5c71\u5fe0\u70c8\u7960.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaohsiung Martyrs' Shrine]]]]\n[[File:Kaohsiung_Tuntex_Sky_Tower_Innen_Bild_2_(2).jpg|thumb|right|The restored [[Port of Kaohsiung]], which was badly damaged in [[World War II]].]]\n\nAfter control of Taiwan was [[History of Taiwan since 1945|handed over from Japan]] to the government of the [[Republic of China]] on 25 October 1945, Kaohsiung City and [[Kaohsiung County]] were established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] and a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] of [[Taiwan Province]] respectively on 25 December 1945. The official romanization of the name came to be \"Kaohsiung\", based on the [[Wade\u2013Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] reading of the [[kanji]] name.<ref>[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 What's in changing a name?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070630101000/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 |date=30 June 2007 }} Taiwan Journal Vol. XXVI No. 19 May 15, 2009 \"...while name Kaohsiung is technically the Mandarin pronunciation of the Japanese written version of a Holo Taiwanese rendition of an old aboriginal name...\"</ref> Kaohsiung City then consisted of 10 [[District (Taiwan)|districts]], which were [[Gushan District|Gushan]], [[Lingya District|Lianya]] (renamed \"Lingya\" in 1952), [[Nanzi District|Nanzi]], [[Qianjin District, Kaohsiung|Cianjin]], [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]], [[Qijin District, Kaohsiung|Cijin]], [[Sanmin District|Sanmin]], [[Sinsing District, Taiwan|Sinsing]], [[Yancheng District, Kaohsiung|Yancheng]], and [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]].\n\nDuring this time, Kaohsiung developed rapidly. The port, badly damaged in [[World War II]], was restored. It also became a fishing port for boats sailing to [[Philippines|Philippine]] and Indonesian waters. Largely because of its climate, Kaohsiung overtook [[Keelung]] as Taiwan's major port. Kaohsiung also surpassed Tainan to become the second largest city of Taiwan in the late 1970s and Kaohsiung City was upgraded from a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] to [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] on 1 July 1979, by the [[Executive Yuan]] with a total of 11 districts. The additional district is [[Siaogang District]], which was annexed from Siaogang Township of [[Kaohsiung County]].\n\nThe [[Kaohsiung Incident]], where the government suppressed a commemoration of International [[Human Rights Day]], occurred on 10 December 1979. Since then, Kaohsiung gradually grew into a political center of the [[Pan-Green]] population of Taiwan, in opposition to [[Taipei]] where the majority population is [[Kuomintang]] supporters.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, Kaohsiung City merged with Kaohsiung County to form a larger [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] with [[Lingya District]] and [[Fongshan District|Fengshan District]] becoming the capital city, ending the administration of Kaohsiung County.\n\nOn 31 July 2014, a series of [[2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions|gas explosions]] occurred in the [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]] and [[Lingya District]]s of the city, killing 31 and injuring more than 300.

The year-round warm climate allows [[coral reefs]] to grow along the coasts around [[Kaohsiung Harbor]], with [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan Mountain]] being a small mountain completely made up of coral reefs and [[calcium carbonate]], while the mountainous districts in the northeast include Taiwan's highest mountain, [[Yushan (mountain)|Yushan]]. Other notable natural attractions include the [[Mount Banping]], [[Lotus Lake]], and [[Dongsha Atoll National Park]], which is currently inaccessible by the public due to military occupation.\n\n====Historical sites====\n[[File:Former British Consulate at Takao.jpg|thumb|[[Former British Consulate at Takao]]]]\nA large number of historical sites and monuments were left in the city after the colonization of the Dutch in the 17th century, the Qing dynasty during the 18th and 19th century and the Japanese empire from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.  The city government has protected various sites and monuments from further damage and many have been opened to the public since the early 1980s. Notable historical sites include the [[Cemetery of Zhenghaijun]], [[Former British Consulate at Takao]], [[Former Dinglinzihbian Police Station]], [[Meinong Cultural and Creative Center]], [[Former Sanhe Bank]], and the [[Cihou Lighthouse]], one of the oldest lighthouses of the city.\n\n====Museums====\n[[File:Confucius temple Kaohsiung amk.jpg|thumb|[[Confucius Temple of Kaohsiung]]]]\nKaohsiung is home to many museums, including the [[Chung Li-he Museum]], [[Cijin Shell Museum]], [[Jiasian Petrified Fossil Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Astronomical Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Hakka Cultural Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Harbor Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of History]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of Labor]], [[Kaohsiung Vision Museum]], [[Meinong Hakka Culture Museum]], [[National Science and Technology Museum]], [[Republic of China Air Force Museum]], [[Soya-Mixed Meat Museum]], [[Taiwan Sugar Museum (Kaohsiung)|Taiwan Sugar Museum]], [[Takao Railway Museum]] and [[YM Museum of Marine Exploration Kaohsiung]].\n\n====Parks and Zoos====\nAs the largest municipality in Taiwan, Kaohsiung has a number of newly built leisure areas and parks.

The same applies to Kaohsiung city. Kaohsiung also hosts the largest [[Buddhist temple]] in Taiwan, the [[Foguangshan]] Temple.\n\n===Taoism===\nAround 33% of the Taiwanese population are Taoist, making it the second largest religion of Taiwan. Most people who believe in Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the [[Chinese folk religion|folk]] [[sea goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], who is variously [[syncretized]] as a [[Taoist immortal]] or avatar of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]]. [[Chi Jin Mazu Temple|Her temple on Cijin Island]] is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed the center of the city's early settlement.<ref name=herry>{{citation |contribution-url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/Heritage.aspx?KeyID=740a98f3-eb1e-4e3b-aca2-29561ae6cd51 |contribution=Tianhou Temple at Cihou |url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |title=Official site |year=2008 |publisher=Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the Kaohsiung City Government |location=Kaohsiung |access-date=16 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006000307/http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}. {{in lang|zh}}{{nbsp}}& {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nChristianity is a growing religion in Taiwan. It was first brought onto the island when the Dutch and Spanish colonized Taiwan during the 17th century, mostly to the aboriginals. Kaohsiung currently hosts around 56,000 Christians.\n\n===Islam===\nBesides the majority population of Buddhists and Taoists, Kaohsiung also includes a rather small population of [[Muslims]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled [[mainland China]] with the [[Kuomintang]] to Taiwan. During the 1980s, another few thousand Muslims from [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]], whom are mostly descendants of [[Nationalist Chinese|Nationalist]] soldiers who fled [[Yunnan]] as a result of the communist takeover, migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life, resulting in an increase of Muslim population within the country. More recently, with the rise of Indonesian workers working in Taiwan, an estimated number of 88,000 Indonesian Muslims currently live in the country, in addition to the existing 53,000 Taiwanese Muslims. Combining all demographics, Taiwan hosts around 140,000 Muslims, with around 25,000 living in Kaohsiung. [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] is the largest mosque in Kaohsiung and the main gathering site of Muslims within the city.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fo Guang Shan.jpg|[[Foguangshan]] Temple\nFile:\u65d7\u5f8c\u5929\u540e\u5bae.jpg|Cijing Tianhou Temple\nFile:\u73ab\u7470\u8056\u6bcd\u4e3b\u6559\u5ea7\u5802.JPG|[[Holy Rosary Cathedral, Kaohsiung|Holy Rosary Cathedral]]\nFile:Kaohsiung Mosque.JPG|[[Kaohsiung Mosque]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Politics==\n===Government===\n{{main|Kaohsiung City Government|Kaohsiung City Council}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Kaohsiung|List of county magistrates of Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02\u9577 \u97d3\u570b\u745c.jpg|thumb|[[Han Kuo-yu]], the incumbent [[Mayor of Kaohsiung]]]]\n\nSometimes Kaohsiung used to be seen as the political opposite Taipei. While northern Taiwan leans towards the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] in the state-level elections, southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung, leaned towards the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] since the late 1990s. [[Frank Hsieh]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was reelected twice as Mayor of Kaohsiung, where he was widely credited for transforming the city from an industrial sprawl into an attractive modern metropolis. Hsieh resigned from the office of mayor to take up the office of [[Premier of the Republic of China]] in 2005. The [[2006 Republic of China municipal elections|municipal election, held on 9 December 2006]], resulted in a victory for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s candidate [[Chen Chu]], the first elected female mayor of [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] in Taiwan, defeating her [[Kuomintang]] rival and former deputy mayor, Huang Chun-ying. The current mayor of Kaohsiung City is [[Han Kuo-yu]] of the [[Kuomintang]].\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Kaohsiung City Hall (Dec 2010).JPG\n|alt1=Kaohsiung City Hall\n|[[Kaohsiung City Government]] \u2013

Cijin island lighthouse hill.]]\n\nA major port, through which pass most of Taiwan's marine imports and exports, is located at the city but is not managed by the city government. Also known as the \"Harbour Capital\" of Taiwan, Kaohsiung has always had a strong link with the ocean and maritime transportation. [[Ferries]] play a key role in everyday transportation, especially for transportation across the harbour. With five terminals and 23 berths, the ''Port of Kaohsiung'' is Taiwan's largest [[container port]] and the 13th largest in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|title=Top 50 World Container Ports {{!}} World Shipping Council|website=www.worldshipping.org|access-date=4 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115163646/http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007 the port reached its handling capacity with a record trade volume of {{TEU|10.2&nbsp;million|first=yes}}.<ref name=\"LLDCN\">{{cite news| last =Dale |first =Jamie |title =Kaohsiung container port hits full capacity | work =Lloyd's List Daily Commercial News | page =16 | publisher =Informa Australia | date =17 January 2008}}</ref> A new container terminal is under construction, increasing future handling capacity by {{TEU|2 million}} by 2013.<ref name=\"LLDCN\"/>\n\nThe [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is not officially a part of Kaohsiung City, instead it is administrated by Kaohsiung Port Authority, under Ministry of Transportation. There is a push for Kaohsiung City to annex the Port of Kaohsiung to facilitate better regional planning.\n\nKaohsiung is one of the biggest ports in the world for importing [[Shark finning|shark fins]], sold at high prices in the restaurants and shops of Taiwan and China. They are brought in from overseas and are placed out to dry in the sun on residential rooftops near the port.\n\n===Kaohsiung International Airport===\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u570b\u969b\u6a5f\u5834.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kaohsiung International Airport]]]]\n\nKaohsiung City is also home to Taiwan's second largest international airport, the [[Kaohsiung International Airport]], located in [[Siaogang District]] near the city's center. It one of the three major international airports of Taiwan, serving passengers of the entire southern and southeastern part of the country. However, the size of the airport is relatively small with short runways compared to other major airports of Taiwan due to its age and its location near the city center, making it impossible for large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A380]] to land at the airport. As a result, plans for runway expansion or building a new airport in replacement have been proposed.\n\n===Rapid transit===\n[[File:Kaohsiung MRT Train at World Games Station.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaohsiung MRT]]]]\n[[File:KMRT_CAF_train_2016-08-27.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Circular Line (KMRT)|Kaohsiung Circular Light Rail]]]]\n\n[[Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit]] opened for service in March 2008.

It was released on November 21, 2000 as the third [[single (music)|single]] from Eminem's third album ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000). It reached number one in twelve countries, including United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland and Australia.\n\nDido's lyrics are a remix of the opening lines from her song \"[[Thank You (Dido song)|Thank You]]\". [[The 45 King]]-produced track also uses a slightly modified [[Break (music)|break]] from \"Thank You\" as its base sample; both songs were released as singles in late 2000. \"Stan\" has been called one of Eminem's best songs and is considered one of his [[signature song]]s. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked \"Stan\" at number 296 in their list in [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/eminem-feat-dido-stan-20110526 |journal=Rolling Stone |date=April 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2015}}</ref> The song was also listed at number 15 on [[VH1]]{{'}}s list of the greatest hip hop songs of all-time and was also named in [[the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].\n\nThe song was nominated for multiple awards, including [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song|Best Song]] at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], Best Rap Video, [[Best Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], but only won Best International Artist Video at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]. In April 2011, [[Complex (magazine)|''Complex'' magazine]] put together a list of the 100 greatest Eminem songs, ranking \"Stan\" at number two.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/the-100-best-eminem-songs/eminem-f-dido-stan#gallery |title=The 100 Best Eminem Songs |magazine=Complex |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref> The name of the eponymous character has given rise to [[Stan (fan)|a slang term]] online which refers to overzealous, maniacal, overly obsessed fans of a celebrity or personality; the term has since been included in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.\n\n==peen=\nThe song tells the story of a person named Stanley \"Stan\" Mitchell (voiced by Eminem) who claims to be Eminem's biggest fan. He writes Eminem several letters; over three verses, he becomes more obsessive, and when there is no reply he becomes angrier. He finally creates a voice recording of himself drunk-driving his car, calling back to Eminem's \"[[My Name Is]]\" with the lyrics \"I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\" He reveals that his pregnant girlfriend is tied up in the trunk as he proceeds to drive into the river, shortly before coming to the realization that he doesn't know how Eminem will hear the tape.\n\nThe fourth verse features Eminem as himself, attempting to write back to Stan and reason with the troubled young man, only to realize\u2014to his surprise\u2014that the man was Stan and the tape collected by the police was for him.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video is a literal interpretation of the story, directed by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Philip G. Atwell]] and featuring [[Devon Sawa]] as Stan and [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] as his pregnant girlfriend.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/kzvk8z/we-asked-the-actor-from-eminems-stan-video-who-he-stans-for|title=We Asked the Actor from Eminem's 'Stan' Video Who He Stans For|last=Berman|first=Sarah|date=December 12, 2018|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=December 12, 2018}}</ref> A prologue involves Stan dying his hair blonde and reacting angrily to being called \"Stanley\" by his girlfriend. Later, he sits in a room full of Eminem's posters, writing letters that express his devotion as \"your [Eminem's] biggest fan\". He is aware of every development in Eminem's personal life.\n\nStan wants Eminem to contact him through a personal [[Letter (message)|letter]] or a [[Telephone call|phone call]]; but, due to unfortunate circumstances, the letters fail to reach Eminem in a timely manner. Believing he has been ignored, Stan uses a [[tape recorder]] to record himself driving along a rain-soaked highway while his girlfriend is tied up in the [[Trunk (car)|trunk]]; which he does with the intention of [[Murder\u2013suicide|driving off a bridge]]. In the process, Stan references both \"[[My Name Is]]\" (\"I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?\") and an [[In the Air Tonight#Urban legend|urban legend]] about [[Phil Collins]]'s \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\" before realizing that there is no way of transmitting this final tape to Eminem, proceeding to commit the act anyway.\n\nStan's mother and Matthew visit his grave. When Matthew opens his [[Hoodie]], he has dyed his hair blonde like Stan. Eminem finally gets around to responding to Stan. He apologizes for being late, thanks him for being a fan, and expresses interest in Stan's personal life. Eminem worries about Stan's mental state and says he does not want Stan to end up like a story he had seen on the news recently\u2014a man who had driven drunk off a bridge with his girlfriend in the trunk, about whom he then realizes, \"It was you. Damn.\" Unbeknown to Eminem, flashes of lightning shine on his window, revealing the ghost of Stan silently glaring. The video ends with Matthew staring at Stan's grave.\n\n=== Video credits ===\n* [[Eminem]]\n* [[Dido (singer)|Dido]]\n* Devon Sawa\n* Nathan Mathers\n* Directed by: [[Dr. Dre]] & [[Philip G.

Significant portions from the first two verses and most of the third verse were removed. MTV also cut out all traces of Stan\u2019s girlfriend bound in the trunk of the car and removed one scene showing him guzzling vodka while driving.<ref>Goodman, Fred. \"Protests Don't Slow Eminem's Fire: \"the Marshall Mathers LP\" Stays at Number One Despite Controversy.\" ''Rolling Stone'' August 17, 2000: 38. Web.\n</ref> In the MTV full version, which is 8:15 long, verse 3 censors Stan mentioning his girlfriend in the trunk (so \"Shut up bitch\" and \"screaming in the trunk\" is censored), and about him not slitting her throat, but tied her up, and \"if she [[asphyxia|suffocates]], she'll suffer more, then she'll die too\", which \"slit\", \"tied her up\", \"suffocates\", and \"die\" is censored.\n\nDido has stated that she was [[gag]]ged in the third verse of the video,<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jan/29/artsfeatures |title=Interview: Dido |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref> but this was censored so widely that versions with her gagged are rare.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!-- Trending: --> Hot right now: &nbsp; &nbsp; |url=http://www.gigwise.com/photos/47455/10/The-50-Most-Shocking-Music-Videos-Ever |title=The 50 Most Shocking Music Videos Ever! |work=Gigwise |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref> In the uncensored version, Stan is shown drinking at the wheel of the car before showing Dido struggling in the [[Trunk (automobile)|trunk]] of the car. She manages to remove the duct tape from her mouth and screams before struggling for breath. Most versions were censored so that there is only a brief clip of Dido in the trunk of the car towards the end of the verse. It also censors when Stan says he \"drank a fifth of vodka\", which censors \"drank\" and \"vodka\"; and censors when he says he's on \"a thousand downers\", which \"downers\" is censored; and also censors Stan drinking while driving. At the end of the third verse, \"Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\" is changed to \"Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the end of the bridge now\". In the fourth verse, the line \"[And what's this] shit about us meant to be together\" is completely censored. All references to the girlfriend in the trunk are censored, including the screaming in the background, and the line: \"And had his girlfriend in his trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid.\"\n\nIn the MTV short version, which was used for radio airplay due to time constraints, the second verse lines that are missing are from \"I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to\" to \"I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest\"; the video cuts showing Stan meeting Eminem, talking about how his father cheated and beat his mother and showed him getting a \"Slim Shady\" tattoo on his chest. The missing lyrics from the third verse are of Stan talking about drinking while driving and referencing \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\", which in the video, it skips from showing Stan near-missing a car, and swerving to avoid crashing into it. The lines that are missing are from \"Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare to me to drive?\" to \"I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\". It also removes the chorus after the third verse and goes straight to the fourth verse; the video then cuts to Eminem at last receiving the letter from Stan, and the car sinking more into the water.\n\nIn [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]'s original state as a rock and alternative station, the same versions of the video were shown as on MTV. However, in later Fuse airings, more lines and words are silenced than on the clean version of the LP; half of one of the beginning verses are cut out, and then the song fades out about halfway through the second verse, after playing for approximately two minutes. \"Stan\" was also released on track 17 of ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''; on the clean and explicit versions, the live track censored only the profanity, unlike the clean version of the studio track.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song was met with critical acclaim, with praise directed to the song's [[wikt:Special:Search/epistolary|epistolary]] narrative structure, emotional range and lyrical depth. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] highlighted the song.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-marshall-mathers-lp-mw0000062949 |title=The Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem |website=AllMusic |date=May 23, 2000 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the song, too: \"Eminem proves himself a peerless rap poet with a profound understanding of the power of language.

The same critic listed the song in the Recommended Downloads list and reviewed it:<blockquote>If you haven't heard this, you probably make a career out of living under rocks. It tells the story of an obsessive fan who kills themselves because their idol (Eminem) never writes back, and introduces one of the album's key themes \u2013 the scary power of fame. Ironic, then, that this album made him the biggest cultural figurehead on the planet. It starts with a sample of Dido's 'Thank You' under a sample of rain. This sample goes on to form the song's hook, relating the level of Stan's obsession and almost making him a sympathetic character (Your picture on my wall/It reminds me that it's not so bad....). Offsetting this is Eminem's raps under the persona of Stan, which reveal him as a reprehensible character; mentally unstable, self-mutilating, sexually confused, volatile, and abusive to his pregnant girlfriend (whose life he takes too, when he takes his own). Eminem's final verse is him attempting to write back, asking him not to be like this guy he saw on the news....Overplayed? Yes. But even so, of all of Eminem's singles, this one demonstrates his power as a rapper and his skill as a poet best.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/1440/Eminem-The-Marshall-Mathers-LP/ |title=Review: Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP |website=Sputnikmusic |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>[[IGN]] praised the song as \"easily the most scathingly introspective rumination on fan adoration, idol assimilation, and borderline stalker etiquette. Teamed to Dido's lulling 'Thank You' with its almost somnambulistically hypnotic pop sultriness provides a jolting contrast to the twisted storyline of a musical obsession gone awry.

It was released on November 21, 2000 as the third [[single (music)|single]] from Eminem's third album ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000). It reached number one in twelve countries, including United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland and Australia.\n\nDido's lyrics are a remix of the opening lines from her song \"[[Thank You (Dido song)|Thank You]]\". [[The 45 King]]-produced track also uses a slightly modified [[Break (music)|break]] from \"Thank You\" as its base sample; both songs were released as singles in late 2000. \"Stan\" has been called one of Eminem's best songs and is considered one of his [[signature song]]s. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked \"Stan\" at number 296 in their list in [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/eminem-feat-dido-stan-20110526 |journal=Rolling Stone |date=April 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2015}}</ref> The song was also listed at number 15 on [[VH1]]{{'}}s list of the greatest hip hop songs of all-time and was also named in [[the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].\n\nThe song was nominated for multiple awards, including [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song|Best Song]] at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], Best Rap Video, [[Best Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], but only won Best International Artist Video at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]. In April 2011, [[Complex (magazine)|''Complex'' magazine]] put together a list of the 100 greatest Eminem songs, ranking \"Stan\" at number two.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/the-100-best-eminem-songs/eminem-f-dido-stan#gallery |title=The 100 Best Eminem Songs |magazine=Complex |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref> The name of the eponymous character has given rise to [[Stan (fan)|a slang term]] online which refers to overzealous, maniacal, overly obsessed fans of a celebrity or personality; the term has since been included in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.\n\n==Song==\nThe song tells the story of a person named Stanley \"Stan\" Mitchell (voiced by Eminem) who claims to be Eminem's biggest fan. He writes Eminem several letters; over three verses, he becomes more obsessive, and when there is no reply he becomes angrier. He finally creates a voice recording of himself drunk-driving his car, calling back to Eminem's \"[[My Name Is]]\" with the lyrics \"I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\" He reveals that his pregnant girlfriend is tied up in the trunk as he proceeds to drive into the river, shortly before coming to the realization that he doesn't know how Eminem will hear the tape.\n\nThe fourth verse features Eminem as himself, attempting to write back to Stan and reason with the troubled young man, only to realize\u2014to his surprise\u2014that the man was Stan and the tape collected by the police was for him.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video is a literal interpretation of the story, directed by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Philip G. Atwell]] and featuring [[Devon Sawa]] as Stan and [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] as his pregnant girlfriend.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/kzvk8z/we-asked-the-actor-from-eminems-stan-video-who-he-stans-for|title=We Asked the Actor from Eminem's 'Stan' Video Who He Stans For|last=Berman|first=Sarah|date=December 12, 2018|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=December 12, 2018}}</ref> A prologue involves Stan dying his hair blonde and reacting angrily to being called \"Stanley\" by his girlfriend. Later, he sits in a room full of Eminem's posters, writing letters that express his devotion as \"your [Eminem's] biggest fan\". He is aware of every development in Eminem's personal life.\n\nStan wants Eminem to contact him through a personal [[Letter (message)|letter]] or a [[Telephone call|phone call]]; but, due to unfortunate circumstances, the letters fail to reach Eminem in a timely manner. Believing he has been ignored, Stan uses a [[tape recorder]] to record himself driving along a rain-soaked highway while his girlfriend is tied up in the [[Trunk (car)|trunk]]; which he does with the intention of [[Murder\u2013suicide|driving off a bridge]]. In the process, Stan references both \"[[My Name Is]]\" (\"I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?\") and an [[In the Air Tonight#Urban legend|urban legend]] about [[Phil Collins]]'s \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\" before realizing that there is no way of transmitting this final tape to Eminem, proceeding to commit the act anyway.\n\nStan's mother and Matthew visit his grave. When Matthew opens his [[Hoodie]], he has dyed his hair blonde like Stan. Eminem finally gets around to responding to Stan. He apologizes for being late, thanks him for being a fan, and expresses interest in Stan's personal life. Eminem worries about Stan's mental state and says he does not want Stan to end up like a story he had seen on the news recently\u2014a man who had driven drunk off a bridge with his girlfriend in the trunk, about whom he then realizes, \"It was you. Damn.\" Unbeknown to Eminem, flashes of lightning shine on his window, revealing the ghost of Stan silently glaring. The video ends with Matthew staring at Stan's grave.\n\n=== Video credits ===\n* [[Eminem]]\n* [[Dido (singer)|Dido]]\n* Devon Sawa\n* Nathan Mathers\n* Directed by: [[Dr. Dre]] & [[Philip G.

Significant portions from the first two verses and most of the third verse were removed. MTV also cut out all traces of Stan\u2019s girlfriend bound in the trunk of the car and removed one scene showing him guzzling vodka while driving.<ref>Goodman, Fred. \"Protests Don't Slow Eminem's Fire: \"the Marshall Mathers LP\" Stays at Number One Despite Controversy.\" ''Rolling Stone'' August 17, 2000: 38. Web.\n</ref> In the MTV full version, which is 8:15 long, verse 3 censors Stan mentioning his girlfriend in the trunk (so \"Shut up bitch\" and \"screaming in the trunk\" is censored), and about him not slitting her throat, but tied her up, and \"if she [[asphyxia|suffocates]], she'll suffer more, then she'll die too\", which \"slit\", \"tied her up\", \"suffocates\", and \"die\" is censored.\n\nDido has stated that she was [[gag]]ged in the third verse of the video,<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jan/29/artsfeatures |title=Interview: Dido |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref> but this was censored so widely that versions with her gagged are rare.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!-- Trending: --> Hot right now: &nbsp; &nbsp; |url=http://www.gigwise.com/photos/47455/10/The-50-Most-Shocking-Music-Videos-Ever |title=The 50 Most Shocking Music Videos Ever! |work=Gigwise |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref> In the uncensored version, Stan is shown drinking at the wheel of the car before showing Dido struggling in the [[Trunk (automobile)|trunk]] of the car. She manages to remove the duct tape from her mouth and screams before struggling for breath. Most versions were censored so that there is only a brief clip of Dido in the trunk of the car towards the end of the verse. It also censors when Stan says he \"drank a fifth of vodka\", which censors \"drank\" and \"vodka\"; and censors when he says he's on \"a thousand downers\", which \"downers\" is censored; and also censors Stan drinking while driving. At the end of the third verse, \"Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\" is changed to \"Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the end of the bridge now\". In the fourth verse, the line \"[And what's this] shit about us meant to be together\" is completely censored. All references to the girlfriend in the trunk are censored, including the screaming in the background, and the line: \"And had his girlfriend in his trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid.\"\n\nIn the MTV short version, which was used for radio airplay due to time constraints, the second verse lines that are missing are from \"I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to\" to \"I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest\"; the video cuts showing Stan meeting Eminem, talking about how his father cheated and beat his mother and showed him getting a \"Slim Shady\" tattoo on his chest. The missing lyrics from the third verse are of Stan talking about drinking while driving and referencing \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\", which in the video, it skips from showing Stan near-missing a car, and swerving to avoid crashing into it. The lines that are missing are from \"Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare to me to drive?\" to \"I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\". It also removes the chorus after the third verse and goes straight to the fourth verse; the video then cuts to Eminem at last receiving the letter from Stan, and the car sinking more into the water.\n\nIn [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]'s original state as a rock and alternative station, the same versions of the video were shown as on MTV. However, in later Fuse airings, more lines and words are silenced than on the clean version of the LP; half of one of the beginning verses are cut out, and then the song fades out about halfway through the second verse, after playing for approximately two minutes. \"Stan\" was also released on track 17 of ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''; on the clean and explicit versions, the live track censored only the profanity, unlike the clean version of the studio track.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song was met with critical acclaim, with praise directed to the song's [[wikt:Special:Search/epistolary|epistolary]] narrative structure, emotional range and lyrical depth. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] highlighted the song.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-marshall-mathers-lp-mw0000062949 |title=The Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem |website=AllMusic |date=May 23, 2000 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the song, too: \"Eminem proves himself a peerless rap poet with a profound understanding of the power of language. ''Stan,'' an epistolary exchange between the artist and a dangerously obsessive fan, may be the most moving song about star worship ever recorded\" and added that \"Stan\" blazes significant new ground for rap.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Will Hermes|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276305,00.html |title=The Marshall Mathers LP Review|magazine=EW.com |date=June 2, 2000 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> LA Times was also positive: \"'Stan', the album's most haunting track, is superb storytelling with a point.

The same critic listed the song in the Recommended Downloads list and reviewed it:<blockquote>If you haven't heard this, you probably make a career out of living under rocks. It tells the story of an obsessive fan who kills themselves because their idol (Eminem) never writes back, and introduces one of the album's key themes \u2013 the scary power of fame. Ironic, then, that this album made him the biggest cultural figurehead on the planet. It starts with a sample of Dido's 'Thank You' under a sample of rain. This sample goes on to form the song's hook, relating the level of Stan's obsession and almost making him a sympathetic character (Your picture on my wall/It reminds me that it's not so bad....). Offsetting this is Eminem's raps under the persona of Stan, which reveal him as a reprehensible character; mentally unstable, self-mutilating, sexually confused, volatile, and abusive to his pregnant girlfriend (whose life he takes too, when he takes his own). Eminem's final verse is him attempting to write back, asking him not to be like this guy he saw on the news....Overplayed? Yes. But even so, of all of Eminem's singles, this one demonstrates his power as a rapper and his skill as a poet best.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/1440/Eminem-The-Marshall-Mathers-LP/ |title=Review: Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP |website=Sputnikmusic |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>[[IGN]] praised the song as \"easily the most scathingly introspective rumination on fan adoration, idol assimilation, and borderline stalker etiquette. Teamed to Dido's lulling 'Thank You' with its almost somnambulistically hypnotic pop sultriness provides a jolting contrast to the twisted storyline of a musical obsession gone awry. It also paints a picture of what it's like to be knee deep in the push-and-pull world of a superstar.

Many incarnations of the game have a group of children form a ring, [[circle dance|dance in a circle]] around a person, and stoop or curtsy with the final line. The slowest child to do so is faced with a penalty or becomes the \"rosie\" (literally: [[rose]] tree, from the French ''rosier'') and takes their place in the center of the ring. \n\nVariations, corruptions, and vulgarized versions were noted to be in use long before the earliest printed publications. One such variation was dated to be in use in [[Connecticut]] in the 1840s.<ref name=\"newell\"/>\n\nCommon British versions include:\n<blockquote><poem>\nRing-a-ring o' roses,\nA pocket full of posies,\nA-tishoo!

We are three children, sitting under an elder bush. All of us going hush, hush, hush!\" The rhyme is well known in Germany with the first line \"''Ringel, Ringel, Reihe''\" (as the popular collection ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' gave it); it has many local variants, often with \"''Husch, husch, husch''\" (which in German could mean \"quick, quick\") in the fourth line,<ref>B\u00f6hme (1897), pp. 438\u201341, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227.

Beautiful apricots. Blue violets, forget-me-nots. All children sit down.\"\n\nSwiss versions have the children dancing round a rosebush.<ref>B\u00f6hme (1897), p. 439, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 225.</ref> Other European singing games with a strong resemblance include \"''Roze, roze, meie''\" (\"Rose, rose, May\") from The Netherlands with a similar tune to \"Ring a ring o' roses\"<ref>Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227.</ref> and \"''Gira, gira rosa''\" (\"Circle, circle, rose\"), recorded in Venice in 1874, in which girls danced around the girl in the middle who skipped and curtsied as demanded by the verses and at the end kissed the one she liked best, so choosing her for the middle.<ref name=\"theorydate\">Opie and Opie (1985), p. 224.</ref>\n\nIn [[Serbo-Croatian]], there is a similar rhyme called \"Ringe Ringe Raja\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nRinge-ringe-raja,\nDo\u0161'o \u010dika Paja,\nPa pojeo jaja.\nJedno jaje mu\u0107,\nA mi, djeco, \u010du\u010d!</poem></blockquote>\n\nA rough translation is \"Ringe Ringe Raya [a common Serbo-Croatian nonsense word], uncle Ducky has come, and he ate all the eggs, one egg crashed, and we children squat!\" On the last word, the children singing the rhyme jump or squat.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], there is a similar rhyme called \"Ringa, ringa raja\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nRinga, ringa raja,\nmuca pa nagaja,\nku\u017ea pa prite\u010de,\npa vse na tla pome\u010de.</poem></blockquote>\n\nA rough translation is \"Ringa, ringa raja [meaningless], the cat is being naughty, the dog comes running around, and throws everyone on the ground.\"\n\nIn Italian the rhyme has two different versions. The shorter goes this way:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\ncasca il mondo,\ncasca la Terra,\ntutti gi\u00f9 per terra!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nWhich roughly translates this way: \"(We) turn, turn around, the world falls down, Earth falls down, we all fall down (to the ground)!\". It is to be noticed that in Italian the word ''terra'' means both ''Earth'' and ''ground''. There is a slightly longer version that reads:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\nquant'\u00e8 bello il mondo\nil mondo dei bambini,\ncon tanti fiorellini.\nCentocinquanta, la gallina canta,\ncanta sola sola, non vuole andare a scuola,\nla gallina bianca e nera, ti d\u00e0 la buonasera\nti d\u00e0 la buonanotte, il lupo \u00e8 dietro la porta,\nla porta casca gi\u00f9, il lupo non c'\u00e8 pi\u00f9\nA terra tutti gi\u00f9!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe translation is: \"(We) turn, turn around, how beautiful is the world, the world of the children, with many little flowers. One hundred fifty, the chicken sings, she sings all alone (because) she doesn't want to go to the school, the chicken is white and black, she says good evening, she says good night, the wolf hides behind the door, the door falls down, the wolf disappears and we all fall down!\"\nWhile singing the longer version, children often form two circles one inside the other, which turn in opposite directions; when the verse changes, the direction of the circle changes too, and if someone goes wrong he or she is sent off.\n\n==Meaning==\n[[File:RingaRosesTumbleDown.jpg|thumb|Illustration by L. Leslie Brooke (1862\u20131940) for \"All Tumble Down\" from Anon, ''Ring O' Roses'' (1922)]]\nThe origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation. Folklore scholars, however, regard the Great Plague explanation that has been the most common since the mid-20th century as baseless. \n\n===Theories from the late 19th century===\nIn 1898, ''A Dictionary of British Folklore'' contained the belief that an explanation of the game was of pagan origin, based on the ''Sheffield Glossary'' comparison of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]''. The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states, \"Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Freyja wept gold.\" It claimed the first instance to be indicative of pagan beings of light. Another suggestion is more literal, that it was making a \"ring\" around the roses and bowing with the \"all fall down\" as a [[curtsy]].<ref name=nutt /> In 1892, the American writer, [[Eugene Field]] wrote a poem titled ''Teeny-Weeny'' that specifically referred to [[fairy|fey]] folk playing ring-a-rosie.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2921540/the_osage_city_free_press/ | title=Children's Column | publisher=The Osage City Free Press (Osage City, Kansas) | date=25 August 1892 | accessdate=31 July 2015 | pages=6}}</ref> \n\nAccording to ''Games and Songs of American Children'', published in 1883, the \"rosie\" was a reference to the French word for [[Rhododendron ponticum|rose tree]] and the children would dance and stoop to the person in the center.<ref name=\"newell\"/> Variations, especially more literal ones, were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game-rhyme.

[[Peter and Iona Opie]], the leading authorities on [[nursery rhyme]]s, remarked:\n\n{{quote|The invariable sneezing and falling down in modern English versions have given would-be origin finders the opportunity to say that the rhyme dates back to the Great Plague.

The shorter goes this way:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\ncasca il mondo,\ncasca la Terra,\ntutti gi\u00f9 per terra!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nWhich roughly translates this way: \"(We) turn, turn around, the world falls down, Earth falls down, we all fall down (to the ground)!\". It is to be noticed that in Italian the word ''terra'' means both ''Earth'' and ''ground''. There is a slightly longer version that reads:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\nquant'\u00e8 bello il mondo\nil mondo dei bambini,\ncon tanti fiorellini.\nCentocinquanta, la gallina canta,\ncanta sola sola, non vuole andare a scuola,\nla gallina bianca e nera, ti d\u00e0 la buonasera\nti d\u00e0 la buonanotte, il lupo \u00e8 dietro la porta,\nla porta casca gi\u00f9, il lupo non c'\u00e8 pi\u00f9\nA terra tutti gi\u00f9!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe translation is: \"(We) turn, turn around, how beautiful is the world, the world of the children, with many little flowers. One hundred fifty, the chicken sings, she sings all alone (because) she doesn't want to go to the school, the chicken is white and black, she says good evening, she says good night, the wolf hides behind the door, the door falls down, the wolf disappears and we all fall down!\"\nWhile singing the longer version, children often form two circles one inside the other, which turn in opposite directions; when the verse changes, the direction of the circle changes too, and if someone goes wrong he or she is sent off.\n\n==Meaning==\n[[File:RingaRosesTumbleDown.jpg|thumb|Illustration by L. Leslie Brooke (1862\u20131940) for \"All Tumble Down\" from Anon, ''Ring O' Roses'' (1922)]]\nThe origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation. Folklore scholars, however, regard the Great Plague explanation that has been the most common since the mid-20th century as baseless. \n\n===Theories from the late 19th century===\nIn 1898, ''A Dictionary of British Folklore'' contained the belief that an explanation of the game was of pagan origin, based on the ''Sheffield Glossary'' comparison of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]''. The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states, \"Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Freyja wept gold.\" It claimed the first instance to be indicative of pagan beings of light. Another suggestion is more literal, that it was making a \"ring\" around the roses and bowing with the \"all fall down\" as a [[curtsy]].<ref name=nutt /> In 1892, the American writer, [[Eugene Field]] wrote a poem titled ''Teeny-Weeny'' that specifically referred to [[fairy|fey]] folk playing ring-a-rosie.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2921540/the_osage_city_free_press/ | title=Children's Column | publisher=The Osage City Free Press (Osage City, Kansas) | date=25 August 1892 | accessdate=31 July 2015 | pages=6}}</ref> \n\nAccording to ''Games and Songs of American Children'', published in 1883, the \"rosie\" was a reference to the French word for [[Rhododendron ponticum|rose tree]] and the children would dance and stoop to the person in the center.<ref name=\"newell\"/> Variations, especially more literal ones, were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game-rhyme.

Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions. For example, a \"9 [[Millimetre|mm]] pistol\" has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters. Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions \"converted\" to metric units, metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches. True \"caliber\" specifications require imperial measure, and even when cartridge designations (often mistakenly referred to as \"caliber\") only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch, actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch.\n\nIn a [[rifling|rifled]] barrel, the distance is measured between opposing [[Rifling#Construction and operation|lands]] or between opposing [[Rifling#Construction and operation|grooves]]; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the [[United States]], while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world. Measurements \"across the grooves\" are used for maximum precision because [[rifling]] and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the \"lands\" behind.\n\nGood performance requires a concentric, straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within, in preference to a \"tight\" fit which can be achieved even with off-center, crooked bores that cause excessive friction, fouling and an out-of-balance, wobbling projectile in flight.\n\nWhile modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] the gun is chambered for, they are still categorized together based on bore diameter.  For example, a firearm might be described as a \"[[.30 caliber|30 caliber]] rifle\", which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly {{convert|0.30|in|mm}} projectile; or a \"22 rimfire\", referring to any [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] firearms firing cartridges with a [[.22 caliber]] projectile. However, there can be significant differences in nominal bullet and bore dimensions and all cartridges so \"categorized\" are not automatically identical in actual caliber.\n\nFor example, [[.303 British]] firearms and projectiles are often \"categorized\" as \".30-caliber\" alongside several dozen U.S. \".30-caliber\" cartridges despite using bullets .310-.312\" diameter while all U.S \".30-caliber\" centerfire rifle cartridges use a common, standard .308\" bullet outside diameter. Using bullets larger than design specifications causes excessive pressures while undersize bullets cause low pressures,insufficient muzzle velocities and fouling that will eventually lead to excessive pressures.\n\nRegardless of common practice among \"shooters\", caliber refers to specific, precise and crucial bore/bullet dimensions and generic categorizations involving \"caliber\" are of little benefit to the shooting and arms industries.\n\nCalibers fall into four general categories by size. [[Small-bore]] refers to calibers with a diameter of .32 inches or smaller. The medium-bore refers to calibers with a diameter between .33 inches up to .39 inches and large-bore refers to calibers with a diameter of .40 inches or larger. Miniature bore historically referred to calibers under .22. There is much variance in the use of the term small-bore which over the years has changed considerably with anything under .577 caliber considered small-bore prior to the mid-19th century.\n\n==Cartridge naming conventions==\nMakers of early cartridge arms had to invent methods of naming cartridges since no established convention existed then.<ref name=\"cotw\">{{cite book | last = Barnes | first = Frank C. | editor = McPherson, M.L. | title = Cartridges of the World | edition = 8th | origyear = 1965 | year = 1997 | publisher = DBI Books | pages =8\u201312 | isbn = 0-87349-178-5}}</ref> One of the early established cartridge arms was the [[Spencer repeating rifle]], which [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces used in the [[American Civil War]]. It was named based on the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] dimensions, rather than the bore diameter, with the earliest cartridge called the \"No. 56 cartridge\", indicating a chamber diameter of .56&nbsp;in; the bore diameter varied considerably, from .52 to .54&nbsp;in.  Later various [[wildcat cartridge|derivatives]] were created using the same basic cartridge, but with smaller-diameter bullets; these were named by the cartridge diameter at the base and mouth. The original No. 56 became the .56-56, and the smaller versions, .56-52, .56-50, and .56-46. The .56-52, the most common of the new calibers, used a 50-cal bullet.\n\nOther black powder-era cartridges used naming schemes that appeared similar, but measured entirely different characteristics; [[.45-70]], [[.44-40]], and [[.32-20]] were designated by bullet diameter to hundredths of an inch and standard [[black powder]] charge in [[grain (measure)|grain]]s. Optionally, the bullet weight in grains was designated, e.g. .45-70-405.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 9.</ref> This scheme was far more popular and was carried over after the advent of early [[smokeless powder]] cartridges such as the [[.30-30 Winchester]] and [[.22 Long]]. Later developments used terms to indicate relative power, such as [[.44 Special]] and [[.44 Magnum]]. Variations on these methods persist today, with new cartridges such as the [[.204 Ruger]] and [[.17 HMR]] (Hornady Magnum Rimfire).\n\nMetric diameters for small arms refer to cartridge dimensions and are expressed with an \"\u00d7\" between the bore diameter and the length of the cartridge case; for example, the [[6.5\u00d755mm|6.5\u00d755mm Swedish]] cartridge has a bore diameter of 6.5&nbsp;mm and a case length of 55&nbsp;mm.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe means of measuring a rifled bore varies, and may refer to the diameter of the lands or the grooves of the rifling.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 9.</ref> For example, the [[.257 Roberts]] and [[.250-3000 Savage|.250 Savage]] both use a .250 inch projectile; both .250 and 257 rifle bores have the a .250 inch land diameter and .257 inch groove diameter.<ref name=VanZwoll>{{cite book| last=Van Zwoll| first=Wayne| title=Shooter's bible guide to rifle ballistics| page=18| publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]| publication-date=2011| isbn=978-1-61608-224-6}}</ref> The [[.308 Winchester]] is measured across the grooves and uses a .308-in diameter (7.82-mm) bullet; the military-specification version is known as [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]], so called because the bore diameter measured between the lands is 7.62&nbsp;mm, and the cartridge has a case 51&nbsp;mm long.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 670.</ref>\n\n==Metric and US customary==\nThe following table lists some of the commonly used calibers where both metric and US customary are used as equivalents.

[[IMI Desert Eagle|Desert Eagle]] handgun.\n|}\n\n==Shotguns==\n{{Main|Gauge (firearms)}}\n\nShotguns are classed according to gauge, a related expression.  The gauge of a shotgun refers to how many lead spheres, each with a diameter equal to that of the bore, amount to one pound (approximately 454 grams) in weight. In the case of a 12-gauge shotgun, it would take 12 spheres the size of the shotgun's bore to equal a pound.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 629.</ref> A numerically larger gauge indicates a smaller barrel: a 20-gauge shotgun requires more spheres to equal a pound; therefore, its barrel is smaller than the 12-gauge. This metric is used in Russia as \"caliber number\": e.g., \"shotgun of the 12 caliber.\" The 16th caliber is known as \"lordly\" ({{lang-ru|\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}). While shotgun bores can be expressed in calibers (the .410 bore shotgun is in fact a caliber measure of .41 caliber [10.4&nbsp;mm]),<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 629.</ref> unlike with rifles the actual bore diameter of a smoothbore shotgun varies significantly down the length of the barrel due to various chokes (and sometimes back-boring).\n\n==Caliber as measurement of length==\n{{Main|Caliber (artillery)#Barrel length}}\nThe length of artillery barrels has often been described in terms of multiples of the bore diameter e.g. a 4-inch gun of 50 calibers would have a barrel 4&nbsp;in  \u00d7 50 = 200&nbsp;in long.  A 50 caliber 16 inch gun (16 inch diameter shell), has a barrel length (muzzle to breech) of 50 \u00d7 16 = 800 in (66&nbsp;ft 8 in).  Both 14-in and 16-in navy guns were common in World War II.  The British Royal Navy insisted on 50-cal guns on ships as it would allow {{convert|1,900|to|2,700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shells to travel at an initial velocity of up to 1,800&nbsp;mph (2,896&nbsp;kmh) to a distance of 26&nbsp;mi (42&nbsp;km).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Pounds as a measure of cannon bore==\nSmoothbore [[cannon]] and [[carronade]] bores are designated by the weight in imperial pounds of spherical solid iron shot of diameter to fit the bore. Standard sizes are 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, and 42 pounds, with some 68-pound weapons, and other nonstandard weapons using the same scheme. See [[Carronade#Ordnance]].\n\nFrom about the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century, measurement of the bore of large gunpowder weapons was usually expressed as the weight of its iron shot in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]].  Iron [[round shot|shot]] was used as the standard reference because iron was the most common material used for artillery ammunition during that period, and solid spherical shot the most common form encountered. Artillery was classified thereby into standard categories, with 3-pdr., 4-pdr., 6-pdr., 8-pdr., 9-pdr., 12-pdr., 18-pdr., 24-pdr., and 32-pdr. being the most common sizes encountered, although larger, smaller and intermediate sizes existed.\n\nIn practice, though, significant variation occurred in the actual mass of the projectile for a given nominal shot weight. The country of manufacture is a significant consideration when determining bore diameters.  For example, the French livre, until 1812, had a mass of 489.5 g whilst the contemporary English ([[avoirdupois]]) pound massed approximately 454 g. Thus, a French 32-pdr. at the  [[Battle of Trafalgar]] threw a shot with 1.138&nbsp;kg more mass than an English 32-pdr.\n\nComplicating matters further, muzzle-loaded weapons require a significant gap between the sides of the tube bore and the surface of the shot. This is necessary so the projectile may be inserted from the mouth to the base of the tube and seated securely adjacent the propellant charge with relative ease.  The gap, called [[windage]], increases the size of the bore with respect to the diameter of the shot somewhere between 10% and 20% depending upon the year the tube was cast and the [[foundry]] responsible.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+English gun classes c. 1800{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n|-\n! gun class (pdr.)\n! shot diameter (cm)\n! shot volume (cm<sup>3</sup>)\n! approx. service bore (cm)\n! mass of projectile (kg)\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2\n| align=\"right\"| 6\n| align=\"right\"| 115\n| align=\"right\"| 6.6\n| align=\"right\"| 0.9\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 3\n| align=\"right\"| 6.9\n| align=\"right\"| 172\n| align=\"right\"| 7.6\n| align=\"right\"| 1.4\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 4\n| align=\"right\"| 7.6\n| align=\"right\"| 230\n| align=\"right\"| 8.4\n| align=\"right\"| 1.8\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 6\n| align=\"right\"| 8.7\n| align=\"right\"| 345\n| align=\"right\"| 9.6\n| align=\"right\"| 2.7\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 9\n| align=\"right\"| 10\n| align=\"right\"| 518\n| align=\"right\"| 11\n| align=\"right\"| 4.1\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 12\n| align=\"right\"| 10.9\n| align=\"right\"| 691\n| align=\"right\"| 12.1\n| align=\"right\"| 5.4\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 18\n| align=\"right\"| 12.6\n| align=\"right\"| 1037\n| align=\"right\"| 13.8\n| align=\"right\"| 8.2\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 24\n| align=\"right\"| 13.8\n| align=\"right\"| 1383\n| align=\"right\"| 15.2\n| align=\"right\"| 10.9\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 32\n| align=\"right\"| 15.2\n| align=\"right\"| 1844\n| align=\"right\"| 16.7\n| align=\"right\"| 14.5\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 64\n| align=\"right\"| 19.2\n| align=\"right\"| 3687\n| align=\"right\"| 21.1\n| align=\"right\"| 29\n|}\n\nThe relationship between bore diameter and projectile weight was severed following the widespread adoption of rifled weapons during the latter part of the 19th century. Guns continued to be classed by projectile weight into the mid-20th century, [[British standard ordnance weights and measurements|particularly in British service]]. However, this value no longer definitively related to bore diameter, since projectiles were no longer simple spheres\u2014and in any case were more often hollow shells filled with explosives rather than solid iron shot.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of cartridges by caliber]]\n*[[List of handgun cartridges]]\n*[[List of rifle cartridges]]\n*[[List of the largest cannons by caliber]]\n\n==References==\n{{Cite book |title=Cartridges of the world : a complete and illustrated reference for more than 1500 cartridges |last=Barnes |first=Frank C. |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2016 |isbn=1440246424 |editor-last=Woodard |editor-first=W.

Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions. For example, a \"9 [[Millimetre|mm]] pistol\" has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters. Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions \"converted\" to metric units, metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches. True \"caliber\" specifications require imperial measure, and even when cartridge designations (often mistakenly referred to as \"caliber\") only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch, actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch.\n\nIn a [[rifling|rifled]] barrel, the distance is measured between opposing [[Rifling#Construction and operation|lands]] or between opposing [[Rifling#Construction and operation|grooves]]; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the [[United States]], while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world. Measurements \"across the grooves\" are used for maximum precision because [[rifling]] and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the \"lands\" behind.\n\nGood performance requires a concentric, straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within, in preference to a \"tight\" fit which can be achieved even with off-center, crooked bores that cause excessive friction, fouling and an out-of-balance, wobbling projectile in flight.\n\nWhile modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] the gun is chambered for, they are still categorized together based on bore diameter.  For example, a firearm might be described as a \"[[.30 caliber|30 caliber]] rifle\", which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly {{convert|0.30|in|mm}} projectile; or a \"22 rimfire\", referring to any [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] firearms firing cartridges with a [[.22 caliber]] projectile. However, there can be significant differences in nominal bullet and bore dimensions and all cartridges so \"categorized\" are not automatically identical in actual caliber.\n\nFor example, [[.303 British]] firearms and projectiles are often \"categorized\" as \".30-caliber\" alongside several dozen U.S. \".30-caliber\" cartridges despite using bullets .310-.312\" diameter while all U.S \".30-caliber\" centerfire rifle cartridges use a common, standard .308\" bullet outside diameter. Using bullets larger than design specifications causes excessive pressures while undersize bullets cause low pressures,insufficient muzzle velocities and fouling that will eventually lead to excessive pressures.\n\nRegardless of common practice among \"shooters\", caliber refers to specific, precise and crucial bore/bullet dimensions and generic categorizations involving \"caliber\" are of little benefit to the shooting and arms industries.\n\nCalibers fall into four general categories by size. [[Small-bore]] refers to calibers with a diameter of .32 inches or smaller. The medium-bore refers to calibers with a diameter between .33 inches up to .39 inches and large-bore refers to calibers with a diameter of .40 inches or larger. Miniature bore historically referred to calibers under .22. There is much variance in the use of the term small-bore which over the years has changed considerably with anything under .577 caliber considered small-bore prior to the mid-19th century.\n\n==Cartridge naming conventions==\nMakers of early cartridge arms had to invent methods of naming cartridges since no established convention existed then.<ref name=\"cotw\">{{cite book | last = Barnes | first = Frank C. | editor = McPherson, M.L. | title = Cartridges of the World | edition = 8th | origyear = 1965 | year = 1997 | publisher = DBI Books | pages =8\u201312 | isbn = 0-87349-178-5}}</ref> One of the early established cartridge arms was the [[Spencer repeating rifle]], which [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces used in the [[American Civil War]]. It was named based on the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] dimensions, rather than the bore diameter, with the earliest cartridge called the \"No. 56 cartridge\", indicating a chamber diameter of .56&nbsp;in; the bore diameter varied considerably, from .52 to .54&nbsp;in.  Later various [[wildcat cartridge|derivatives]] were created using the same basic cartridge, but with smaller-diameter bullets; these were named by the cartridge diameter at the base and mouth. The original No. 56 became the .56-56, and the smaller versions, .56-52, .56-50, and .56-46. The .56-52, the most common of the new calibers, used a 50-cal bullet.\n\nOther black powder-era cartridges used naming schemes that appeared similar, but measured entirely different characteristics; [[.45-70]], [[.44-40]], and [[.32-20]] were designated by bullet diameter to hundredths of an inch and standard [[black powder]] charge in [[grain (measure)|grain]]s. Optionally, the bullet weight in grains was designated, e.g. .45-70-405.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 9.</ref> This scheme was far more popular and was carried over after the advent of early [[smokeless powder]] cartridges such as the [[.30-30 Winchester]] and [[.22 Long]]. Later developments used terms to indicate relative power, such as [[.44 Special]] and [[.44 Magnum]]. Variations on these methods persist today, with new cartridges such as the [[.204 Ruger]] and [[.17 HMR]] (Hornady Magnum Rimfire).\n\nMetric diameters for small arms refer to cartridge dimensions and are expressed with an \"\u00d7\" between the bore diameter and the length of the cartridge case; for example, the [[6.5\u00d755mm|6.5\u00d755mm Swedish]] cartridge has a bore diameter of 6.5&nbsp;mm and a case length of 55&nbsp;mm.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe means of measuring a rifled bore varies, and may refer to the diameter of the lands or the grooves of the rifling.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 9.</ref> For example, the [[.257 Roberts]] and [[.250-3000 Savage|.250 Savage]] both use a .250 inch projectile; both .250 and 257 rifle bores have the a .250 inch land diameter and .257 inch groove diameter.<ref name=VanZwoll>{{cite book| last=Van Zwoll| first=Wayne| title=Shooter's bible guide to rifle ballistics| page=18| publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]| publication-date=2011| isbn=978-1-61608-224-6}}</ref> The [[.308 Winchester]] is measured across the grooves and uses a .308-in diameter (7.82-mm) bullet; the military-specification version is known as [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]], so called because the bore diameter measured between the lands is 7.62&nbsp;mm, and the cartridge has a case 51&nbsp;mm long.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 670.</ref>\n\n==Metric and US customary==\nThe following table lists some of the commonly used calibers where both metric and US customary are used as equivalents.

[[IMI Desert Eagle|Desert Eagle]] handgun.\n|}\n\n==Shotguns==\n{{Main|Gauge (firearms)}}\n\nShotguns are classed according to gauge, a related expression.  The gauge of a shotgun refers to how many lead spheres, each with a diameter equal to that of the bore, amount to one pound (approximately 454 grams) in weight. In the case of a 12-gauge shotgun, it would take 12 spheres the size of the shotgun's bore to equal a pound.<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 629.</ref> A numerically larger gauge indicates a smaller barrel: a 20-gauge shotgun requires more spheres to equal a pound; therefore, its barrel is smaller than the 12-gauge. This metric is used in Russia as \"caliber number\": e.g., \"shotgun of the 12 caliber.\" The 16th caliber is known as \"lordly\" ({{lang-ru|\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}). While shotgun bores can be expressed in calibers (the .410 bore shotgun is in fact a caliber measure of .41 caliber [10.4&nbsp;mm]),<ref>Barnes, Cartridges of the World 15 Edition 2016, p. 629.</ref> unlike with rifles the actual bore diameter of a smoothbore shotgun varies significantly down the length of the barrel due to various chokes (and sometimes back-boring).\n\n==Caliber as measurement of length==\n{{Main|Caliber (artillery)#Barrel length}}\nThe length of artillery barrels has often been described in terms of multiples of the bore diameter e.g. a 4-inch gun of 50 calibers would have a barrel 4&nbsp;in  \u00d7 50 = 200&nbsp;in long.  A 50 caliber 16 inch gun (16 inch diameter shell), has a barrel length (muzzle to breech) of 50 \u00d7 16 = 800 in (66&nbsp;ft 8 in).  Both 14-in and 16-in navy guns were common in World War II.  The British Royal Navy insisted on 50-cal guns on ships as it would allow {{convert|1,900|to|2,700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shells to travel at an initial velocity of up to 1,800&nbsp;mph (2,896&nbsp;kmh) to a distance of 26&nbsp;mi (42&nbsp;km).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Pounds as a measure of cannon bore==\nSmoothbore [[cannon]] and [[carronade]] bores are designated by the weight in imperial pounds of spherical solid iron shot of diameter to fit the bore. Standard sizes are 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, and 42 pounds, with some 68-pound weapons, and other nonstandard weapons using the same scheme. See [[Carronade#Ordnance]].\n\nFrom about the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century, measurement of the bore of large gunpowder weapons was usually expressed as the weight of its iron shot in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]].  Iron [[round shot|shot]] was used as the standard reference because iron was the most common material used for artillery ammunition during that period, and solid spherical shot the most common form encountered. Artillery was classified thereby into standard categories, with 3-pdr., 4-pdr., 6-pdr., 8-pdr., 9-pdr., 12-pdr., 18-pdr., 24-pdr., and 32-pdr. being the most common sizes encountered, although larger, smaller and intermediate sizes existed.\n\nIn practice, though, significant variation occurred in the actual mass of the projectile for a given nominal shot weight. The country of manufacture is a significant consideration when determining bore diameters.  For example, the French livre, until 1812, had a mass of 489.5 g whilst the contemporary English ([[avoirdupois]]) pound massed approximately 454 g. Thus, a French 32-pdr. at the  [[Battle of Trafalgar]] threw a shot with 1.138&nbsp;kg more mass than an English 32-pdr.\n\nComplicating matters further, muzzle-loaded weapons require a significant gap between the sides of the tube bore and the surface of the shot. This is necessary so the projectile may be inserted from the mouth to the base of the tube and seated securely adjacent the propellant charge with relative ease.  The gap, called [[windage]], increases the size of the bore with respect to the diameter of the shot somewhere between 10% and 20% depending upon the year the tube was cast and the [[foundry]] responsible.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+English gun classes c. 1800{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n|-\n! gun class (pdr.)\n! shot diameter (cm)\n! shot volume (cm<sup>3</sup>)\n! approx. service bore (cm)\n! mass of projectile (kg)\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2\n| align=\"right\"| 6\n| align=\"right\"| 115\n| align=\"right\"| 6.6\n| align=\"right\"| 0.9\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 3\n| align=\"right\"| 6.9\n| align=\"right\"| 172\n| align=\"right\"| 7.6\n| align=\"right\"| 1.4\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 4\n| align=\"right\"| 7.6\n| align=\"right\"| 230\n| align=\"right\"| 8.4\n| align=\"right\"| 1.8\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 6\n| align=\"right\"| 8.7\n| align=\"right\"| 345\n| align=\"right\"| 9.6\n| align=\"right\"| 2.7\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 9\n| align=\"right\"| 10\n| align=\"right\"| 518\n| align=\"right\"| 11\n| align=\"right\"| 4.1\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 12\n| align=\"right\"| 10.9\n| align=\"right\"| 691\n| align=\"right\"| 12.1\n| align=\"right\"| 5.4\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 18\n| align=\"right\"| 12.6\n| align=\"right\"| 1037\n| align=\"right\"| 13.8\n| align=\"right\"| 8.2\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 24\n| align=\"right\"| 13.8\n| align=\"right\"| 1383\n| align=\"right\"| 15.2\n| align=\"right\"| 10.9\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 32\n| align=\"right\"| 15.2\n| align=\"right\"| 1844\n| align=\"right\"| 16.7\n| align=\"right\"| 14.5\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 64\n| align=\"right\"| 19.2\n| align=\"right\"| 3687\n| align=\"right\"| 21.1\n| align=\"right\"| 29\n|}\n\nThe relationship between bore diameter and projectile weight was severed following the widespread adoption of rifled weapons during the latter part of the 19th century. Guns continued to be classed by projectile weight into the mid-20th century, [[British standard ordnance weights and measurements|particularly in British service]]. However, this value no longer definitively related to bore diameter, since projectiles were no longer simple spheres\u2014and in any case were more often hollow shells filled with explosives rather than solid iron shot.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of cartridges by caliber]]\n*[[List of handgun cartridges]]\n*[[List of rifle cartridges]]\n*[[List of the largest cannons by caliber]]\n\n==References==\n{{Cite book |title=Cartridges of the world : a complete and illustrated reference for more than 1500 cartridges |last=Barnes |first=Frank C. |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2016 |isbn=1440246424 |editor-last=Woodard |editor-first=W.
