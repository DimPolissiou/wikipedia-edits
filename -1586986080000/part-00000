First produced and published for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (Famicom), the series consists of sixteen main games and four spin-offs. The gameplay revolves around the tactical movement of characters across grid-based environments while incorporating a story and characters similar to traditional role-playing video games.\n\nA notable aspect of gameplay is the [[permanent death|permanent death]] of characters in battle, removing them from the rest of the game when they are defeated. In the newer titles, from ''[[Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem]]'' onwards, players get to choose between Classic mode, in which characters permanently die, or Casual mode, in which fallen characters are revived for the next battle. The series title refers to the \"Fire Emblem\", usually portrayed as a royal weapon or shield that represents the power of war and dragons, a recurring element in the series. The development of the first game began as a [[D\u014djin|d\u014djin project]] by [[Shouzou Kaga]] and three other developers. Its success prompted the development of further titles in the series. Shouzou Kaga headed the development of each entry until the release of ''[[Fire Emblem: Thracia 776|Thracia 776]],'' when he left Intelligent Systems and founded his game studio to develop ''[[Tear Ring Saga]]''.\n\n''[[Advance Wars]]'', the 2001 [[turn-based tactics]] game, was previously released before ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' two months prior, which was such a success that Designer Kentaro Nishimura stated that the success of \u201c''Advance Wars'' shifted Nintendo\u2019s attitude towards western tastes.\u201d Additionally, he went on to say that the ''Fire Emblem'' series would have never crossed the seas to the west had ''Advance Wars'' not made a prominent impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-advance-wars?page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426182037/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-advance-wars?page=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-04-26|title=The Making Of: Advance Wars - Edge Magazine|date=2012-04-26|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>  \n\nNo games in the series were released outside of Japan until two characters, [[Marth (Fire Emblem)|Marth]] and [[Roy (Fire Emblem)|Roy]], were included as playable characters in the 2001 fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. Their popularity eventually convinced Nintendo to release the next game, ''The Blazing Blade'', in Western regions under the title ''[[Fire Emblem (video game)|Fire Emblem]]'' in 2003. Many games in the series have sold well despite a decline during the 2000s which resulted in the series' near-cancellation. Individual entries have generally been praised, the series as a whole has been lauded for its gameplay, and it is cited as a seminal series in the tactical role-playing genre. Characters from multiple games have also been included in crossovers with other franchises.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Titles==\n\n{{Timeline of release years\n| title = Timeline of release years\n| range1       = 1990 \u2013\n| range1_color = #201916 #b3a6a1 <!-- Based on the series logo -->\n| 1990  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light|Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light]]''\n| 1992  = ''[[Fire Emblem Gaiden|Gaiden]]''\n| 1994  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem|Mystery of the Emblem]]''\n| 1996  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War|Genealogy of the Holy War]]''\n| 1999  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Thracia 776|Thracia 776]]''\n| 2002  = ''[[Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade|The Binding Blade]]''\n| 2003  = ''[[Fire Emblem (video game)|Fire Emblem]]''\n| 2004  = ''[[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones|The Sacred Stones]]''\n| 2005  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance|Path of Radiance]]''\n| 2007  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn|Radiant Dawn]]''\n| 2008  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon|Shadow Dragon]]''\n| 2010  = ''[[Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem|New Mystery of the Emblem]]''\n| 2012  = ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening|Awakening]]''\n| 2015a = ''[[Fire Emblem Fates|Fates]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia|Echoes: Shadows of Valentia]]''\n| 2019  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Three Houses|Three Houses]]''\n}}\n\n===Games===\n{{Main|List of Fire Emblem video games}}\nThere are currently 16 games in the ''Fire Emblem'' series, including remakes of earlier titles.<ref name=\"IwataInterview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Fire-Emblem-Fates/Fire-Emblem-Fates/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi-1032066.html |title=Iwata Asks \"Fire Emblem Fates\" |publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo UK]] |date=2015 |accessdate=July 9, 2015 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20151105045559/https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Fire-Emblem-Fates/Fire-Emblem-Fates/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi-1032066.html |archivedate=November 5, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Of the sixteen games, thirteen have been original games, and three have been remakes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/01/14/nintendo-announces-new-fire-emblem-for-3ds/ |title=Nintendo announces new Fire Emblem for 3DS|author=Minotti, Mike|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=January 14, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711171634/http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/14/nintendo-announces-new-fire-emblem-for-3ds/|archivedate=July 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe first entry in the series, ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light|Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light]]'', was released in 1990 for the Japanese [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].

Each character has a specific [[character class]], giving them set abilities and affecting how far they can move across the field. Some character classes have innate skills unique to them, and each character has their own stats. Depending on the series entry, a character's class can be changed or upgraded, sometimes with the requirement of special items. During a battle, each character gains experience points by performing actions, such as attacking an enemy, healing an ally, or slaying a foe (which typically offers the most experience points). When a certain level is reached, the character levels up, and new skill points are awarded randomly to a character's attributes, such as the character's health, agility or strength. The more a character is used in battle, the more experience that character gains.<ref name=\"FEAmanual\"/><ref name=\"TechFE\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/fire-emblem-awakening-character-guide/|title=Fire Emblem: Awakening character guide|author=Concepcion, Miguel|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224075532/http://www.gamesradar.com/fire-emblem-awakening-character-guide/|archivedate=December 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GamaFE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=14|title=Game Design Essentials: 20 RPGs|author=Harris, John|website=[[Gamasutra]]|page=14|date=July 2, 2009|accessdate=July 18, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200544/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=14|archivedate=October 29, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA key element in combat since ''Genealogy of the Holy War'' is the Weapon Triangle, a system governing the strengths and weaknesses that certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]] fashion.

At this time, Marth and Roy from ''Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light'' and ''Sword of Seals'' appeared as playable characters in ''Super Smash Bros.

Due to its success overseas, it was decided to return the series to home consoles for ''Path of Radiance'' for the GameCube. Despite it arriving late in the GameCube's life cycle, it provided a late boost to sales, reaffirming Nintendo's faith in the series.<ref name=\"FEhistory\"/><ref name=\"RDinterview\"/> By 2010, the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next ''Fire Emblem'' failed to sell above 250,000 units, the series would be canceled.

The first suit failed, and the court ruled in Tirnanog's favor. Nintendo filed a second lawsuit, and this time was awarded a cash settlement of \u00a576 million. Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher [[Enterbrain]] were still allowed to publish the title, though they changed its name to '[[Tear Ring Saga]]', and eventually developed a sequel.

First produced and published for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (Famicom), the series consists of sixteen main games and four [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]]. The gameplay revolves around the tactical movement of characters across grid-based environments while incorporating a story and characters similar to traditional role-playing video games.\n\nA notable aspect of gameplay is the [[permanent death]] of characters in battle, removing them from the rest of the game when they are defeated. In the newer titles, from ''[[Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem]]'' onwards, players get to choose between Classic mode, in which characters permanently die, or Casual mode, in which fallen characters are revived for the next battle. The series title refers to the \"Fire Emblem\", usually portrayed as a royal weapon or shield that represents the power of war and dragons, a recurring element in the series. The development of the first game began as a [[D\u014djin|d\u014djin project]] by [[Shouzou Kaga]] and three other developers (these three developers' names should be listed). Its success prompted the development of further titles in the series. Shouzou Kaga headed the development of each entry until the release of ''[[Fire Emblem: Thracia 776|Thracia 776]],'' when he left Intelligent Systems and founded his game studio to develop ''[[Tear Ring Saga]]''.\n\n''[[Advance Wars]]'', the 2001 [[turn-based tactics]] game, was previously released before ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' two months prior, which was such a success that Designer Kentaro Nishimura stated that the success of \u201c''[[Advance Wars]]''\u2019 shifted Nintendo\u2019s attitude towards western tastes.\u201d Additionally, he went on to say that the ''Fire Emblem'' series would have never crossed the seas to the west had ''[[Advance Wars]]'' not made a prominent impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-advance-wars?page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426182037/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-advance-wars?page=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-04-26|title=The Making Of: Advance Wars - Edge Magazine|date=2012-04-26|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>  \n\nNo games in the series were released outside of Japan until two characters, [[Marth (Fire Emblem)|Marth]] and [[Roy (Fire Emblem)|Roy]], were included as playable characters in the 2001 fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. Their popularity eventually convinced Nintendo to release the next game, ''The Blazing Blade'', in Western regions under the title ''[[Fire Emblem (video game)|Fire Emblem]]'' in 2003. Many games in the series have sold well despite a decline during the 2000s which resulted in the series' near-cancellation. Individual entries have generally been praised, the series as a whole has been lauded for its gameplay, and it is cited as a seminal series in the tactical role-playing genre. Characters from multiple games have also been included in crossovers with other franchises.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Titles==\n\n{{Timeline of release years\n| title = Timeline of release years\n| range1       = 1990 \u2013\n| range1_color = #201916 #b3a6a1 <!-- Based on the series logo -->\n| 1990  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light|Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light]]''\n| 1992  = ''[[Fire Emblem Gaiden|Gaiden]]''\n| 1994  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem|Mystery of the Emblem]]''\n| 1996  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War|Genealogy of the Holy War]]''\n| 1999  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Thracia 776|Thracia 776]]''\n| 2002  = ''[[Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade|The Binding Blade]]''\n| 2003  = ''[[Fire Emblem (video game)|Fire Emblem]]''\n| 2004  = ''[[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones|The Sacred Stones]]''\n| 2005  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance|Path of Radiance]]''\n| 2007  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn|Radiant Dawn]]''\n| 2008  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon|Shadow Dragon]]''\n| 2010  = ''[[Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem|New Mystery of the Emblem]]''\n| 2012  = ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening|Awakening]]''\n| 2015a = ''[[Fire Emblem Fates|Fates]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia|Echoes: Shadows of Valentia]]''\n| 2019  = ''[[Fire Emblem: Three Houses|Three Houses]]''\n}}\n\n===Games===\n{{Main|List of Fire Emblem video games}}\nThere are currently 16 games in the ''Fire Emblem'' series, including remakes of earlier titles.<ref name=\"IwataInterview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Fire-Emblem-Fates/Fire-Emblem-Fates/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi-1032066.html |title=Iwata Asks \"Fire Emblem Fates\" |publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo UK]] |date=2015 |accessdate=July 9, 2015 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20151105045559/https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Fire-Emblem-Fates/Fire-Emblem-Fates/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi/1-Story-by-Shin-Kibayashi-1032066.html |archivedate=November 5, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Of the sixteen games, thirteen have been original games, and three have been remakes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/01/14/nintendo-announces-new-fire-emblem-for-3ds/ |title=Nintendo announces new Fire Emblem for 3DS|author=Minotti, Mike|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=January 14, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711171634/http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/14/nintendo-announces-new-fire-emblem-for-3ds/|archivedate=July 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe first entry in the series, ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light|Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light]]'', was released in 1990 for the Japanese [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].

Each character has a specific [[character class]], giving them set abilities and affecting how far they can move across the field. Some character classes have innate skills unique to them, and each character has their own stats. Depending on the series entry, a character's class can be changed or upgraded, sometimes with the requirement of special items. During a battle, each character gains experience points by performing actions, such as attacking an enemy, healing an ally, or slaying a foe (which typically offers the most experience points). When a certain level is reached, the character levels up, and new skill points are awarded randomly to a character's attributes, such as the character's health, agility or strength. The more a character is used in battle, the more experience that character gains.<ref name=\"FEAmanual\"/><ref name=\"TechFE\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/fire-emblem-awakening-character-guide/|title=Fire Emblem: Awakening character guide|author=Concepcion, Miguel|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224075532/http://www.gamesradar.com/fire-emblem-awakening-character-guide/|archivedate=December 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GamaFE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=14|title=Game Design Essentials: 20 RPGs|author=Harris, John|website=[[Gamasutra]]|page=14|date=July 2, 2009|accessdate=July 18, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200544/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=14|archivedate=October 29, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA key element in combat since ''Genealogy of the Holy War'' is the Weapon Triangle, a system governing the strengths and weaknesses that certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]] fashion.

At this time, Marth and Roy from ''Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light'' and ''Sword of Seals'' appeared as playable characters in ''Super Smash Bros.

Due to its success overseas, it was decided to return the series to home consoles for ''Path of Radiance'' for the GameCube. Despite it arriving late in the GameCube's life cycle, it provided a late boost to sales, reaffirming Nintendo's faith in the series.<ref name=\"FEhistory\"/><ref name=\"RDinterview\"/> By 2010, the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next ''Fire Emblem'' failed to sell above 250,000 units, the series would be canceled.

On 9 May 2003 (the day after ''Major Fraud'' aired in the US as a special episode of ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime]]''), the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled ''The Final Answer'', which was credited with over 5 million viewers.\n\n=== Trial ===\nFollowing [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a trial]] at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]] lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), Ingram, his wife and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of \"[[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]\" on 7 April 2003.

Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram \u00a340,000 and Diana Ingram \u00a325,000.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken. During the trial, Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing throughout the episode, claiming he was too busy to notice.<ref name=\"scotsman\">{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/quizmaster-amazed-to-hear-163-1m-winner-could-have-cheated-1-598995 |title=Quizmaster 'amazed' to hear \u00a31m winner could have cheated |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=Karen |last=Mcveigh}}</ref>\n\n====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====\nLarry Whitehurst, another contestant who had appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts).

The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken.

They were strongly influenced by the [[Celtici]]. Those [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European tribes]], [[Celts|Celtic]] or pre-Celtic, founded the city of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] (then called [[Lacobriga|Lac\u00f3briga]]). The [[Phoenicia]]ns had established trading ports along the coast c. 1000 BC. Some sources claim that the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] founded Portus Hanibalis \u2013 known today as [[Portim\u00e3o]] \u2013 c. 550 BC. \n===Roman period===\nThe Algarve region came under Roman control after [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus (consul 142 BC)|Fabius Maximus Servilianus]] defeated the [[Lusitanians]] and the [[Turduli]] in the context of the [[Lusitanian War]], as was the case of much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which was absorbed into the [[Roman Republic]] in the second century BC. Cyneticum (in reference to the Cynetes who inhabited the region), as it was then called, became integrated into [[Hispania Ulterior]] and into [[Lusitania]] afterwards, being under Roman influence for around 600 years (from 200 BC till 410 AD), having thus adopted [[Latin]] as the official language, as well as Roman cultural, political, architectonic, religious and economic tenets. \n\nSeeing that during this time traveling through the land was dangerous, its geography meant that Cyneticum was of crucial importance as a passageway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, connecting countless Roman ports to several provinces, mainly in other parts of [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. This meant that the region experienced a great level of prosperity accrued through an expansion of its trading and commercial capabilities, mainly from the production and commercialization of olive oil and [[garum]], products very much sought after throughout the Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Viegas |first1=Catarina |title=A Ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o Romana do Algarve |date=2011 |publisher=CENTRO DE ARQUEOLOGIA DA UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA |isbn=978-989-95653-4-0 |page=39 |url=https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/9775/1/CViegas-2011.pdf |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> As [[Christianity]] rose in popularity, becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire under [[Constantine the Great]], Cyneticum, following the same tendency of the rest of the Roman provinces, made the transition from a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] society into a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] one. The region made a gradual changeover into Christianity, as Pagan and [[Animism|Animistic]] religions became obsolete under this new cultural influence. Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]], himself a native of the Iberian Peninsula, would come to prohibit Paganism in 381. The [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Roman Temple of Milreu]], originally dedicated to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], transformed later on into a Paleochristian temple, is an example of the religious changes that took place in this period.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Neto, Jo\u00e3o; Gordalina, Ros\u00e1rio |title=Ru\u00ednas de Est\u00f3i / Ru\u00ednas de Milreu |url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2883 |website=Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Patrim\u00f3nio Cultural |publisher=SIPA |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2003}}</ref> \n\nMany Roman ruins, both in the form of temples, [[Villa rustica|countryside villas]] (of which more than 30 were found in the Algarve), public baths, bridges, salting and fish-processing facilities and mosaics are widespread all over the region, notably in [[Vila do Bispo]], [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Portim\u00e3o]], [[Roman ruins of Cerro da Vila|Quarteira]], [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Faro]], [[Olh\u00e3o]], [[Balsa (Roman town)|Tavira]] and in other areas, illustrating the strong contributions that Roman culture as a whole made to the Algarve.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finding Rome on the Atlantic: an informal guide to some of the visible remains of Rome in Southern Portugal and Southwest Spain |url=https://www.algarvehistoryassociation.com/pt/iberian-history/58-finding-rome-on-the-atlantic |website=Algarve History Association |publisher=David Johnson |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cm-faro.pt/3366/milreu-roman-ruins.aspx|title=Milreu Roman Ruins|last=CM-FARO|website=www.cm-faro.pt|access-date=2017-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Villa de Milreu, os romanos no Algarve |url=https://ensina.rtp.pt/artigo/villa-de-milreu-os-romanos-no-algarve/ |website=RTP Ensina |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2015}}</ref>\n===Visigothic Kindgdom and Moorish Occupation===\n[[File:Capitel_Visig\u00f3tico_de_Pedra_-_Silves_-_22.10.2019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Visigothic [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] found in [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]]]\n[[File:Cidade de Silves12.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The city of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]], the first capital of the Algarve and an example of the noticeable Moorish influence in the region]]\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the [[Visigoths]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] originally from [[Scandinavia]] but who had spread into Eastern Europe, occupied the Iberian Peninsula around the year 500, having founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] as its capital, in 542. In 552, the Algarve was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and, in 571, [[Liuvigild]] managed to secure the region for the Visigothic Kingdom once again, which lasted until the year 711, and comprised most of the Iberian Peninsula and parts of modern France. Although already Christian as a whole, some of these Germanic peoples were still Pagan and thus brought Paganism back to the Iberian Peninsula, where it marginally co-existed with Christianity. The Visigoths reigned until the beginning of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] and, although not nearly as influential as the Romans, left some influence in the Algarve, both in words that were, after the Moorish Occupation, added to the lexicon, which are still present in modern-day [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as in local architecture. Several Visigothic [[Necropolis]] were found in the Algarve, suggesting that the presence was likely more significant than once believed.<ref>{{cite web |author1=M\u00e1rio Varela Gomes |title=A necr\u00f3pole visig\u00f3tica do Po\u00e7o dos Mouros (Silves) |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/media/uploads/revistaportuguesadearqueologia/5_2/13.pdf |publisher=Revista Portuguesa de Arqueologia.

Faro, which the Christian residents had called Santa Maria, was renamed Faraon, which means \"settlement of the knights\". Due to the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the region was called [[Gharb Al-Andalus]]: ''Gharb'' means \"the west\", while ''[[al-Andalus]]'' is the Arabic name for the Iberian Peninsula. For several years, the town of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]] was the capital of the region.\nIn the mid-13th century, during the [[Reconquista]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] took over the region in a series of successful military campaigns against the Moors. ''Al-Gharb'' became the [[Kingdom of the Algarve]], and the Moors were expelled. The Portuguese finally secured the region against subsequent Muslim attempts to recapture the area in the early 14th century. King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] started calling himself King of Portugal and the Algarve. After 1471, with the conquest of several territories in the [[Maghreb]] \u2013 the area considered an extension of the Algarve \u2013 [[Afonso V of Portugal]] began fashioning himself \"King of Portugal and the Algarves\", referring to the European and African possessions. The nearly 6 centuries-long Moorish rule over the Iberian Peninsula left strong linguistic, architectonic, gastronomical and artistic marks which are still strongly visible to this day in Portugal, most notably in the Algarve and Alentejo. Several fortifications like the [[Silves Castle]], [[Castle of Paderne]] and the [[Ribat of Arrifana]] still stand.\n\n===Modern times===\nPrior to the [[independence of Brazil]], \"[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]]\" (1815\u20131822) was an official designation for Portugal which also alluded to the Algarve. Portuguese monarchs continued to use this title until the proclamation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910. Between 1595 and 1808, the Algarve was a semiautonomous area of Portugal with its own governor, as well as a separate taxation system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n[[File:Muralha de Lagos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Castle of Lagos|walls]] of the ancient town of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]]]]\nIn the 15th century, Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] based himself near [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] and conducted various maritime expeditions which established the colonies that comprised the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Also from Lagos, [[Gil Eanes]] set sail in 1434 to become the first seafarer to round [[Cape Bojador]] in West Africa. The voyages of discovery brought Lagos fame and fortune. Trade flourished and Lagos became the capital of the historical province of Algarve in 1577 and remained so until the fabled [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. The earthquake damaged many areas in the Algarve and an accompanying [[tsunami]] destroyed or damaged coastal fortresses, while coastal towns and villages were heavily damaged except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]] lagoon. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. For many Portuguese coastal regions, including the Algarve, the destructive effects of the tsunami were more disastrous than those of the earthquake itself.\n\nIn 1807, while [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] led the first [[Napoleon]]ic invasion in the north of Portugal, the Algarve was occupied by Spanish troops under [[Manuel Godoy]]. Beginning in 1808, and after subsequent battles in various towns and villages, the region was the first to drive out the Spanish occupiers. During the [[Portuguese Civil War]], several battles took place in the region, especially the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|battle of Cape St. Vicente]] and the battle of Sant\u2019Ana, between liberals and Miguelites. [[Remexido]] was the guerrilla Algarvian leader who stood with the Miguelite absolutists for years, until he was executed in Faro in 1838.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.algarveprimeiro.com/d/remexido/200-33|title=Remexido|work=Algarve Primeiro|access-date=2017-02-27|language=pt-PT}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910 marked the end of the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve. The Algarve is a somewhat exotic region for the Portuguese, due to the Mediterranean climate, unique foods, architecture, and geographical location- many Portuguese traditionally spend their Summer break or own a holiday home in the Algarve.\n\n==Geography==\n{{wide image|Pano_Sendeanlage_auf_dem_Foia_Algarve.jpg|1500px|A panoramic view from the highest point F\u00f3ia of the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]}}\nThe Algarve covers 4997&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=dgt/> extending just south of the Tagus valley to the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Its highest point is [[F\u00f3ia (mountain)|F\u00f3ia]], {{convert|902|m|ft|abbr=on}}, in the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]. It also includes some islands and islets. The region is also the home of the [[Ria Formosa Lagoon]], a [[nature reserve]] of over 170&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a stopping place for hundreds of different species of birds. The length of the south-facing coastline is roughly 155&nbsp;km. Beyond the westernmost point of [[Cape St. Vincent]] it stretches a further 50&nbsp;km to the north. The coastline is notable for picturesque [[limestone]] caves and grottoes, particularly around Lagos, which are accessible by [[powerboat]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe maximum recorded temperatures in the Algarve fluctuate between {{convert|25|C|F}} in winter and {{convert|47|C|F}}{{cn|date=January 2019}} in summer, with the temperature rarely falling below freezing in the winter. The winter of 2008\u201309 was exceptionally cold and wet. Temperatures below {{convert|0|C|0|abbr=on}} were recorded in coastal areas for the first time in many years.\n\nGenerally, winter sees only subtle differences in daily maxima along the coastal Algarve, Tavira in the Eastern Algarve may see {{convert|16|-|17|C|F}}, Faro and Quarteira in the central Algarve broadly similar values, whist Sagres and the peninsula in the extreme west experiences more frontal activity off storms in the Atlantic and generally {{convert|15|C|F}} is the maximum daytime temperature. Conversely, overnight lows are higher in Sagres, at {{convert|9|C|F}}, whilst to the East {{convert|7|-|8|C|F}} is more common.\n\nSummer sees the highest average coastal temperatures in Faro and most points east, maxima around {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}}, whilst points west of Faro to about Lagos are in the range {{convert|27|-|29|C|F}}. The peninsula and Sagres see the coolest of the summer temperatures, being prone to the cooler North Westerly winds that topple round the Azores high so here we see {{convert|24|-|26|C|F}} more typically. Overnight lows are in the region of {{convert|17|-|19|C|F}} the higher values in Faro and to the east. \n\nYear to year, there can be considerable differences in the sea surface temperatures off the Algarve during the summer/early Autumn. In recent years, the sea temperatures have struggled to exceed {{convert|18|-|19|C|F}} till later in August, then weather conditions have encouraged a warm outflow from the Mediterranean, temporarily bathing the Algarve in warm surface water and sea temperatures can rise, very rapidly over a week or so, to {{convert|25|C|F}} and only slowly drop away during October. This warm plume of water can add some noticeable humidity to an otherwise very comfortable summer feel, temperature-wise. \n\nInland Algarve sees higher daytime temperatures than the coast, typically {{convert|31|-|33|C|F}} whilst overnight temperatures drop away to {{convert|16|-|18|C|F}}. Heatwaves can occasionally push the mercury to {{convert|45|C|F}} and at this intensity, overnight lows can remain uncomfortably high at over {{convert|25|C|F}}.\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Faro\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 21.9\n|Feb record high C = 24.7\n|Mar record high C = 28.9\n|Apr record high C = 30.1\n|May record high C = 33.6\n|Jun record high C = 37.1\n|Jul record high C = 44.3\n|Aug record high C = 39.6\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 33.3\n|Nov record high C = 28.6\n|Dec record high C = 24.0\n|year record high C = 44.3\n|Jan high C = 16.1\n|Feb high C = 16.9\n|Mar high C = 19.1\n|Apr high C = 20.4\n|May high C = 22.8\n|Jun high C = 26.4\n|Jul high C = 29.2\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.6\n|Oct high C = 23.2\n|Nov high C = 19.6\n|Dec high C = 17.0\n|year high C = 22.2\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.8\n|Mar mean C = 14.8\n|Apr mean C = 16.1\n|May mean C = 18.4\n|Jun mean C = 21.9\n|Jul mean C = 24.2\n|Aug mean C = 24.1\n|Sep mean C = 22.3\n|Oct mean C = 19.3\n|Nov mean C = 15.7\n|Dec mean C = 13.3\n|year mean C = 17.9\n|Jan low C = 7.9\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.5\n|Apr low C = 11.8\n|May low C = 14.0\n|Jun low C = 17.3\n|Jul low C = 19.1\n|Aug low C = 19.4\n|Sep low C = 18.0\n|Oct low C = 15.3\n|Nov low C = 11.7\n|Dec low C = 9.6\n|year low C = 13.6\n|Jan record low C = -1.2\n|Feb record low C = -1.2\n|Mar record low C = 2.3\n|Apr record low C = 3.6\n|May record low C = 6.7\n|Jun record low C = 8.0\n|Jul record low C = 11.9\n|Aug record low C = 13.1\n|Sep record low C = 9.9\n|Oct record low C = 7.8\n|Nov record low C = 2.7\n|Dec record low C = 1.2\n|year record low C = -1.2\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 59.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 52.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 39.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 38.6\n|May precipitation mm = 21.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 1.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 3.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 23.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 60.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 90.4\n|Dec precipitation mm = 114.1\n|year precipitation mm = 508.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 10\n|May precipitation days = 7\n|Jun precipitation days = 4\n|Jul precipitation days = 1\n|Aug precipitation days = 1\n|Sep precipitation days = 3\n|Oct precipitation days = 9\n|Nov precipitation days = 10\n|Dec precipitation days = 11\n|Jan sun = 170.5\n|Feb sun = 165.2\n|Mar sun = 232.5\n|Apr sun = 252.0\n|May sun = 313.1\n|Jun sun = 333.0\n|Jul sun = 368.9\n|Aug sun = 353.4\n|Sep sun = 273.0\n|Oct sun = 226.3\n|Nov sun = 183.0\n|Dec sun = 167.4\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = [[Instituto de Meteorologia]],<ref>[http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/008/ Faro] \u2013 Instituto de Meteorologia, 1981\u20132010 (provis\u00f3rias)</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name=weather>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/003/c00004.htm  |title=Monthly Averages for Faro, Portugal |publisher= World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> <small>(precipitation days)</small>, [[Hong Kong Observatory]]<ref>[http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/europe/sp_po/faro_e.htm \"Climatological Information for Faro, Portugal\"] Hong Kong Observatory.

Horticulture is important and the region's landscape is known for the large areas of land covered with plastic [[greenhouse]]s which are used to that end. [[Fishing in Portugal|Fishing]] and [[aquaculture]] are important activities in the coastal area of the Algarve, with [[sardine]]s, [[Sole (fish)|soles]], [[cyprinids]], [[gilt-head bream]], and various seafood, including the [[grooved carpet shell]], being the major products. The Algarve's wines are also renowned. Four wines in the region have [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (''[[Denomina\u00e7\u00e3o de Origem Controlada]]'' \u2013 DOC): [[Lagoa DOC]], [[Lagos DOC]], [[Portim\u00e3o DOC]], and [[Tavira DOC]]. [[Food processing]], cement and construction are the main industries. Tourism-related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve's economy during summer. The Algarve's economy has always been closely linked to the sea, and fishing has been an important activity since ancient times. Only since the 1960s has the region embraced tourism, which has become its most important economic activity. With the increase in life quality and purchasing power, many shopping malls have been constructed, mostly in the past 15\u201320 years. Recently,{{when|date=September 2018}} an [[Ikea]] opened in [[Loul\u00e9]], one of five in Portugal.\n\nIn 2017, the Algarve was the Portuguese region that experienced the biggest economic growth, an increase of 4.6% of its GDP.<ref>{{cite news|title=Contributo do Algarve para o PIB Nacional pode chegar aos 4,6% em 2017|url=http://www.sulinformacao.pt/2017/12/contributo-do-algarve-para-o-pib-nacional-pode-chegar-aos-46-em-2017/|accessdate=26 February 2018|agency=Sul Informa\u00e7\u00e3o|publisher=Sul Informa\u00e7\u00e3o}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe Algarve has been experiencing a strong development since the beginning of the 1960s, initially due to the need to accommodate its foreign visitors. The region started the construction of better [[infrastructure]], mainly [[roads]], [[sanitation]], [[power grids]], [[telecommunications]], [[hospitals]], and [[House|housing]]. Due to the austerity measures introduced in 2011, tolls were placed on the main motorway that crosses the region to offset the expense of its maintenance. Private investors, with the support of [[municipalities]], also began the construction of a variety of [[hotels]], [[resorts]], [[golf courses]] (which are considered to be some of the best in Europe), and [[villa]]s. All this led to a large [[Economic development|development]] in the region, especially for the locals, who had previously lived in harsher circumstances. Today, the Algarve is amongst the regions in Portugal with the best [[quality of life]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Tourism===\nIn the 1960s, the Algarve became a popular destination for tourists, mainly from the United Kingdom. It has since become a common destination for people from Germany, the Netherlands, and Ireland. Many of these tourists own their own property in the region. Algarve-based [[publications]] and newspapers are written in English specifically for this community. In recent years, the Algarve has seen a high increase in tourists from [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[Italy]], followed by [[Canadians]], [[Americans]], and [[Australians]]. Portuguese people from other parts of the country also visit the region in large numbers, especially in the peak of the summer (July and August).\n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o, one of many sites that attract tourists]]\nTourist attractions in the region include its beaches, [[Climate of Portugal|Mediterranean climate]], [[Crime in Portugal|safety]], [[Portuguese cuisine|cuisine]], and relatively low prices. Well-known beaches in the Algarve include [[Praia da Marinha|Marinha Beach]], [[Praia da Rocha]] and [[Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara]]. A well-known [[spa town]] is [[Caldas de Monchique]]. In addition to its natural features and beaches, the Algarve has invested in the creation of a network of golf courses.\n\nThe Algarve is also popular for religious tourism, notably pilgrimages to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Piety (best known as the Sovereign Mother), a Marian shrine dedicated to the patron saint of [[Loul\u00e9]], that attract thousands of pilgrims of the Catholic faith to the city, or with the international pilgrimages to the site of the apparitions of Our Lady Mother of Goodness occurred near [[S\u00e3o Marcos da Serra]].\n\n[[File:Festa da Nossa Senhora 2012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The procession of the Sovereign Mother (Our Lady of Piety) attracts thousands of pilgrims to the Marian shrine of [[Loul\u00e9 Municipality|Loul\u00e9]], in the Algarve.]]\nThe Algarve's mild climate has attracted interest from Northern Europeans wishing to have a holiday home or residence in the region.

A large number of seasonal job opportunities are tourism-related and are fulfilled by thousands of locals and immigrants. Due to its seasonal nature, most of the economy relies on the good weather available mostly for only about 5\u20136 months (characterised by a prolonged lack of rain and temperatures above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C throughout the day), meaning that many Algarvians go unemployed during the low season. Nonetheless, due to the very high monetary income that the high season brings, most people in the Algarve are still able to have comfortable lives even while unemployed. In March 2007, the Portuguese economic minister, Manuel Pinho, announced the creation of the \"Allgarve\" brand, as a part of a strategic promotion of the Algarve as a tourism destination for foreign citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/|title=Correio da Manh\u00e3: Portugal, Mundo, Sociedade, Cultura.

They were strongly influenced by the [[Celtici]]. Those [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European tribes]], [[Celts|Celtic]] or pre-Celtic, founded the city of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] (then called [[Lacobriga|Lac\u00f3briga]]). The [[Phoenicia]]ns had established trading ports along the coast c. 1000 BC. Some sources claim that the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] founded Portus Hanibalis \u2013 known today as [[Portim\u00e3o]] \u2013 c. 550 BC. \n===Roman period===\nThe Algarve region came under Roman control after [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus (consul 142 BC)|Fabius Maximus Servilianus]] defeated the [[Lusitanians]] and the [[Turduli]] in the context of the [[Lusitanian War]], as was the case of much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which was absorbed into the [[Roman Republic]] in the second century BC. Cyneticum (in reference to the Cynetes who inhabited the region), as it was then called, became integrated into [[Hispania Ulterior]] and into [[Lusitania]] afterwards, being under Roman influence for around 600 years (from 200 BC till 410 AD), having thus adopted [[Latin]] as the official language, as well as Roman cultural, political, architectonic, religious and economic tenets. \n\nSeeing that during this time traveling through the land was dangerous, its geography meant that Cyneticum was of crucial importance as a passageway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, connecting countless Roman ports to several provinces, mainly in other parts of [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. This meant that the region experienced a great level of prosperity accrued through an expansion of its trading and commercial capabilities, mainly from the production and commercialization of olive oil and [[garum]], products very much sought after throughout the Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Viegas |first1=Catarina |title=A Ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o Romana do Algarve |date=2011 |publisher=CENTRO DE ARQUEOLOGIA DA UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA |isbn=978-989-95653-4-0 |page=39 |url=https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/9775/1/CViegas-2011.pdf |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> As [[Christianity]] rose in popularity, becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire under [[Constantine the Great]], Cyneticum, following the same tendency of the rest of the Roman provinces, made the transition from a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] society into a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] one. The region made a gradual changeover into Christianity, as Pagan and [[Animism|Animistic]] religions became obsolete under this new cultural influence. Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]], himself a native of the Iberian Peninsula, would come to prohibit Paganism in 381. The [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Roman Temple of Milreu]], originally dedicated to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], transformed later on into a Paleochristian temple, is an example of the religious changes that took place in this period.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Neto, Jo\u00e3o; Gordalina, Ros\u00e1rio |title=Ru\u00ednas de Est\u00f3i / Ru\u00ednas de Milreu |url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2883 |website=Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Patrim\u00f3nio Cultural |publisher=SIPA |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2003}}</ref> \n\nMany Roman ruins, both in the form of temples, [[Villa rustica|countryside villas]] (of which more than 30 were found in the Algarve), public baths, bridges, salting and fish-processing facilities and mosaics are widespread all over the region, notably in [[Vila do Bispo]], [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Portim\u00e3o]], [[Roman ruins of Cerro da Vila|Quarteira]], [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Faro]], [[Olh\u00e3o]], [[Balsa (Roman town)|Tavira]] and in other areas, illustrating the strong contributions that Roman culture as a whole made to the Algarve.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finding Rome on the Atlantic: an informal guide to some of the visible remains of Rome in Southern Portugal and Southwest Spain |url=https://www.algarvehistoryassociation.com/pt/iberian-history/58-finding-rome-on-the-atlantic |website=Algarve History Association |publisher=David Johnson |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cm-faro.pt/3366/milreu-roman-ruins.aspx|title=Milreu Roman Ruins|last=CM-FARO|website=www.cm-faro.pt|access-date=2017-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Villa de Milreu, os romanos no Algarve |url=https://ensina.rtp.pt/artigo/villa-de-milreu-os-romanos-no-algarve/ |website=RTP Ensina |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2015}}</ref>\n===Visigothic Kindgdom and Moorish Occupation===\n[[File:Capitel_Visig\u00f3tico_de_Pedra_-_Silves_-_22.10.2019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Visigothic [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] found in [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]]]\n[[File:Cidade de Silves12.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The city of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]], the first capital of the Algarve and an example of the noticeable Moorish influence in the region]]\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the [[Visigoths]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] originally from [[Scandinavia]] but who had spread into Eastern Europe, occupied the Iberian Peninsula around the year 500, having founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] as its capital, in 542. In 552, the Algarve was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and, in 571, [[Liuvigild]] managed to secure the region for the Visigothic Kingdom once again, which lasted until the year 711, and comprised most of the Iberian Peninsula and parts of modern France. Although already Christian as a whole, some of these Germanic peoples were still Pagan and thus brought Paganism back to the Iberian Peninsula, where it marginally co-existed with Christianity. The Visigoths reigned until the beginning of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] and, although not nearly as influential as the Romans, left some influence in the Algarve, both in words that were, after the Moorish Occupation, added to the lexicon, which are still present in modern-day [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as in local architecture. Several Visigothic [[Necropolis]] were found in the Algarve, suggesting that the presence was likely more significant than once believed.<ref>{{cite web |author1=M\u00e1rio Varela Gomes |title=A necr\u00f3pole visig\u00f3tica do Po\u00e7o dos Mouros (Silves) |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/media/uploads/revistaportuguesadearqueologia/5_2/13.pdf |publisher=Revista Portuguesa de Arqueologia.

Faro, which the Christian residents had called Santa Maria, was renamed Faraon, which means \"settlement of the knights\". Due to the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the region was called [[Gharb Al-Andalus]]: ''Gharb'' means \"the west\", while ''[[al-Andalus]]'' is the Arabic name for the Iberian Peninsula. For several years, the town of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]] was the capital of the region.\nIn the mid-13th century, during the [[Reconquista]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] took over the region in a series of successful military campaigns against the Moors. ''Al-Gharb'' became the [[Kingdom of the Algarve]], and the Moors were expelled. The Portuguese finally secured the region against subsequent Muslim attempts to recapture the area in the early 14th century. King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] started calling himself King of Portugal and the Algarve. After 1471, with the conquest of several territories in the [[Maghreb]] \u2013 the area considered an extension of the Algarve \u2013 [[Afonso V of Portugal]] began fashioning himself \"King of Portugal and the Algarves\", referring to the European and African possessions. The nearly 6 centuries-long Moorish rule over the Iberian Peninsula left strong linguistic, architectonic, gastronomical and artistic marks which are still strongly visible to this day in Portugal, most notably in the Algarve and Alentejo. Several fortifications like the [[Silves Castle]], [[Castle of Paderne]] and the [[Ribat of Arrifana]] still stand.\n\n===Modern times===\nPrior to the [[independence of Brazil]], \"[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]]\" (1815\u20131822) was an official designation for Portugal which also alluded to the Algarve. Portuguese monarchs continued to use this title until the proclamation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910. Between 1595 and 1808, the Algarve was a semiautonomous area of Portugal with its own governor, as well as a separate taxation system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n[[File:Muralha de Lagos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Castle of Lagos|walls]] of the ancient town of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]]]]\nIn the 15th century, Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] based himself near [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] and conducted various maritime expeditions which established the colonies that comprised the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Also from Lagos, [[Gil Eanes]] set sail in 1434 to become the first seafarer to round [[Cape Bojador]] in West Africa. The voyages of discovery brought Lagos fame and fortune. Trade flourished and Lagos became the capital of the historical province of Algarve in 1577 and remained so until the fabled [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. The earthquake damaged many areas in the Algarve and an accompanying [[tsunami]] destroyed or damaged coastal fortresses, while coastal towns and villages were heavily damaged except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]] lagoon. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. For many Portuguese coastal regions, including the Algarve, the destructive effects of the tsunami were more disastrous than those of the earthquake itself.\n\nIn 1807, while [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] led the first [[Napoleon]]ic invasion in the north of Portugal, the Algarve was occupied by Spanish troops under [[Manuel Godoy]]. Beginning in 1808, and after subsequent battles in various towns and villages, the region was the first to drive out the Spanish occupiers. During the [[Portuguese Civil War]], several battles took place in the region, especially the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|battle of Cape St. Vicente]] and the battle of Sant\u2019Ana, between liberals and Miguelites. [[Remexido]] was the guerrilla Algarvian leader who stood with the Miguelite absolutists for years, until he was executed in Faro in 1838.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.algarveprimeiro.com/d/remexido/200-33|title=Remexido|work=Algarve Primeiro|access-date=2017-02-27|language=pt-PT}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910 marked the end of the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve. The Algarve is a somewhat exotic region for the Portuguese, due to the Mediterranean climate, unique foods, architecture, and geographical location- many Portuguese traditionally spend their Summer break or own a holiday home in the Algarve.\n\n==Geography==\n{{wide image|Pano_Sendeanlage_auf_dem_Foia_Algarve.jpg|1500px|A panoramic view from the highest point F\u00f3ia of the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]}}\nThe Algarve covers 4997&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=dgt/> extending just south of the Tagus valley to the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Its highest point is [[F\u00f3ia (mountain)|F\u00f3ia]], {{convert|902|m|ft|abbr=on}}, in the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]. It also includes some islands and islets. The region is also the home of the [[Ria Formosa Lagoon]], a [[nature reserve]] of over 170&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a stopping place for hundreds of different species of birds. The length of the south-facing coastline is roughly 155&nbsp;km. Beyond the westernmost point of [[Cape St. Vincent]] it stretches a further 50&nbsp;km to the north. The coastline is notable for picturesque [[limestone]] caves and grottoes, particularly around Lagos, which are accessible by [[powerboat]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe maximum recorded temperatures in the Algarve fluctuate between {{convert|25|C|F}} in winter and {{convert|47|C|F}}{{cn|date=January 2019}} in summer, with the temperature rarely falling below freezing in the winter. The winter of 2008\u201309 was exceptionally cold and wet. Temperatures below {{convert|0|C|0|abbr=on}} were recorded in coastal areas for the first time in many years.\n\nGenerally, winter sees only subtle differences in daily maxima along the coastal Algarve, Tavira in the Eastern Algarve may see {{convert|16|-|17|C|F}}, Faro and Quarteira in the central Algarve broadly similar values, whist Sagres and the peninsula in the extreme west experiences more frontal activity off storms in the Atlantic and generally {{convert|15|C|F}} is the maximum daytime temperature. Conversely, overnight lows are higher in Sagres, at {{convert|9|C|F}}, whilst to the East {{convert|7|-|8|C|F}} is more common.\n\nSummer sees the highest average coastal temperatures in Faro and most points east, maxima around {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}}, whilst points west of Faro to about Lagos are in the range {{convert|27|-|29|C|F}}. The peninsula and Sagres see the coolest of the summer temperatures, being prone to the cooler North Westerly winds that topple round the Azores high so here we see {{convert|24|-|26|C|F}} more typically. Overnight lows are in the region of {{convert|17|-|19|C|F}} the higher values in Faro and to the east. \n\nYear to year, there can be considerable differences in the sea surface temperatures off the Algarve during the summer/early Autumn. In recent years, the sea temperatures have struggled to exceed {{convert|18|-|19|C|F}} till later in August, then weather conditions have encouraged a warm outflow from the Mediterranean, temporarily bathing the Algarve in warm surface water and sea temperatures can rise, very rapidly over a week or so, to {{convert|25|C|F}} and only slowly drop away during October. This warm plume of water can add some noticeable humidity to an otherwise very comfortable summer feel, temperature-wise. \n\nInland Algarve sees higher daytime temperatures than the coast, typically {{convert|31|-|33|C|F}} whilst overnight temperatures drop away to {{convert|16|-|18|C|F}}. Heatwaves can occasionally push the mercury to {{convert|45|C|F}} and at this intensity, overnight lows can remain uncomfortably high at over {{convert|25|C|F}}.\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Faro\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 21.9\n|Feb record high C = 24.7\n|Mar record high C = 28.9\n|Apr record high C = 30.1\n|May record high C = 33.6\n|Jun record high C = 37.1\n|Jul record high C = 44.3\n|Aug record high C = 39.6\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 33.3\n|Nov record high C = 28.6\n|Dec record high C = 24.0\n|year record high C = 44.3\n|Jan high C = 16.1\n|Feb high C = 16.9\n|Mar high C = 19.1\n|Apr high C = 20.4\n|May high C = 22.8\n|Jun high C = 26.4\n|Jul high C = 29.2\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.6\n|Oct high C = 23.2\n|Nov high C = 19.6\n|Dec high C = 17.0\n|year high C = 22.2\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.8\n|Mar mean C = 14.8\n|Apr mean C = 16.1\n|May mean C = 18.4\n|Jun mean C = 21.9\n|Jul mean C = 24.2\n|Aug mean C = 24.1\n|Sep mean C = 22.3\n|Oct mean C = 19.3\n|Nov mean C = 15.7\n|Dec mean C = 13.3\n|year mean C = 17.9\n|Jan low C = 7.9\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.5\n|Apr low C = 11.8\n|May low C = 14.0\n|Jun low C = 17.3\n|Jul low C = 19.1\n|Aug low C = 19.4\n|Sep low C = 18.0\n|Oct low C = 15.3\n|Nov low C = 11.7\n|Dec low C = 9.6\n|year low C = 13.6\n|Jan record low C = -1.2\n|Feb record low C = -1.2\n|Mar record low C = 2.3\n|Apr record low C = 3.6\n|May record low C = 6.7\n|Jun record low C = 8.0\n|Jul record low C = 11.9\n|Aug record low C = 13.1\n|Sep record low C = 9.9\n|Oct record low C = 7.8\n|Nov record low C = 2.7\n|Dec record low C = 1.2\n|year record low C = -1.2\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 59.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 52.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 39.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 38.6\n|May precipitation mm = 21.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 1.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 3.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 23.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 60.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 90.4\n|Dec precipitation mm = 114.1\n|year precipitation mm = 508.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 10\n|May precipitation days = 7\n|Jun precipitation days = 4\n|Jul precipitation days = 1\n|Aug precipitation days = 1\n|Sep precipitation days = 3\n|Oct precipitation days = 9\n|Nov precipitation days = 10\n|Dec precipitation days = 11\n|Jan sun = 170.5\n|Feb sun = 165.2\n|Mar sun = 232.5\n|Apr sun = 252.0\n|May sun = 313.1\n|Jun sun = 333.0\n|Jul sun = 368.9\n|Aug sun = 353.4\n|Sep sun = 273.0\n|Oct sun = 226.3\n|Nov sun = 183.0\n|Dec sun = 167.4\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = [[Instituto de Meteorologia]],<ref>[http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/008/ Faro] \u2013 Instituto de Meteorologia, 1981\u20132010 (provis\u00f3rias)</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name=weather>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/003/c00004.htm  |title=Monthly Averages for Faro, Portugal |publisher= World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> <small>(precipitation days)</small>, [[Hong Kong Observatory]]<ref>[http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/europe/sp_po/faro_e.htm \"Climatological Information for Faro, Portugal\"] Hong Kong Observatory.

Horticulture is important and the region's landscape is known for the large areas of land covered with plastic [[greenhouse]]s which are used to that end. [[Fishing in Portugal|Fishing]] and [[aquaculture]] are important activities in the coastal area of the Algarve, with [[sardine]]s, [[Sole (fish)|soles]], [[cyprinids]], [[gilt-head bream]], and various seafood, including the [[grooved carpet shell]], being the major products. The Algarve's wines are also renowned. Four wines in the region have [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (''[[Denomina\u00e7\u00e3o de Origem Controlada]]'' \u2013 DOC): [[Lagoa DOC]], [[Lagos DOC]], [[Portim\u00e3o DOC]], and [[Tavira DOC]]. [[Food processing]], cement and construction are the main industries. Tourism-related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve's economy during summer. The Algarve's economy has always been closely linked to the sea, and fishing has been an important activity since ancient times. Only since the 1960s has the region embraced tourism, which has become its most important economic activity. With the increase in life quality and purchasing power, many shopping malls have been constructed, mostly in the past 15\u201320 years. Recently,{{when|date=September 2018}} an [[Ikea]] opened in [[Loul\u00e9]], one of five in Portugal.\n\nIn 2017, the Algarve was the Portuguese region that experienced the biggest economic growth, an increase of 4.6% of its GDP.<ref>{{cite news|title=Contributo do Algarve para o PIB Nacional pode chegar aos 4,6% em 2017|url=http://www.sulinformacao.pt/2017/12/contributo-do-algarve-para-o-pib-nacional-pode-chegar-aos-46-em-2017/|accessdate=26 February 2018|agency=Sul Informa\u00e7\u00e3o|publisher=Sul Informa\u00e7\u00e3o}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe Algarve has been experiencing a strong development since the beginning of the 1960s, initially due to the need to accommodate its foreign visitors. The region started the construction of better [[infrastructure]], mainly [[roads]], [[sanitation]], [[power grids]], [[telecommunications]], [[hospitals]], and [[House|housing]]. Due to the austerity measures introduced in 2011, tolls were placed on the main motorway that crosses the region to offset the expense of its maintenance. Private investors, with the support of [[municipalities]], also began the construction of a variety of [[hotels]], [[resorts]], [[golf courses]] (which are considered to be some of the best in Europe), and [[villa]]s. All this led to a large [[Economic development|development]] in the region, especially for the locals, who had previously lived in harsher circumstances. Today, the Algarve is amongst the regions in Portugal with the best [[quality of life]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Tourism===\nIn the 1960s, the Algarve became a popular destination for tourists, mainly from the United Kingdom. It has since become a common destination for people from Germany, the Netherlands, and Ireland. Many of these tourists own their own property in the region. Algarve-based [[publications]] and newspapers are written in English specifically for this community. In recent years, the Algarve has seen a high increase in tourists from [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[Italy]], followed by [[Canadians]], [[Americans]], and [[Australians]]. Portuguese people from other parts of the country also visit the region in large numbers, especially in the peak of the summer (July and August).\n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o, one of many sites that attract tourists]]\nTourist attractions in the region include its beaches, [[Climate of Portugal|Mediterranean climate]], [[Crime in Portugal|safety]], [[Portuguese cuisine|cuisine]], and relatively low prices. Well-known beaches in the Algarve include [[Praia da Marinha|Marinha Beach]], [[Praia da Rocha]] and [[Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara]]. A well-known [[spa town]] is [[Caldas de Monchique]]. In addition to its natural features and beaches, the Algarve has invested in the creation of a network of golf courses.\n\nThe Algarve is also popular for religious tourism, notably pilgrimages to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Piety (best known as the Sovereign Mother), a Marian shrine dedicated to the patron saint of [[Loul\u00e9]], that attract thousands of pilgrims of the Catholic faith to the city, or with the international pilgrimages to the site of the apparitions of Our Lady Mother of Goodness occurred near [[S\u00e3o Marcos da Serra]].\n\n[[File:Festa da Nossa Senhora 2012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The procession of the Sovereign Mother (Our Lady of Piety) attracts thousands of pilgrims to the Marian shrine of [[Loul\u00e9 Municipality|Loul\u00e9]], in the Algarve.]]\nThe Algarve's mild climate has attracted interest from Northern Europeans wishing to have a holiday home or residence in the region.

A large number of seasonal job opportunities are tourism-related and are fulfilled by thousands of locals and immigrants. Due to its seasonal nature, most of the economy relies on the good weather available mostly for only about 5\u20136 months (characterised by a prolonged lack of rain and temperatures above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C throughout the day), meaning that many Algarvians go unemployed during the low season. Nonetheless, due to the very high monetary income that the high season brings, most people in the Algarve are still able to have comfortable lives even while unemployed. In March 2007, the Portuguese economic minister, Manuel Pinho, announced the creation of the \"Allgarve\" brand, as a part of a strategic promotion of the Algarve as a tourism destination for foreign citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/|title=Correio da Manh\u00e3: Portugal, Mundo, Sociedade, Cultura.

The first settler is believed to have been Will Butter, Richard Harnden or Abraham Jaquith. Butter was brought to Woburn as an indentured captive. Once he attained his freedom, he fled to the opposite side of a large swamp, in what is now Wilmington. Harnden settled in Reading, in an area that is now part of Wilmington. Jaquith settled in an area of Billerica that became part of Wilmington in 1740.\n\n[[Minutemen]] from Wilmington responded to the alarm on April 19, 1775 and fought at Merriam's Corner in [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Concord]].\n\nThe [[Middlesex Canal]] passed through Wilmington. Chartered in 1792, opened in 1803, it provided freight and passenger transport between the [[Merrimack River]] and Boston. One important cargo on the canal was hops. From the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century, Massachusetts was the acknowledged leader in hop production in North America. Middlesex County in particular was famous for its hop yards, and Wilmington was the first place where the culture grew to a fever pitch.<ref>Tomlan, Michael, \"Tinged with Gold: Hop Culture in the U.S.\" Univ. of Georgia, 1992.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] was built in the 1820s, the canal became a primary means of transporting cotton to and from the mills. It was abandoned in 1852 after the construction of the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]].\n\nThe Boston and Lowell Railroad was built in 1835. The line is now the oldest operating rail line in the U.S. Wilmington is also served by the Haverhill Division (the old [[Boston and Maine Railroad|B&M]] Portland Division). A spur track known as the [[Wildcat Branch|Wildcat]] connects the Haverhill and Lowell divisions, following the path of the old Wilmington & Andover Railroad, the corporate ancestor of the Boston & Maine.\n\nWilmington is where the [[Baldwin apple]] was discovered.\n\nWilmington is also home to the Col. Joshua Harnden Tavern, which probably served as a stop on the [[underground railroad]] and now houses the Wilmington Town [[Museum]].\n\nSince World War II,  Wilmington's population has quadrupled. [[Interstate 93]], [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]], [[Route 129]] and [[Route 38]] run through town, and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] is about a mile south of Wilmington.\n\n==Geography==\nWilmington is located at {{Coord|42|33|N|71|10|W|type:city}} (42.560, \u221271.170).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|17.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|17.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.46%, is water.\n\nWilmington borders the towns of [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[North Reading, Massachusetts|North Reading]], [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]], [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]], [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], and [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]].\n\nMuch of Wilmington was built on or still is [[wetlands]].

The first settler is believed to have been Will Butter, Richard Harnden or Abraham Jaquith. Butter was brought to Woburn as an indentured captive. Once he attained his freedom, he fled to the opposite side of a large swamp, in what is now Wilmington. Harnden settled in Reading, in an area that is now part of Wilmington. Jaquith settled in an area of Billerica that became part of Wilmington in 1740.\n\n[[Minutemen]] from Wilmington responded to the alarm on April 19, 1775 and fought at Merriam's Corner in [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Concord]].\n\nThe [[Middlesex Canal]] passed through Wilmington. Chartered in 1792, opened in 1803, it provided freight and passenger transport between the [[Merrimack River]] and Boston. One important cargo on the canal was hops. From the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century, Massachusetts was the acknowledged leader in hop production in North America. Middlesex County in particular was famous for its hop yards, and Wilmington was the first place where the culture grew to a fever pitch.<ref>Tomlan, Michael, \"Tinged with Gold: Hop Culture in the U.S.\" Univ. of Georgia, 1992.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] was built in the 1820s, the canal became a primary means of transporting cotton to and from the mills. It was abandoned in 1852 after the construction of the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]].\n\nThe Boston and Lowell Railroad was built in 1835. The line is now the oldest operating rail line in the U.S. Wilmington is also served by the Haverhill Division (the old [[Boston and Maine Railroad|B&M]] Portland Division). A spur track known as the [[Wildcat Branch|Wildcat]] connects the Haverhill and Lowell divisions, following the path of the old Wilmington & Andover Railroad, the corporate ancestor of the Boston & Maine.\n\nWilmington is where the [[Baldwin apple]] was discovered.\n\nWilmington is also home to the Col. Joshua Harnden Tavern, which probably served as a stop on the [[underground railroad]] and now houses the Wilmington Town [[Museum]].\n\nSince World War II,  Wilmington's population has quadrupled. [[Interstate 93]], [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]], [[Route 129]] and [[Route 38]] run through town, and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] is about a mile south of Wilmington.\n\n==Geography==\nWilmington is located at {{Coord|42|33|N|71|10|W|type:city}} (42.560, \u221271.170).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|17.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|17.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.46%, is water.\n\nWilmington borders the towns of [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[North Reading, Massachusetts|North Reading]], [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]], [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]], [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], and [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]].\n\nMuch of Wilmington was built on or still is [[wetlands]].

It is a [[greatest hits]] double album: CD 1 is primarily a collection of Carey's hits from 1990 to 1995, while CD 2 is primarily a collection of hits from 1996 to 2000. In 2011, the album was re-issued outside the US with the same track listing, under the title of ''[[The Essential Mariah Carey]]''.\n\n==Content==\nCarey had previously released the compilation album ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), but the release of her ''Greatest Hits'' album was a contractual agreement beyond her control, since she had left Columbia Records and had moved on to [[Virgin Records]]. The album had little creative input from Carey and there are no personal messages within its liner notes, unlike ''#1's''. All tracks from the previous album, with the exception of \"Whenever You Call\" with [[Brian McKnight]], and the ''#1's'' non-U.S. bonus track \"[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]\" are included on LP.\n''Greatest Hits''. Tracks that weren't included on ''#1's'' are:\n*the U.S. top five hits \"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]]\" (1991), \"[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]]\" (1992) and \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\" (1994), and the top twenty hit \"[[Anytime You Need a Friend]]\" (1994);\n*the radio airplay-only tracks \"[[Forever (Mariah Carey song)|Forever]]\" (1996), \"[[Underneath the Stars (song)|Underneath the Stars]]\" (1996), and \"[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey song)|Butterfly]]\" (1997);\n*\"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]\" (1999) and \"[[Thank God I Found You]]\" (2000), the two singles from Carey's ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'' album that went to number 1 following the release of ''#1's'', as well as \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]\" (2000), another track from ''Rainbow'';\n*\"[[Endless Love (song)#Luther Vandross and Mariah Carey version|Endless Love]]\" (1994), a top five duet with [[Luther Vandross]], which had not been previously included on any Carey album;\n*the So So Def remix of \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\" (2000) featuring [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]], which had only been included on the Japanese re-release of the single in 2000.\n\nMost non-U.S. versions of ''Greatest Hits'' retain the track listing as listed below with the addition of \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)#Mariah Carey and Westlife version|Against All Odds]]\" (2000), a duet with [[Westlife]]. The Japanese version contains \"Against All Odds\", \"[[Open Arms (Journey song)#Mariah Carey version|Open Arms]]\" (1996), the non-single album track \"Music Box\" from the album ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), and the ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' album version of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\"; it is also the only album to include the \"[[Never Too Far/Hero Medley]]\" (2001) single. Unlike most non-U.S. versions of the ''Greatest Hits'' album, the So So Def Remix of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was not included on the original UK edition but on the album's 2005 re-release.\n\n==Commercial  performance==\nAs of November 2018, ''Greatest Hits'' has sold 1,230,000 copies in the US.<ref name=\"USsales\">{{cite

Magazine}}</ref>\n}}<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\n\n'''''Greatest Hits''''' is the second [[greatest hits album]] by American singer and songwriter [[Mariah Carey]], released in the United States on December 4, 2001 by [[Columbia Records]]. It is a [[greatest hits]] double album: CD 1 is primarily a collection of Carey's hits from 1990 to 1995, while CD 2 is primarily a collection of hits from 1996 to 2000. In 2011, the album was re-issued outside the US with the same track listing, under the title of ''[[The Essential Mariah Carey]]''.\n\n==Content==\nCarey had previously released the compilation album ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), but the release of her ''Greatest Hits'' album was a contractual agreement beyond her control, since she had left Columbia Records and had moved on to [[Virgin Records]]. The album had little creative input from Carey and there are no personal messages within its liner notes, unlike ''#1's''. All tracks from the previous album, with the exception of \"Whenever You Call\" with [[Brian McKnight]], and the ''#1's'' non-U.S. bonus track \"[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]\" are included on LP.\n''Greatest Hits''. Tracks that weren't included on ''#1's'' are:\n*the U.S. top five hits \"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]]\" (1991), \"[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]]\" (1992) and \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\" (1994), and the top twenty hit \"[[Anytime You Need a Friend]]\" (1994);\n*the radio airplay-only tracks \"[[Forever (Mariah Carey song)|Forever]]\" (1996), \"[[Underneath the Stars (song)|Underneath the Stars]]\" (1996), and \"[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey song)|Butterfly]]\" (1997);\n*\"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]\" (1999) and \"[[Thank God I Found You]]\" (2000), the two singles from Carey's ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'' album that went to number 1 following the release of ''#1's'', as well as \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]\" (2000), another track from ''Rainbow'';\n*\"[[Endless Love (song)#Luther Vandross and Mariah Carey version|Endless Love]]\" (1994), a top five duet with [[Luther Vandross]], which had not been previously included on any Carey album;\n*the So So Def remix of \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\" (2000) featuring [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]], which had only been included on the Japanese re-release of the single in 2000.\n\nMost non-U.S. versions of ''Greatest Hits'' retain the track listing as listed below with the addition of \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)#Mariah Carey and Westlife version|Against All Odds]]\" (2000), a duet with [[Westlife]]. The Japanese version contains \"Against All Odds\", \"[[Open Arms (Journey song)#Mariah Carey version|Open Arms]]\" (1996), the non-single album track \"Music Box\" from the album ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), and the ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' album version of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\"; it is also the only album to include the \"[[Never Too Far/Hero Medley]]\" (2001) single. Unlike most non-U.S. versions of the ''Greatest Hits'' album, the So So Def Remix of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was not included on the original UK edition but on the album's 2005 re-release.\n\n==Commercial  performance==\nAs of November 2018, ''Greatest Hits'' has sold 1,230,000 copies in the US.<ref name=\"USsales\">{{cite
