Vardaman]], [[Coleman Livingston Blease]], and then [[Huey Long]], controversial figures who were Southern demagogues, populists, and [[political bosses]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:AR Gov. Davis marker in Ashdown IMG 8564.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Historical marker of the birthplace of Governor Jeff Davis]]\nDavis was born near [[Rocky Comfort, Arkansas|Rocky Comfort]] in [[Little River County, Arkansas|Little River County]] in southwestern Arkansas. His parents were Lewis W. Davis, a Baptist preacher originally from [[Kentucky]], and his wife Elizabeth Phillips, originally from [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]].<ref>{{harvp|\"Governors\"|1995|p= 115}}.</ref> Lewis Davis did not join the Confederate army until drafted in 1864. He named his only son after [[Jefferson Davis]], then-[[President of the Confederate States of America]]. His military service was largely performed as a chaplain's commission, but he quit the ministry following the war and became a lawyer.<ref name=\"p27\" />\n\n===American Civil War and Reconstruction===\n{{See also|Arkansas in the American Civil War|Red River Campaign}}\nNo Civil War battles were fought within Sevier County's bounds, but there were many opportunities for the war to make an impression on the young Jeff Davis. After the Union captured Little Rock in 1863, the state capitol was moved to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]]. Union General [[Nathaniel Banks]] later led the [[Red River Campaign]]through the county, an unsuccessful attempt to capture [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] via southwest Arkansas. Beginning in 1865, Laynesport, not far from the Davis property, was fortified as a Confederate garrison. Perhaps equally indelible was the romanticism of \"[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|The Lost Cause]]\" myth in the years following the war; as a majority of southwestern Arkansas residents remained staunch Confederate supporters.<ref>{{harvp|\"Ozarks\"|1988|pp= 26-27}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, Lewis Davis was elected to serve as county and probate judge of Sevier County, and later Little River County following its creation by the state legislature in 1867. The following year, Congressional or [[Radical Reconstruction]] swept Davis and most other Democrats from office by temporarily banning former Confederates from office and passing amendments to enfranchise [[freedmen]]. Confederate supporters did not accept this political overhaul, turning to vigilante groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Knights of the White Camelia]] to intimidate blacks and Republicans. The rough and tumble nature of Little River County was especially conductive for gangs, outlaws and violence.<ref name=\"p27\" >{{harvp|\"Ozarks\"|1988|p= 29}}.</ref>\n\nEventually the situation devolved to such lawlessness that governor [[Powell Clayton]] declared [[martial law]] in Little River and nine other counties to restore order. Desperado [[Cullen Baker]] initially assembled a posse to oppose Clayton's militia, but after several skirmishes, the militia gained control of the county. Local history tells of rape, torture, murder and pillaging of blacks and white Republican sympathizers by the militia in the ensuing months. The martial law months were later described by Jeff Davis as the \"most bitter episode of his youth\".<ref name=\"p27\" /> In 1869 the Davis family moved to [[Dover, Arkansas]] in the [[Arkansas River Valley]].\n\n===Move to Pope County===\n{{See also|Pope County, Arkansas#History}}\nFollowing a move to Pope County, Lewis Davis found that his previous service as judge quickly elevated him within a very small legal community. However, the Davis family had moved into a post-war situation that was similarly violent to that of Little River County and rooted deep in Pope County's past. With the population divided sharply into city-country and Union-Rebel factions, both sides held grudges long after the war was over. The Republican domination of local government resulted in resentment by the ex-Confederate Democrats, and the situation exploded in 1872. In what was later known as the Pope County Militia War, the county fell into lawlessness for six months resulting in robbery, murder and pillaging.<ref name=\"harvp|Governors|1995|p= 116\">{{harvp|\"Governors\"|1995|p= 116}}.</ref> Pope County Democrats became heroes across the state for openly providing armed resistance to Powell Clayton's state militia. Such Reconstruction violence continued to have a strong effect on ten-year-old Jeff Davis.<ref name=\"p27\"/>\n\n==Education and early career==\n[[File:Early View of Kirkland Hall.jpg|right|thumb|Main Building as it would've appeared when Davis attended Vanderbilt Law School in 1880]]\nDavis attended public schools in [[Russellville, Arkansas]].<ref name=\"harvp|Governors|1995|p= 116\"/> After being rejected by [[West Point]] in 1878, Davis enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], where he studied until 1880. He transferred to [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. Although he completed the two-year law curriculum in one year, the [[Vanderbilt University Law School]] withheld his diploma for failure to satisfy their residency requirement.<ref name=\"harvp|Governors|1995|p= 116\"/>\n\nWith the help of his father's influence, Davis returned to Russellville in the summer of 1881 and was accepted to the [[Arkansas Bar Association]] despite being underaged. In the fall of 1881, Davis enrolled at [[Cumberland University]], which granted his [[juris doctor|law degree]] in May 1882.\n\nNow twenty years old, Davis joined his father's law firm, L.W. Davis and Son, Attorneys, in Russellville as a junior law partner. Focusing on homestead cases, the law practice had become rather successful. The elder Davis, buoyed by a growing law practice while also working as a newspaper editor, real estate broker, and local booster, had become one of the county's most successful citizens.<ref name=\"harvp|Governors|1995|p= 116\"/> The elder Davis won election to the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] in 1877. Jeff Davis became deeply involved in political campaigns as early as 1884.\n\nAfter supporting [[Grover Cleveland]] in the [[1888 United States presidential election|1888 presidential election]], Davis decided to run for district prosecuting attorney in the Fifth Judicial District the following cycle.<ref>{{harvp|\"Governors\"|1995|p= 117}}.</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{See also|Politics of the Southern United States#After the Civil War|Politics of the Southern United States#Twentieth-century}}\nAt the time, the South was ruled by an unofficial [[tantamount to election|one-party system]], with Democratic hegemony, [[white supremacy]], and [[disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|black disfranchisement]] remaining intertwined after Reconstruction and well into the 20th century.<ref>{{harvp|\"Demagoguery\"|1980|p= 120}}.</ref> Prominent landowning white men of the former planter class were returned to power by Democratic supporters and known as Redeemers in the waning years of Reconstruction. After 1877, they largely ruled statewide and national positions as well as an increasing number of local positions once the state passed disenfranchisement of blacks. They sought to reverse Republican gains made during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and to return to white supremacy of the [[Antebellum South]] by disenfranchising most blacks and imposing [[Jim Crow laws]]. An insurgent [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary]] component, including groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], also rose to prominence during the period. Together with common whites, they committed countless [[lynchings]] and other acts of violence against Republicans, blacks, and other groups.\n\n===Style and contemporaries===\nDavis is often classified with politicians such as [[Benjamin Tillman]], [[Robert Love Taylor]], [[Thomas E. Watson]], [[James K. Vardaman]], [[Coleman Livingston Blease]], and later [[Huey Long]], controversial figures who were Southern demagogues, populists, and [[political bosses]]. Davis was one of many Southern demagogue politicians who rose to power on a populist message of agrarian frustration with big business and elites. His coarse language, insults, and theatrics were all crafted to enhance his \"common man\" credentials.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvp|\"Demagoguery\"|1980|p= 117}}.</ref> Davis made a career of skewering the [[business]] interests, [[newspapers]], and [[Urban culture|urban]] dwellers to appeal to the poor [[rural]] citizens, the majority of the population. He portrayed himself as \u201cjust another poor country boy\u201d against the moneyed interests that held back the common man. Davis often used words such as \"rednecks\" or \"hillbillies\" but as terms of endearment rather than pejorative, a technique that Huey Long would learn from Davis and later use successfully in [[Louisiana]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Davis used a rhetoric that was strongly [[racist]] and [[segregationist]]. Although Davis did not succeed in implementing many of his racist promises on the stump, he supported [[disfranchisement]] of blacks, segregation of school taxes, and white supremacy.<ref>{{harvp|\"Demagoguery\"|1980|pp= 118-119}}.</ref> He attacked 1904 gubernatorial opponent [[Carroll D. Wood]] for appointing a black man as a jury commissioner and promised that \"no man could be appointed to office under my administration unless he was a white man, a Democrat, and a Jeff Davis man.\"<ref>{{harvp|\"Demagoguery\"|1980|p= 118}}.</ref>\n\nIt was said that many of his supporters incorrectly believed Davis to be related to Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], which the politician did nothing to discourage and may have covertly encouraged.<ref name=\"funeral\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=271 |title=The Arkansas News: Jeff Davis Funeral Attracts Crowd of Thousands |accessdate=2007-04-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006083042/http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=271 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nDavis served as prosecuting attorney of the Fifth Judicial District of Arkansas from 1892 to 1896.\n\n====Attorney General====\nHe was elected as [[Arkansas Attorney General]] and served from 1898 to 1901.\n\n====Governor====\nElected in 1900, Davis served as Governor of Arkansas from 1901 to 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arkansas/col2-content/main-content-list/title_davis_jefferson.html|title=Arkansas Governor Jefferson Davis|publisher= National Governors Association |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, when [[US President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited Arkansas, Davis greeted him with a speech that defended [[lynching]] as a means of social control.

They sought to reverse Republican gains made during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and to return to white supremacy of the [[Antebellum South]] by disenfranchising most blacks and imposing [[Jim Crow laws]]. An insurgent [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary]] component, including groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], also rose to prominence during the period. Together with common whites, they committed countless [[lynchings]] and other acts of violence against Republicans, blacks, and other groups.\n\n===Style and contemporaries===\nDavis is often classified with politicians such as [[Benjamin Tillman]], [[Robert Love Taylor]], [[Thomas E. Watson]], [[James K. Vardaman]], [[Coleman Livingston Blease]], and later [[Huey Long]], controversial figures who were Southern demagogues, populists, and [[political bosses]]. Davis was one of many Southern demagogue politicians who rose to power on a populist message of agrarian frustration with big business and elites. His coarse language, insults, and theatrics were all crafted to enhance his \"common man\" credentials.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvp|\"Demagoguery\"|1980|p= 117}}.</ref> Davis made a career of skewering the [[business]] interests, [[newspapers]], and [[urban]] dwellers to appeal to the poor [[rural]] citizens, the majority of the population. He portrayed himself as \u201cjust another poor country boy\u201d against the moneyed interests that held back the common man. Davis often used words such as \"rednecks\" or \"hillbillies\" but as terms of endearment rather than pejorative, a technique that Huey Long would learn from Davis and later use successfully in [[Louisiana]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Davis used a rhetoric that was strongly [[racist]] and [[segregationist]]. Although Davis did not succeed in implementing many of his racist promises on the stump, he supported [[disfranchisement]] of blacks, segregation of school taxes, and white supremacy.<ref>{{harvp|\"Demagoguery\"|1980|pp= 118-119}}.</ref> He attacked 1904 gubernatorial opponent [[Carroll D. Wood]] for appointing a black man as a jury commissioner and promised that \"no man could be appointed to office under my administration unless he was a white man, a Democrat, and a Jeff Davis man.\"<ref>{{harvp|\"Demagoguery\"|1980|p= 118}}.</ref>\n\nIt was said that many of his supporters incorrectly believed Davis to be related to Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], which the politician did nothing to discourage and may have covertly encouraged.<ref name=\"funeral\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=271 |title=The Arkansas News: Jeff Davis Funeral Attracts Crowd of Thousands |accessdate=2007-04-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006083042/http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=271 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nDavis served as prosecuting attorney of the Fifth Judicial District of Arkansas from 1892 to 1896.\n\n====Attorney General====\nHe was elected as [[Arkansas Attorney General]] and served from 1898 to 1901.\n\n====Governor====\nElected in 1900, Davis served as Governor of Arkansas from 1901 to 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arkansas/col2-content/main-content-list/title_davis_jefferson.html|title=Arkansas Governor Jefferson Davis|publisher= National Governors Association |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, when [[US President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited Arkansas, Davis greeted him with a speech that defended [[lynching]] as a means of social control.

The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

The town borders [[Bukit Batok]] to the north, [[Bukit Timah]] to the northeast, [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] to the east and [[Jurong East]] to the west.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nIt is often famed that \"Clementi\" derives its name from the local favourite drink, \u201cIce Lemon Tea\u201d. 'Clementi Road', the main traffic route that still runs into the district to this day. It was once known as 'Reformatory Road' as there was a boys' home situated along the road. In 1947, the Singapore Rural Board discussed renaming the road. Their original intention was to name it after [[Hugh Clifford|Sir Hugh Clifford]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/freepress19470822-1.2.65.aspx|title=CRACKER SHOPS TO BE LICENSED|date=22 August 1947|newspaper=The Singapore Free Press|page=5|access-date=25 May 2016|via=NewspaperSG}}</ref> but it was eventually named as Clementi Road. It is generally suggested that the road was named after [[Cecil Clementi Smith|Sir Cecil Clementi Smith]], who was the first [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malaya|British High Commissioner]] in the [[Straits Settlements]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTOJAAAAQBAJ|title=Singapore Street Names: A Study of Toponymics|last=Savage|first=Victor R.|last2=Yeoh|first2=Brenda|date=2013-06-15|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|isbn=9789814484749|page=85|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> However, it is also possible that the road was named after [[Cecil Clementi|Sir Cecil Clementi]], another former Governor of the Straits Settlements (1930\u201333) who initiated the construction of the [[Kallang Airport]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BJwAAAAMAAJ|title=Street Names of Singapore|last=Dunlop|first=Peter K. G.|date=2000|publisher=Who's Who Publishing|isbn=9789814062114|pages=55\u201356|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe present area occupying Clementi Avenue 1 used to be known as 'Sussex Estate', named after the historic [[historic counties of England|county]] of [[Sussex]] in England. It was developed in the mid-1950s to house the families of British senior non-commissioned officers. When Clementi underwent a major transformation beginning in 1975, Sussex Estate was the only pre-development feature that was retained. It was demolished in 1997.\n \nMost of the area currently occupied by Clementi New Town today was once a military installation called 'Colombo Camp'. It is not known when the camp came into existence, however what is known is that the Singapore Guard Regiment, formed in 1948, stationed its troops there. When the regiment disbanded in November 1971, the camp was left to stand for another four more years before it was demolished in 1975.\n \nClementi New Town was subsequently developed between 1975 and 1979 on the plot of land that was once occupied by the camp. Planned as a self-sufficient residential town with a range of facilities and services, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) began clearing the area in 1974 and affected villagers were resettled.\n\nAn iconic landmark at Clementi is the steel truss railway bridge crossing Sungei Ulu Pandan. It was once part of the Jurong [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|KTMB]] Railway Line which was constructed to facilitate the transportation of manufactured products from [[Jurong]] to [[Malaysia]], and raw materials from Malaysia to the industrial estate at Jurong. Construction of the railway began in 1963, and the first train ran in 1966. The Jurong section of the railway remained in use for the next four decades until its closure in the early 1990s. Today, the disused track continues to attract much interest from the public, especially people with a taste for history, nature and photography.\n\n==Geography==\nClementi's arterial road, Clementi Road, runs for some 5 kilometres, from the vicinity around [[Bukit Timah]], at Jalan Anak Bukit, to the [[West Coast Highway (Singapore)|West Coast Highway]], but the geographical entity of Clementi is generally regarded as the area dominated by HDB [[Apartment|flats]] around [[Commonwealth, Singapore|Commonwealth Avenue West]] and the [[Clementi MRT station]]. Besides Clementi Road, the two other arterial roads that serve the new town are the Ayer Rajah Expressway and the West Coast Highway.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Clementi New Town {{!}} Infopedia|url = http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_215_2005-01-23.html|website = eresources.nlb.gov.sg|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\nThe primary residential district in Clementi is Clementi New Town and forms a large bulk of its residents and identity. The area also consists of many landed properties, especially in the West of the area.\n\nThe boundaries of Clementi New Town are Sunset Way Estate to the North, Clementi Road to the East, West Coast Highway to the South, and Clementi Avenue 6 to the West.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\nThere are 4 constituencies in the town, and 7 neighbourhoods (N1 to N7) within the Clementi vicinity.<ref>[http://citypost.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pdf_Clementi.pdf citypost.sg - HDB Statistics for Clementi Estate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040709/http://citypost.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pdf_Clementi.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> Most of the neighbourhoods are centralised or aligned along their respective neighbourhood centres, where most of the commercial activities are conducted, other than Clementi Town Centre.\n\n==Politics==\nClementi was last an independent political constituency in the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 general election]]. Clementi now comes under the [[West Coast GRC]] (West Coast ward), [[Jurong GRC]] (Clementi ward) and [[Holland-Bukit Timah GRC]] (Ulu Pandan & Bukit Timah wards).\n\nWest Coast GRC is led by [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Minister for Trade and Industry]], [[Lim Hng Kiang]]. The constituency first faced a challenge from the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] in the [[1997 Singapore general election|1997 general election]]. Since then, the constituency has received walkovers in both the [[2001 Singapore general election|2001]] and [[2006 Singapore general election|2006 general elections]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general election]], the [[People's Action Party|PAP]] slate for five-member West Coast GRC, comprising [[Lim Hng Kiang]], [[S. Iswaran]], [[Arthur Fong]], [[Lawrence Wong Shyun Tsai]] and [[Foo Mee Har]], faced a contest against the [[Reform Party (Singapore)|Reform Party]] led by [[Kenneth Jeyaretnam]].\n\nClementi was drawn into Jurong GRC after the electoral boundaries changed as a result of the [[2015 Singapore general election|2015 general elections]]. The PAP-[[Jurong GRC]] team won 79.28% of the votes in that election. Dr Tan Wu Meng currently represents the Clementi division after winning a seat in the 2015 General Elections.\n\nCurrently, West Coast Town Council office is still being occupied in this very location at the Clementi Mall, but it is now meant for residents in Dover, Pandan Gardens, Teban Gardens and West Coast.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe Commonwealth Cinema on the south side of Clementi MRT station was demolished in 2008 and rebuilt into a 4-storey shopping mall, now named, 'CityVibe'. The former [[WE Cinemas|Eng Wah]]'s Empress Entertainment Centre Cineplex has also been rebuilt and reopened as '[[Eng Wah Global|321 Clementi]]' in March 2015.\n\nFurther from the town centre, a shopping complex, [[West Coast Plaza]], not only serves the upmarket residents of the condominiums along West Coast Road.\n\nThe [[Clementi Police Division|Singapore Police 'D' Divisional Headquarters]] is located at Clementi Avenue 5, while the Clementi Neighbourhood Police Post is situated at Clementi Avenue 3. Clementi Fire Station is located off Commonwealth Avenue West.\n\nIn April 2005, the HDB announced plans to build a new [[mixed-use development]] at Clementi Town Centre, on the existing bus interchange site. The new development complex was to house a 5-storey retail podium with two basements, two 40-storey residential blocks (Clementi Towers), the West Coast Town Council (Clementi Office), a [[National Library Board|public library]] and an air-conditioned bus interchange. On 21 May 2011, [[Clementi Mall|The Clementi Mall]] \u2013 the new retail shopping mall which is part of the mixed-use development, officially opened.

The town borders [[Bukit Batok]] to the north, [[Bukit Timah]] to the northeast, [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] to the east and [[Jurong East]] to the west.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nIt is often famed that \"Clementi\" derives its name from the local favourite drink, \u201cIce Lemon Tea\u201d. 'Clementi Road', the main traffic route that still runs into the district to this day. It was once known as 'Reformatory Road' as there was a boys' home situated along the road. In 1947, the Singapore Rural Board discussed renaming the road. Their original intention was to name it after [[Hugh Clifford|Sir Hugh Clifford]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/freepress19470822-1.2.65.aspx|title=CRACKER SHOPS TO BE LICENSED|date=22 August 1947|newspaper=The Singapore Free Press|page=5|access-date=25 May 2016|via=NewspaperSG}}</ref> but it was eventually named as Clementi Road. It is generally suggested that the road was named after [[Cecil Clementi Smith|Sir Cecil Clementi Smith]], who was the first [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malaya|British High Commissioner]] in the [[Straits Settlements]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTOJAAAAQBAJ|title=Singapore Street Names: A Study of Toponymics|last=Savage|first=Victor R.|last2=Yeoh|first2=Brenda|date=2013-06-15|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|isbn=9789814484749|page=85|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> However, it is also possible that the road was named after [[Cecil Clementi|Sir Cecil Clementi]], another former Governor of the Straits Settlements (1930\u201333) who initiated the construction of the [[Kallang Airport]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BJwAAAAMAAJ|title=Street Names of Singapore|last=Dunlop|first=Peter K. G.|date=2000|publisher=Who's Who Publishing|isbn=9789814062114|pages=55\u201356|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe present area occupying Clementi Avenue 1 used to be known as 'Sussex Estate', named after the historic [[historic counties of England|county]] of [[Sussex]] in England. It was developed in the mid-1950s to house the families of British senior non-commissioned officers. When Clementi underwent a major transformation beginning in 1975, Sussex Estate was the only pre-development feature that was retained. It was demolished in 1997.\n \nMost of the area currently occupied by Clementi New Town today was once a military installation called 'Colombo Camp'. It is not known when the camp came into existence, however what is known is that the Singapore Guard Regiment, formed in 1948, stationed its troops there. When the regiment disbanded in November 1971, the camp was left to stand for another four more years before it was demolished in 1975.\n \nClementi New Town was subsequently developed between 1975 and 1979 on the plot of land that was once occupied by the camp. Planned as a self-sufficient residential town with a range of facilities and services, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) began clearing the area in 1974 and affected villagers were resettled.\n\nAn iconic landmark at Clementi is the steel truss railway bridge crossing Sungei Ulu Pandan. It was once part of the Jurong [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|KTMB]] Railway Line which was constructed to facilitate the transportation of manufactured products from [[Jurong]] to [[Malaysia]], and raw materials from Malaysia to the industrial estate at Jurong. Construction of the railway began in 1963, and the first train ran in 1966. The Jurong section of the railway remained in use for the next four decades until its closure in the early 1990s. Today, the disused track continues to attract much interest from the public, especially people with a taste for history, nature and photography.\n\n==Geography==\nClementi's arterial road, Clementi Road, runs for some 5 kilometres, from the vicinity around [[Bukit Timah]], at Jalan Anak Bukit, to the [[West Coast Highway (Singapore)|West Coast Highway]], but the geographical entity of Clementi is generally regarded as the area dominated by HDB [[Apartment|flats]] around [[Commonwealth, Singapore|Commonwealth Avenue West]] and the [[Clementi MRT station]]. Besides Clementi Road, the two other arterial roads that serve the new town are the Ayer Rajah Expressway and the West Coast Highway.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Clementi New Town {{!}} Infopedia|url = http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_215_2005-01-23.html|website = eresources.nlb.gov.sg|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\nThe primary residential district in Clementi is Clementi New Town and forms a large bulk of its residents and identity. The area also consists of many landed properties, especially in the West of the area.\n\nThe boundaries of Clementi New Town are Sunset Way Estate to the North, Clementi Road to the East, West Coast Highway to the South, and Clementi Avenue 6 to the West.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\nThere are 4 constituencies in the town, and 7 neighbourhoods (N1 to N7) within the Clementi vicinity.<ref>[http://citypost.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pdf_Clementi.pdf citypost.sg - HDB Statistics for Clementi Estate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040709/http://citypost.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pdf_Clementi.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> Most of the neighbourhoods are centralised or aligned along their respective neighbourhood centres, where most of the commercial activities are conducted, other than Clementi Town Centre.\n\n==Politics==\nClementi was last an independent political constituency in the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 general election]]. Clementi now comes under the [[West Coast GRC]] (West Coast ward), [[Jurong GRC]] (Clementi ward) and [[Holland-Bukit Timah GRC]] (Ulu Pandan & Bukit Timah wards).\n\nWest Coast GRC is led by [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Minister for Trade and Industry]], [[Lim Hng Kiang]]. The constituency first faced a challenge from the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] in the [[1997 Singapore general election|1997 general election]]. Since then, the constituency has received walkovers in both the [[2001 Singapore general election|2001]] and [[2006 Singapore general election|2006 general elections]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general election]], the [[People's Action Party|PAP]] slate for five-member West Coast GRC, comprising [[Lim Hng Kiang]], [[S. Iswaran]], [[Arthur Fong]], [[Lawrence Wong Shyun Tsai]] and [[Foo Mee Har]], faced a contest against the [[Reform Party (Singapore)|Reform Party]] led by [[Kenneth Jeyaretnam]].\n\nClementi was drawn into Jurong GRC after the electoral boundaries changed as a result of the [[2015 Singapore general election|2015 general elections]]. The PAP-[[Jurong GRC]] team won 79.28% of the votes in that election. Dr Tan Wu Meng currently represents the Clementi division after winning a seat in the 2015 General Elections.\n\nCurrently, West Coast Town Council office is still being occupied in this very location at the Clementi Mall, but it is now meant for residents in Dover, Pandan Gardens, Teban Gardens and West Coast.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe Commonwealth Cinema on the south side of Clementi MRT station was demolished in 2008 and rebuilt into a 4-storey shopping mall, now named, 'CityVibe'. The former [[WE Cinemas|Eng Wah]]'s Empress Entertainment Centre Cineplex has also been rebuilt and reopened as '[[Eng Wah Global|321 Clementi]]' in March 2015.\n\nFurther from the town centre, a shopping complex, [[West Coast Plaza]], not only serves the upmarket residents of the condominiums along West Coast Road.\n\nThe [[Clementi Police Division|Singapore Police 'D' Divisional Headquarters]] is located at Clementi Avenue 5, while the Clementi Neighbourhood Police Post is situated at Clementi Avenue 3. Clementi Fire Station is located off Commonwealth Avenue West.\n\nIn April 2005, the HDB announced plans to build a new [[mixed-use development]] at Clementi Town Centre, on the existing bus interchange site. The new development complex was to house a 5-storey retail podium with two basements, two 40-storey residential blocks (Clementi Towers), the West Coast Town Council (Clementi Office), a [[National Library Board|public library]] and an air-conditioned bus interchange. On 21 May 2011, [[Clementi Mall|The Clementi Mall]] \u2013 the new retail shopping mall which is part of the mixed-use development, officially opened. The mall is linked directly to [[Clementi MRT station]] on the 3rd level, and the new air-conditioned [[Clementi Bus Interchange]] at the 1st level has direct access to the mall. It is the first development in Singapore to integrate [[Public housing in Singapore|public housing]], public transport and [[Commercial district|commercial]] facilities built together within a single complex. On 15 May 2012, the mixed development won the prestigious international FIABCI Prix d'Excellence award, scoring the Runner-up award under the Master Plan Category.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clementi Town mixed development wins prestigious award|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1201580/1/.html|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|date=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Ang Chee Sia Ong Temple]] and [[Masjid Tentera Diraja|Tentera Di-Raja Mosque]] are their notable places of worship in Clementi.\n\n==Recreation==\nClementi has a swimming complex and a sports hall for badminton or table tennis located near the MRT station.

The Indian subcontinent also served as a refuge for some Shias escaping persecution from [[Umayyads]], [[Abbasids]], [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubis]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The immigration continued throughout the second millennium, until the formation of modern nation states. Shi'ism also won converts among the local population. Shia Islam has long history and deep roots in the subcontinent. However, the earliest major political influence was that of the Shia dynasties in Deccan. It was here that the indigenous and distinct Shia culture took shape.<ref>Justin Jones, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=rrioNz8_EwwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Shi%27a+Islam+in+Colonial+India&hl=da&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj24dzhsYrlAhVMJFAKHaxsBNoQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Shi'a%20Islam%20in%20Colonial%20India&f=false Shi'a Islam in Colonial India]\", p. 5, Cambridge University Press, (2012).</ref> After the conquest of [[Golconda Fort|Golconda]] by [[Aurangzeb]] in the 17th century, and subsequent establishment of hereditary governorship in [[Nawab of Awadh|Awdh]] after his death, [[Lucknow]] became the nerve center of Indian Shi'ism. In the 18th century, intellectual movements of Islamic puritanism were launched by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] in Najd and [[Shah Waliullah Dehlawi|Shah Waliullah]] and his sons, with [[Shah Abdul Aziz]] being the main flag-bearer of modern anti-Shi'ism in Delhi, resulted in continuous persecution of Shia community and laid the foundations of organised violence against them.<ref>B.

The results were not reflective of reality as most Shias hide their religious beliefs from the state, because Shias [[Taqiya|feared]] the data might leak to the anti-Shia bigots and used to target them. For example, in 1881 Census of Jhang District, only 11, 835 people among the 326, 919 Muslims identified themselves as Shias<ref name=\":13\" />.

The next year, Ibrahim went to Kufah and Nafs al-Zakiyah to Medina and started planning the revolt. Abdullah al-Ashtar, also known as [[Abdullah Shah Ghazi]], stayed in Sindh, married a local Muslim woman and had children by her.

His daughter [[Aisha]], his sons [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr|Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] and [[Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr|Abdur Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]], his grandson [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr|Abdullah ibn Zubayr]] and the son of his nephew, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath|Abdur Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Ash'ath]] are the prominent Sunni opponents of the Umayyad rule. The Sunnis of Khurasan were as opposed to the Umayyad rule as the Shias were. They had been instrumental in [[Abbasid Revolution|overthrow]] of the Umayyad dynasty and in Abbasid rule under the Shia commander [[Abu Muslim|Abu Muslim al-Khurasani]]. The influential Muslim theologian, [[Abu Hanifa|Imam Abu Hanifa]] (699 \u2013 767 AD) was born to an Afghan family living in [[Kufa]], he had great regard for the Ahlulbayt and supported the Shi'ite revolt lead by [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. The Delhi empire carried this legacy of attachment with Ahlulbayt and the family of Caliph Abu Bakr. It was during the early years of the Delhi Sultanate that the great [[Sufism in India|Sufi]] saint, [[Moinuddin Chishti]] (1142\u20131236 AD) set his foot in India and converted many locals to Islam. \n\nDuring the early years of the establishment of [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultanate]], a number of Ismaili Shias had settled around Delhi.

Ismaili missionaries spread across Gujrat and managed to establish the [[Nizari|Nizari Ismaili]] [[Khoja]] community and the [[Musta'li|Mustali Bohras]]. Till the reign of [[Iltutmish]], they remained politically inactive, preaching their ideology secretly. In contrast to Ismailis, history does not record the presence of mainstream [[Twelver|Twelver Shi'ism]] in the first phase of Delhi sultanate. One reason could be [[Taqiya]], because the Shias fleeing persecution in the Middle East settled in the subcontinent as local minorities cautious of threats to their survival. The other reason for this is that the love of Ahlulbayt and the commemoration of Muharram by the Sufi's helped the twelver Shias integrate well into the Sunni Muslim minority of India and not claim a separate political identity. For example, during the [[Gwalior]] campaign of Iltutmish, special sermons by the name of \"''tazkirs''\" were delivered in the military camps during the first ten days of Muharram.<ref>Minhaj us-Siraj, pp. 174\u2013175, 249, (1977).\n\nAs cited in: S.

In the phase of decline, it split up into five smaller kingdoms, three of them ruled by Shias.\n\n==== The Adil Shahi dynasty (1489\u20131686 AD) ====\n[[Yusuf Adil Shah]] of Ottoman Turk origin, the adopted son of a Shia scholar [[Mahmud Gawan]], declared autonomy in [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] in 1489 AD after his father was executed by the drunk king, and proclaimed Shi\u2018ism as the state religion in 1502 AD. Bijapur became the first Twelver Shia state in India, with Ja'fari, Hanafi and Sha'fi schools of Islamic law, each applied to its followers. It was the first time in India that ''Shia [[Adhan]]'' was called on the state pulpits and names of the twelve [[The Twelve Imams|Shia Imams]] be included in ''Khutba''. However, he strictly banned the practice of ''[[tabarra]]''.<ref>J. N. Hollister, \"'''The Shi'a of India'''\", pp. 113, Luzac and Co, London (1953).</ref> In 1579 AD, the king [[Ibrahim Adil Shah II|Ibrahim II]] adopted Sunni sect, but the people were allowed to follow their own. The [[Adil Shahi dynasty]] stayed independent until 1686 AD when it was annexed to the [[Mughal Empire]] by [[Aurangzeb]].\n\n==== The Qutb Shahi dynasty (1512\u20131687 AD) ====\n\nThe longest surviving Shia-ruled state in southern India was that of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutb Shahs]]. Its founder Sultan [[Quli Qutb Mulk]] was of Turkoman origins. He ordered the ''Khutba'' to be read in the names of the twelve Shia Imams. This kingdom was known for its wealth: it is the only one among the Deccan sultanates to have a currency of gold coins. It became the hub of Shia culture in India, later surpassed only by [[Lucknow]]. [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]] (1565\u20131612 AD) is the first [[Urdu]] poet to have compiled and published a divan<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/quli-qutub-shah/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Quli Qutub Shah|website=Rekhta|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> and also the first to write a ''[[Marsiya]]'' in Urdu. A Shia scholar and scientist, [[Mir Muhammad Momin]], came to Golconda in 1581 AD, and was assigned the task of designing the new capital [[Hyderabad]], which was built in 1591 AD. The first [[Hussainiya|Imambargah]] in India, by the name of \"''[[Badshahi Ashurkhana]]''\" was built along with other monuments and bullrings like [[Charminar]], gardens of Ilahi Mahal, Jama Masjid, Colleges and Hospitals. In 1592 AD, the oldest surviving flag <nowiki>''</nowiki>[[Bibi-Ka-Alam|Alam]]<nowiki>''</nowiki> was erected at the Ashurkhana<ref>S. A. A.

In 1633 AD their kingdom was finally annexed by the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Jahan]].\n\n=== Mughal Empire ''Phase-I'' (1526\u20131707 AD) ===\n\nIn March 1526 AD, [[Babur]] defeated the last monarch of the Delhi Sultanate, [[Ibrahim Lodi|Ibrahim Lodhi]], at Panipat and one year later defeated the Rajput hero [[Rana Sanga]] near Sikri. He became the first Mughal Emperor of India but died shortly after, in 1530 AD at Agra. Majority of his army commanders were Turani Begs, however, some of them were Iranians. His son Humayun succeeded him, who inherited his military and Sufi-hanafi orientation. However, he met a crushing defeat at the hands of [[Sher Shah Suri]] in 1540, due to disputes among his brothers, and fled to Iran where [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] welcomed him warmly. In 1545 AD, Hamayun with the help of Iranian military genius [[Bairam Khan|Bayram Khan]], launched attack on Qandhar and then seized Kabul. He conquered Delhi in 1555 AD and died the next year, leaving the throne to his young son [[Akbar]], who was to rule India for almost half a century and become one of the greatest Emperors, Plato's ''[[philosopher king]]'' of India. Him and his contemporary in Deccan, [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]], are perhaps the most enlightened and progressive Kings in Indian history. \n\nIn his childhood, two influential Sunni clerics persuaded him to turn a blind eye to their atrocities against Shias. In 1564 AD, a Shia philosopher and mathematician, Mir Murtaza Shirazi, moved to Akbar's court. When he died in 1567 AD, he was buried near the great poet Amir Khusrow. Shaykh Abd un Nabi and Mulla Makhdum-ul Mulk insisted that his dead body be taken out and buried somewhere else, the young Emperor ordered and his grave was dug up. Around 1570 AD, a Shia jurist, Mir Habsh Turbati was killed, and in Kashmir, Akbar's envoy Mirza Muqim.<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"'''A socio-intellectual History of Isna Ashari Shi'is in India'''\", Vol. 1, pp. 212, Mar'ifat Publishing House, Canberra (1986).</ref> The two clerics would not tolerate difference of opinion, and using their influence in the court of the young king, they forced Fayzi and Abu-ul Fazl into going underground. However, soon the king had enough of their bigotry and he started questioning what he had been taught. In 1575 AD, he built a debating hall by the name of [[Ibadat Khana|Ibadatkhana]], where he would hold discussions between men of knowledge from all backgrounds.<ref>S. A. N. Rezavi, \"'''Religious disputation and imperial ideology: the purpose and location of Akbar's Ibadatkhana'''\",studies in history, 24, 2, pp. 195\u2013209, SAGE Publications (2008).</ref>\n\nThe Mughal state was secular, perhaps the pioneer of secularism, and did not facilitate hate crimes, but a cold war between Shia and Sunni elite continued. Mughal Emperors except Aurangzeb, were indifferent to sectarian disputes and did not encourage sectarian violence.\n\n==== Shia revival in Punjab ====\n[[File:Shrine of RAJAN SHAH Layyah.JPG|thumb|Shrine of Syed Raju Shah Bukhari in Layyah]]\nIn the sixteenth century, some Shia phobes, the like of Mirza Haider Dughlat, appear to question the expression of love for Ahlulbayt by followers of Sufi'ism. Humayun in Kabul was visited by a cleric Shaykh Hamid who angered the king by asking him why so many of his soldiers had Ali in their names?.<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"'''A socio-intellectual History of Isna Ashari Shi'is in India'''\", Vol. 1, pp. 197, Mar'ifat Publishing House, Canberra (1986).</ref> Shia literature of the time mentions them as Kharjis. In response to this, an influential Shia saint Syed Raju Shah Bukhari of [[Layyah District|Layyah]], launched a campaign against unnecessary ''Taqiyya'' among the Shias and invited them to express their love for Ahlulbayt more openly. Another saint, Syed [[Mehboob Alam Shah|Mahbub-i Alam Shah Jiwana]] (1490 \u2013 1564 AD) settled in a village near Jhang. During this time, many saints and syeds professed their faith and identified as Shias openly. They and their disciples traveled the agricultural heartlands of Punjab and spread the message.<ref>Andreas Rieck, \"'''The Shias of Pakistan'''\", p. 7, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref>\n\n==== Shia intelligentsia in Akbar's court ====\nDuring the reign of the curious and just Akbar the Great (1556\u20131605 AD), men of knowledge from all over India gathered at his [[Ibadat Khana|Ibadat khana]] in the then Maughal capital, [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. Among them were three Shia scholars: [[Fathullah Shirazi|Shah Fathullah Shirazi]], [[Qazi Nurullah Shustari]] and [[Syed Ahmad Nasrallah Thattavi|Mullah Ahmad Thattavi]].\n\nThe foundations of Shi'i theology in present-day Pakistan were laid by [[Qazi Nurullah Shustari]] who stayed in Lahore from 1586 AD to 1599 AD.<ref name=\":6\">S.

In 1584 AD, he moved from Mash'had to India and arrived in Akbar's court the next year. In 1586 AD, Akbar shifted his capital to Lahore and appointed him as the Qazi (chief jurist) of the city. He accepted the position on the condition that he will follow his own judgement (Ijtihad) and not adhere to a particular school of jurisprudence. He reformed the judiciary system and made sure that justice was served to the masses. [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni|Mulla Badauni]] says:\n\n''\"He has reduced the insolent jurists and subtle and crafty judges to order and has eradicated their corruption and has put constraints on their conduct. He is well-known for his neutrality, modesty, piety, justice, virtue, and qualities of a noble man. He is well known for his scholarship, decision power, insight, and clarity of thought.

It appears that he made many enemies, while holding them accountable. After Akbar's death, in 1605 AD, life became harder for him and eventually, he was sentenced to public flogging by Jahangir.

Religious and racial sensitivities were manipulated to meet selfish ends. This state of affairs was perfect for sectarian conflicts to grow. It seems like the Kharji's of the pre-Akbar era had re-surfaced. During [[Farrukhsiyar|Farukhsiyar]]'s reign (1713\u20131719 AD), the most prominent Sufi saint was Khawaja Muhammad Jafar. A cleric from Multan by the name of Shaykh Abdullah visited Delhi and could not stand the reverence of the twelve Imams on his ''dargah''. He went to Delhi's Friday mosque and started to campaign against the Khawaja, which resulted in violence. When he went back to Multan, he continued the hate speech. He was arrested and sent back to Delhi to be put behind the bars. On his way, his followers attacked the police to free him, but the attempt failed to leave many dead. The Shaykh was put in prison.<ref>S. A. A.

The weakened Mughals now recognized them as part of Mughal Empire. Shahu was given tax collecting power over the large piece of land he already controlled. But the boundaries between the provinces were always disputed, thus Marathas continued their expansion. Mughal Empire started to become decentralized and a number of successor states emerged. Their rulers had considerable autonomy and sought legitimacy by being ceremonially appointed by the Emperor. In 1723 AD, [[Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I|Nizam-ul Mulk]], the strongest Sunni noble at Delhi's court and Mughal Viceroy of the Deccan, declared himself as a shadow king of the area, founding [[Hyderabad State]]. When the Emperor sent an army to crush his soft coup, it was defeated. However, because of constant Maratha threat, he did not claim independent and chose to stay quasi-independent. Following this the Shia [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Nawabs of Bengal]] and [[Nawab of Awadh|Nawabs of Awdh]] were also awarded hereditary governorship and local autonomy in their respective areas. Like Nizam, they too appointed their own administration in their state, while paying tributes to the Emperor. Meanwhile the European trading companies had started to recruit armies from local population in Bombay, Madras and Bengal. The Empire entered into an era of perpetual war, mistrust and treachery.<ref>Stanley Wolpert, \"'''A New History of India'''\", ch. 12, Oxford University Press, (2004).</ref> However, it was also an era of emergence of new cultural capitals, like [[Lucknow]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Hyderabad]] and [[Pune|Poone]].\n\n==== Shia rule in Bengal ====\n[[File:Nizamat Imambara, Murshidabad.JPG|thumb|[[Nizamat Imambara|Nizammat Imambara]] of Murshidabad is the biggest imambargah in the Subcontinent.]]\nShi'ism was introduced to Bengal during the governorship of [[Shah Shuja (Mughal prince)|Shah Shuja]] (1641\u20131661 AD), son of Shah Jahan.

When [[Muhammad Shah]], who was busy with revolts at home, failed to respond, he used this as a pretext to attack Delhi and plunder it. The Shia nawab of Awdh, [[Saadat Ali Khan I|Sa'adat Ali Khan]] tried to defend Delhi but was stabbed in the back by [[Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I|Nizam-ul Mulk]], who prevented the Emperor from sending reinforcements and the nawab ended up arrested.<ref>William Irvine, \"'''Later Mughals'''\", Vol. 2, pp. 341\u2013344, M.C.

After his assassination in 1747 AD, the commander of his Afghan troops [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmed Shah Abdali Durrani]] proclaimed independence and founded [[Afghanistan]] in parts of Iran and India. To fill his treasury he attacked and looted the Indus Valley seven times. His [[Indian campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani|invasions]] were supported by the Afghan [[Rohilla|Rohillas]] in Delhi who had rebellious tendencies since last days of Aurangzeb. Ahmed Shah Abdali attacked Punjab in 1747 AD and advanced towards Delhi, but the Shia nawab of Awdh and commander of the Mughal army [[Safdar Jang]] defeated him at Manpur near [[Sirhind-Fategarh|Sirhind]]. After this event, the Rohillas attacked Awdh but were pushed back. Safdar Jang made alliance with Marathas against Abdali and his Rohilla agents. Abdali invaded Punjab again by the end of 1748 AD and created havoc. In 1751 AD, he invaded Punjab the third time and this time the Mughal governor Mir Mannu ceded Lahore and Multan to him and regained governorship under Abdali.\n\nWith increasing sectarian strife at the Mughal court, the Sunni faction managed to enthrone [[Alamgir II|Alamgir-II]] as the Emperor, and persuaded him to ban the commemoration of Muharram in Delhi.

For more than a month, afghans went from home to home, taking whatever wealth people had, even if it was buried in the ground, and raping women. Sikh militias attacked Abdali's forces on their way back to Afghanistan, and free some of the Hindu or Sikh women that were taken as sex-slaves. Abdali invaded Delhi in 1759 AD again, looted the city, expelled its Shia population, forcibly married the 16-year-old beauty [[Hazrat Begum|Princess Hazrat Begum]].

Gauhar Aman then appointed his son in law, Muhammad Khan, as the ruler of Gilgit.<ref>Military Report and Gazetteer of the Gilgit Agency, 2nd ed., p. 47, (1927).</ref> However, Gilgit was retaken by a Dogra army under General Hushiara in 1858 AD, who in 1860 ordered a total massacre of the people of Yasin valley as a revenge of the earlier military defeats. In 1863, he collectively punished the population of Darel for not supporting his army against an invasion from Chitral.<ref>Military Report and Gazetteer of the Gilgit Agency, 2nd ed., p. 48, (1927).</ref> Several attempts were made in the following years by the tribal chiefs to liberate Gilgit but all failed due to a lack of modern military equipment and strategy. However these attacks did not let the British establish their rule firmly till 1888 AD. In 1889, the Gilgit agency was established and its powers extended over Gurais, Astor, Bunji, Sai and Gilgit. However Chitral, Punial, Hunza, Nagar, Darel, Gor and Chilas were made tributary to the Dogra court of Kashmir.<ref>Military Report and Gazetteer of the Gilgit Agency, 2nd ed., pp. 48 - 51, (1927).</ref> \n\nIn Gilgit, Shias co-existed with Sunnis, Buddhists and Hindus. Northern part was reported to be predominantly Shia, while Sunni tenets were found in the Southern part of the region.<ref>Military Report and Gazetteer of the Gilgit Agency, 2nd ed., p. 19, (1927).</ref> The Gazetteer of Gilgit agency reads:\n\n\"''Wherever Sunnis and Shias are found living together, they seem to practice a mutual tolerance rare in other Muhammadan communities. Except in Chilas and the Indus valley below or, there is, generally speaking, a complete absence of fanaticism''\".<ref>''Military Report and Gazetteer of the Gilgit Agency'', 2nd ed., pp. 19 - 20, (1927).</ref>\n\n==== Shi'ism in Kashmir ====\nA very small minority of Shias lived in the suburbs of Srinagar, mainly at Zadibal. However, they were very hard-working and industrious people; finest papier-mache workers, shawl-makers and wealthiest were Shias.<ref>Gazetteer of the Kashmir, p. 31, (1872-73).</ref> Of the famous 10 [[Taraaj-e Shia|Shia Taraaj's]]<ref name=\":14\" />, the last one occurred in September 1872. The Gazetteer of Kashmir contains the details of the violence:\n\n\"''The disturbances then raged for more than a weak, and for some time defied the efforts of the governor, who called in the aid of troops; whole districts were reduced to smoldering heaps of ruins; and business was for some time entirely suspended, a great portion of the city being deserted. The Shias fled in every direction, some seeking safety on the adjacent mountains, while others remained in the city in secret lurking places. Many of the women and children of the Shias found an asylum from the hands of their infuriated co-religionists in the houses of the Hindu portion of the community''\".<ref>Gazetteer of the Kashmir, p. 32, (1872-73).</ref>\n\n==== Shi'ism in NWFP and Tribal Agencies ====\nAfter the British annexed Kohat, the Turis repeatedly attacked their troops in Miranzai. In 1854 AD an agreement was reached but the raids increased, and in 1856 AD, a force under Neville Chamberlain attacked the valley and the Turis were made to pay Rs. 8,630. In 1877 AD the Turis revolted against the oppressive attitude of the Afghan governor of Kurram. In November, 1878 AD, a British force commanded by General Roberts attacked Kurram from Thal, and occupied Kurram Fort. The Afghans were defeated at the Peiwar Kotal, and Khost was occupied in January next year.  At that time, Afghanistan as being ruled by a fanatic Sunni king, [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Amir Abdur Rahman Khan]]. In 1880 AD, the Turis, with the Bangash, asked the British to take over the valley and protect them from Abdur Rahman Khan's fanaticism; but the British decided to keep them as a buffer between India and Afghanistan and the tribe was declared independent. The Shias of Kurram valley requested to join British India once more and the valley was finally annexed to British India in 1892.<ref>Gazetteer of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), pp. 239 - 240, (1907).</ref> \n\nBesides Turi and Bangash people of Kurram valley, many Orakzai Pashtuns in Tirah, and some in Kohat, Peshawar and Shirani country also professed Shi'ism. Fanaticism was rampant throughout the area.<ref name=\":24\">Gazetteer of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), pp. 33 - 34, (1907).</ref> In Kurram, 22% of the population were Turis, 11% were Bangash and the rest were Chamkannis, Ghilzais, Mangals, Orakzais and a small Hindu minority of Arora caste. Main source of income was agriculture, however Silk was also produced and exported.<ref>Gazetteer of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), p. 240, (1907).</ref> \n\nAccording to the British estimates, only 1% of the total population of the province professed to be Shia<ref name=\":24\" />.

Clerics trained at the Asif-ud Daula seminary in Lucknow spread throughout North India to preach Usuli Shi'ism and connect people to the central religious authority at Lucknow. In the nineteenth century AD, Allama Abul Qasim Rizvi (1833 \u2013 1906 AD) arrived in Lahore after having completed higher education in Iraq, and founded an Imamia seminary in 1879 patronized by Nawab Ali Raza Khan Qizilbash. Elites like the Qizilbashs in Lahore, Faqirs and Gardezis in Multan and Shah Jiwana and Rajoa Sa'dat in Jhang contributed heavily to the spread of Shi'ism in Punjab.<ref name=\":13\">T. Kamran and A.

They are the most bigoted type. They observe the Muharram most strictly, abstaining from all luxuries for the first ten days of the month, and on the 10th they accompany the Taziahs bareheaded and bare-footed. They throw dust on their heads and beat their breasts with extreme violence, and allow neither Hindu nor Muhammadan to approach the Taziah without baring his head and removing his shoes\"''<ref name=\":29\">Gazetteer of Jhang District 1883\u201384, p. 50, (1984).</ref>''.''\n\nThe coexistence of Shias and Sunnis was noticed in other parts of Punjab as well. The following passage is taken from the 1923\u201324 Gazetteer of Multan:\n\n\"''They are careful in the observance of the Muharram; and although Sunnis join freely in tazia procession, such observances are particularly unknown, except in the quarters where there are Shias to start and organize them. Generally speaking, there is very little bitterness between the Sunni and Shia sect, and in the ordinary intercourse of life, there is little to distinguish the two''\".<ref>Gazetteer of Multan District, pp. 121, (1924).</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of the twentieth century AD, Shia-Sunni debates were on the rise following [[Azadari in Lucknow#Riot of 1908 and Piggot committee|sectarian riots in Lucknow]]. Allama Syed Muhammad Baqir Naqvi Chakralvi and other Shia scholars of Punjab held public debates with many Sunni scholars in the early years of the twentieth century. These debates during the British rule allowed Shias to present their case in the public without fear. The Multan District Gazetteer mentions this phenomenon:\n\n\"''There is organized proselytizing, but every now and then a man is, by conversion or by loan of books, induced to change his sect, and there seems no doubt that the conversions from Sunnism to Shi\u2019ism are more common than the vice versa''\".<ref name=\":25\">Gazetteer of the Multan District, p. 120, (1924).</ref>\n\nAnother factor was the wealth generated by the newly developed [[Punjab Canal Colonies|Canal irrigation system]] made it possible for the Shia elites of the area to spend lavishly on Muharram and build Imambargahs.[[File:1960 Azadari Procession in D I Khan.jpeg|thumb|1960: Muharram Procession in Dera Ismail Khan.]]\nThe Jhang District Gazetteer of 1929 reads:-\n\n''\u201cShi\u2018ism is on the increase in the district.

The 1915 Gazetteer of Mianwali District recorded Shia phobia as follows:\n\n\"''All the Pathan clans, excepting a small number of Shias Kazilbash Pathans in Bhakkar tahsil, are very strict Sunnis and very particular in the matter of prayers, fasts, etc. They have a great hatred of the Shias and Rafzis. An orthodox Pathan regards tazia with the greatest repugnance. The influence of Sunni governors too seems to have led to the very general profession of the Sunni faith by the bulk of the mixed Jat population, though the Biluches have as a rule adhered to the Shia faith''\".<ref>Gazetteer of Mianwali District, pp. 71 - 72, (1915).</ref>\n\n==== Shi'ism in Sindh ====\nMost of the Talpurs, the Mughals, Khojas, Bohras, a considerable population of Kalhoras, Syeds and Baluchis professed Shia faith.<ref>Gazetteer of the Province of Sind, p. 160, (1907).</ref> The Muharram mourning was observed throughout Sindh. The British Gazetteer of 1907 notes:\n\n\"''Among Shias, who regard [[Yazid I|Yazid]] as a usurper and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husain]] as martyrs, it is a season for deep and solemn, or even frenzied, grief. The Sunnis also consider it proper to mourn on the occasion, but in moderation. The mourning commences ten days before the anniversary and [[Ta'zieh|Taziahs]], or Tabuts, that is models of the tomb of Husain at [[Karbala]], are prepared in many houses, sometimes in very imposing and expensive styles. The Mirs, who are Shias and the Sayads of [[Rohri]], [[Sukkur]] and [[Shikarpur District|Shikarpur]] are lavish in their expenditure on these. During the ten days of mourning the religious do not work, but dress in black and devote themselves to lamentation and prayer and listening to recites of the moving story. On the tenth day the tabuts are taken in procession to the sea, or a river or lake, and thrown into the water''\".<ref>Gazetteer of the Province of Sind, p. 240, (1907).</ref> \n\n==== Khairpur Princely State ====\nAfter the British conquest of Sindh in 1843, the Khairpur principality was preserved as a princely state, and it remained so till 1955 when it was dissolved in [[One Unit]] of West Pakistan. The Talpur Mirs patronized the Muharram mourning and build Shia mosques and Imambaras.

He had started to attack [[Hazarajat]] to annexe the area and his forces were committing atrocities against the Shia Hazaras. Meanwhile, the 1888 \u2013 1893 [[1888\u20131893 Uprisings of Hazaras|Hazara uprising]] had begun in Afghanistan, which was ruthlessly suppressed, about half of the Hazara population killed or expelled, their properties confiscated and women and children were sold as slaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minorityrights.org/minorities/hazaras/|title=Hazaras|website=Minority Rights Group|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> Many Hazaras fled to Quetta and started to live there.

They were majorly Ismailis, but a few Twelvers who observed mourning and made tazias or effigies of the Imams. The British Gazetteer noted that the Shias were despised by the Sunnis.<ref>Gazetteer of Las Bela, p. 63, (1907).</ref> In the district of Makran and Kharan, the Shias were known as Lotias, who were Khojas by ethnicity.

They lived along the coastline and engaged in trade.<ref>Gazetteer of Makran and Kharan, p. 109, (1907).</ref>\n\n== Shiaphobia and Sectarian Violence ==\nWhile Shias and Sunnis have lived side-by-side in the subcontinent for almost fifteen centuries, anti-Shia violence has been growing consistently for the past three centuries. Anti-Shi'ism has two aspects: shiaphobic literature and hate-crimes. The anti Shia literature that portrays Shias as religiously heretic, morally corrupt, politically traitors and lesser human beings sets the ideological framework for the violence against them.\n\n=== Historical timeline ===\nIn the medieval period, the Middle East saw bloody clashes between both sects but the subcontinent remained safe and peaceful because of the secular policy of Mughals. Until the end of the seventeenth century AD, only two anti-Shia books were written in India: ''Minhaj al-Din'' by Makhdoom-ul Mulk Mullah Abdullah Sultanpuri and ''Radd-e Rawafiz'' by [[Ahmad Sirhindi|Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi]].<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"Shah Abd al-Aziz\", p. 253, Ma\u2019rifat Publishing House, Canberra, (1982).</ref> As far as armed violence is concerned, the medieval period has only few examples of Shias being killed for their beliefs, most notable incidents are the killing of [[Abdullah Shah Ghazi]] in 769 AD<ref>Derryl N. Maclean,\" Religion and Society in Arab Sind\", ch. 4, BRILL, (1989) {{ISBN|90-04-08551-3}}.</ref>, the destruction of Multan in 1005 AD, the persecution of Shias at the hands of [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Sultan Feroz Shah]] (1351\u20131388 AD)<ref name=\":39\" />, and the target killing of Mullah Ahmad Thathavi in 1589 AD<ref name=\":40\" />. However, the killer of Mulla Ahmad Thathavi was served justice by Emperor Akbar<ref name=\":12\" />. The death of Syed Nurullah Shushtari seems to be politically motivated<ref name=\":7\" />. The region of [[Srinagar]] in Kashmir is an exception in middle ages with ten bloody [[Taraaj-e Shia]] campaigns<ref name=\":14\" />. \n\nHowever, in the eighteenth century AD, the number of polemical writings started to increase.<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"Shah Abd al-Aziz\", p. 255, Ma\u2019rifat Publishing House, Canberra, (1982).</ref> It started with Aurangzeb's discrimination against the Shias. The sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir hated the Shias; he abolished the secular policy of Akbar and tried to establish the superiority of the Sunni sect. He supervised the compilation of an encyclopedia of religious rulings, called fatawa Alamgiri, in which Shias were said to be heretics. The spiritual leader of Bohra Shias, Sayyid Qutb-ud-din, along with his 700 followers were massacred on the orders of Aurangzeb. He banned the tazia processions.<ref>A. Truschke, \"Aurangzeb: The Man and The Myth\", Penguin, (2017).</ref> In the century following his death, polemical literature and sectarian killings increased. \n\n==== Shia vs Sunni power struggle ====\nWhenever a Mughal emperor died, war of succession followed in which elites played a key role. After Aurangzeb's death, when the Shia elites tried to play political role, the Sunni elite used the sectarian polarization created by Aurangzeb to undermine the Shia elite. This created a tug-of-war at the heart of Mughal Empire. Bengal and Awdh came under the rule of the Shia elite and the rest of the states, e.g. Deccan, Rohailkhand, Kashmir, etc., were ruled by Sunni elite. Shah Waliullah (1703 \u2013 1762 AD) was among those Sunni clerics who were patronized by the Sunni elite. He started his career by translating the anti-Shia track of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, ''radd-e-rawafiz'', into Arabic under the title of ''al-muqaddima tus-saniyyah fil intisar al-firqa te-sunniya (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u06c1 \u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0644\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u06c1).''

Although he did not declare them apostates or non-Muslims, but he considered them lesser human beings just like what he would think about Hindus or other non-Muslims. In a letter he advises Sunnis to not greet Shias first, and if a Shia greets them first, their response should be cold.

Shah Abd al-Aziz used to heavily criticise making of taziya and other arts associated with commemoration of Muharram<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, ''A Socio-Intellectual History of Isna Ashari Shi'is in India'', Vol.\u20052, p. 305, Mar'ifat Publishing House, Canberra (1986).</ref>, but he also authored a short treatise entitled ''Sirr al-Shahadatayn (\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u06c1\u0627\u062f\u062a\u06cc\u0646)'', in which he described the commemoration of Muharram as God's will to keep the memory of Imam Hussain's martyrdom alive. He also said that the martyrdom of Imam Hasan and Imam Hussain was, in spirit, the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad. He used to arrange public gatherings in Muharram himself. Rizvi describes:\n\n\"''In a letter dated 1822 CE he wrote about two assemblies which he used to hold in his own house and considered perfectly legal from the Shari\u2019a point of view. One was held on the anniversary of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s demise and the other to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hasan and Imam Hussain on the tenth of Muharram or a day or two earlier. From four to five hundred and up to a thousand people gathered there. They recited durud. After the Shah\u2019s own arrival, the greatness of Imam Hasan and I*mam Hussain, as related in the works of hadith, was described. The prophecies concerning their martyrdom, the circumstances that led to it and the wickedness of those who killed them were also recounted. The elegies on their martyrdom which Umm Salma and the companions of the Prophet had heard, were also described. Those dreadful visions, which Ibn Abbas and the Prophet\u2019s other companions saw relating to the Prophet\u2019s anguish at his grandson\u2019s tragic death, were also recited.

They now had to rely on public funding, the ''chanda''. Secondly, when the British masters decided to introduce modern societal reforms, and everybody became ascribed to a singular identity in census and politically important in voting. Thus, politicization of religion and marking boundaries of the spheres of influence became a financial need of the religious leaders. They started to describe everybody belonging to their sect or religion as one monolithic group of people whose religion was in danger. The third important social change was the printing press which made writing and publishing pamphlets and books easy and cheap. The fourth factor was the railways and postal service; it became easy for communal leaders to travel, communicate and build networks beyond their place of residence. This changed the religious discourse drastically and gave birth to communal and sectarian violence. The puritanical wahhabists had already excluded Azadari from the Sunni Islam, and Arya Samaj and Shudhis started to ask Hindus to refrain from Azadari.\n\nNew sects emerging among Sunnis; e.g. Deobandis, Barelvis, Ahle Hadith, Ahmadis and the Quranists; took extreme positions against Shias in order to prove themselves pure and real spokesmen of Sunni Islam. Shias also started to modify the practice in order to popularize it. A new class of Urdu orators emerged, the khatibs, replacing Mujtahideen. A competition of holding the best majlis and attract participants made the Shia elite to introduce new practices and customs, like ''Zanjirzani,'' ''chup ka tazia'', ''mehndi'' and ''Zuljinah.'' The Shia and Sunni orators started to challenge each other in religious debates and hence earn money as well as publicity, the most famous were Abdul Shakoor Lakhnavi (Sunni) and Maqbool Ahmad Dihlavi (ex-Sunni).<ref>J. Jones, \"Shi\u2019a Islam in Colonial India\", pp. 81 \u2013 99, Cambridge University Press, (2012).</ref> With increasing incidents of violence and having lost political influence in Awdh and Bengal, Shias started to practice ''Taqiyya'' on individual level. Hollister says:- \n\n\"''For some decades the decennial census made a separate enumeration of Shias and Sunnis in some of the Provinces. In 1911 and 1921, most Provinces and states were included but the results were unsatisfactory. For example, in 1921, in the census for Bihar and Orissa, 3711 Shias were enumerated, but in the report of superintendent of Census Operations in the Province, we read that:''\n\n''\u2018It is certain that these figures are not nearly complete, and the reason is that many Shias refused to record themselves as such\u2019.''\n\n''That they would refuse to do so was clearly stated the day before the census was taken, by a Shiite member in the Legislative Council at Patna. An estimate made at that times placed the probable figure at 17,000, or nearly five times the census enumeration. For Patna city, the estimate was for 10,000 against a census figure of 1000. In 1931 and 1941, the effort to make a separate enumeration of Shias was generally discontinued''\"<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn [[Pune]], there used to be more Hindus than Muslims participating in Muharram processions. In the 1890s, some communal Hindu leaders called for a boycott of what they thought was a Muslim festival. Colonial government facilitated them by refusing to issue licences to Hindus to erect the flags. Similarly in Satara, as a result of a campaign run from Pune, Muslims were left alone to observe Muharram.<ref>Gordon Johnson, \"Provincial Politics and Indian Nationalism \u2013 Bombay and the Indian National Congress 1880 \u2013 1915\", p. 85, Cambridge University Press, (2005).</ref> During the Ganpati festival, slogans against Muharram and Muslims were raised, and pamphlets were distributed urging Hindus to arm themselves. One Muslim was killed.<ref>Gordon Johnson, \"Provincial Politics and Indian Nationalism \u2013 Bombay and the Indian National Congress 1880 \u2013 1915\", p. 86, Cambridge University Press, (2005).</ref>\n\nPolemical works were also being authored at a larger scale. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan started writing ''Tuhfa-e-Hasan (\u062a\u062d\u0641\u06c1 \u062d\u0633\u0646)'' against Shias but stopped after writing two volumes because he realized that it was doing harm. Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk wrote ''Ayyat-i-Bayenat (\u0622\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u062a)'', Molana Rashid Ganguhi of Deoband wrote ''Hadiyah-tu-Shia (\u06c1\u062f\u06cc\u06c1 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u06cc\u0639\u06c1)'', Khalil Ahmad Saharanpori of Deoband wrote ''Mitraqah-tul-Karamah (\u0645\u0637\u0631\u0642\u06c1 \u0627\u0644\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0647)'', Mirza Hairat Dihlavi of Deoband wrote ''Kitab-e-Shahdat (\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u06c1\u0627\u062f\u062a)'' in which he attacked Imam Ali and his sons for resisting against Umayyads. \n\nMeanwhile, the number the followers of Syed Ahmad Barelvi, who were commonly known as ''wahabis'', was increasing. Their statistics given in the Gazetteer of the districts of Punjab is representative of the overall spread of the new sect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The %age of ''Wahabis'' in the Muslim Population of Punjab\n!Year\n!District\n!Wahabis\n|-\n|1897\u201398\n|Peshawar\n|0.01%<ref name=\":26\" />\n|-\n|1883\u201384\n|Shahpur\n|0.07%<ref name=\":27\" />\n|-\n|1883\u201384\n|Jhang\n|0.02%<ref name=\":29\" />\n|-\n|1893\u201394\n|Lahore\n|0.03%<ref name=\":28\" />\n|}\nAlthough the numbers are not available for most of the districts, a tendency of increasing followers of Syed Ahmad Barelvi's puritanism can be confirmed. The numbers given in the Gazetteer's are also not exact, because many wahabis preferred to identify as mainstream sunnis. The Lahore Gazetteer notes:\n\n\"''The wahabis are returned very short of their real number; probably many Muhammadans who were wahabis thought it safer not to reveal themselves as such''\"<ref name=\":28\" />.\n\n==== Army of the Sahaba is born ====\n[[File:Madh-e-Sahaba Celebration in Lucknow.jpeg|thumb|Cartoon appearing in Lucknow Punch, an Urdu satirical magazine mocking riots during Muharram 1908.]]\n\nBy the start of the 1900s, the majority of Sunnis still observed Muharram. Molana Abdul Shakoor Lakhnavi devised a clever plan to widen the gulf between the Shias and Sunnis. He started to advocate a celebration of victory of Imam Hussain over Yazid. He established a separate Sunni Imambargah at Phul Katora and asked Sunnis to wear red or yellow dress instead of black, and carry a decorated charyari flag instead of the traditional black alam-e-Abbas. Instead of honouring the Sahaba on their birthdays, he started to arrange public meetings under the banner of bazm-e-siddiqi, bazm-e-farooqi and bazm-e-usmani, in the first ten days of Muharram to revere the first three Caliphs and named it Madh-e-Sahaba. He would discuss the lives of the first three Caliphs and attack Shia beliefs. Shias saw it an attempt to sabotage the remembrance of the tragedy of Karbala and started to recite ''tabarra'' in response.<ref>J. Jones, \"Shi\u2019a Islam in Colonial India\", pp. 100 \u2013 105, Cambridge University Press, (2012).</ref> These ideas resulted in Muharram becoming a feast as well as a battleground. As the government gazette noted: \n\n\"''Shops and booths came to be set up and there were amusements such as swings and merry go rounds. It appears further that the women of the town had begun not only to frequent the route of the tazias but to set up tents (brothels) on the fairground, where they received visitors''\".<ref name=\":17\">V. Dhulipala, \"[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/rallying-the-qaum-the-muslim-league-in-the-united-provinces-19371939/8468C5AFE0DD63CAB799922671ED3511 Rallying the Qaum: The Muslim League in the United Provinces, 1937 \u2013 1939]\", pp. 603 \u2013 640, Modern Asian Studies 44, 3 (2010). </ref>\n\nAccording to Dhulipala;\n\n\"''The Shias took exception to these practices which they felt denigrated the solemnity of these religious occasions which were predominantly for mourning. They, therefore, petitioned the Lucknow District Magistrate to check these practices and to disallow anything which went against the character of these occasions. In response, stringent rules sympathetic to Shia demands were put into place for the Ashra procession of 1906 by the Lucknow District administration. The Sunnis objected to the new rules claiming that unlike the Shias, they regarded the processions as celebrations in honour of an Islamic hero and not as occasions for mourning. The dispute between the two sides was temporarily settled in 1906 with the Lucknow district administration granting a separate site for Sunnis to bury their Karbala.'' \n\n''The Sunnis, however, were now determined to give their processions a character that was distinct to that of the Shia processions. Verses at the time known as Charyari were recited during the Sunni processions. These verses were in praise of the first four Caliphs who were portrayed as friends of the Prophet as well as friends of each other. Since some of these verses \u2018were positively objectionable in that they contained abuse of Shias and of their beliefs\u2019, their recitation was found provocative by the Shias. The Shias retaliated by reciting Tabarra or abuse of the first three Caliphs in their own processions, since they saw them as usurpers who were hostile to the rightful Caliph Ali and his family. These developments marked a watershed in the social relations between these two sects of Islam in the UP. Serious riots broke out in 1907 and 1908 in Lucknow due to the recitation of Charyari and Tabarra by Sunni and Shia processions respectively.''\n\n''Responding to these developments, in 1908, the provincial government set up a committee headed by T.C. Piggott, an ICS officer, who was asked to examine the whole issue, assess the claims of both parties, and to make recommendations. The Piggott committee concluded that the recitation of Charyari verses in an organised way, and converting Tazia processions into Charyari processions, was an \u2018innovation\u2019 since 1906. Such social innovations were deemed to be at the root of civil disturbances in a combustible religious society like India, and the British, in their keenness to maintain law and order, actively discouraged them. Not surprisingly, the Piggott committee recommended prohibiting the recitation of Charyari verses along the \u2018route of any tazia, alam or other Mohammadan procession or in the hearing of such a procession\u2019 on three days of the year \u2013 Ashura, Chhelum and the 21st day of Ramzan''\"<ref name=\":17\" />. \n\nAfter the failure of the Khilafat movement in the 1920s, the political ulema had lost their support in public and Muslims started to follow modern minds like Muhammad Ali Jinnah. To keep themselves relevant, the ulema established a militant Deobandi organisation, Majlis Ahrar-e-Islam, in 1931. They came from neighboring Malihabad, Kanpur, Delhi, Meerut and from as far as Peshawar.<ref name=\":18\">Mushirul Hasan, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4403862 Traditional Rites and Contested Meanings: Sectarian Strife in Colonial Lucknow]\", Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 31, No. 9, pp. 543 \u2013 550 (1996).</ref> This organisation can be considered as predecessor of Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). They first agitated against the Ahmedis in Kashmir and now they were looking for an opportunity. It was provided by Molana Abdul shakoor Lakhnavi who now added Farooqi to his name and had become a follower of Deobandi sect and he had established a seminary in Lucknow in 1931 right on the route of Azadari, called Dar-ul-Muballighin.<ref>J. Jones, \"Shi\u2019a Islam in Colonial India\", pp. 188 \u2013 199, Cambridge University Press, (2012).</ref> Molana Abdul Shakoor Farooqi wrote many books and pamphlets. Shias responded by writing rejoinders. As paper had become available in plenty, these writings spread all over subcontinent and caused incidents of violence, though negligible compared to what was happening in UP. Dhulipala says:\n\n\"''The problem broke out with renewed vigour in 1936 on Ashura day when two Sunnis disobeyed orders and publicly recited Charyari in the city centre of Lucknow. They were arrested and prosecuted, but then on Chhelum day more Sunnis took part in reciting Charyari and fourteen were arrested. This led to a new agitation by the Lucknow Sunnis in favour of reciting these verses publicly, which came to be known as Madhe Sahaba''\"<ref name=\":17\" />.\n\nThe government appointed the Allsop committee which endorsed the decision of the Piggott committee and imposed ban on Madhe Sahaba on the days of Azadari. Jinnah had stopped members of Muslim League from taking sides in the conflict which he termed as a conspiracy to distract Muslims from their real concerns. Liaquat Ali Khan delivered a speech on the floor of UP assembly supporting Madh-e-Sahaba agitation in Muharram.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ahrar.org.pk/ur/naqeeb-rasala/%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%b1%db%8c%da%a9-%d9%85%d8%af%d8%ad-%d8%b5%d8%ad%d8%a7%d8%a8%db%81-%d9%86%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%a8%d8%b2%d8%a7%d8%af%db%81-%d9%84%db%8c%d8%a7%d9%82%d8%aa-%d8%b9%d9%84%db%8c-%d8%ae%d8%a7/|title=\u062a\u062d\u0631\u06cc\u06a9 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0635\u062d\u0627\u0628\u06c1 \u2014 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06c1 \u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0642\u062a \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u062a\u0642\u0631\u06cc\u0631 {{!}} \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref> The Allsop committee report was published in March 1938 and was rejected by the Deobandi ulema.

Though a fervent advocate of secular nationalism and a principled critic of the \u00abtwo-nation theory\u00bb, he stirred sectarian passions unabashedly. He spoke at a public meeting in Lucknow on 17 March 1938 sharing the platform with the firebrand head of the Dar al-Muballighin, Maulvi 'Abdul Shakoor, and Maulana Zafarul Mulk, chief exponent of Madh-e Sahaba in Lucknow''\"<ref name=\":18\" />. \n\n==== From stone pelting to bomb blasts ====\nAzadari in UP was no more peaceful; it would never be the same again. Violence went so far that on Ashura 1940, a Deobandi terrorist attacked the Ashura procession with a bomb. Hollister writes:\n\n\"''Conflicts between Sunnis and Shias at Muharram are not infrequent. Processions in the cities are accompanied by police along fixed lines of march. The following quotations from a single newspaper are not usual. They indicate what might happen if government did not keep the situation under control: \u2018adequate measures avert incidents\u2019, \u2018Muharram passed off peacefully\u2019, \u2018All shops remained closed in . . . in order to avoid incidents\u2019, \u2018Several women offered satyagraha in front of the final procession . . . about twenty miles from Allahabad. They object to the passing of the procession through their fields\u2019, \u2018the police took great precautions to prevent a breach of the peace\u2019, \u2018as a sequel to the cane charge by the police on a Mehndi procession the Moslems . . . did not celebrate the Muharram today. No ta\u2019zia processions were taken out . . . Business was transacted as usual in the Hindu localities\u2019, \u2018Bomb thrown on procession\u2019. Not all of these disturbances spring from sectarian differences, but those differences actuate many fracases. Birdwood says that, in Bombay, where the first four days of Muharram are likely to be devoted to visiting each other's tabut khanas, women and children as well as men are admitted, and members of other communities \u2013 only the Sunnies are denied \u2018simply as a police precaution\u2019''\".<ref>J. N. Hollister, \"The Shi'a of India\", p. 178, Luzac and Co, London, (1953).</ref>\n\nThe main purpose of the army of Sahaba had been achieved: Shias and Sunnis were segregated as Azadari was not safe any more. \n\nCongress wanted to use the sectarian card against Jinnah, who was a Shia, but the more Congress supported the religio-fascists ulema, the more it alienated her from the Muslims and the more the League became popular. The sectarian activities started to fire back. Deobandi ulema were becoming infamous and Muslim masses were disgusted with what the Muslim league interpreted as \u2018divide-and-rule\u2019 policy of Congress. With the Pakistan movement gaining momentum, Muslims put their differences aside and started to respond to the Muslim League\u2019s call of Muslim Unity and establishment of a separate homeland<ref name=\":17\" />. Now Deobandi ulema changed tactics: in 1944 they established a separate organisation to do the dirty work, ''Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'', solely focused on the anti-Shia violence<ref>A. Rieck, \"The Shias of Pakistan\", p. 47, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref> and the main leaders like Madani started to present themselves as inclusive secularists again. The irony is that the same nationalistic secular ulema were writing fake history about Akbar being the cursed infidel and Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi being a notable opposition to his secularism. Archives and history books of Mughal period have lots of material about opposition leaders, e.g. Shiva Ji, but there is no mention of Ahmad Sirhindi.

Although the [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Muslims usually coexist peacefully, [[Sectarian violence in Pakistan|sectarian violence]] is carried out sporadically by radical groups.\n\nWhen General [[Zia ul-Haq]], the former military ruler of [[Pakistan]], introduced new laws to make [[Zakat]] deductions mandatory for every [[Muslim]] during the 1980s, [[Tehrik-e-Jafaria Pakistan|Tehrik-e-Jafaria]] held a large public demonstration in [[Islamabad]] to compel the government to exempt the [[Shia Muslim]] community from this law. This protest resulted in the \"Islamabad Agreement\" in which the government agreed to introduce a separate syllabus for Shia students in public schools, as well as exempt the Shia community from the Zakat law, since Shia consider Zakat as a personal tax (to be paid to the needy) not collectible by the state. According to one senior Pakistani journalist who witnessed these events, Iranian leader [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] played an important role in this agreement being reached, and he sought assurances from General Zia al-Haq that Shia demands would be met.

Many students of Molana Abdul Shakoor Farooqi and Molana Hussain Ahmad Madani migrated to Pakistan and either set up seminaries here or became part of the Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat (TAS) or Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI). They travelled through the length and breadth of the country and called for attacks on Azadari and wrote books and tracts against it. Among them were: Molana Noorul Hasan Bukhari, Molana Dost Muhammad Qureshi, Molana Abdus Sattar Taunsavi, Molana Mufti Mahmood, Molana Abdul Haq Haqqani, Molana Sarfaraz Khan Safdar Gakharvi, and Molana Manzoor Ahmad Naumani. The sectarian clashes of Lucknow had attracted zealous workers of religious parties from Punjab and KPK, but with influx of sectarian clergy, the religious sectarianism and narrow-mindedness of UP was injected to Sufism-oriented Punjab and Sindh.\n\nIn the 1950s, ''Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'' started to arrange public gatherings all over Pakistan to incite violence and mock Shia sanctities. TAS issued an anti-Shia monthly, called ''Da\u2019wat''. In Muharram 1955, attacks took place on at least 25 places in Punjab. In 1956, thousands of armed villagers gathered to attack Azadari in the small town of Shahr Sultan, but were stopped by Police from killing. On 7 August 1957, three Shias were killed during an attack in Sitpur village. Blaming the victim, TAS demanded that government should ban the thousand years old tradition of Azadari, because it caused rioting and bloodshed. In May 1958, a Shia orator Agha Mohsin was target-killed in Bhakkar. Police needed to be appointed to many places, the scenario became more like in the pre-partition Urdu Speaking areas.<ref>A. Rieck, \"The Shias of Pakistan\", pp. 88 \u2013 98, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref> It is important to note here that the Shia ulema were becoming part of religious alliances and not supporting secularism. The syllabus taught at Shia seminaries does not include any course on the history of the subcontinent. Shia clerics don\u2019t have an independent political vision: they were strengthening the puritanism which was going to deprive Shias of basic human rights, like equality, peace and freedom.\n\nAyyub Khan enforced Martial Law in 1958. In the 1960s, Shias started to face state persecution when Azadari processions were banned at some places and the ban was lifted only after protests. In Lahore, the main procession of Mochi gate was forced to change its route. After Martial Law was lifted in 1962, anti-Shia hate propaganda started again, both in the form of books and weekly papers. The Deobandi organisation ''Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'' demanded the Azadari to be limited to Shia ghetto\u2019s. Following Muharram, on 3 June 1963, two Shias were killed and over a hundred injured in an attack on Ashura procession in Lahore. In a small town of Tehri in the Khairpur District of Sindh, 120 Shias were slaughtered. The press did not cover the incidents properly, as the identity of both the perpetrators and the victims, and their objective was concealed. On 16 June, six Deobandi organisations arranged a public meeting in Lahore where they blamed the victims for the violence. In July, a commission was appointed to inquire into the riots. Its report was published in December that year, but it too did not name any individual or organisation. Nobody was punished.<ref>A. Rieck, \"The Shias of Pakistan\", pp. 109 \u2013 114, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref> Mahmood Ahmad Abbasi, Abu Yazid Butt, Qamar-ud-Din Sialvi and others wrote books against Shias.\n\nA wave of socialism spread across Pakistan in the last phase of Ayyub era. The religious mob influenced by the Deobandi ideology was significantly weakened. This brought peace for the Shias and Azadari. No incidents of violence were reported between 1965 and 1979. However, like always, Shia ulema sided with Deobandi clergy against socialism and their fatwas were rejected by the Shias who supported Bhutto\u2019s PPP wholeheartedly. On the other hand, Mufti Mahmood, Molana Samiul Haq, Ihsan Illahi Zaheer and others wrote and spoke furiously against Shias. Molana Samilul Haq wrote in the editorial of ''Al-Haq'' magazine'':''\n\n\"''We must also remember that Shias consider it their religious duty to harm and eliminate the Ahle-Sunna .... the Shias have always conspired to convert Pakistan to a Shia state ... They have been conspiring with our foreign enemies and with the Jews.

Ayyub Khan not only alienated Bengalis but also promoted a historical narrative of Ghulam Ahmad Pervaiz, a conspiracy theorist who attacked Shias in his books like ''Shahkaar-e-Risalat''. Long before Zia, the two-nation theory of Jinnah had been attributed to Ahmad Sirhindi and Shah Waliullah.

It indirectly strengthened the Islamists in Pakistan. Molana Maududi\u2019s ''Jamaat-e-Islami'' shared common ideas of political Islamism. They were the first to support it and publish Khomeini\u2019s writings and speeches in Pakistan. Shias did not support this revolution until 1985, when Molana Arif al-Hussaini assumed leadership of the Shia organisation ''Tehreek-e-Jafariya''. Molana Manzoor Ahmad Naumani had been writing against Jamaat-e-Islami for long time. Fearing that this revolution might actually empower Jamaat-i-Islami and the Shias, he obtained funding from Rabta Aalam-i-Islami of Saudi Arabia and wrote a book against Shias and Khomeini. Meanwhile, Molana Nurul Hasan Bukhari and Attaullah Shah Bukhari had died and ''Taznim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'' (TAS) was in a bad shape. The need for its re-organization was met by another Deobandi cleric of lower rank, Molana Haq Nawaz Jhangvi from Punjab. With same ideology and support base, he chose the name ''Anjuman Sipah-e-Sahaba'' (ASS) and later changed it to ''Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan'' (SSP). \n\nJust as the Soviet forces were leaving Afghanistan, a wave of civil disobedience and protests erupted in Kashmir<ref>J.

To understand the Shia-State relations in Medieval India, it is necessary to look at the nature of Sunni Islam that was brought to this region following the conquest of the Ghurids. Pashtun tribes crossed the Hindu kush mountains to present-day Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhawa province) between 13th and 16th century, and mixed with the locals. The [[Ghori pathans|Ghurid tribe]] had embraced Islam in the times of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]]. The Arab conquest of Persia, that began in 643 AD, reached Khurasan region in 653 AD where local Pushtun tribes offered fierce resistance.<ref name=\":41\">Yahia Baiza, \"'''The Hazaras of Afghanistan and their Shi'a Orientation: An Analytical Historical Survey'''\", Journal of Shi'a Islamic Studies, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 151 - 171, (2014).</ref> The leader of the tribes, Mahawi Suri from the Shansabanian family along with a group of Ghurid chieftains visited the Caliph in Kufa. Upon meeting Ali in 657 AD, they converted to Islam and Mahawi Suri was appointed governor of the region<ref name=\":41\" />.  The most of today's Afghanistan became part of the Muslim world in the reign of [[Umar II|Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]]. [[Ghor Province|Ghur]] in Khurasan was the only part of Muslim world that had defied the [[Umayyad tradition of cursing Ali]].<ref>Muhammad Qasim Farishta, \"''Tarikh-e Farishta''\", Vol. 1, p. 81, Usmania University Press, Haiderabad (1926).</ref> The family of the first Rashidun Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] had resisted the Umayyad rule. His daughter [[Aisha]], his sons [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr|Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] and [[Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr|Abdur Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]], his grandson [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr|Abdullah ibn Zubayr]] and the son of his nephew, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath|Abdur Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Ash'ath]] are the prominent Sunni opponents of the Umayyad rule. The Sunnis of Khurasan were as opposed to the Umayyad rule as the Shias were. They had been instrumental in [[Abbasid Revolution|overthrow]] of the Umayyad dynasty and in Abbasid rule under the Shia commander [[Abu Muslim|Abu Muslim al-Khurasani]]. The influential Muslim theologian, [[Abu Hanifa|Imam Abu Hanifa]] (699 \u2013 767 AD) was born to an Afghan family living in [[Kufa]], he had great regard for the Ahlulbayt and supported the Shi'ite revolt lead by [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. The Delhi empire carried this legacy of attachment with Ahlulbayt and the family of Caliph Abu Bakr. It was during the early years of the Delhi Sultanate that the great [[Sufism in India|Sufi]] saint, [[Moinuddin Chishti]] (1142\u20131236 AD) set his foot in India and converted many locals to Islam. \n\nDuring the early years of the establishment of [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultanate]], a number of Ismaili Shias had settled around Delhi. Ismaili faith was also introduced to Gujrat during these years. Ismaili missionaries spread across Gujrat and managed to establish the [[Nizari|Nizari Ismaili]] [[Khoja]] community and the [[Musta'li|Mustali Bohras]]. Till the reign of [[Iltutmish]], they remained politically inactive, preaching their ideology secretly. In contrast to Ismailis, history does not record the presence of mainstream [[Twelver|Twelver Shi'ism]] in the first phase of Delhi sultanate. One reason could be [[Taqiya]], because the Shias fleeing persecution in the Middle East settled in the subcontinent as local minorities cautious of threats to their survival. The other reason for this is that the love of Ahlulbayt and the commemoration of Muharram by the Sufi's helped the twelver Shias integrate well into the Sunni Muslim minority of India and not claim a separate political identity. For example, during the [[Gwalior]] campaign of Iltutmish, special sermons by the name of \"''tazkirs''\" were delivered in the military camps during the first ten days of Muharram.<ref>Minhaj us-Siraj, pp. 174\u2013175, 249, (1977).\n\nAs cited in: S.

Mir Shams-ud Din arrived in Kashmir in 1481 AD and then returned to Iran. Twenty years later in 1501 AD, he came to Kashmir again, along with 700 Shia Sufis, scholars and missionaries.  In 1505 AD, the King of the [[Shah Mir dynasty|Shah Mir Dynasty]] converted to Shi'ism and so did the Chak clan of Kashmir. He traveled in the valleys of Himalayas and spread Shi'ism from [[Skardu District|Skardu]] to [[Tibet]], converting thousands of Hindus and Buddhists to Shi'ism. In 1516 AD, the Shia [[Chak Dynasty|Chak dynasty]] was established and forcible conversions of Hindus began. In 1532 AD, [[Sultan Said Khan]] dispatched an army under the command of [[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat|Mirza Haider Dughlat]] that attacked Kashmir from [[Kashgar]].<ref name=\":3\">S. A. A.

Soon he suffered a military defeat and fled to the Mughal King [[Humayun]] in Lahore. He returned in 1540 AD, accompanied by Mughal troops, at the invitation of one of the two rival factions that continually fought for power in Kashmir. He put an end to the Chak rule. His reign was a reign of terror and Shias had no choice but to practice ''[[Taqiya|Taqiyya]]''<ref name=\":3\" />. In 1550 AD, he killed Mir Danial, the son of Mir Shams-ud Din Iraqi. This sparked an all-out revolt and he was killed by the end of the same year. Chak dynasty was re-established and in 1586 AD, it merged with the Mughal Empire. Mughals appointed talented officers and contributed greatly to the cultural and economic life of Kashmir. In the following four centuries, Sunni Ulema and militia of the area and abroad, led ten campaigns of terror against Shias known as \"[[Taraaj-e Shia]]\" in the years: 1548 AD, 1585 AD, 1635 AD, 1686 AD, 1719 AD, 1741 AD, 1762 AD, 1801 AD, 1830 AD and 1872 AD; during which the Shia villages were plundered, people slaughtered, women raped, libraries burnt, corpses mutilated and their sacred sites destroyed.<ref name=\":14\">Zaheen, \"'''Shi'ism in Kashmir, 1477\u20131885'''\", International Research Journal of Social Sciences, Vol. 4(4), 74\u201380, April (2015).</ref>\n\n==== Shi'ism in Gilgit Baltistan ====\nIn the 16th century, while [[Gilgit]] was ruled by a Buddhist King Sri Badat, it was invaded by Shamsher of Skardu where Shi'ism had already won converts.

It patronized men of scholarship and hence Shia missionaries and scholars arrived in Deccan. In the phase of decline, it split up into five smaller kingdoms, three of them ruled by Shias.\n\n==== The Adil Shahi dynasty (1489\u20131686 AD) ====\n[[Yusuf Adil Shah]] of Ottoman Turk origin, the adopted son of a Shia scholar [[Mahmud Gawan]], declared autonomy in [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] in 1489 AD after his father was executed by the drunk king, and proclaimed Shi\u2018ism as the state religion in 1502 AD. Bijapur became the first Twelver Shia state in India, with Ja'fari, Hanafi and Sha'fi schools of Islamic law, each applied to its followers. It was the first time in India that ''Shia [[Adhan]]'' was called on the state pulpits and names of the twelve [[The Twelve Imams|Shia Imams]] be included in ''Khutba''. However, he strictly banned the practice of ''[[tabarra]]''.<ref>J. N.

Its founder Sultan [[Quli Qutb Mulk]] was of Turkoman origins. He ordered the ''Khutba'' to be read in the names of the twelve Shia Imams. This kingdom was known for its wealth: it is the only one among the Deccan sultanates to have a currency of gold coins. It became the hub of Shia culture in India, later surpassed only by [[Lucknow]]. [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]] (1565\u20131612 AD) is the first [[Urdu]] poet to have compiled and published a divan<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/quli-qutub-shah/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Quli Qutub Shah|website=Rekhta|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> and also the first to write a ''[[Marsiya]]'' in Urdu. A Shia scholar and scientist, [[Mir Muhammad Momin]], came to Golconda in 1581 AD, and was assigned the task of designing the new capital [[Hyderabad]], which was built in 1591 AD. The first [[Hussainiya|Imambargah]] in India, by the name of \"''[[Badshahi Ashurkhana]]''\" was built along with other monuments and bullrings like [[Charminar]], gardens of Ilahi Mahal, Jama Masjid, Colleges and Hospitals.

He became the first Mughal Emperor of India but died shortly after, in 1530 AD at Agra. Majority of his army commanders were Turani Begs, however, some of them were Iranians. His son Humayun succeeded him, who inherited his military and Sufi-hanafi orientation. However, he met a crushing defeat at the hands of [[Sher Shah Suri]] in 1540, due to disputes among his brothers, and fled to Iran where [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] welcomed him warmly. In 1545 AD, Hamayun with the help of Iranian military genius [[Bairam Khan|Bayram Khan]], launched attack on Qandhar and then seized Kabul. He conquered Delhi in 1555 AD and died the next year, leaving the throne to his young son [[Akbar]], who was to rule India for almost half a century and become one of the greatest Emperors, Plato's ''[[philosopher king]]'' of India. Him and his contemporary in Deccan, [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]], are perhaps the most enlightened and progressive Kings in Indian history. \n\nIn his childhood, two influential Sunni clerics persuaded him to turn a blind eye to their atrocities against Shias. In 1564 AD, a Shia philosopher and mathematician, Mir Murtaza Shirazi, moved to Akbar's court. When he died in 1567 AD, he was buried near the great poet Amir Khusrow. Shaykh Abd un Nabi and Mulla Makhdum-ul Mulk insisted that his dead body be taken out and buried somewhere else, the young Emperor ordered and his grave was dug up. Around 1570 AD, a Shia jurist, Mir Habsh Turbati was killed, and in Kashmir, Akbar's envoy Mirza Muqim.<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"'''A socio-intellectual History of Isna Ashari Shi'is in India'''\", Vol. 1, pp. 212, Mar'ifat Publishing House, Canberra (1986).</ref> The two clerics would not tolerate difference of opinion, and using their influence in the court of the young king, they forced Fayzi and Abu-ul Fazl into going underground. However, soon the king had enough of their bigotry and he started questioning what he had been taught. In 1575 AD, he built a debating hall by the name of [[Ibadat Khana|Ibadatkhana]], where he would hold discussions between men of knowledge from all backgrounds.<ref>S. A. N.

Mughal Emperors except Aurangzeb, were indifferent to sectarian disputes and did not encourage sectarian violence.\n\n==== Shia revival in Punjab ====\n[[File:Shrine of RAJAN SHAH Layyah.JPG|thumb|Shrine of Syed Raju Shah Bukhari in Layyah]]\nIn the sixteenth century, some Shia phobes, the like of Mirza Haider Dughlat, appear to question the expression of love for Ahlulbayt by followers of Sufi'ism. Humayun in Kabul was visited by a cleric Shaykh Hamid who angered the king by asking him why so many of his soldiers had Ali in their names?.<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"'''A socio-intellectual History of Isna Ashari Shi'is in India'''\", Vol. 1, pp. 197, Mar'ifat Publishing House, Canberra (1986).</ref> Shia literature of the time mentions them as Kharjis. In response to this, an influential Shia saint Syed Raju Shah Bukhari of [[Layyah District|Layyah]], launched a campaign against unnecessary ''Taqiyya'' among the Shias and invited them to express their love for Ahlulbayt more openly. Another saint, Syed [[Mehboob Alam Shah|Mahbub-i Alam Shah Jiwana]] (1490 \u2013 1564 AD) settled in a village near Jhang. During this time, many saints and syeds professed their faith and identified as Shias openly. They and their disciples traveled the agricultural heartlands of Punjab and spread the message.<ref>Andreas Rieck, \"'''The Shias of Pakistan'''\", p. 7, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref>\n\n==== Shia intelligentsia in Akbar's court ====\nDuring the reign of the curious and just Akbar the Great (1556\u20131605 AD), men of knowledge from all over India gathered at his [[Ibadat Khana|Ibadat khana]] in the then Maughal capital, [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. Among them were three Shia scholars: [[Fathullah Shirazi|Shah Fathullah Shirazi]], [[Qazi Nurullah Shustari]] and [[Syed Ahmad Nasrallah Thattavi|Mullah Ahmad Thattavi]].\n\nThe foundations of Shi'i theology in present-day Pakistan were laid by [[Qazi Nurullah Shustari]] who stayed in Lahore from 1586 AD to 1599 AD.<ref name=\":6\">S.

In 1584 AD, he moved from Mash'had to India and arrived in Akbar's court the next year. In 1586 AD, Akbar shifted his capital to Lahore and appointed him as the Qazi (chief jurist) of the city. He accepted the position on the condition that he will follow his own judgement (Ijtihad) and not adhere to a particular school of jurisprudence. He reformed the judiciary system and made sure that justice was served to the masses. [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni|Mulla Badauni]] says:\n\n''\"He has reduced the insolent jurists and subtle and crafty judges to order and has eradicated their corruption and has put constraints on their conduct. He is well-known for his neutrality, modesty, piety, justice, virtue, and qualities of a noble man. He is well known for his scholarship, decision power, insight, and clarity of thought.

Sunni Ulema became as powerful as [[Reformation|Pope in medieval Europe]]. Shias had to practice taqiyya if they wished to be treated equally by Aurangzeb.

It seems like the Kharji's of the pre-Akbar era had re-surfaced. During [[Farrukhsiyar|Farukhsiyar]]'s reign (1713\u20131719 AD), the most prominent Sufi saint was Khawaja Muhammad Jafar. A cleric from Multan by the name of Shaykh Abdullah visited Delhi and could not stand the reverence of the twelve Imams on his ''dargah''. He went to Delhi's Friday mosque and started to campaign against the Khawaja, which resulted in violence. When he went back to Multan, he continued the hate speech.

The weakened Mughals now recognized them as part of Mughal Empire. Shahu was given tax collecting power over the large piece of land he already controlled. But the boundaries between the provinces were always disputed, thus Marathas continued their expansion. Mughal Empire started to become decentralized and a number of successor states emerged. Their rulers had considerable autonomy and sought legitimacy by being ceremonially appointed by the Emperor. In 1723 AD, [[Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I|Nizam-ul Mulk]], the strongest Sunni noble at Delhi's court and Mughal Viceroy of the Deccan, declared himself as a shadow king of the area, founding [[Hyderabad State]].

Ahmed Shah Abdali attacked Punjab in 1747 AD and advanced towards Delhi, but the Shia nawab of Awdh and commander of the Mughal army [[Safdar Jang]] defeated him at Manpur near [[Sirhind-Fategarh|Sirhind]]. After this event, the Rohillas attacked Awdh but were pushed back. Safdar Jang made alliance with Marathas against Abdali and his Rohilla agents. Abdali invaded Punjab again by the end of 1748 AD and created havoc. In 1751 AD, he invaded Punjab the third time and this time the Mughal governor Mir Mannu ceded Lahore and Multan to him and regained governorship under Abdali.\n\nWith increasing sectarian strife at the Mughal court, the Sunni faction managed to enthrone [[Alamgir II|Alamgir-II]] as the Emperor, and persuaded him to ban the commemoration of Muharram in Delhi.

For more than a month, afghans went from home to home, taking whatever wealth people had, even if it was buried in the ground, and raping women. Sikh militias attacked Abdali's forces on their way back to Afghanistan, and free some of the Hindu or Sikh women that were taken as sex-slaves. Abdali invaded Delhi in 1759 AD again, looted the city, expelled its Shia population, forcibly married the 16-year-old beauty [[Hazrat Begum|Princess Hazrat Begum]].

The influx of wealth on account of canal irrigation has invested some Sayyid families with added importance, and has proved helpful in spreading Shi\u2018ism\u201d''<ref>Gazetteer of Jhang District 1929 (Lahore, 2000), p. 69.</ref>''.''\n\nThe number of followers of Syed Ahmad Barelvi, known as Wahabis, had started to increase and thus the bitterness between Shias and Sunnis was also on the rise. The 1915 Gazetteer of Mianwali District recorded Shia phobia as follows:\n\n\"''All the Pathan clans, excepting a small number of Shias Kazilbash Pathans in Bhakkar tahsil, are very strict Sunnis and very particular in the matter of prayers, fasts, etc. They have a great hatred of the Shias and Rafzis. An orthodox Pathan regards tazia with the greatest repugnance. The influence of Sunni governors too seems to have led to the very general profession of the Sunni faith by the bulk of the mixed Jat population, though the Biluches have as a rule adhered to the Shia faith''\".<ref>Gazetteer of Mianwali District, pp. 71 - 72, (1915).</ref>\n\n==== Shi'ism in Sindh ====\nMost of the Talpurs, the Mughals, Khojas, Bohras, a considerable population of Kalhoras, Syeds and Baluchis professed Shia faith.<ref>Gazetteer of the Province of Sind, p. 160, (1907).</ref> The Muharram mourning was observed throughout Sindh. The British Gazetteer of 1907 notes:\n\n\"''Among Shias, who regard [[Yazid I|Yazid]] as a usurper and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husain]] as martyrs, it is a season for deep and solemn, or even frenzied, grief. The Sunnis also consider it proper to mourn on the occasion, but in moderation. The mourning commences ten days before the anniversary and [[Ta'zieh|Taziahs]], or Tabuts, that is models of the tomb of Husain at [[Karbala]], are prepared in many houses, sometimes in very imposing and expensive styles. The Mirs, who are Shias and the Sayads of [[Rohri]], [[Sukkur]] and [[Shikarpur District|Shikarpur]] are lavish in their expenditure on these. During the ten days of mourning the religious do not work, but dress in black and devote themselves to lamentation and prayer and listening to recites of the moving story. On the tenth day the tabuts are taken in procession to the sea, or a river or lake, and thrown into the water''\".<ref>Gazetteer of the Province of Sind, p. 240, (1907).</ref> \n\n==== Khairpur Princely State ====\nAfter the British conquest of Sindh in 1843, the Khairpur principality was preserved as a princely state, and it remained so till 1955 when it was dissolved in [[One Unit]] of West Pakistan. The Talpur Mirs patronized the Muharram mourning and build Shia mosques and Imambaras. On of the Shia intellectuals of that era, Mirza Qilich Beg, is known as the pioneer of Sindhi drama and novel<ref name=\":36\" />. Mir [[George Ali Murad Khan]] remains one of the few surviving first class rulers of the old Indian Empire, still holding a public Majlis every Muharram at his sprawling palace, Faiz Mahal.<br />\n\n==== Shi'ism in Balouchistan ====\n[[File:The-Argus-10000-Hazara-slaves-Fri-20-Oct-1893-Pg5.jpg|thumb|Hazara Genocide: An estimated 60% of Hazara population was exterminated during the 1890s genocide of Hazaras in Afghanistan.

He had started to attack [[Hazarajat]] to annexe the area and his forces were committing atrocities against the Shia Hazaras. Meanwhile, the 1888 \u2013 1893 [[1888\u20131893 Uprisings of Hazaras|Hazara uprising]] had begun in Afghanistan, which was ruthlessly suppressed, about half of the Hazara population killed or expelled, their properties confiscated and women and children were sold as slaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minorityrights.org/minorities/hazaras/|title=Hazaras|website=Minority Rights Group|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> Many Hazaras fled to Quetta and started to live there. Some Shias from Punjab also settled there<ref name=\":38\" />.\n\nIn Las Bella district, the trading community of Khojas were Shias, and lived in Miani niabat, Uthal, Ormara, and Shah Liari. They were majorly Ismailis, but a few Twelvers who observed mourning and made tazias or effigies of the Imams. The British Gazetteer noted that the Shias were despised by the Sunnis.<ref>Gazetteer of Las Bela, p. 63, (1907).</ref> In the district of Makran and Kharan, the Shias were known as Lotias, who were Khojas by ethnicity. They were found in Gwadar, Pasni, and Isai. They lived along the coastline and engaged in trade.<ref>Gazetteer of Makran and Kharan, p. 109, (1907).</ref>\n\n== Shiaphobia and Sectarian Violence ==\nWhile Shias and Sunnis have lived side-by-side in the subcontinent for almost fifteen centuries, anti-Shia violence has been growing consistently for the past three centuries. Anti-Shi'ism has two aspects: shiaphobic literature and hate-crimes. The anti Shia literature that portrays Shias as religiously heretic, morally corrupt, politically traitors and lesser human beings sets the ideological framework for the violence against them.\n\n=== Historical timeline ===\nIn the medieval period, the Middle East saw bloody clashes between both sects but the subcontinent remained safe and peaceful because of the secular policy of Mughals. Until the end of the seventeenth century AD, only two anti-Shia books were written in India: ''Minhaj al-Din'' by Makhdoom-ul Mulk Mullah Abdullah Sultanpuri and ''Radd-e Rawafiz'' by [[Ahmad Sirhindi|Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi]].<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"Shah Abd al-Aziz\", p. 253, Ma\u2019rifat Publishing House, Canberra, (1982).</ref> As far as armed violence is concerned, the medieval period has only few examples of Shias being killed for their beliefs, most notable incidents are the killing of [[Abdullah Shah Ghazi]] in 769 AD<ref>Derryl N. Maclean,\" Religion and Society in Arab Sind\", ch. 4, BRILL, (1989) {{ISBN|90-04-08551-3}}.</ref>, the destruction of Multan in 1005 AD, the persecution of Shias at the hands of [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Sultan Feroz Shah]] (1351\u20131388 AD)<ref name=\":39\" />, and the target killing of Mullah Ahmad Thathavi in 1589 AD<ref name=\":40\" />. However, the killer of Mulla Ahmad Thathavi was served justice by Emperor Akbar<ref name=\":12\" />. The death of Syed Nurullah Shushtari seems to be politically motivated<ref name=\":7\" />. The region of [[Srinagar]] in Kashmir is an exception in middle ages with ten bloody [[Taraaj-e Shia]] campaigns<ref name=\":14\" />. \n\nHowever, in the eighteenth century AD, the number of polemical writings started to increase.<ref>S. A. A. Rizvi, \"Shah Abd al-Aziz\", p. 255, Ma\u2019rifat Publishing House, Canberra, (1982).</ref> It started with Aurangzeb's discrimination against the Shias. The sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir hated the Shias; he abolished the secular policy of Akbar and tried to establish the superiority of the Sunni sect. He supervised the compilation of an encyclopedia of religious rulings, called fatawa Alamgiri, in which Shias were said to be heretics. The spiritual leader of Bohra Shias, Sayyid Qutb-ud-din, along with his 700 followers were massacred on the orders of Aurangzeb. He banned the tazia processions.<ref>A. Truschke, \"Aurangzeb: The Man and The Myth\", Penguin, (2017).</ref> In the century following his death, polemical literature and sectarian killings increased. \n\n==== Shia vs Sunni power struggle ====\nWhenever a Mughal emperor died, war of succession followed in which elites played a key role. After Aurangzeb's death, when the Shia elites tried to play political role, the Sunni elite used the sectarian polarization created by Aurangzeb to undermine the Shia elite. This created a tug-of-war at the heart of Mughal Empire. Bengal and Awdh came under the rule of the Shia elite and the rest of the states, e.g. Deccan, Rohailkhand, Kashmir, etc., were ruled by Sunni elite. Shah Waliullah (1703 \u2013 1762 AD) was among those Sunni clerics who were patronized by the Sunni elite. He started his career by translating the anti-Shia track of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, ''radd-e-rawafiz'', into Arabic under the title of ''al-muqaddima tus-saniyyah fil intisar al-firqa te-sunniya (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u06c1 \u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0644\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u06c1).'' He continued to criticise the Shias in his books like ''Qurat-ul Ainain'' (\u0642\u0631\u0627\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0646), ''Azalah-tul Khafa (\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0644\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u0627)'', ''Fayyuz-ul Haramain'' (\u0641\u06cc\u0648\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646), etc.<ref name=\":19\">Khaled Ahmed, \"Sectarian War\", pp. 12 \u2013 14, Oxford University press, (2012).</ref><ref>S.

Although he did not declare them apostates or non-Muslims, but he considered them lesser human beings just like what he would think about Hindus or other non-Muslims. In a letter he advises Sunnis to not greet Shias first, and if a Shia greets them first, their response should be cold. In his view, Sunnis should not marry Shias, avoid eating their food and the animals slaughtered by a Shia.<ref name=\":33\">S. A. A.

Rizvi, ''A Socio-Intellectual History of Isna Ashari Shi'is in India'', Vol.\u20052, p. 305, Mar'ifat Publishing House, Canberra (1986).</ref>, but he also authored a short treatise entitled ''Sirr al-Shahadatayn (\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u06c1\u0627\u062f\u062a\u06cc\u0646)'', in which he described the commemoration of Muharram as God's will to keep the memory of Imam Hussain's martyrdom alive. He also said that the martyrdom of Imam Hasan and Imam Hussain was, in spirit, the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad. He used to arrange public gatherings in Muharram himself. Rizvi describes:\n\n\"''In a letter dated 1822 CE he wrote about two assemblies which he used to hold in his own house and considered perfectly legal from the Shari\u2019a point of view. One was held on the anniversary of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s demise and the other to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hasan and Imam Hussain on the tenth of Muharram or a day or two earlier.

They now had to rely on public funding, the ''chanda''. Secondly, when the British masters decided to introduce modern societal reforms, and everybody became ascribed to a singular identity in census and politically important in voting. Thus, politicization of religion and marking boundaries of the spheres of influence became a financial need of the religious leaders. They started to describe everybody belonging to their sect or religion as one monolithic group of people whose religion was in danger. The third important social change was the printing press which made writing and publishing pamphlets and books easy and cheap. The fourth factor was the railways and postal service; it became easy for communal leaders to travel, communicate and build networks beyond their place of residence. This changed the religious discourse drastically and gave birth to communal and sectarian violence. The puritanical wahhabists had already excluded Azadari from the Sunni Islam, and Arya Samaj and Shudhis started to ask Hindus to refrain from Azadari.\n\nNew sects emerging among Sunnis; e.g. Deobandis, Barelvis, Ahle Hadith, Ahmadis and the Quranists; took extreme positions against Shias in order to prove themselves pure and real spokesmen of Sunni Islam. Shias also started to modify the practice in order to popularize it. A new class of Urdu orators emerged, the khatibs, replacing Mujtahideen. A competition of holding the best majlis and attract participants made the Shia elite to introduce new practices and customs, like ''Zanjirzani,'' ''chup ka tazia'', ''mehndi'' and ''Zuljinah.'' The Shia and Sunni orators started to challenge each other in religious debates and hence earn money as well as publicity, the most famous were Abdul Shakoor Lakhnavi (Sunni) and Maqbool Ahmad Dihlavi (ex-Sunni).<ref>J. Jones, \"Shi\u2019a Islam in Colonial India\", pp. 81 \u2013 99, Cambridge University Press, (2012).</ref> With increasing incidents of violence and having lost political influence in Awdh and Bengal, Shias started to practice ''Taqiyya'' on individual level. Hollister says:- \n\n\"''For some decades the decennial census made a separate enumeration of Shias and Sunnis in some of the Provinces. In 1911 and 1921, most Provinces and states were included but the results were unsatisfactory. For example, in 1921, in the census for Bihar and Orissa, 3711 Shias were enumerated, but in the report of superintendent of Census Operations in the Province, we read that:''\n\n''\u2018It is certain that these figures are not nearly complete, and the reason is that many Shias refused to record themselves as such\u2019.''\n\n''That they would refuse to do so was clearly stated the day before the census was taken, by a Shiite member in the Legislative Council at Patna. An estimate made at that times placed the probable figure at 17,000, or nearly five times the census enumeration. For Patna city, the estimate was for 10,000 against a census figure of 1000. In 1931 and 1941, the effort to make a separate enumeration of Shias was generally discontinued''\"<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn [[Pune]], there used to be more Hindus than Muslims participating in Muharram processions. In the 1890s, some communal Hindu leaders called for a boycott of what they thought was a Muslim festival. Colonial government facilitated them by refusing to issue licences to Hindus to erect the flags. Similarly in Satara, as a result of a campaign run from Pune, Muslims were left alone to observe Muharram.<ref>Gordon Johnson, \"Provincial Politics and Indian Nationalism \u2013 Bombay and the Indian National Congress 1880 \u2013 1915\", p. 85, Cambridge University Press, (2005).</ref> During the Ganpati festival, slogans against Muharram and Muslims were raised, and pamphlets were distributed urging Hindus to arm themselves.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan started writing ''Tuhfa-e-Hasan (\u062a\u062d\u0641\u06c1 \u062d\u0633\u0646)'' against Shias but stopped after writing two volumes because he realized that it was doing harm. Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk wrote ''Ayyat-i-Bayenat (\u0622\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u062a)'', Molana Rashid Ganguhi of Deoband wrote ''Hadiyah-tu-Shia (\u06c1\u062f\u06cc\u06c1 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u06cc\u0639\u06c1)'', Khalil Ahmad Saharanpori of Deoband wrote ''Mitraqah-tul-Karamah (\u0645\u0637\u0631\u0642\u06c1 \u0627\u0644\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0647)'', Mirza Hairat Dihlavi of Deoband wrote ''Kitab-e-Shahdat (\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u06c1\u0627\u062f\u062a)'' in which he attacked Imam Ali and his sons for resisting against Umayyads. \n\nMeanwhile, the number the followers of Syed Ahmad Barelvi, who were commonly known as ''wahabis'', was increasing.

The numbers given in the Gazetteer's are also not exact, because many wahabis preferred to identify as mainstream sunnis. The Lahore Gazetteer notes:\n\n\"''The wahabis are returned very short of their real number; probably many Muhammadans who were wahabis thought it safer not to reveal themselves as such''\"<ref name=\":28\" />.\n\n==== Army of the Sahaba is born ====\n[[File:Madh-e-Sahaba Celebration in Lucknow.jpeg|thumb|Cartoon appearing in Lucknow Punch, an Urdu satirical magazine mocking riots during Muharram 1908.]]\n\nBy the start of the 1900s, the majority of Sunnis still observed Muharram. Molana Abdul Shakoor Lakhnavi devised a clever plan to widen the gulf between the Shias and Sunnis. He started to advocate a celebration of victory of Imam Hussain over Yazid. He established a separate Sunni Imambargah at Phul Katora and asked Sunnis to wear red or yellow dress instead of black, and carry a decorated charyari flag instead of the traditional black alam-e-Abbas. Instead of honouring the Sahaba on their birthdays, he started to arrange public meetings under the banner of bazm-e-siddiqi, bazm-e-farooqi and bazm-e-usmani, in the first ten days of Muharram to revere the first three Caliphs and named it Madh-e-Sahaba. He would discuss the lives of the first three Caliphs and attack Shia beliefs. Shias saw it an attempt to sabotage the remembrance of the tragedy of Karbala and started to recite ''tabarra'' in response.<ref>J. Jones, \"Shi\u2019a Islam in Colonial India\", pp. 100 \u2013 105, Cambridge University Press, (2012).</ref> These ideas resulted in Muharram becoming a feast as well as a battleground. As the government gazette noted: \n\n\"''Shops and booths came to be set up and there were amusements such as swings and merry go rounds. It appears further that the women of the town had begun not only to frequent the route of the tazias but to set up tents (brothels) on the fairground, where they received visitors''\".<ref name=\":17\">V.

They, therefore, petitioned the Lucknow District Magistrate to check these practices and to disallow anything which went against the character of these occasions. In response, stringent rules sympathetic to Shia demands were put into place for the Ashra procession of 1906 by the Lucknow District administration. The Sunnis objected to the new rules claiming that unlike the Shias, they regarded the processions as celebrations in honour of an Islamic hero and not as occasions for mourning. The dispute between the two sides was temporarily settled in 1906 with the Lucknow district administration granting a separate site for Sunnis to bury their Karbala.'' \n\n''The Sunnis, however, were now determined to give their processions a character that was distinct to that of the Shia processions. Verses at the time known as Charyari were recited during the Sunni processions. These verses were in praise of the first four Caliphs who were portrayed as friends of the Prophet as well as friends of each other. Since some of these verses \u2018were positively objectionable in that they contained abuse of Shias and of their beliefs\u2019, their recitation was found provocative by the Shias. The Shias retaliated by reciting Tabarra or abuse of the first three Caliphs in their own processions, since they saw them as usurpers who were hostile to the rightful Caliph Ali and his family. These developments marked a watershed in the social relations between these two sects of Islam in the UP. Serious riots broke out in 1907 and 1908 in Lucknow due to the recitation of Charyari and Tabarra by Sunni and Shia processions respectively.''\n\n''Responding to these developments, in 1908, the provincial government set up a committee headed by T.C. Piggott, an ICS officer, who was asked to examine the whole issue, assess the claims of both parties, and to make recommendations. The Piggott committee concluded that the recitation of Charyari verses in an organised way, and converting Tazia processions into Charyari processions, was an \u2018innovation\u2019 since 1906. Such social innovations were deemed to be at the root of civil disturbances in a combustible religious society like India, and the British, in their keenness to maintain law and order, actively discouraged them. Not surprisingly, the Piggott committee recommended prohibiting the recitation of Charyari verses along the \u2018route of any tazia, alam or other Mohammadan procession or in the hearing of such a procession\u2019 on three days of the year \u2013 Ashura, Chhelum and the 21st day of Ramzan''\"<ref name=\":17\" />. \n\nAfter the failure of the Khilafat movement in the 1920s, the political ulema had lost their support in public and Muslims started to follow modern minds like Muhammad Ali Jinnah. To keep themselves relevant, the ulema established a militant Deobandi organisation, Majlis Ahrar-e-Islam, in 1931. They came from neighboring Malihabad, Kanpur, Delhi, Meerut and from as far as Peshawar.<ref name=\":18\">Mushirul Hasan, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4403862 Traditional Rites and Contested Meanings: Sectarian Strife in Colonial Lucknow]\", Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 31, No. 9, pp. 543 \u2013 550 (1996).</ref> This organisation can be considered as predecessor of Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP).

Jones, \"Shi\u2019a Islam in Colonial India\", pp. 188 \u2013 199, Cambridge University Press, (2012).</ref> Molana Abdul Shakoor Farooqi wrote many books and pamphlets. Shias responded by writing rejoinders. As paper had become available in plenty, these writings spread all over subcontinent and caused incidents of violence, though negligible compared to what was happening in UP. Dhulipala says:\n\n\"''The problem broke out with renewed vigour in 1936 on Ashura day when two Sunnis disobeyed orders and publicly recited Charyari in the city centre of Lucknow. They were arrested and prosecuted, but then on Chhelum day more Sunnis took part in reciting Charyari and fourteen were arrested. This led to a new agitation by the Lucknow Sunnis in favour of reciting these verses publicly, which came to be known as Madhe Sahaba''\"<ref name=\":17\" />.\n\nThe government appointed the Allsop committee which endorsed the decision of the Piggott committee and imposed ban on Madhe Sahaba on the days of Azadari. Jinnah had stopped members of Muslim League from taking sides in the conflict which he termed as a conspiracy to distract Muslims from their real concerns.

Though a fervent advocate of secular nationalism and a principled critic of the \u00abtwo-nation theory\u00bb, he stirred sectarian passions unabashedly. He spoke at a public meeting in Lucknow on 17 March 1938 sharing the platform with the firebrand head of the Dar al-Muballighin, Maulvi 'Abdul Shakoor, and Maulana Zafarul Mulk, chief exponent of Madh-e Sahaba in Lucknow''\"<ref name=\":18\" />. \n\n==== From stone pelting to bomb blasts ====\nAzadari in UP was no more peaceful; it would never be the same again. Violence went so far that on Ashura 1940, a Deobandi terrorist attacked the Ashura procession with a bomb. Hollister writes:\n\n\"''Conflicts between Sunnis and Shias at Muharram are not infrequent. Processions in the cities are accompanied by police along fixed lines of march. The following quotations from a single newspaper are not usual. They indicate what might happen if government did not keep the situation under control: \u2018adequate measures avert incidents\u2019, \u2018Muharram passed off peacefully\u2019, \u2018All shops remained closed in . . . in order to avoid incidents\u2019, \u2018Several women offered satyagraha in front of the final procession . . . about twenty miles from Allahabad.

No ta\u2019zia processions were taken out . . . Business was transacted as usual in the Hindu localities\u2019, \u2018Bomb thrown on procession\u2019. Not all of these disturbances spring from sectarian differences, but those differences actuate many fracases. Birdwood says that, in Bombay, where the first four days of Muharram are likely to be devoted to visiting each other's tabut khanas, women and children as well as men are admitted, and members of other communities \u2013 only the Sunnies are denied \u2018simply as a police precaution\u2019''\".<ref>J.

The sectarian activities started to fire back. Deobandi ulema were becoming infamous and Muslim masses were disgusted with what the Muslim league interpreted as \u2018divide-and-rule\u2019 policy of Congress. With the Pakistan movement gaining momentum, Muslims put their differences aside and started to respond to the Muslim League\u2019s call of Muslim Unity and establishment of a separate homeland<ref name=\":17\" />. Now Deobandi ulema changed tactics: in 1944 they established a separate organisation to do the dirty work, ''Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'', solely focused on the anti-Shia violence<ref>A. Rieck, \"The Shias of Pakistan\", p. 47, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref> and the main leaders like Madani started to present themselves as inclusive secularists again. The irony is that the same nationalistic secular ulema were writing fake history about Akbar being the cursed infidel and Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi being a notable opposition to his secularism. Archives and history books of Mughal period have lots of material about opposition leaders, e.g. Shiva Ji, but there is no mention of Ahmad Sirhindi. It was Molana Azad who first crafted a hero out of Ahmad Sirhindi and later this fabrication was carried on by all Deobandi historians.<ref>Mubarak Ali, \"''Almiyah-i-Tarikh''\", Ch. 9 & 10, Fiction House, Lahore, (2012).</ref> Some others, like ''Shabbir Ahmad Usmani'', joined the League and when failed to snatch leadership from Jinnah, formed a new party in 1946, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) which would become the first opposition party after the foundation of Pakistan.\n\n== Shi'ism in Modern Pakistan ==\nAlthough the overwhelming majority of Pakistani Shia Muslims belong to [[Ithna 'ashariyah]] school, there are significant minorities of [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]]s ([[Aga Khan]]is) and the smaller [[Mustaali]] Dawoodi Bohra and [[Sulaimani Bohra]] branches.<ref name=\"Shia resistance and revival\">{{cite news|url=http://herald.dawn.com/news/1153276/heart-of-darkness-shia-resistance-and-revival-in-pakistan|title=Heart of darkness: Shia resistance and revival in Pakistan|date=29 October 2015|work=[[Herald (Pakistan)]]|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref>The distribution of Shia population is uneven.

Many students of Molana Abdul Shakoor Farooqi and Molana Hussain Ahmad Madani migrated to Pakistan and either set up seminaries here or became part of the Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat (TAS) or Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI). They travelled through the length and breadth of the country and called for attacks on Azadari and wrote books and tracts against it. Among them were: Molana Noorul Hasan Bukhari, Molana Dost Muhammad Qureshi, Molana Abdus Sattar Taunsavi, Molana Mufti Mahmood, Molana Abdul Haq Haqqani, Molana Sarfaraz Khan Safdar Gakharvi, and Molana Manzoor Ahmad Naumani. The sectarian clashes of Lucknow had attracted zealous workers of religious parties from Punjab and KPK, but with influx of sectarian clergy, the religious sectarianism and narrow-mindedness of UP was injected to Sufism-oriented Punjab and Sindh.\n\nIn the 1950s, ''Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'' started to arrange public gatherings all over Pakistan to incite violence and mock Shia sanctities. TAS issued an anti-Shia monthly, called ''Da\u2019wat''. In Muharram 1955, attacks took place on at least 25 places in Punjab. In 1956, thousands of armed villagers gathered to attack Azadari in the small town of Shahr Sultan, but were stopped by Police from killing. On 7 August 1957, three Shias were killed during an attack in Sitpur village. Blaming the victim, TAS demanded that government should ban the thousand years old tradition of Azadari, because it caused rioting and bloodshed. In May 1958, a Shia orator Agha Mohsin was target-killed in Bhakkar. Police needed to be appointed to many places, the scenario became more like in the pre-partition Urdu Speaking areas.<ref>A. Rieck, \"The Shias of Pakistan\", pp. 88 \u2013 98, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref> It is important to note here that the Shia ulema were becoming part of religious alliances and not supporting secularism. The syllabus taught at Shia seminaries does not include any course on the history of the subcontinent. Shia clerics don\u2019t have an independent political vision: they were strengthening the puritanism which was going to deprive Shias of basic human rights, like equality, peace and freedom.\n\nAyyub Khan enforced Martial Law in 1958. In the 1960s, Shias started to face state persecution when Azadari processions were banned at some places and the ban was lifted only after protests. In Lahore, the main procession of Mochi gate was forced to change its route. After Martial Law was lifted in 1962, anti-Shia hate propaganda started again, both in the form of books and weekly papers. The Deobandi organisation ''Tanzim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'' demanded the Azadari to be limited to Shia ghetto\u2019s. Following Muharram, on 3 June 1963, two Shias were killed and over a hundred injured in an attack on Ashura procession in Lahore. In a small town of Tehri in the Khairpur District of Sindh, 120 Shias were slaughtered. The press did not cover the incidents properly, as the identity of both the perpetrators and the victims, and their objective was concealed. On 16 June, six Deobandi organisations arranged a public meeting in Lahore where they blamed the victims for the violence. In July, a commission was appointed to inquire into the riots. Its report was published in December that year, but it too did not name any individual or organisation. Nobody was punished.<ref>A. Rieck, \"The Shias of Pakistan\", pp. 109 \u2013 114, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref> Mahmood Ahmad Abbasi, Abu Yazid Butt, Qamar-ud-Din Sialvi and others wrote books against Shias.\n\nA wave of socialism spread across Pakistan in the last phase of Ayyub era. The religious mob influenced by the Deobandi ideology was significantly weakened. This brought peace for the Shias and Azadari. No incidents of violence were reported between 1965 and 1979. However, like always, Shia ulema sided with Deobandi clergy against socialism and their fatwas were rejected by the Shias who supported Bhutto\u2019s PPP wholeheartedly. On the other hand, Mufti Mahmood, Molana Samiul Haq, Ihsan Illahi Zaheer and others wrote and spoke furiously against Shias. Molana Samilul Haq wrote in the editorial of ''Al-Haq'' magazine'':''\n\n\"''We must also remember that Shias consider it their religious duty to harm and eliminate the Ahle-Sunna .... the Shias have always conspired to convert Pakistan to a Shia state ...

Ayyub Khan not only alienated Bengalis but also promoted a historical narrative of Ghulam Ahmad Pervaiz, a conspiracy theorist who attacked Shias in his books like ''Shahkaar-e-Risalat''. Long before Zia, the two-nation theory of Jinnah had been attributed to Ahmad Sirhindi and Shah Waliullah. These hate preachers were presented as heroes and real founders of Pakistan in Syllabus<ref name=\":19\" />.\n\nOther significant event was the Islamic revolution of Iran. It indirectly strengthened the Islamists in Pakistan. Molana Maududi\u2019s ''Jamaat-e-Islami'' shared common ideas of political Islamism. They were the first to support it and publish Khomeini\u2019s writings and speeches in Pakistan. Shias did not support this revolution until 1985, when Molana Arif al-Hussaini assumed leadership of the Shia organisation ''Tehreek-e-Jafariya''. Molana Manzoor Ahmad Naumani had been writing against Jamaat-e-Islami for long time. Fearing that this revolution might actually empower Jamaat-i-Islami and the Shias, he obtained funding from Rabta Aalam-i-Islami of Saudi Arabia and wrote a book against Shias and Khomeini. Meanwhile, Molana Nurul Hasan Bukhari and Attaullah Shah Bukhari had died and ''Taznim-e-Ahle-Sunnat'' (TAS) was in a bad shape. The need for its re-organization was met by another Deobandi cleric of lower rank, Molana Haq Nawaz Jhangvi from Punjab. With same ideology and support base, he chose the name ''Anjuman Sipah-e-Sahaba'' (ASS) and later changed it to ''Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan'' (SSP). \n\nJust as the Soviet forces were leaving Afghanistan, a wave of civil disobedience and protests erupted in Kashmir<ref>J.

Pakistan decided to send in the Jihadis trained for Afghan Jihad. The followers of [[Syed Ahmad Barelvi]]'s puritanical form of Islam were trained at [[Balakot]], the place where he was killed while fleeing the joint Sikh-Pashtun attack in 1831. New organisations, like Hizbul Mujahideen, were set up, but their members were drawn from the ideological spheres of Deobandi seminaries and Jamaat-e-islami.<ref>Khaled Ahmad, \"Sectarian War\", pp. 133 - 135, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref> This made matters worse for Shias in Pakistan, as the jihadis trained for Kashmir used to come home and act as part-time sectarian terrorists.

This happens when the media either does not report Shia killing at all or deliberately hides Shia victims\u2019 sectarian identity. By obfuscation I mean that the media portrays Shia killing in terms of a Shia\u2013Sunni binary in which both sects are shown to be equally involved in violence. By justification I mean that the media portrays the Shias as heretics, blasphemers, and agents provocateurs operating on behalf of foreign powers and thus deserving of violence being done to them''\"<ref name=\":34\" />. \n\nKhaled Ahmed argues that it is because the owners of the media houses and the manpower employed there is overwhelmingly Sunni, and that there is a 'sense of shame' that stops them from openly talking about the problem.<ref>Khaled Ahmed, \"Sectarian War\", pp. xxv - xxvi, Oxford University Press, (2015).</ref>\n\n== Shi'ism in Modern India ==\n{{see also|Azadari in Lucknow}}[[File:Bara Imambara Lucknow.jpg|thumb|500x500px|[[Asafi Imambara]] Lucknow, built by Nawab Asaf ud Daulah one of the largest [[Imambara]] of [[India]]]]\nIn India, the Shia population is distributed unevenly.
