Most commonly, the term is used to describe a [[farm]] vehicle that provides the power and traction to [[mechanization|mechanize]] agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) [[tillage]], but nowadays a great variety of tasks.

A large [[flywheel]] was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven. In the 1850s, [[John Fowler (agricultural engineer)|John Fowler]] used a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine to drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage to cultivation.\n\nIn parallel with the early portable engine development, many engineers attempted to make them self-propelled \u2013 the fore-runners of the [[traction engine]]. In most cases this was achieved by fitting a sprocket on the end of the crankshaft, and running a chain from this to a larger sprocket on the rear axle. These experiments met with mixed success.<ref name=Lane2>{{cite book|last= Lane |first= Michael R. |title= Pride of the Road |page= 56}}</ref> The first proper [[traction engine]], in the form recognisable today, was developed in 1859 when British engineer [[Aveling and Porter|Thomas Aveling]] modified a [[Clayton & Shuttleworth]] [[portable engine]], which had to be hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one.

It was widely adopted for agricultural use. The first tractors were steam-powered [[ploughing engine|plowing engine]]s. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. In Britain [[Mann\u2019s Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company|Mann's]] and [[Richard Garrett & Sons|Garrett]] developed [[steam tractor]]s for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the [[United States]], where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered [[agricultural engine]]s remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/machines_04.html |title= Tractors in the 1930s}}</ref>\n\n=== Gasoline-powered tractor ===\n[[File:Ivel Tractor 1902.JPG|thumb|right|[[Dan Albone]] with his 1902 prototype Ivel Agricultural Motor, the first successful gasoline-powered tractor]]\n[[File:Line of tractors ploughing (4520565207).jpg|thumb|Line of tractors plowing a field in the 1940s]]\n\nIn 1892, [[John Froelich]] invented and built the first gasoline/petrol-powered tractor in [[Clayton County, Iowa]], US.<ref>{{cite book|title=The John Deere Tractor Legacy|publisher=Voyageur Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cJeffKoriEC&pg=PA45|page=45|isbn=9781610605298}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Vintage Farm Tractors|publisher=Voyageur Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twt3arApXLMC&pg=PA14|page=14|isbn=9781610605649}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Xulon Press|publisher=Xulon Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtgl7YKNFQ0C&pg=PA42|isbn=978-1-59160-134-0|date=June 2002}}</ref> A Van Duzen single-cylinder gasoline engine was mounted on a Robinson engine chassis, which could be controlled and propelled by Froelich's gear box.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ultimate John Deere: The History of the Big Green Machines |publisher=Voyageur Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNXJvfiOqDsC&pg=PA52|page=52|isbn=9781610605588|year=2001}}</ref> After receiving a patent, Froelich started up the [[Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company]] and invested all of his assets.

While the earlier, heavier tractors were initially very successful, it became increasingly apparent at this time that the weight of a large supporting frame was less efficient than lighter designs.  Henry Ford introduced a light-weight, mass-produced design which largely displaced the heavier designs. Some companies halfheartedly followed suit with mediocre designs, as if to disprove the concept, but they were largely unsuccessful in that endeavor.<ref>Oliver Hart-Parr - C.H. Wendel, Krause Publications, November 29, 2011</ref>\n\nWhile unpopular at first, these gasoline-powered machines began to catch on in the 1910s, when they became smaller and more affordable.<ref name=\"Rumely1910\">{{Harvnb|Rumely|1910}}.</ref> [[Henry Ford]] introduced the [[Fordson]], a wildly popular mass-produced tractor, in 1917. They were built in the U.S., Ireland, England and Russia, and by 1923, Fordson had 77% of the U.S. market. The Fordson dispensed with a frame, using the strength of the engine block to hold the machine together. By the 1920s, tractors with gasoline-powered [[internal combustion engine]]s had become the norm.\n\n[[File:Trattore Cassani mod 40HP IMG 3337 Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|left|Tractor Cassani model 40HP, at the [[Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] of Milan]]\n\nThe first three-point hitches were experimented with in 1917, however it was not until [[Harry Ferguson]] applied for a British patent for his [[three-point hitch]] in 1926 that they became popular. a three-point attachment of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The [[Ferguson-Brown Company]] produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor with a Ferguson-designed [[hydraulic]] hitch. In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the [[Ford N-Series tractor|Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor]]. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch attachment system among farmers around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used to power three point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.\n\n== Farm tractor design, power and transmission ==\n\n=== Tractor configurations ===\nTractors can be generally classified by number of axles or wheels, with main categories of [[two-wheel tractor]]s (single-axle tractors) and four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors); more axles are possible but uncommon. Among four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors), most are [[two-wheel drive]] (usually [[rear wheel drive|at the rear]]); but many are two-wheel drive with front wheel assist, [[four-wheel drive]] (often with articulated steering), or [[continuous track|track]] tractors (with steel or rubber tracks).\n\n[[File:Volvo T 25.1.jpg|thumb|200px|Volvo T25, 1956, gasoline tractor]]\nThe classic farm tractor is a simple open [[vehicle]], with two very large driving wheels on an axle below and slightly behind a single seat (the seat and [[steering]] wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine in front of the driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for reasons of operator safety and comfort.\n\nIn some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the [[Caterpillar, Inc.|\"Caterpillar\"]] or [[crawler tractor|\"crawler\"]] type of tracked tractor became popular in the 1930s, due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and separate track clutches operated by levers rather than a steering wheel.\n\n[[File:Modern-tractor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A modern 4-wheel drive [[farm]] tractor in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] ]]\nFour-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard \"two large, two small\" configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the trailing unit is not steered separately.\n\n[[File:Wheat Planting Rig May 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern steerable all-tracked power unit planting wheat in North Dakota]]\nIn the early 21st century, articulated or non-articulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the replacement of wheels or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.\n\n=== Engine and fuels ===\nThe predecessors of modern tractors, traction engines, used [[diesel engine ]]s for power.\n\n==== Gasoline and kerosene ====\nSince the turn of the 20th century, [[internal combustion engine]]s have been the power source of choice. Between 1900 and 1960, [[gasoline]] was the predominant fuel, with [[kerosene]] (the [[Rumely Oil Pull]] was the most notable of this kind) and [[ethanol]] being common alternatives. Generally, one engine could burn any of those, although cold starting was easiest on gasoline. Often, a small auxiliary fuel tank was available to hold gasoline for cold starting and warm-up, while the main fuel tank held whatever fuel was most convenient or least expensive for the particular farmer. In the United Kingdom, a gasoline-kerosene engine is known as a [[petrol-paraffin engine]].\n\n==== Diesel ====\n[[Dieselisation]] gained momentum starting in the 1960s, and modern farm tractors usually employ [[diesel engine]]s, which range in power output from 18 to 575 [[horsepower]] (15 to 480&nbsp;kW). Size and output are dependent on application, with smaller tractors used for [[lawn mower|lawn mowing]], landscaping, orchard work, and [[truck farming]], and larger tractors for vast fields of wheat, maize, soy, and other bulk crops.\n\n==== Liquefied petroleum gas ====\n[[Liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) or [[propane]] also have been used as tractor fuels, but require special pressurized fuel tanks and filling equipment, so are less prevalent in most markets.\n\n==== Biodiesel ====\nIn some countries such as Germany, [[biodiesel]] is often used.<ref>[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm Use of biodiesel in tractors in Germany]</ref><ref>[http://www.bebioenergy.com/documents/BallaratUniversity.pdf BE energy promoting biodiesel for use in tractors]</ref> Some other biofuels such as straight vegetable oil are also being used by some farmers.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-08/living/farmer.fuel_1_jatropha-diesel-fuel-biodiesel?_s=PM:LIVING Jatropha being used to run a tractor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204094347/http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-08/living/farmer.fuel_1_jatropha-diesel-fuel-biodiesel?_s=PM:LIVING |date=2010-12-04 }}</ref><ref>[http://extension.psu.edu/cropping-systems/documents/canola-fueled-tractors.pdf SVO from canola being used in tractors]</ref>\n\n=== Transmission ===\nMost older farm tractors use a [[manual transmission]] with several [[gear]] [[ratio]]s, typically three to six, sometimes multiplied into two or three ranges. This arrangement provides a set of discrete ratios that, combined with the varying of the throttle, allow final-drive speeds from less than one up to about 25 miles per hour (40&nbsp;km/h), with the lower speeds used for working the land and the highest speed used on the road.\n\nSlow, controllable speeds are necessary for most of the operations performed with a tractor. They help give the farmer a larger degree of control in certain situations, such as field work. However, when travelling on public roads, the slow operating speeds can cause problems, such as long queues or tailbacks, which can delay or annoy motorists in cars and trucks. These motorists are responsible for being duly careful around farm tractors and sharing the road with them, but many shirk this responsibility, so various ways to minimize the interaction or minimize the speed differential are employed where feasible. Some countries (for example the [[Netherlands]]) employ a [[road sign]] on some roads that means \"no farm tractors\". Some modern tractors, such as the [[J. C. Bamford|JCB]] Fastrac, are now capable of much higher road speeds of around 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).\n\n[[File:OlderModelTractor.JPG|thumb|left|An older model European farm tractor, of the type still common in Eastern Europe]]\nOlder tractors usually have [[Manual transmission#Unsynchronized transmission|unsynchronized]] transmission designs, which often require the operator stop the tractor to shift between gears. This mode of use is inherently unsuited to some of the work tractors do, and has been circumvented in various ways over the years. For existing unsynchronized tractors, the methods of circumvention are [[Double clutch (technique)|double clutching]] or power-shifting, both of which require the operator to rely on skill to speed-match the gears while shifting, and are undesirable from a risk-mitigation standpoint because of what can go wrong if the operator makes a mistake \u2013 transmission damage is possible, and loss of vehicle control can occur if the tractor is towing a heavy load either uphill or downhill \u2013 something that tractors often do. Therefore, operator's manuals for most of these tractors state one must always stop the tractor before shifting, and they do not even mention the alternatives. As already said, that mode of use is inherently unsuited to some of the work tractors do, so better options were pursued for newer tractor designs.\n\n[[File:John Deere 3350 tractor cut.JPG|thumb|Cutaway of modern tractor]]\n\nIn these, unsynchronized transmission designs were replaced with [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchronization]] or with [[continuously variable transmission]]s (CVTs). Either a synchronized manual transmission with enough available gear ratios (often achieved with dual ranges, high and low) or a CVT allow the engine speed to be matched to the desired final-drive speed, while keeping engine speed within the appropriate speed (as measured in rotations per minute or rpm) range for power generation (the working range) (whereas throttling back to achieve the desired final-drive speed is a trade-off that leaves the working range). The problems, solutions, and developments described here also describe the history of transmission evolution in [[semi-trailer truck]]s. The biggest difference is fleet turnover; whereas most of the old [[Tractor unit|road tractor]]s have long since been scrapped, many of the old farm tractors are still in use. Therefore, old transmission design and operation is primarily just of historical interest in trucking, whereas in farming it still often affects daily life.\n\n== Hitches and power applications ==\nThe power produced by the engine must be transmitted to the implement or equipment to do the actual work intended for the equipment.  This may be accomplished via a drawbar or hitch system if the implement is to be towed or otherwise pulled through the tractive power of the engine, or via a pulley or power takeoff system if the implement is stationary, or a combination of the two.\n\n=== Drawbars ===\nUntil the 1940s, [[plows]] and other tillage equipment usually were connected to the tractor via a [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]].  The classic drawbar is simply a steel bar attached to the tractor (or in some cases, as in the early Fordsons, cast as part of the rear transmission housing) to which the hitch of the implement was attached with a pin or by a loop and [[clevis]].  The implement could be readily attached and removed, allowing the tractor to be used for other purposes on a daily basis.  If the tractor was equipped with a swinging drawbar, then it could be set at the center or offset from center to allow the tractor to run outside the path of the implement.\n\nThe drawbar system necessitated the implement having its own running gear (usually wheels) and in the case of a plow, chisel cultivator or harrow, some sort of lift mechanism to raise it out of the ground at turns or for transport.  Drawbars necessarily posed a rollover risk depending on how the tractive torque was applied.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Amy|last2=Poots|first2=Jill|date=12 Apr 2018|title=Investigation of UK Farmer Go/No-Go Decisions in Response to Tractor-Based Risk Scenarios|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|volume=23|issue=2|pages=154\u2013165|doi=10.1080/1059924X.2017.1423000|pmid=29648955|url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/12160/1/JAg_tractorpaper_revision.pdf|hdl=2164/12160}}</ref> The Fordson tractor (of which more units were produced and placed in service than any other farm tractor) was extremely prone to roll over backwards due to an excessively short wheelbase.  The linkage between the implement and the tractor usually had some slack which could lead to jerky starts and greater wear and tear on the tractor and the equipment.\n\n[[File:Modern John Deere Tractor IMG 0401.JPG|thumb|left|350px|A large, modern John Deere model 9400 four-wheel drive tractor with tripled wheels and a drawbar-towed tool chain, including one-pass tillage equipment, planter and fertilizer applicator with tanks]]\n\nDrawbars were appropriate to the dawn of mechanization, because they were very simple in concept and because as the tractor replaced the horse, existing horse-drawn implements usually already had running gear. As the history of mechanization progressed, however, the advantages of other hitching systems became apparent, leading to new developments (see below).  Depending on the function for which a tractor is used, though, the drawbar is still one of the usual means of attaching an implement to a tractor (see photo at left).\n\n=== Fixed mounts ===\nSome tractor manufacturers produced matching equipment that could be directly mounted on the tractor.  Examples included front-end loaders, belly mowers, row crop cultivators, corn pickers and corn planters.  In most cases, these fixed mounts were proprietary and unique to each make of tractor, so an implement produced by John Deere, for example, could not be attached to a Minneapolis Moline tractor.  Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semi-permanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware. Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis.  As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time.  An implement generally would be mounted at the beginning of its season of use (such as tillage, planting or harvesting) and removed only when the likely use season had ended.\n\n=== Three-point hitches and quick hitches ===\nThe drawbar system was virtually the exclusive method of attaching implements (other than direct attachment to the tractor) before [[Harry Ferguson]] developed the [[three-point hitch]]. Equipment attached to the three-point hitch can be raised or lowered [[hydraulic]]ally with a control lever. The equipment attached to the three-point hitch is usually completely supported by the tractor. Another way to attach an implement is via a quick hitch, which is attached to the three-point hitch. This enables a single person to attach an implement quicker and put the person in less danger when attaching the implement.\n\n[[File:Tractor3pointhitchDubMay04.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A modern three-point hitch]]\n\nThe three-point hitch revolutionized farm tractors and their implements. While the Ferguson system was still under patent, other manufacturers developed new hitching systems to try to fend off some of Ferguson's competitive advantage. For example, International Harvester's [[Farmall]] tractors gained a two-point \"Fast Hitch\", and John Deere had a power lift that was similar to, but not as flexible as, the Ferguson invention. Once the patent protection expired on the three-point hitch, it became an industry standard.\n\nAlmost every tractor today features Ferguson's three-point linkage or a derivative of it.  This hitch allows for easy attachment and detachment of implements while allowing the implement to function as a part of the tractor, almost as if it were attached by a fixed mount.  Previously, when the implement hit an obstacle, the towing link would break or the tractor could flip over.  Ferguson's genius was to combine a connection via two lower and one upper lift arms that were connected to a hydraulic lifting ram.  The ram was, in turn, connected to the upper of the three links so the increased drag (as when a plough hits a rock) caused the hydraulics to lift the implement until the obstacle was passed.\n\nRecently, [[Bobcat Company|Bobcat's]] patent on its front loader connection (inspired by these earlier systems) has expired, and compact tractors are now being outfitted with quick-connect attachments for their [[loader (equipment)|front-end loaders]].\n\n=== Power take-off systems and hydraulics ===\nIn addition to towing an implement or supplying tractive power through the wheels, most tractors have a means to transfer power to another machine such as a [[baler]], [[swather]], or [[mower]].  Unless it functions solely by pulling it through or over the ground, a towed implement needs its own power source (such as a baler or combine with a separate engine) or else a means of transmitting power from the tractor to the mechanical operations of the equipment.\n\nEarly tractors used [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] or cables wrapped around the [[flywheel]] or a separate belt pulley to power stationary equipment, such as a threshing machine, buzz saw, silage blower, or stationary baler. In most cases, it was not practical for the tractor and equipment to move with a flexible belt or cable between them, so this system required the tractor to remain in one location, with the work brought to the equipment, or the tractor to be relocated at each turn and the power set-up reapplied (as in cable-drawn plowing systems used in early steam tractor operations).\n\n[[File:TractorPTOshaftMay04.jpg|left|150px|thumb|A PTO shaft connected to a tractor]]\n\nModern tractors use a [[power take-off]] (PTO) shaft to provide rotary power to machinery that may be stationary or pulled. The PTO shaft generally is at the rear of the tractor, and can be connected to an implement that is either towed by a drawbar or a three-point hitch.  This eliminates the need for a separate, implement-mounted power source, which is almost never seen in modern farm equipment. It is also optional to get a front PTO as well when buying a new tractor.\n\nVirtually all modern tractors can also provide external [[hydraulic fluid]] and [[electric]]al power to the equipment they are towing, either by hoses or wires.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Benin brown tractor 600.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A garden tractor towing a cargo cart]]\n\nModern tractors have many electrical switches and levers in the cab for controlling the multitude of different functions available on the tractor.\n\n=== Pedals ===\nModern farm tractors usually have four or five foot-pedals for the operator on the floor of the tractor.\n\nThe pedal on the left is the [[clutch]]. The operator presses on this pedal to disengage the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] for either shifting gears or stopping the tractor. Some modern tractors have (or as optional equipment) a button on the gear stick for controlling the clutch, in addition to the standard pedal.\n\nTwo of the pedals on the right are the [[brake]]s.  The left brake pedal stops the left rear wheel and the right brake pedal does the same with the right side.  This independent left and right wheel-braking augments the steering of the tractor when only the two rear wheels are driven. This is usually done when it is necessary to make a sharp turn. The split brake pedal is also used in mud or soft soil to control a tire spinning due to loss of traction. The operator presses both pedals together to stop the tractor. Usually a swinging or sliding bolt is provided to lock the two together when desired.\n\nThe pedal furthest to the right is the foot [[throttle]]. Unlike in automobiles, it can also be controlled from a hand-operated lever (\"hand throttle\").  This helps provide a constant speed in field work.  It also helps provide continuous power for stationary tractors that are operating an implement by shaft or belt.  The foot throttle gives the operator more automobile-like control over the speed of the tractor for road work.  This is a feature of more recent tractors; older tractors often did not have it. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], foot pedal use to control engine speed while travelling on the road is mandatory. Some tractors, especially those designed for row-crop work, have a 'de-accelerator' pedal, which operates in the reverse fashion to an automobile throttle, in that the pedal is pushed down to slow the engine. This allows fine control over the speed of the tractor when maneuvering at the end of crop rows in fields&nbsp;\u2013 the operating speed of the engine is set using the hand throttle, and to slow the tractor to turn, the operator simply has to press the pedal, and turn and release it once the turn is completed, rather than having to alter the setting of the hand throttle twice during the maneuver.\n\nA fifth pedal is traditionally included just in front of the driver's seat (often pressed with the operator's heel) to operate the rear [[locking differential|differential lock]] (diff-lock), which prevents wheel slip. The differential normally allows the outside wheel to travel faster than the inside wheel during a turn. However, in low-traction conditions on a soft surface, the same mechanism could allow one wheel to slip, further reducing traction. The diff-lock overrides this, forcing both wheels to turn at the same speed, reducing wheel slip and improving traction. Care must be taken to unlock the differential before turning, usually by hitting the pedal a second time, since the tractor with good traction cannot perform a turn with the diff-lock engaged. In modern tractors, this pedal is replaced with an electrical switch.\n\n=== Levers and switches ===\nMany functions once controlled with levers have been replaced with some model of electrical switch with the rise of indirect computer controlling of functions in modern tractors.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 1960s, tractors had a single register of gears, hence one gear stick, often with three to five forward gears and one reverse. Then, group gears were introduced, and another gear stick was added. Later, control of the forward-reverse direction was moved to a special stick attached at the side of the steering wheel, which allowed forward or reverse travel in any gear. Nowadays, with [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]]s or other clutch-free gear types, fewer sticks control the transmission, and some are replaced with electrical switches or are totally computer-controlled.\n\nThe three-point hitch was controlled with a lever for adjusting the position, or as with the earliest ones, just the function for raising or lowering the hitch. With modern electrical systems, it is often replaced with a potentiometer for the lower bound position and another one for the upper bound, and a switch allowing automatic adjustment of the hitch between these settings.\n\nThe external hydraulics also originally had levers, but now are often replaced with some form of electrical switch; the same is true for the [[power take-off]] shaft.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:Tractorrearturnover.gif|thumb|220px|right|Farm tractor rear turnover]]\n[[File:RogerTractorLarge.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The classic row crop tractor (an Allis-Chalmers WD).

The ROPS does not prevent tractor overturns; rather, it prevents the operator from being crushed during an overturn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wisfarmer.com/story/news/2018/03/05/tragedy-averted-90-second-video-speaks-wisconsin-farmers/397566002/|title=Tragedy averted: 90-second video speaks to Wisconsin farmers|work=Wisconsin State Farmer|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}</ref> This is especially important in open-air tractors, where the ROPS is a steel beam that extends above the operator's seat.  For tractors with operator cabs, the ROPS is part\nof the [[Frame (vehicle)|frame]] of the cab. A ROPS with enclosed cab further reduces the likelihood of serious injury because the operator is protected by the sides and windows of the cab.\n\nThese structures were first required by legislation in Sweden in 1959. Before they were required, some farmers died when their tractors rolled on top of them.  Row-crop tractors, before ROPS, were particularly dangerous because of their 'tricycle' design with the two front wheels spaced close together and angled inward toward the ground. Some [[farmer]]s were killed by rollovers while operating tractors along [[wikt:steep|steep]] [[Grade (slope)|slopes]]. Others have been killed while attempting to tow or pull an excessive load from above axle height, or when cold weather caused the tires to freeze to the ground, in both cases causing the tractor to pivot around the rear axle.<ref name=\"nasd746\" /> ROPS were first required in the United States in 1986, but this requirement did not retroactively apply to tractors produced before this year; therefore, adoption of ROPS has been incomplete in the farming community. To combat this problem, CROPS (cost-effective roll-over protection structures) have been developed to encourage farmers to retrofit older tractors.<ref name=NIOSHBlog/>\n\nFor the ROPS to work as designed, the operator must stay within its protective frame. This means the operator must wear the seat belt; not wearing it may defeat the primary purpose of the ROPS.\n\n== Applications and variations ==\n\n=== Farm tractor applications ===\n[[File:JDTractor chisel-plough.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A modern [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] 8110 Farm Tractor plowing a field using a [[chisel plow]]]]\n[[File:Farmer and tractor tilling soil.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A tractor pulling a tiller]]\n\nThe most common use of the term \"tractor\" is for the [[vehicle]]s used on [[farm]]s. The farm tractor is used for pulling or pushing [[agriculture|agricultural]] machinery or [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]s, for [[plow]]ing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and similar tasks.\n\n[[File:TractorPoweringWaterpump.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A farm tractor used to power a [[pump]] for [[irrigating]] a plot of land]]\n\nA variety of specialty farm tractors have been developed for particular uses.  These include \"row crop\" tractors with adjustable tread width to allow the tractor to pass down rows of [[cereals]], [[maize]], [[tomatoes]] or other crops without crushing the plants, \"wheatland\" or \"standard\" tractors with fixed wheels and a lower center of gravity for plowing and other heavy field work for broadcast crops, and \"high crop\" tractors with adjustable tread and increased ground clearance, often used in the cultivation of cotton and other high-growing row crop plant operations, and \"utility tractors\", typically smaller tractors with a low center of gravity and short turning radius, used for general purposes around the farmstead. Many utility tractors are used for nonfarm grading, [[landscape maintenance]] and excavation purposes, particularly with loaders, backhoes, pallet forks and similar devices.  Small garden or [[lawn mowers|lawn tractor]]s designed for suburban and semirural gardening and landscape maintenance also exist in a variety of configurations.\n\n[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A tractor with a [[chaser bin]]]]\n\nSome farm-type tractors are found elsewhere than on farms: with large universities' gardening departments, in public parks, or for highway workman use with [[blowtorch]] cylinders strapped to the sides and a [[Jackhammer|pneumatic drill]] [[air compressor]] permanently fastened over the [[power take-off]]. These are often fitted with grass (turf) tyres which are less damaging to soft surfaces than agricultural tires.\n\n=== Precision agriculture ===\n[[Space technology]] has been incorporated into [[agriculture]] in the form of [[GPS]] devices, and robust on-board [[computers]] installed as optional features on farm tractors. These technologies are used in modern, [[precision farming]] techniques. The [[Government spin-off|spin-off]]s from the [[space race]] have actually facilitated [[automation]] in plowing and the use of autosteer systems ([[Unmanned ground vehicle|drone]] on tractors that are manned but only steered at the end of a row), the idea being to neither overlap and use more fuel nor leave streaks when performing jobs such as [[Agriculture|cultivating]]. Several tractor companies have also been working on producing a [[driverless tractor]].\n\n=== Engineering tractors ===\n[[File:Chelyabinsk tractor factory 1930s.jpg|thumb|right|260px|A tractor factory in [[Chelyabinsk]] in the [[Soviet Union]] circa 1930]]\n[[File:tractor fanguejant.jpg|thumb|[[Ebro trucks|Ebro]] farm tractor with steel wheel extensions.  This arrangement is often used in muddy conditions that are found in paddy farming of rice.]]\n\nThe durability and engine power of tractors made them very suitable for engineering tasks. Tractors can be fitted with engineering tools such as [[bulldozer|dozer blade]]s, [[loader (equipment)|bucket]]s, [[hoe (equipment)|hoe]]s, rippers, etc.  The most common attachments for the front of a tractor are dozer blades or buckets. When attached to engineering tools, the tractor is called an [[engineering vehicle]].\n\nA [[bulldozer]] is a [[tractor crawler|track-type tractor]]  with a blade attached in the front and a rope-winch behind. Bulldozers are very powerful tractors and have excellent ground-hold, as their main tasks are to push or drag.\n\nBulldozers have been further modified over time to evolve into new machines which are capable of working in ways that the original bulldozer can not. One example is that [[Loader (equipment)|loader]] tractors were created by removing the blade and substituting a large volume bucket and hydraulic arms which can raise and lower the bucket, thus making it useful for scooping up earth, rock and similar loose material to load it into trucks.\n\nA front-loader or loader is a tractor with an engineering tool which consists of two hydraulic powered arms on either side of the front engine compartment and a tilting implement. This is usually a wide-open box called a bucket, but other common attachments are a [[pallet fork]] and a bale grappler.\n\nOther modifications to the original bulldozer include making the machine smaller to let it operate in small work areas where movement is limited. Also, tiny wheeled loaders, officially called [[skid-steer loader]]s, but nicknamed \"[[Bobcat (equipment)|Bobcat]]\" after the original manufacturer, are particularly suited for small excavation projects in confined areas.\n\n=== Backhoe loader ===\n{{Main|Backhoe loader}}\n[[File:Backhoe and loader.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A common backhoe-loader \u2013 the backhoe is on the left, the bucket/blade on the right.]]\n\nThe most common variation of the classic farm '''tractor''' is the '''hoe''', also called a '''hoe-loader'''. As the name implies, it has a loader assembly on the front and a [[backhoe]] on the back. Backhoes attach to a three-point hitch on farm or industrial tractors.  Industrial tractors are often heavier in construction, particularly with regards to the use of a steel grill for protection from rocks and the use of construction tires. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] controls. Removable backhoe attachments almost always have a separate seat on the attachment.\n\nBackhoe-loaders are very common and can be used for a wide variety of tasks: construction, small demolitions, light transportation of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes, loading trucks, breaking [[asphalt]] and paving roads. Some buckets have retractable bottoms, enabling them to empty their loads more quickly and efficiently. Buckets with retractable bottoms are also often used for grading and scratching off sand. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted. Often the bucket can be replaced with other devices or tools.\n\nTheir relatively small frames and precise controls make backhoe-loaders very useful and common in [[civil engineering|urban engineering]] projects, such as construction and [[repair]]s in areas too small for larger equipment. Their versatility and compact size make them one of the most popular urban [[construction vehicle]]s.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, the word \"[[J. C. Bamford|JCB]]\" is used [[colloquial]]ly as a [[genericized trademark]] for any such type of engineering vehicle. The term JCB now appears in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], although it is still legally a [[trademark]] of J. C. Bamford Ltd. The term \"digger\" is also commonly used.\n\n=== Compact utility tractor ===\n<!-- [[File:Kubota- -New-Holland-CUTs.jpg|thumb|left|Kubota and New Holland compact tractors equipped with front-end loaders]] -->\n[[File:Farm Tractor vs CUT vs Garden Tractor.jpg|thumb|left|In the middle is a 24 hp (18 kW) diesel CUT illustrating the size difference between a small 40 hp farm tractor and a garden tractor.]]\n\nA compact utility tractor (CUT) is a smaller version of an agricultural tractor, but designed primarily for landscaping and estate management tasks rather than for planting and harvesting on a commercial scale. Typical CUTs range from 20 to 50 horsepower (15\u201337&nbsp;kW) with available [[power take-off]] (PTO) horsepower ranging from 15 to 45&nbsp;hp (11\u201334&nbsp;kW). CUTs are often equipped with both a mid-mounted and a standard rear PTO, especially those below 40 horsepower (30&nbsp;kW). The mid-mount PTO shaft typically rotates at/near 2000 rpm and is typically used to power mid-mount finish mowers, front-mounted [[snow blower]]s or front-mounted rotary brooms.  The rear PTO is standardized at 540 rpm for the North American markets, but in some parts of the world, a dual 540/1000 rpm PTO is standard, and implements are available for either standard in those markets.\n\n[[File:1subsoil1.jpg|thumb|right|Howse brand modular subsoiler mounted to a tractor]]\n[[File:Herd Seeder.jpeg|thumb|right|Broadcast seeder mounted to a Kubota CUT]]\n\nOne of the most common attachment for a CUT is the [[front-end loader]] or FEL. Like the larger agricultural tractors, a CUT will have an adjustable, hydraulically controlled [[three-point hitch]]. Typically, a CUT will have four-wheel drive, or more correctly four-wheel assist. Modern CUTs often feature hydrostatic transmissions, but many variants of gear-drive transmissions are also offered from low priced, simple gear transmissions to synchronized transmissions to advanced glide-shift transmissions. All modern CUTs feature government-mandated [[roll over protection structure]]s just like agricultural tractors. The most well-known brands in North America include [[Kubota Corporation|Kubota]], [[John Deere Tractor]], [[New Holland Ag]], Case-Farmall and Massey-Ferguson.  Although less common, compact backhoes are often attached to compact utility tractors.\n\n[[File:JD 71 Flexi Planter, 2 Row.jpg|thumb|left|JD 71 Flexi [[Planter (farm implement)|Planter]] for tractors 20 to 35 horsepower]]\n\nCompact utility tractors require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors.  Very common implements include the [[box blade]], the [[grader]] blade, the landscape rake, the post hole digger (or post hole [[auger (drill)|auger]]), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a [[broadcast seeder]], a [[subsoiler]] and the [[rototiller]] (rotary tiller).  In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models are available with front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumber tractor brands, so CUT owners have a wide selection of implements.\n\nFor small-scale farming or large-scale gardening, some planting and harvesting implements are sized for CUTs. One- and two-row planting units are commonly available, as are cultivators, sprayers and different types of seeders (slit, rotary and drop).  One of the first CUTs offered for small farms of three to 30 acres and for small jobs on larger farms was a three-wheeled unit, with the rear wheel being the drive wheel, offered by Sears & Roebuck in 1954 and priced at $598 for the basic model.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1t4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96 \"Three Wheeled Tractor With Implements Handles Small-Farm Work.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1954, p. 96.</ref>\n\n=== Standard tractor ===\nThe earliest tractors were called \"standard\" tractors, and were intended almost solely for [[plough|plowing]] and [[harrow (tool)|harrowing]] before planting, which were difficult tasks for humans and [[working animal|draft animals]]. They were characterized by a low, rearward seating position, fixed-width tread, and low ground clearance. These early tractors were cumbersome, and were not well-suited to getting into a field of already-planted row crops to do weed control. The \"standard\" tractor definition is no longer in current use.\n\n=== Row-crop tractor ===\nA '''general-purpose''' or '''row-crop tractor''' is tailored specifically to the growing of crops grown in rows, and most especially to [[cultivator|cultivating]] these crops. These tractors are universal machines, capable of both [[tillage|primary tillage]] and cultivation of a crop. The \"row-crop\" or \"general-purpose\" designation is no longer in current use. \n<!-- relevant? out of place?\n\"Row crop\" refers to any farm [[crop]] cultivated in rows. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines row crop as an \"[a]gricultural crop planted, usually with mechanical planting devices, in individual rows that are spaced to permit machine traffic during the early parts of the growing season\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/cropglossary.html |title=Crop Glossary &#124; Ag 101 &#124; Agriculture &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref>-->\n\n==== Row-crop tractor history ====\n[[File:Farmall regular web.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Farmall \"Regular\"]]\n\nThe row-crop tractor category evolved rather than appearing overnight, but the [[International Harvester]] (IH) [[Farmall]] is often considered the \"first\" tractor of the category. Some earlier tractors of the 1910s and 1920s approached the form factor from the heavier side, as did motorized cultivators from the lighter side, but the Farmall brought all of the salient features together into one package, with a capable distribution network to ensure its commercial success. In the new form factor that the Farmall popularized, the [[cultivator]] was mounted in the front so it was easily visible. Additionally, the tractor had a narrow front end; the front tires were spaced very closely and angled in towards the bottom. The back wheels straddled two rows, and the unit could cultivate four rows at once.\n\nFrom 1924 until 1963, Farmalls were the largest selling row-crop tractors.\n\nTo compete, [[John Deere]] designed the [[List of John Deere tractors|Model C]], which had a wide front and could cultivate three rows at once. Only 112 prototypes were made, as Deere realized sales would be lost to Farmall if their model did less. In 1928, Deere released the Model C anyway, only as the [[Model GP]] (General Purpose) to avoid confusion with the Model D when ordered over the then unclear telephone.<ref name=\"KlancherLeffingwellMorland2003}\">{{Harvnb|Klancher|Leffingwell|Morland|Pripps|2003}}.</ref>\n\nOliver refined its \"Row Crop\" model early in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/machines_04.html |title=Tractors Advance during the Depression |publisher=Livinghistoryfarm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> Until 1935, the 18\u201327 was Oliver\u2013[[Hart-Parr]]'s only row-crop tractor.<ref name=\"Ertel2001p72\">{{Harvnb|Ertel|2001|p=72}}.</ref>\nMany Oliver row-crop models are referred to as \"Oliver Row Crop 77\", \"Oliver Row Crop 88\", etc.\n\n==== Row-crop tractor safety ====\nMany early row-crop tractors had a tricycle design with two closely spaced front tires, and some even had a single front tire. This made it dangerous to operate on the side of a steep hill; as a result, many farmers died from tractor rollovers. Also, early row-crop tractors had no [[rollover protection system]] (ROPS), meaning if the tractor flipped back, the operator could be crushed. Sweden was the first country which passed legislation requiring ROPS, in 1959.\n\nOver 50% of tractor related injuries and deaths are attributed to tractor [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]].<ref name=\"Donham, K. 1999\"/>\n\n==== Modern row-crop tractors ====\nCanadian agricultural equipment manufacturer [[Versatile (company)|Versatile]] makes row-crop tractors that are {{convert|265|to|365|hp|kW}}; powered by an 8.9 liter [[Cummins Diesel]] engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cumminsengines.com/showcase-item.aspx?id=110&title=QSL9+for+Agriculture+(Tier+4+Interim)&|title=QSL9 for Agriculture (Tier 4 Interim)|website=Cummins Engines|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versatile-ag.com/NA/pages/product_mfwd.php|title=Versatile - MFWD Tractors|website=www.versatile-ag.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Case IH]] and [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] of [[CNH Industrial]] both produce high horsepower front-wheel-assist row crop tractors with available rear tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agriculture1.newholland.com/nar/en-us/equipment/products/tractors-telehandlers/genesis-t8-series-tier-4b|title=GENESIS\u00ae T8 Series \u2013 Tier 4B - Overview {{!}} Tractors \uff06 Telehandlers {{!}} New Holland (US)|website=agriculture1.newholland.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  Case IH also has a 500&nbsp;hp (373&nbsp;kW) four-wheel drive track system called Rowtrac.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caseih.com/northamerica/en-us/Pages/campaigns/track-leadership.aspx|title=Track Technology {{!}} Quadtrac and Rowtrac Tractors {{!}} Case IH|website=Case IH|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n[[John Deere]] has an extensive line of available row crop tractors ranging from 140 to 400 horsepower (104 to 298&nbsp;kW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deere.com/en/tractors/row-crop-tractors/|title=John Deere Tractors {{!}} Row Crop Tractors {{!}} John Deere US|website=www.deere.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\nModern row crop tractors have rollover protection systems in the form of a reinforced cab or a [[roll cage|roll bar]].\n\n=== Garden tractors ===\nGarden tractors (mini tractors) are small, light tractors designed for use in domestic [[garden]]s and small estates. Garden tractors are designed for cutting [[grass]], snow removal, and small property cultivation. In the U.S., the term [[Lawn mower#Riding (ride-on) mowers|riding lawn mower]] today often is used to refer to mid- or rear-engined machines. Front-engined tractor layout machines designed primarily for cutting grass and light towing are called [[lawn tractors]]; heavier-duty tractors of similar size are garden tractors. Garden tractors are capable of mounting a wider array of attachments than lawn tractors. Unlike lawn tractors and rear-engined riding mowers, garden tractors are powered by horizontal-crankshaft engines with a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]]-drive to [[transaxle]]-type transmissions (usually of four or five speeds, although some may also have two-speed reduction gearboxes, drive-shafts, or hydrostatic or [[Hydrokinetic transmission|hydraulic drives]]). Garden tractors from [[Wheel Horse]], [[Cub Cadet]], Economy (Power King), John Deere, [[Massey Ferguson]] and Case [[Ingersoll Power Equipment|Ingersoll]] are built in this manner. The engines are generally one- or two-cylinder petrol (gasoline) engines, although [[diesel engine]] models are also available, especially in Europe. Typically, diesel-powered garden tractors are larger and heavier-duty than gasoline-powered units and compare more similarly to compact utility tractors.\n\nVisually, the distinction between a garden tractor and a lawn tractor is often hard to make \u2013 generally, garden tractors are more sturdily built, with stronger frames, 12-inch or larger wheels mounted with multiple lugs (most lawn tractors have a single bolt or clip on the hub), heavier transaxles, and ability to accommodate a wide range of front, belly, and rear mounted attachments.\n\n=== Two-wheel tractors ===\n{{main|Two-wheel tractor}}\nAlthough most people think first of four-wheel vehicles when they think of tractors, a tractor may have one or more axles. The key benefit is the power itself, which only takes one axle to provide. Single-axle tractors, more often called [[two-wheel tractor]]s or walk-behind tractors, have had many users since the beginning of [[internal combustion engine]] tractors. They tend to be small and affordable. This was especially true before the 1960s, when a walk-behind tractor could often be more affordable than a two-axle tractor of comparable power. Today's compact utility tractors and advanced garden tractors may negate most of that market advantage, but two-wheel tractors still enjoy a loyal following, especially where an already-paid-for two-wheel tractor is financially superior to a compact or garden tractor that would have to be purchased. Countries where two-wheel tractors are especially prevalent today include [[Thailand]], [[China]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], and other [[Southeast Asia]] countries.\n\n=== Orchard tractors ===\nTractors tailored to use in fruit [[orchard]]s typically have features suited to passing under tree branches with impunity. These include a lower overall profile; reduced tree-branch-snagging risk (via underslung exhaust pipes rather than smoke-stack-style exhaust, and large sheetmetal [[cowling]]s and [[:wikt:fairing|fairing]]s that allow branches to deflect and slide off rather than catch); [[spark arrestor]]s on the exhaust tips; and often wire cages to protect the operator from snags.\n\n=== Automobile-conversion tractors and other homemade versions ===\n[[File:Model T tractor.png|thumb|A [[Model T]] tractor pulling a plow]]\n[[File:Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advert 1918.png|thumb|left|An advertisement for auto-to-tractor conversion kits, 1918]]\n[[File:Ford epa tractor.jpg|thumb|A Ford rebuilt to an EPA tractor]]\n[[File:Duett-EPA-rear.jpg|thumb|left|A Volvo Duett rebuilt to an EPA tractor.

In the United States, this trend was especially strong from the 1910s through 1950s. It began early in the development of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, with blacksmiths and amateur mechanics tinkering in their shops. Especially during the [[interwar period]], dozens of manufacturers ([[Montgomery Ward]] among them) marketed aftermarket kits for converting [[Ford Model T]]s for use as tractors.<ref name=\"PrippsMorland1993p28\">{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|p=28}}.</ref> (These were sometimes called 'Hoover wagons' during the [[Great Depression]], although this term was usually reserved for [[Bennett buggy|automobiles converted to horse-drawn buggy use]] when gasoline was unavailable or unaffordable.  During the same period, another common name was \"[[Doodlebug tractor|Doodlebug]]\".) Ford even considered producing an \"official\" optional kit.<ref name=\"Leffingwell2004p43-53\">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2004|pp=43\u201353}}.</ref> Many [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Model A Fords]] also were converted for this purpose. In later years, some farm mechanics have been known to convert more modern trucks or cars for use as tractors, more often as curiosities or for recreational purposes (rather than out of the earlier motives of pure necessity or frugality).\n\n{{Anchor|EPA tractors in Sweden}}\nDuring [[World War&nbsp;II]], a shortage of tractors in [[Sweden]] led to the development of the so-called \"EPA\" tractor (EPA was a chain of discount stores and it was often used to signify something lacking in quality). An EPA tractor was simply an automobile, truck or lorry, with the passenger space cut off behind the front seats, equipped with two gearboxes in a row. When done to an older car with a [[ladder frame]], the result was not dissimilar to a tractor and could be used as one.  After the war it remained popular, now not as a farm vehicle, but as a way for young people without a [[driver's license]] to own something similar to a car. Since it was legally seen as a tractor, it could be driven from 16 years of age and only required a tractor license. Eventually, the legal loophole was closed and no new EPA tractors were allowed to be made, but the remaining ones were still legal, which led to inflated prices and many protests from people who preferred EPA tractors to ordinary cars.\n\nThe German occupation of Italy during World {{nowrap|War II}} resulted in a severe shortage of mechanized farm equipment.  The destruction of tractors was a sort of [[scorched earth|scorched-earth]] strategy used to reduce the independence of the conquered.  The shortage of tractors in that area of Europe was the origin of [[History of Lamborghini#Origin|Lamborghini]].  The war was also the inspiration for dual-purpose vehicles such as the [[Land Rover]].  Based on the Jeep, the company made a vehicle that combined PTO, tillage, and transportation.\n\nIn March 1975, a similar type of vehicle was introduced in Sweden, the ''A tractor'' [from ''arbetstraktor'' (work tractor)]; the main difference is an A tractor has a top speed of 30&nbsp;km/h. This is usually done by fitting two gearboxes in a row and not using one of them. The [[Volvo Duett]] was, for a long time, the primary choice for conversion to an EPA or A tractor, but since supplies have dried up, other cars have been used, in most cases another [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]. The [[SFRO]] is a Swedish organization advocating homebuilt and modified vehicles.\n\nAnother type of homemade tractors are ones that are [[fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] from scratch. The \"[[wikt:from scratch#Adverb|from scratch]]\" description is relative, as often individual components will be repurposed from earlier vehicles or machinery (e.g., engines, gearboxes, axle housings), but the tractor's overall [[chassis]] is essentially designed and built by the owner (e.g., a frame is welded from [[bar stock]]\u2014channel stock, angle stock, flat stock, etc.). As with automobile conversions, the heyday of this type of tractor, at least in developed economies, lies in the past, when there were large populations of blue-collar workers for whom [[metalworking]] and [[farming]] were prevalent parts of their lives. (For example, many 19th- and 20th-century [[New England]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] machinists and factory workers had grown up on farms.) Backyard fabrication was a natural activity to them (whereas it might seem daunting to most people today).\n\n=== Alternative machine types called tractors ===\nThe term \"tractor\" (US and Canada) or \"tractor unit\" (UK) is also applied to:\n* '''Road tractors''', '''[[tractor unit]]s''' or traction heads, familiar as the front end of an [[articulated lorry]] / [[semi-trailer truck]]. They are heavy-duty [[vehicle]]s with large [[engine]]s and several [[axle]]s.\n** The majority of these tractors are designed to pull long [[semi-trailer]]s, most often to transport freight over a significant distance, and is connected to the trailer with a [[fifth wheel coupling]]. In England, this type of \"tractor\" is often called an \"[[Semi-trailer truck|artic cab]]\" (short for \"articulated\" cab).\n** A minority is the [[ballast tractor]], whose load is hauled from a [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]].\n* '''[[Pushback|Pushback tractors]]''' are used on airports to move aircraft on the ground, most commonly pushing aircraft away from their parking stands.\n* [[Locomotive]] tractors ([[engine]]s) or [[rail car mover]]s \u2013 the amalgamation of [[machine]]s, [[electrical generator]]s, controls and devices that comprise the [[traction component]] of [[railway]] [[vehicle]]s\n* [[Artillery tractor]]s \u2013 vehicles used to tow [[artillery]] pieces of varying weights.\n* [[NASA]] and [[list of space agencies|other space agencies]] use [[Crawler-transporter|very large tractors]] to move large [[launch vehicle]]s and [[space shuttle]]s between their hangars and [[launch pad]]s.\n* A [[pipe-tractor]] is a device used for conveying advanced instruments into pipes for measurement and data logging, and the purging of well holes, sewer pipes and other inaccessible tubes.\n<gallery>\nFile:UP Diesel.png|Diesel-electric [[locomotive]] at work\nFile:Trackmobile.jpg|A Trackmobile 4150\nFile:PushbackCargolux.jpg|Aircraft [[Pushback|pushback tractor]]\nFile:Backing it in 2.jpg|Road tractor pulling a flatbed trailer\n</gallery>\n\n== Glossary of tractor-related terms not explained elsewhere ==\n* {{Anchor|Nebraska tractor tests}} '''Nebraska tractor tests''': Tests, mandated by the [[Nebraska]] Tractor Test Law and administered by the [[University of Nebraska system|University of Nebraska]], that objectively test the performance of all brands of tractors, 40 horsepower or more, sold in Nebraska.

[[Richard Trevithick]] designed the first 'semi-portable' [[stationary steam engine]] for agricultural use, known as a \"barn engine\" in 1812, and it was used to drive a corn threshing machine.<ref name=Hodge>{{cite book|last= Hodge |first= James |title= Richard Trevithick (Lifelines 6) |publisher= Shire Publications |year= 1973 |isbn= 978-0-85263-177-5 |page= 30}}</ref> The truly portable engine was invented in 1893 by [[William Tuxford]] of [[Boston, Lincolnshire]] who started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal smoke tubes. A large [[flywheel]] was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven. In the 1850s, [[John Fowler (agricultural engineer)|John Fowler]] used a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine to drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage to cultivation.\n\nIn parallel with the early portable engine development, many engineers attempted to make them self-propelled \u2013 the fore-runners of the [[traction engine]]. In most cases this was achieved by fitting a sprocket on the end of the crankshaft, and running a chain from this to a larger sprocket on the rear axle. These experiments met with mixed success.<ref name=Lane2>{{cite book|last= Lane |first= Michael R. |title= Pride of the Road |page= 56}}</ref> The first proper [[traction engine]], in the form recognisable today, was developed in 1859 when British engineer [[Aveling and Porter|Thomas Aveling]] modified a [[Clayton & Shuttleworth]] [[portable engine]], which had to be hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one.

It was widely adopted for agricultural use. The first tractors were steam-powered [[ploughing engine|plowing engine]]s. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. In Britain [[Mann\u2019s Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company|Mann's]] and [[Richard Garrett & Sons|Garrett]] developed [[steam tractor]]s for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the [[United States]], where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows.

While the earlier, heavier tractors were initially very successful, it became increasingly apparent at this time that the weight of a large supporting frame was less efficient than lighter designs.  Henry Ford introduced a light-weight, mass-produced design which largely displaced the heavier designs. Some companies halfheartedly followed suit with mediocre designs, as if to disprove the concept, but they were largely unsuccessful in that endeavor.<ref>Oliver Hart-Parr - C.H. Wendel, Krause Publications, November 29, 2011</ref>\n\nWhile unpopular at first, these gasoline-powered machines began to catch on in the 1910s, when they became smaller and more affordable.<ref name=\"Rumely1910\">{{Harvnb|Rumely|1910}}.</ref> [[Henry Ford]] introduced the [[Fordson]], a wildly popular mass-produced tractor, in 1917. They were built in the U.S., Ireland, England and Russia, and by 1923, Fordson had 77% of the U.S. market. The Fordson dispensed with a frame, using the strength of the engine block to hold the machine together. By the 1920s, tractors with gasoline-powered [[internal combustion engine]]s had become the norm.\n\n[[File:Trattore Cassani mod 40HP IMG 3337 Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|left|Tractor Cassani model 40HP, at the [[Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] of Milan]]\n\nThe first three-point hitches were experimented with in 1917, however it was not until [[Harry Ferguson]] applied for a British patent for his [[three-point hitch]] in 1926 that they became popular. a three-point attachment of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The [[Ferguson-Brown Company]] produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor with a Ferguson-designed [[hydraulic]] hitch. In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the [[Ford N-Series tractor|Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor]]. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch attachment system among farmers around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used to power three point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.\n\n== Farm tractor design, power and transmission ==\n\n=== Tractor configurations ===\nTractors can be generally classified by number of axles or wheels, with main categories of [[two-wheel tractor]]s (single-axle tractors) and four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors); more axles are possible but uncommon. Among four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors), most are [[two-wheel drive]] (usually [[rear wheel drive|at the rear]]); but many are two-wheel drive with front wheel assist, [[four-wheel drive]] (often with articulated steering), or [[continuous track|track]] tractors (with steel or rubber tracks).\n\n[[File:Volvo T 25.1.jpg|thumb|200px|Volvo T25, 1956, gasoline tractor]]\nThe classic farm tractor is a simple open [[vehicle]], with two very large driving wheels on an axle below and slightly behind a single seat (the seat and [[steering]] wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine in front of the driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for reasons of operator safety and comfort.\n\nIn some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the [[Caterpillar, Inc.|\"Caterpillar\"]] or [[crawler tractor|\"crawler\"]] type of tracked tractor became popular in the 1930s, due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and separate track clutches operated by levers rather than a steering wheel.\n\n[[File:Modern-tractor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A modern 4-wheel drive [[farm]] tractor in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] ]]\nFour-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard \"two large, two small\" configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the trailing unit is not steered separately.\n\n[[File:Wheat Planting Rig May 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern steerable all-tracked power unit planting wheat in North Dakota]]\nIn the early 21st century, articulated or non-articulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the replacement of wheels or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.\n\n=== Engine and fuels ===\nThe predecessors of modern tractors, traction engines, used [[steam engine]]s for power.\n\n==== Gasoline and kerosene ====\nSince the turn of the 20th century, [[internal combustion engine]]s have been the power source of choice. Between 1900 and 1960, [[gasoline]] was the predominant fuel, with [[kerosene]] (the [[Rumely Oil Pull]] was the most notable of this kind) and [[ethanol]] being common alternatives. Generally, one engine could burn any of those, although cold starting was easiest on gasoline. Often, a small auxiliary fuel tank was available to hold gasoline for cold starting and warm-up, while the main fuel tank held whatever fuel was most convenient or least expensive for the particular farmer. In the United Kingdom, a gasoline-kerosene engine is known as a [[petrol-paraffin engine]].\n\n==== Diesel ====\n[[Dieselisation]] gained momentum starting in the 1960s, and modern farm tractors usually employ [[diesel engine]]s, which range in power output from 18 to 575 [[horsepower]] (15 to 480&nbsp;kW). Size and output are dependent on application, with smaller tractors used for [[lawn mower|lawn mowing]], landscaping, orchard work, and [[truck farming]], and larger tractors for vast fields of wheat, maize, soy, and other bulk crops.\n\n==== Liquefied petroleum gas ====\n[[Liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) or [[propane]] also have been used as tractor fuels, but require special pressurized fuel tanks and filling equipment, so are less prevalent in most markets.\n\n==== Biodiesel ====\nIn some countries such as Germany, [[biodiesel]] is often used.<ref>[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm Use of biodiesel in tractors in Germany]</ref><ref>[http://www.bebioenergy.com/documents/BallaratUniversity.pdf BE energy promoting biodiesel for use in tractors]</ref> Some other biofuels such as straight vegetable oil are also being used by some farmers.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-08/living/farmer.fuel_1_jatropha-diesel-fuel-biodiesel?_s=PM:LIVING Jatropha being used to run a tractor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204094347/http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-08/living/farmer.fuel_1_jatropha-diesel-fuel-biodiesel?_s=PM:LIVING |date=2010-12-04 }}</ref><ref>[http://extension.psu.edu/cropping-systems/documents/canola-fueled-tractors.pdf SVO from canola being used in tractors]</ref>\n\n=== Transmission ===\nMost older farm tractors use a [[manual transmission]] with several [[gear]] [[ratio]]s, typically three to six, sometimes multiplied into two or three ranges. This arrangement provides a set of discrete ratios that, combined with the varying of the throttle, allow final-drive speeds from less than one up to about 25 miles per hour (40&nbsp;km/h), with the lower speeds used for working the land and the highest speed used on the road.\n\nSlow, controllable speeds are necessary for most of the operations performed with a tractor. They help give the farmer a larger degree of control in certain situations, such as field work. However, when travelling on public roads, the slow operating speeds can cause problems, such as long queues or tailbacks, which can delay or annoy motorists in cars and trucks. These motorists are responsible for being duly careful around farm tractors and sharing the road with them, but many shirk this responsibility, so various ways to minimize the interaction or minimize the speed differential are employed where feasible. Some countries (for example the [[Netherlands]]) employ a [[road sign]] on some roads that means \"no farm tractors\". Some modern tractors, such as the [[J. C. Bamford|JCB]] Fastrac, are now capable of much higher road speeds of around 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).\n\n[[File:OlderModelTractor.JPG|thumb|left|An older model European farm tractor, of the type still common in Eastern Europe]]\nOlder tractors usually have [[Manual transmission#Unsynchronized transmission|unsynchronized]] transmission designs, which often require the operator stop the tractor to shift between gears. This mode of use is inherently unsuited to some of the work tractors do, and has been circumvented in various ways over the years. For existing unsynchronized tractors, the methods of circumvention are [[Double clutch (technique)|double clutching]] or power-shifting, both of which require the operator to rely on skill to speed-match the gears while shifting, and are undesirable from a risk-mitigation standpoint because of what can go wrong if the operator makes a mistake \u2013 transmission damage is possible, and loss of vehicle control can occur if the tractor is towing a heavy load either uphill or downhill \u2013 something that tractors often do. Therefore, operator's manuals for most of these tractors state one must always stop the tractor before shifting, and they do not even mention the alternatives. As already said, that mode of use is inherently unsuited to some of the work tractors do, so better options were pursued for newer tractor designs.\n\n[[File:John Deere 3350 tractor cut.JPG|thumb|Cutaway of modern tractor]]\n\nIn these, unsynchronized transmission designs were replaced with [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchronization]] or with [[continuously variable transmission]]s (CVTs). Either a synchronized manual transmission with enough available gear ratios (often achieved with dual ranges, high and low) or a CVT allow the engine speed to be matched to the desired final-drive speed, while keeping engine speed within the appropriate speed (as measured in rotations per minute or rpm) range for power generation (the working range) (whereas throttling back to achieve the desired final-drive speed is a trade-off that leaves the working range). The problems, solutions, and developments described here also describe the history of transmission evolution in [[semi-trailer truck]]s. The biggest difference is fleet turnover; whereas most of the old [[Tractor unit|road tractor]]s have long since been scrapped, many of the old farm tractors are still in use. Therefore, old transmission design and operation is primarily just of historical interest in trucking, whereas in farming it still often affects daily life.\n\n== Hitches and power applications ==\nThe power produced by the engine must be transmitted to the implement or equipment to do the actual work intended for the equipment.  This may be accomplished via a drawbar or hitch system if the implement is to be towed or otherwise pulled through the tractive power of the engine, or via a pulley or power takeoff system if the implement is stationary, or a combination of the two.\n\n=== Drawbars ===\nUntil the 1940s, [[plows]] and other tillage equipment usually were connected to the tractor via a [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]].  The classic drawbar is simply a steel bar attached to the tractor (or in some cases, as in the early Fordsons, cast as part of the rear transmission housing) to which the hitch of the implement was attached with a pin or by a loop and [[clevis]].  The implement could be readily attached and removed, allowing the tractor to be used for other purposes on a daily basis.  If the tractor was equipped with a swinging drawbar, then it could be set at the center or offset from center to allow the tractor to run outside the path of the implement.\n\nThe drawbar system necessitated the implement having its own running gear (usually wheels) and in the case of a plow, chisel cultivator or harrow, some sort of lift mechanism to raise it out of the ground at turns or for transport.  Drawbars necessarily posed a rollover risk depending on how the tractive torque was applied.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Amy|last2=Poots|first2=Jill|date=12 Apr 2018|title=Investigation of UK Farmer Go/No-Go Decisions in Response to Tractor-Based Risk Scenarios|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|volume=23|issue=2|pages=154\u2013165|doi=10.1080/1059924X.2017.1423000|pmid=29648955|url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/12160/1/JAg_tractorpaper_revision.pdf|hdl=2164/12160}}</ref> The Fordson tractor (of which more units were produced and placed in service than any other farm tractor) was extremely prone to roll over backwards due to an excessively short wheelbase.  The linkage between the implement and the tractor usually had some slack which could lead to jerky starts and greater wear and tear on the tractor and the equipment.\n\n[[File:Modern John Deere Tractor IMG 0401.JPG|thumb|left|350px|A large, modern John Deere model 9400 four-wheel drive tractor with tripled wheels and a drawbar-towed tool chain, including one-pass tillage equipment, planter and fertilizer applicator with tanks]]\n\nDrawbars were appropriate to the dawn of mechanization, because they were very simple in concept and because as the tractor replaced the horse, existing horse-drawn implements usually already had running gear. As the history of mechanization progressed, however, the advantages of other hitching systems became apparent, leading to new developments (see below).  Depending on the function for which a tractor is used, though, the drawbar is still one of the usual means of attaching an implement to a tractor (see photo at left).\n\n=== Fixed mounts ===\nSome tractor manufacturers produced matching equipment that could be directly mounted on the tractor.  Examples included front-end loaders, belly mowers, row crop cultivators, corn pickers and corn planters.  In most cases, these fixed mounts were proprietary and unique to each make of tractor, so an implement produced by John Deere, for example, could not be attached to a Minneapolis Moline tractor.  Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semi-permanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware. Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis.  As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time.  An implement generally would be mounted at the beginning of its season of use (such as tillage, planting or harvesting) and removed only when the likely use season had ended.\n\n=== Three-point hitches and quick hitches ===\nThe drawbar system was virtually the exclusive method of attaching implements (other than direct attachment to the tractor) before [[Harry Ferguson]] developed the [[three-point hitch]]. Equipment attached to the three-point hitch can be raised or lowered [[hydraulic]]ally with a control lever. The equipment attached to the three-point hitch is usually completely supported by the tractor. Another way to attach an implement is via a quick hitch, which is attached to the three-point hitch. This enables a single person to attach an implement quicker and put the person in less danger when attaching the implement.\n\n[[File:Tractor3pointhitchDubMay04.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A modern three-point hitch]]\n\nThe three-point hitch revolutionized farm tractors and their implements. While the Ferguson system was still under patent, other manufacturers developed new hitching systems to try to fend off some of Ferguson's competitive advantage. For example, International Harvester's [[Farmall]] tractors gained a two-point \"Fast Hitch\", and John Deere had a power lift that was similar to, but not as flexible as, the Ferguson invention. Once the patent protection expired on the three-point hitch, it became an industry standard.\n\nAlmost every tractor today features Ferguson's three-point linkage or a derivative of it.  This hitch allows for easy attachment and detachment of implements while allowing the implement to function as a part of the tractor, almost as if it were attached by a fixed mount.  Previously, when the implement hit an obstacle, the towing link would break or the tractor could flip over.  Ferguson's genius was to combine a connection via two lower and one upper lift arms that were connected to a hydraulic lifting ram.  The ram was, in turn, connected to the upper of the three links so the increased drag (as when a plough hits a rock) caused the hydraulics to lift the implement until the obstacle was passed.\n\nRecently, [[Bobcat Company|Bobcat's]] patent on its front loader connection (inspired by these earlier systems) has expired, and compact tractors are now being outfitted with quick-connect attachments for their [[loader (equipment)|front-end loaders]].\n\n=== Power take-off systems and hydraulics ===\nIn addition to towing an implement or supplying tractive power through the wheels, most tractors have a means to transfer power to another machine such as a [[baler]], [[swather]], or [[mower]].  Unless it functions solely by pulling it through or over the ground, a towed implement needs its own power source (such as a baler or combine with a separate engine) or else a means of transmitting power from the tractor to the mechanical operations of the equipment.\n\nEarly tractors used [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] or cables wrapped around the [[flywheel]] or a separate belt pulley to power stationary equipment, such as a threshing machine, buzz saw, silage blower, or stationary baler. In most cases, it was not practical for the tractor and equipment to move with a flexible belt or cable between them, so this system required the tractor to remain in one location, with the work brought to the equipment, or the tractor to be relocated at each turn and the power set-up reapplied (as in cable-drawn plowing systems used in early steam tractor operations).\n\n[[File:TractorPTOshaftMay04.jpg|left|150px|thumb|A PTO shaft connected to a tractor]]\n\nModern tractors use a [[power take-off]] (PTO) shaft to provide rotary power to machinery that may be stationary or pulled. The PTO shaft generally is at the rear of the tractor, and can be connected to an implement that is either towed by a drawbar or a three-point hitch.  This eliminates the need for a separate, implement-mounted power source, which is almost never seen in modern farm equipment. It is also optional to get a front PTO as well when buying a new tractor.\n\nVirtually all modern tractors can also provide external [[hydraulic fluid]] and [[electric]]al power to the equipment they are towing, either by hoses or wires.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Benin brown tractor 600.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A garden tractor towing a cargo cart]]\n\nModern tractors have many electrical switches and levers in the cab for controlling the multitude of different functions available on the tractor.\n\n=== Pedals ===\nModern farm tractors usually have four or five foot-pedals for the operator on the floor of the tractor.\n\nThe pedal on the left is the [[clutch]]. The operator presses on this pedal to disengage the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] for either shifting gears or stopping the tractor. Some modern tractors have (or as optional equipment) a button on the gear stick for controlling the clutch, in addition to the standard pedal.\n\nTwo of the pedals on the right are the [[brake]]s.  The left brake pedal stops the left rear wheel and the right brake pedal does the same with the right side.  This independent left and right wheel-braking augments the steering of the tractor when only the two rear wheels are driven. This is usually done when it is necessary to make a sharp turn. The split brake pedal is also used in mud or soft soil to control a tire spinning due to loss of traction. The operator presses both pedals together to stop the tractor. Usually a swinging or sliding bolt is provided to lock the two together when desired.\n\nThe pedal furthest to the right is the foot [[throttle]]. Unlike in automobiles, it can also be controlled from a hand-operated lever (\"hand throttle\").  This helps provide a constant speed in field work.  It also helps provide continuous power for stationary tractors that are operating an implement by shaft or belt.  The foot throttle gives the operator more automobile-like control over the speed of the tractor for road work.  This is a feature of more recent tractors; older tractors often did not have it. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], foot pedal use to control engine speed while travelling on the road is mandatory. Some tractors, especially those designed for row-crop work, have a 'de-accelerator' pedal, which operates in the reverse fashion to an automobile throttle, in that the pedal is pushed down to slow the engine. This allows fine control over the speed of the tractor when maneuvering at the end of crop rows in fields&nbsp;\u2013 the operating speed of the engine is set using the hand throttle, and to slow the tractor to turn, the operator simply has to press the pedal, and turn and release it once the turn is completed, rather than having to alter the setting of the hand throttle twice during the maneuver.\n\nA fifth pedal is traditionally included just in front of the driver's seat (often pressed with the operator's heel) to operate the rear [[locking differential|differential lock]] (diff-lock), which prevents wheel slip. The differential normally allows the outside wheel to travel faster than the inside wheel during a turn. However, in low-traction conditions on a soft surface, the same mechanism could allow one wheel to slip, further reducing traction. The diff-lock overrides this, forcing both wheels to turn at the same speed, reducing wheel slip and improving traction. Care must be taken to unlock the differential before turning, usually by hitting the pedal a second time, since the tractor with good traction cannot perform a turn with the diff-lock engaged. In modern tractors, this pedal is replaced with an electrical switch.\n\n=== Levers and switches ===\nMany functions once controlled with levers have been replaced with some model of electrical switch with the rise of indirect computer controlling of functions in modern tractors.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 1960s, tractors had a single register of gears, hence one gear stick, often with three to five forward gears and one reverse. Then, group gears were introduced, and another gear stick was added. Later, control of the forward-reverse direction was moved to a special stick attached at the side of the steering wheel, which allowed forward or reverse travel in any gear. Nowadays, with [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]]s or other clutch-free gear types, fewer sticks control the transmission, and some are replaced with electrical switches or are totally computer-controlled.\n\nThe three-point hitch was controlled with a lever for adjusting the position, or as with the earliest ones, just the function for raising or lowering the hitch. With modern electrical systems, it is often replaced with a potentiometer for the lower bound position and another one for the upper bound, and a switch allowing automatic adjustment of the hitch between these settings.\n\nThe external hydraulics also originally had levers, but now are often replaced with some form of electrical switch; the same is true for the [[power take-off]] shaft.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:Tractorrearturnover.gif|thumb|220px|right|Farm tractor rear turnover]]\n[[File:RogerTractorLarge.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The classic row crop tractor (an Allis-Chalmers WD).

For tractors with operator cabs, the ROPS is part\nof the [[Frame (vehicle)|frame]] of the cab. A ROPS with enclosed cab further reduces the likelihood of serious injury because the operator is protected by the sides and windows of the cab.\n\nThese structures were first required by legislation in Sweden in 1959. Before they were required, some farmers died when their tractors rolled on top of them.  Row-crop tractors, before ROPS, were particularly dangerous because of their 'tricycle' design with the two front wheels spaced close together and angled inward toward the ground. Some [[farmer]]s were killed by rollovers while operating tractors along [[wikt:steep|steep]] [[Grade (slope)|slopes]]. Others have been killed while attempting to tow or pull an excessive load from above axle height, or when cold weather caused the tires to freeze to the ground, in both cases causing the tractor to pivot around the rear axle.<ref name=\"nasd746\" /> ROPS were first required in the United States in 1986, but this requirement did not retroactively apply to tractors produced before this year; therefore, adoption of ROPS has been incomplete in the farming community. To combat this problem, CROPS (cost-effective roll-over protection structures) have been developed to encourage farmers to retrofit older tractors.<ref name=NIOSHBlog/>\n\nFor the ROPS to work as designed, the operator must stay within its protective frame. This means the operator must wear the seat belt; not wearing it may defeat the primary purpose of the ROPS.\n\n== Applications and variations ==\n\n=== Farm tractor applications ===\n[[File:JDTractor chisel-plough.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A modern [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] 8110 Farm Tractor plowing a field using a [[chisel plow]]]]\n[[File:Farmer and tractor tilling soil.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A tractor pulling a tiller]]\n\nThe most common use of the term \"tractor\" is for the [[vehicle]]s used on [[farm]]s. The farm tractor is used for pulling or pushing [[agriculture|agricultural]] machinery or [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]s, for [[plow]]ing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and similar tasks.\n\n[[File:TractorPoweringWaterpump.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A farm tractor used to power a [[pump]] for [[irrigating]] a plot of land]]\n\nA variety of specialty farm tractors have been developed for particular uses.  These include \"row crop\" tractors with adjustable tread width to allow the tractor to pass down rows of [[cereals]], [[maize]], [[tomatoes]] or other crops without crushing the plants, \"wheatland\" or \"standard\" tractors with fixed wheels and a lower center of gravity for plowing and other heavy field work for broadcast crops, and \"high crop\" tractors with adjustable tread and increased ground clearance, often used in the cultivation of cotton and other high-growing row crop plant operations, and \"utility tractors\", typically smaller tractors with a low center of gravity and short turning radius, used for general purposes around the farmstead. Many utility tractors are used for nonfarm grading, [[landscape maintenance]] and excavation purposes, particularly with loaders, backhoes, pallet forks and similar devices.  Small garden or [[lawn mowers|lawn tractor]]s designed for suburban and semirural gardening and landscape maintenance also exist in a variety of configurations.\n\n[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A tractor with a [[chaser bin]]]]\n\nSome farm-type tractors are found elsewhere than on farms: with large universities' gardening departments, in public parks, or for highway workman use with [[blowtorch]] cylinders strapped to the sides and a [[Jackhammer|pneumatic drill]] [[air compressor]] permanently fastened over the [[power take-off]]. These are often fitted with grass (turf) tyres which are less damaging to soft surfaces than agricultural tires.\n\n=== Precision agriculture ===\n[[Space technology]] has been incorporated into [[agriculture]] in the form of [[GPS]] devices, and robust on-board [[computers]] installed as optional features on farm tractors. These technologies are used in modern, [[precision farming]] techniques. The [[Government spin-off|spin-off]]s from the [[space race]] have actually facilitated [[automation]] in plowing and the use of autosteer systems ([[Unmanned ground vehicle|drone]] on tractors that are manned but only steered at the end of a row), the idea being to neither overlap and use more fuel nor leave streaks when performing jobs such as [[Agriculture|cultivating]]. Several tractor companies have also been working on producing a [[driverless tractor]].\n\n=== Engineering tractors ===\n[[File:Chelyabinsk tractor factory 1930s.jpg|thumb|right|260px|A tractor factory in [[Chelyabinsk]] in the [[Soviet Union]] circa 1930]]\n[[File:tractor fanguejant.jpg|thumb|[[Ebro trucks|Ebro]] farm tractor with steel wheel extensions.  This arrangement is often used in muddy conditions that are found in paddy farming of rice.]]\n\nThe durability and engine power of tractors made them very suitable for engineering tasks. Tractors can be fitted with engineering tools such as [[bulldozer|dozer blade]]s, [[loader (equipment)|bucket]]s, [[hoe (equipment)|hoe]]s, rippers, etc.  The most common attachments for the front of a tractor are dozer blades or buckets. When attached to engineering tools, the tractor is called an [[engineering vehicle]].\n\nA [[bulldozer]] is a [[tractor crawler|track-type tractor]]  with a blade attached in the front and a rope-winch behind. Bulldozers are very powerful tractors and have excellent ground-hold, as their main tasks are to push or drag.\n\nBulldozers have been further modified over time to evolve into new machines which are capable of working in ways that the original bulldozer can not. One example is that [[Loader (equipment)|loader]] tractors were created by removing the blade and substituting a large volume bucket and hydraulic arms which can raise and lower the bucket, thus making it useful for scooping up earth, rock and similar loose material to load it into trucks.\n\nA front-loader or loader is a tractor with an engineering tool which consists of two hydraulic powered arms on either side of the front engine compartment and a tilting implement. This is usually a wide-open box called a bucket, but other common attachments are a [[pallet fork]] and a bale grappler.\n\nOther modifications to the original bulldozer include making the machine smaller to let it operate in small work areas where movement is limited. Also, tiny wheeled loaders, officially called [[skid-steer loader]]s, but nicknamed \"[[Bobcat (equipment)|Bobcat]]\" after the original manufacturer, are particularly suited for small excavation projects in confined areas.\n\n=== Backhoe loader ===\n{{Main|Backhoe loader}}\n[[File:Backhoe and loader.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A common backhoe-loader \u2013 the backhoe is on the left, the bucket/blade on the right.]]\n\nThe most common variation of the classic farm '''tractor''' is the '''hoe''', also called a '''hoe-loader'''. As the name implies, it has a loader assembly on the front and a [[backhoe]] on the back. Backhoes attach to a three-point hitch on farm or industrial tractors.  Industrial tractors are often heavier in construction, particularly with regards to the use of a steel grill for protection from rocks and the use of construction tires. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] controls. Removable backhoe attachments almost always have a separate seat on the attachment.\n\nBackhoe-loaders are very common and can be used for a wide variety of tasks: construction, small demolitions, light transportation of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes, loading trucks, breaking [[asphalt]] and paving roads. Some buckets have retractable bottoms, enabling them to empty their loads more quickly and efficiently. Buckets with retractable bottoms are also often used for grading and scratching off sand. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted. Often the bucket can be replaced with other devices or tools.\n\nTheir relatively small frames and precise controls make backhoe-loaders very useful and common in [[civil engineering|urban engineering]] projects, such as construction and [[repair]]s in areas too small for larger equipment. Their versatility and compact size make them one of the most popular urban [[construction vehicle]]s.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, the word \"[[J. C. Bamford|JCB]]\" is used [[colloquial]]ly as a [[genericized trademark]] for any such type of engineering vehicle. The term JCB now appears in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], although it is still legally a [[trademark]] of J. C. Bamford Ltd. The term \"digger\" is also commonly used.\n\n=== Compact utility tractor ===\n<!-- [[File:Kubota- -New-Holland-CUTs.jpg|thumb|left|Kubota and New Holland compact tractors equipped with front-end loaders]] -->\n[[File:Farm Tractor vs CUT vs Garden Tractor.jpg|thumb|left|In the middle is a 24 hp (18 kW) diesel CUT illustrating the size difference between a small 40 hp farm tractor and a garden tractor.]]\n\nA compact utility tractor (CUT) is a smaller version of an agricultural tractor, but designed primarily for landscaping and estate management tasks rather than for planting and harvesting on a commercial scale. Typical CUTs range from 20 to 50 horsepower (15\u201337&nbsp;kW) with available [[power take-off]] (PTO) horsepower ranging from 15 to 45&nbsp;hp (11\u201334&nbsp;kW). CUTs are often equipped with both a mid-mounted and a standard rear PTO, especially those below 40 horsepower (30&nbsp;kW). The mid-mount PTO shaft typically rotates at/near 2000 rpm and is typically used to power mid-mount finish mowers, front-mounted [[snow blower]]s or front-mounted rotary brooms.  The rear PTO is standardized at 540 rpm for the North American markets, but in some parts of the world, a dual 540/1000 rpm PTO is standard, and implements are available for either standard in those markets.\n\n[[File:1subsoil1.jpg|thumb|right|Howse brand modular subsoiler mounted to a tractor]]\n[[File:Herd Seeder.jpeg|thumb|right|Broadcast seeder mounted to a Kubota CUT]]\n\nOne of the most common attachment for a CUT is the [[front-end loader]] or FEL. Like the larger agricultural tractors, a CUT will have an adjustable, hydraulically controlled [[three-point hitch]]. Typically, a CUT will have four-wheel drive, or more correctly four-wheel assist. Modern CUTs often feature hydrostatic transmissions, but many variants of gear-drive transmissions are also offered from low priced, simple gear transmissions to synchronized transmissions to advanced glide-shift transmissions. All modern CUTs feature government-mandated [[roll over protection structure]]s just like agricultural tractors. The most well-known brands in North America include [[Kubota Corporation|Kubota]], [[John Deere Tractor]], [[New Holland Ag]], Case-Farmall and Massey-Ferguson.  Although less common, compact backhoes are often attached to compact utility tractors.\n\n[[File:JD 71 Flexi Planter, 2 Row.jpg|thumb|left|JD 71 Flexi [[Planter (farm implement)|Planter]] for tractors 20 to 35 horsepower]]\n\nCompact utility tractors require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors.  Very common implements include the [[box blade]], the [[grader]] blade, the landscape rake, the post hole digger (or post hole [[auger (drill)|auger]]), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a [[broadcast seeder]], a [[subsoiler]] and the [[rototiller]] (rotary tiller).  In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models are available with front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumber tractor brands, so CUT owners have a wide selection of implements.\n\nFor small-scale farming or large-scale gardening, some planting and harvesting implements are sized for CUTs. One- and two-row planting units are commonly available, as are cultivators, sprayers and different types of seeders (slit, rotary and drop).  One of the first CUTs offered for small farms of three to 30 acres and for small jobs on larger farms was a three-wheeled unit, with the rear wheel being the drive wheel, offered by Sears & Roebuck in 1954 and priced at $598 for the basic model.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1t4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96 \"Three Wheeled Tractor With Implements Handles Small-Farm Work.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1954, p. 96.</ref>\n\n=== Standard tractor ===\nThe earliest tractors were called \"standard\" tractors, and were intended almost solely for [[plough|plowing]] and [[harrow (tool)|harrowing]] before planting, which were difficult tasks for humans and [[working animal|draft animals]]. They were characterized by a low, rearward seating position, fixed-width tread, and low ground clearance. These early tractors were cumbersome, and were not well-suited to getting into a field of already-planted row crops to do weed control. The \"standard\" tractor definition is no longer in current use.\n\n=== Row-crop tractor ===\nA '''general-purpose''' or '''row-crop tractor''' is tailored specifically to the growing of crops grown in rows, and most especially to [[cultivator|cultivating]] these crops. These tractors are universal machines, capable of both [[tillage|primary tillage]] and cultivation of a crop. The \"row-crop\" or \"general-purpose\" designation is no longer in current use. \n<!-- relevant? out of place?\n\"Row crop\" refers to any farm [[crop]] cultivated in rows. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines row crop as an \"[a]gricultural crop planted, usually with mechanical planting devices, in individual rows that are spaced to permit machine traffic during the early parts of the growing season\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/cropglossary.html |title=Crop Glossary &#124; Ag 101 &#124; Agriculture &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref>-->\n\n==== Row-crop tractor history ====\n[[File:Farmall regular web.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Farmall \"Regular\"]]\n\nThe row-crop tractor category evolved rather than appearing overnight, but the [[International Harvester]] (IH) [[Farmall]] is often considered the \"first\" tractor of the category. Some earlier tractors of the 1910s and 1920s approached the form factor from the heavier side, as did motorized cultivators from the lighter side, but the Farmall brought all of the salient features together into one package, with a capable distribution network to ensure its commercial success. In the new form factor that the Farmall popularized, the [[cultivator]] was mounted in the front so it was easily visible. Additionally, the tractor had a narrow front end; the front tires were spaced very closely and angled in towards the bottom. The back wheels straddled two rows, and the unit could cultivate four rows at once.\n\nFrom 1924 until 1963, Farmalls were the largest selling row-crop tractors.\n\nTo compete, [[John Deere]] designed the [[List of John Deere tractors|Model C]], which had a wide front and could cultivate three rows at once. Only 112 prototypes were made, as Deere realized sales would be lost to Farmall if their model did less. In 1928, Deere released the Model C anyway, only as the [[Model GP]] (General Purpose) to avoid confusion with the Model D when ordered over the then unclear telephone.<ref name=\"KlancherLeffingwellMorland2003}\">{{Harvnb|Klancher|Leffingwell|Morland|Pripps|2003}}.</ref>\n\nOliver refined its \"Row Crop\" model early in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/machines_04.html |title=Tractors Advance during the Depression |publisher=Livinghistoryfarm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> Until 1935, the 18\u201327 was Oliver\u2013[[Hart-Parr]]'s only row-crop tractor.<ref name=\"Ertel2001p72\">{{Harvnb|Ertel|2001|p=72}}.</ref>\nMany Oliver row-crop models are referred to as \"Oliver Row Crop 77\", \"Oliver Row Crop 88\", etc.\n\n==== Row-crop tractor safety ====\nMany early row-crop tractors had a tricycle design with two closely spaced front tires, and some even had a single front tire. This made it dangerous to operate on the side of a steep hill; as a result, many farmers died from tractor rollovers. Also, early row-crop tractors had no [[rollover protection system]] (ROPS), meaning if the tractor flipped back, the operator could be crushed. Sweden was the first country which passed legislation requiring ROPS, in 1959.\n\nOver 50% of tractor related injuries and deaths are attributed to tractor [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]].<ref name=\"Donham, K. 1999\"/>\n\n==== Modern row-crop tractors ====\nCanadian agricultural equipment manufacturer [[Versatile (company)|Versatile]] makes row-crop tractors that are {{convert|265|to|365|hp|kW}}; powered by an 8.9 liter [[Cummins Diesel]] engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cumminsengines.com/showcase-item.aspx?id=110&title=QSL9+for+Agriculture+(Tier+4+Interim)&|title=QSL9 for Agriculture (Tier 4 Interim)|website=Cummins Engines|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versatile-ag.com/NA/pages/product_mfwd.php|title=Versatile - MFWD Tractors|website=www.versatile-ag.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Case IH]] and [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] of [[CNH Industrial]] both produce high horsepower front-wheel-assist row crop tractors with available rear tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agriculture1.newholland.com/nar/en-us/equipment/products/tractors-telehandlers/genesis-t8-series-tier-4b|title=GENESIS\u00ae T8 Series \u2013 Tier 4B - Overview {{!}} Tractors \uff06 Telehandlers {{!}} New Holland (US)|website=agriculture1.newholland.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  Case IH also has a 500&nbsp;hp (373&nbsp;kW) four-wheel drive track system called Rowtrac.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caseih.com/northamerica/en-us/Pages/campaigns/track-leadership.aspx|title=Track Technology {{!}} Quadtrac and Rowtrac Tractors {{!}} Case IH|website=Case IH|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n[[John Deere]] has an extensive line of available row crop tractors ranging from 140 to 400 horsepower (104 to 298&nbsp;kW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deere.com/en/tractors/row-crop-tractors/|title=John Deere Tractors {{!}} Row Crop Tractors {{!}} John Deere US|website=www.deere.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\nModern row crop tractors have rollover protection systems in the form of a reinforced cab or a [[roll cage|roll bar]].\n\n=== Garden tractors ===\nGarden tractors (mini tractors) are small, light tractors designed for use in domestic [[garden]]s and small estates. Garden tractors are designed for cutting [[grass]], snow removal, and small property cultivation. In the U.S., the term [[Lawn mower#Riding (ride-on) mowers|riding lawn mower]] today often is used to refer to mid- or rear-engined machines. Front-engined tractor layout machines designed primarily for cutting grass and light towing are called [[lawn tractors]]; heavier-duty tractors of similar size are garden tractors. Garden tractors are capable of mounting a wider array of attachments than lawn tractors. Unlike lawn tractors and rear-engined riding mowers, garden tractors are powered by horizontal-crankshaft engines with a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]]-drive to [[transaxle]]-type transmissions (usually of four or five speeds, although some may also have two-speed reduction gearboxes, drive-shafts, or hydrostatic or [[Hydrokinetic transmission|hydraulic drives]]). Garden tractors from [[Wheel Horse]], [[Cub Cadet]], Economy (Power King), John Deere, [[Massey Ferguson]] and Case [[Ingersoll Power Equipment|Ingersoll]] are built in this manner. The engines are generally one- or two-cylinder petrol (gasoline) engines, although [[diesel engine]] models are also available, especially in Europe. Typically, diesel-powered garden tractors are larger and heavier-duty than gasoline-powered units and compare more similarly to compact utility tractors.\n\nVisually, the distinction between a garden tractor and a lawn tractor is often hard to make \u2013 generally, garden tractors are more sturdily built, with stronger frames, 12-inch or larger wheels mounted with multiple lugs (most lawn tractors have a single bolt or clip on the hub), heavier transaxles, and ability to accommodate a wide range of front, belly, and rear mounted attachments.\n\n=== Two-wheel tractors ===\n{{main|Two-wheel tractor}}\nAlthough most people think first of four-wheel vehicles when they think of tractors, a tractor may have one or more axles. The key benefit is the power itself, which only takes one axle to provide. Single-axle tractors, more often called [[two-wheel tractor]]s or walk-behind tractors, have had many users since the beginning of [[internal combustion engine]] tractors. They tend to be small and affordable. This was especially true before the 1960s, when a walk-behind tractor could often be more affordable than a two-axle tractor of comparable power. Today's compact utility tractors and advanced garden tractors may negate most of that market advantage, but two-wheel tractors still enjoy a loyal following, especially where an already-paid-for two-wheel tractor is financially superior to a compact or garden tractor that would have to be purchased. Countries where two-wheel tractors are especially prevalent today include [[Thailand]], [[China]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], and other [[Southeast Asia]] countries.\n\n=== Orchard tractors ===\nTractors tailored to use in fruit [[orchard]]s typically have features suited to passing under tree branches with impunity. These include a lower overall profile; reduced tree-branch-snagging risk (via underslung exhaust pipes rather than smoke-stack-style exhaust, and large sheetmetal [[cowling]]s and [[:wikt:fairing|fairing]]s that allow branches to deflect and slide off rather than catch); [[spark arrestor]]s on the exhaust tips; and often wire cages to protect the operator from snags.\n\n=== Automobile-conversion tractors and other homemade versions ===\n[[File:Model T tractor.png|thumb|A [[Model T]] tractor pulling a plow]]\n[[File:Pullford auto-to-tractor conversion advert 1918.png|thumb|left|An advertisement for auto-to-tractor conversion kits, 1918]]\n[[File:Ford epa tractor.jpg|thumb|A Ford rebuilt to an EPA tractor]]\n[[File:Duett-EPA-rear.jpg|thumb|left|A Volvo Duett rebuilt to an EPA tractor. Obviously the intended use is no longer as a farm vehicle.]]\n[[File:Volvo at Power Big Meet 2005.jpg|thumb|An \"A tractor\" based on [[Volvo 760]] \u2013 notice the slow-vehicle triangle and the longer boot.]]\n\nThe ingenuity of farm mechanics, coupled in some cases with [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] or [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] assistance, has often resulted in the conversion of automobiles for use as farm tractors. In the United States, this trend was especially strong from the 1910s through 1950s. It began early in the development of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, with blacksmiths and amateur mechanics tinkering in their shops. Especially during the [[interwar period]], dozens of manufacturers ([[Montgomery Ward]] among them) marketed aftermarket kits for converting [[Ford Model T]]s for use as tractors.<ref name=\"PrippsMorland1993p28\">{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|p=28}}.</ref> (These were sometimes called 'Hoover wagons' during the [[Great Depression]], although this term was usually reserved for [[Bennett buggy|automobiles converted to horse-drawn buggy use]] when gasoline was unavailable or unaffordable.  During the same period, another common name was \"[[Doodlebug tractor|Doodlebug]]\".) Ford even considered producing an \"official\" optional kit.<ref name=\"Leffingwell2004p43-53\">{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2004|pp=43\u201353}}.</ref> Many [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Model A Fords]] also were converted for this purpose. In later years, some farm mechanics have been known to convert more modern trucks or cars for use as tractors, more often as curiosities or for recreational purposes (rather than out of the earlier motives of pure necessity or frugality).\n\n{{Anchor|EPA tractors in Sweden}}\nDuring [[World War&nbsp;II]], a shortage of tractors in [[Sweden]] led to the development of the so-called \"EPA\" tractor (EPA was a chain of discount stores and it was often used to signify something lacking in quality). An EPA tractor was simply an automobile, truck or lorry, with the passenger space cut off behind the front seats, equipped with two gearboxes in a row. When done to an older car with a [[ladder frame]], the result was not dissimilar to a tractor and could be used as one.  After the war it remained popular, now not as a farm vehicle, but as a way for young people without a [[driver's license]] to own something similar to a car. Since it was legally seen as a tractor, it could be driven from 16 years of age and only required a tractor license. Eventually, the legal loophole was closed and no new EPA tractors were allowed to be made, but the remaining ones were still legal, which led to inflated prices and many protests from people who preferred EPA tractors to ordinary cars.\n\nThe German occupation of Italy during World {{nowrap|War II}} resulted in a severe shortage of mechanized farm equipment.  The destruction of tractors was a sort of [[scorched earth|scorched-earth]] strategy used to reduce the independence of the conquered.  The shortage of tractors in that area of Europe was the origin of [[History of Lamborghini#Origin|Lamborghini]].  The war was also the inspiration for dual-purpose vehicles such as the [[Land Rover]].  Based on the Jeep, the company made a vehicle that combined PTO, tillage, and transportation.\n\nIn March 1975, a similar type of vehicle was introduced in Sweden, the ''A tractor'' [from ''arbetstraktor'' (work tractor)]; the main difference is an A tractor has a top speed of 30&nbsp;km/h. This is usually done by fitting two gearboxes in a row and not using one of them. The [[Volvo Duett]] was, for a long time, the primary choice for conversion to an EPA or A tractor, but since supplies have dried up, other cars have been used, in most cases another [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]. The [[SFRO]] is a Swedish organization advocating homebuilt and modified vehicles.\n\nAnother type of homemade tractors are ones that are [[fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] from scratch. The \"[[wikt:from scratch#Adverb|from scratch]]\" description is relative, as often individual components will be repurposed from earlier vehicles or machinery (e.g., engines, gearboxes, axle housings), but the tractor's overall [[chassis]] is essentially designed and built by the owner (e.g., a frame is welded from [[bar stock]]\u2014channel stock, angle stock, flat stock, etc.). As with automobile conversions, the heyday of this type of tractor, at least in developed economies, lies in the past, when there were large populations of blue-collar workers for whom [[metalworking]] and [[farming]] were prevalent parts of their lives. (For example, many 19th- and 20th-century [[New England]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] machinists and factory workers had grown up on farms.) Backyard fabrication was a natural activity to them (whereas it might seem daunting to most people today).\n\n=== Alternative machine types called tractors ===\nThe term \"tractor\" (US and Canada) or \"tractor unit\" (UK) is also applied to:\n* '''Road tractors''', '''[[tractor unit]]s''' or traction heads, familiar as the front end of an [[articulated lorry]] / [[semi-trailer truck]]. They are heavy-duty [[vehicle]]s with large [[engine]]s and several [[axle]]s.\n** The majority of these tractors are designed to pull long [[semi-trailer]]s, most often to transport freight over a significant distance, and is connected to the trailer with a [[fifth wheel coupling]]. In England, this type of \"tractor\" is often called an \"[[Semi-trailer truck|artic cab]]\" (short for \"articulated\" cab).\n** A minority is the [[ballast tractor]], whose load is hauled from a [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]].\n* '''[[Pushback|Pushback tractors]]''' are used on airports to move aircraft on the ground, most commonly pushing aircraft away from their parking stands.\n* [[Locomotive]] tractors ([[engine]]s) or [[rail car mover]]s \u2013 the amalgamation of [[machine]]s, [[electrical generator]]s, controls and devices that comprise the [[traction component]] of [[railway]] [[vehicle]]s\n* [[Artillery tractor]]s \u2013 vehicles used to tow [[artillery]] pieces of varying weights.\n* [[NASA]] and [[list of space agencies|other space agencies]] use [[Crawler-transporter|very large tractors]] to move large [[launch vehicle]]s and [[space shuttle]]s between their hangars and [[launch pad]]s.\n* A [[pipe-tractor]] is a device used for conveying advanced instruments into pipes for measurement and data logging, and the purging of well holes, sewer pipes and other inaccessible tubes.\n<gallery>\nFile:UP Diesel.png|Diesel-electric [[locomotive]] at work\nFile:Trackmobile.jpg|A Trackmobile 4150\nFile:PushbackCargolux.jpg|Aircraft [[Pushback|pushback tractor]]\nFile:Backing it in 2.jpg|Road tractor pulling a flatbed trailer\n</gallery>\n\n== Glossary of tractor-related terms not explained elsewhere ==\n* {{Anchor|Nebraska tractor tests}} '''Nebraska tractor tests''': Tests, mandated by the [[Nebraska]] Tractor Test Law and administered by the [[University of Nebraska system|University of Nebraska]], that objectively test the performance of all brands of tractors, 40 horsepower or more, sold in Nebraska.

He placed a larger emphasis on the censorship of Disney references, however, jokingly arguing that he resented the censorship of his \"factually accurate\" Donald Duck joke more than the Modi episode being pulled, and alluded to his role of [[Zazu (Disney character)|Zazu]] in Disney's 2019 CGI remake of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2020/03/08/john-oliver-slams-disneys-hotstar-for-censoring-his-show/|title=John Oliver slams Disney for censoring his show in India|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref><ref name=\"thr-lwthotstar\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|www.hotstar.com}}\n* \n{{Disney}}\n{{VOD_services}}\n{{Star TV}}\n{{Star Sports}}\n\n[[Category:Indian entertainment websites]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:Star India]]\n[[Category:Star Sports]]\n[[Category:Self-censorship]]\n[[Category:Disney+]]\n", "name_user": "Lagaash", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2BHotstar"}
