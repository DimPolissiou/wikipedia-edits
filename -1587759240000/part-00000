The current mayor is [[Eric Johnson (Texas politician)|Eric Johnson]], who has served one term since [[2019 Dallas mayoral election|2019]] and is the 62nd mayor to serve the position. Dallas operates under a weak-mayor system, and a board-appointed city manager operates as the chief executive of the city.\n\n==Duties and powers==\nThe city of [[Dallas]] operates under a [[council-manager government]] type, putting the city of Dallas in a unique position as being one of the largest cities in the United States to utilize this municipal government structure. Unlike the more common form of government used by large cities known as the [[mayor-council government]] - where the mayor serves the chief-executive position of the city - the council-manager government of the city of Dallas gives the chief-executive position to the appointed [[City Manager]]. As a result, the mayor is elected [[at-large]] and serves a largely ceremonial position fulfilling a handful of key duties. The mayor serves as a member of the city council, presides over city council meetings and official ceremonies, and serves as a representative to the City of Dallas at a local, state, national, and international level. Likewise, it is not uncommon for mayors of the city of Dallas to simultaneously serve as members or heads of other committees while in office, further representing the interests of the people and city of Dallas in organizations and committees.\n\n==History==\nThe Office of Mayor was created with the formation of the Dallas City Charter in 1856, also providing for the mayor six aldermen, a treasurer, recorder and a constable. In the charter, it was stated that each office would be elected for a term of one year.<ref name=\"Historical Dallas City Charter_1\">{{Cite web |url=https://dallascityhall.com/government/DCH%20documents/01Chartr%20(1).pdf |title=01Chartr (1).pdf |publisher=City of Dallas |page=5 |pages=}}</ref> In the reorganization of 1876, the mayor was elected to the office for a term of two years.<ref name=\"Historical Dallas City Charter_2\">{{Cite web |url=https://dallascityhall.com/government/DCH%20documents/01Chartr%20(1).pdf |title=01Chartr (1).pdf |publisher=City of Dallas |page=6 |pages=}}</ref> The office was first elected in the [[Dallas municipal election, 1856|election of 1856]], in which Dr. [[Samuel B. Pryor]] defeated [[A. D. Rice]] for the position.<ref name=\"List of Elections\">{{Cite web |url=http://citysecretary2.dallascityhall.com/pdf/Elections/ElectMasterList.pdf |title=ElectMasterList.pdf |publisher=City of Dallas |page=5 |pages=}}</ref> A. D. Rice would run for office again and go on to serve as the 4th mayor of the city.\n\nFor much of the 19th century, mayors of the city of Dallas only served as much as one term, even after the reorganization of 1876. This precedence was broken at the end of [[Winship C. Connor]]'s term, who \u2013 after serving three consecutive terms from 1887 to 1894 \u2013 was the longest-serving mayor of the city at the time. His success was accredited to the development of the city's first water, power, and streetcar systems.\n\nThe municipal government of Dallas underwent two significant changes in its structure during its history. The first change was made in 1907 where the city voted to change from an [[alderman]] structure to a commission form of government. [[Stephen J. Hay]] was the first mayor elected in this new form of government, demonstrating the success of the highly debated commission form of government and contributing to the development of [[White Rock Lake]] in response to a water shortage in 1910. The second major government change was made in 1930, altering the commission form of government to specifically be a council-manager form. The mayor to serve following that change was [[Tom Bradford]], a successful grocer who was a significant financial contributor to the Bradford Memorial Hospital for Babies, the preliminary institution to the [[Children's Medical Center Dallas]]. He died after suffering a major heart attack in 1932 and was the first mayor of Dallas to die in office.\n\n[[Woodall Rodgers]] was mayor of Dallas from 1939 to 1947, with his tenure as mayor being one of the longest in the history of the city. He was mayor during World War II and ran during the rampant manufacturing of aircraft and weapon goods in a rapidly industrializing Dallas, along with the neighboring city of [[Fort Worth]]. At the time, [[Dallas Love Field]] was used as a joint [[USAAF]] base and training ground and saw expansion of its hub and runways at the end of the war to soon become the major jet-age airport of the city. He was also mayor when the [[Mercantile National Bank Building]] was constructed, which was the only highrise structure built in the United States during World War II and was the tallest building in the city of Dallas until the completion of [[Republic Center Tower I]] in 1954. The economic success contributed by his work in office is commemorated today by several namesakes throughout the city, most notably the [[Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] that passes underneath [[Klyde Warren Park]] and over the Trinity River along the [[Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge]].\n\n[[Earle Cabell]] served as 48th mayor from 1961 to 1964 and was mayor during the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] in the city.\n\nThe image of the city of Dallas was immensely tarnished by the assassination of the President. Following Earle Cabell was Mayor [[J. Erik Jonsson]] who funded and supported the then proposed [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. As mayor, he went on to support and open public works such as developing the new [[Dallas City Hall]], the [[Dallas Convention Center]], and the [[J. Erik Jonsson Central Library|Dallas Central Library]] which is now named in his honor. He was followed by [[Wes Wise]] who went on to further improve the city's image during his term from 1971 to 1973. However, he stepped down to pursue a political career in [[United States Congress]] before the end of his term. His pro-term mayoral successor, [[Adlene Harrison]], stepped in and became acting mayor for the remainder of his term. She was the city's first female mayor, and the first female Jewish mayor in the United States. Although [[Dianne Feinstein]] is officially recognized as the first female Jewish mayor in the United States, Adlene Harrison's position as acting mayor predates Feinstein's start in office by almost two years. Adlene began serving as acting mayor on February 11, 1976, while Feinstein began her mayoralty on December 4, 1978. Adlene would go on to serve as a member of several environmental committees and organizations after her short tenure, including the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. The city's second female mayor, [[Annette Strauss]], coincidentally was also the city's second female Jewish mayor. She was also the first woman to be elected mayor in her own right.\n\n[[Ron Kirk]] was the first African-American mayor of the City of Dallas and served two terms from 1995 to 2002. As mayor, he led several efforts advocating for race equality and social welfare, mitigated tension between City Council and the controversial Dallas School Board, advocated for economic development, and oversaw the construction of the [[American Airlines Center]]. He would later step down to pursue a seat in the US Senate, where he lost in the 2002 election to [[John Cornyn]]. After his defeat, he went on to become a lobbyist before being nominated and appointed by President [[Barack Obama]] to served as [[United States Trade Representative]] from 2009 to 2013.\n\n==List==\n[[File:Samuel-b-pryor.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Samuel B.

The current mayor is [[Eric Johnson (Texas politician)|Eric Johnson]], who has served one term since [[2019 Dallas mayoral election|2019]] and is the 62nd mayor to serve the position. Dallas operates under a weak-mayor system, and a board-appointed city manager operates as the chief executive of the city.\n\n==Duties and powers==\nThe city of [[Dallas]] operates under a [[council-manager government]] type, putting the city of Dallas in a unique position as being one of the largest cities in the United States to utilize this municipal government structure. Unlike the more common form of government used by large cities known as the [[mayor-council government]] - where the mayor serves the chief-executive position of the city - the council-manager government of the city of Dallas gives the chief-executive position to the appointed [[City Manager]]. As a result, the mayor is elected [[at-large]] and serves a largely ceremonial position fulfilling a handful of key duties. The mayor serves as a member of the city council, presides over city council meetings and official ceremonies, and serves as a representative to the City of Dallas at a local, state, national, and international level. Likewise, it is not uncommon for mayors of the city of Dallas to simultaneously serve as members or heads of other committees while in office, further representing the interests of the people and city of Dallas in organizations and committees.\n\n==History==\nThe Office of Mayor was created with the formation of the Dallas City Charter in 1856, also providing for the mayor six aldermen, a treasurer, recorder and a constable. In the charter, it was stated that each office would be elected for a term of one year.<ref name=\"Historical Dallas City Charter_1\">{{Cite web |url=https://dallascityhall.com/government/DCH%20documents/01Chartr%20(1).pdf |title=01Chartr (1).pdf |publisher=City of Dallas |page=5 |pages=}}</ref> In the reorganization of 1876, the mayor was elected to the office for a term of two years.<ref name=\"Historical Dallas City Charter_2\">{{Cite web |url=https://dallascityhall.com/government/DCH%20documents/01Chartr%20(1).pdf |title=01Chartr (1).pdf |publisher=City of Dallas |page=6 |pages=}}</ref> The office was first elected in the [[Dallas municipal election, 1856|election of 1856]], in which Dr. [[Samuel B. Pryor]] defeated [[A. D. Rice]] for the position.<ref name=\"List of Elections\">{{Cite web |url=http://citysecretary2.dallascityhall.com/pdf/Elections/ElectMasterList.pdf |title=ElectMasterList.pdf |publisher=City of Dallas |page=5 |pages=}}</ref> A. D. Rice would run for office again and go on to serve as the 4th mayor of the city.\n\nFor much of the 19th century, mayors of the city of Dallas only served as much as one term, even after the reorganization of 1876. This precedence was broken at the end of [[Winship C. Connor]]'s term, who \u2013 after serving three consecutive terms from 1887 to 1894 \u2013 was the longest-serving mayor of the city at the time. His success was accredited to the development of the city's first water, power, and streetcar systems.\n\nThe municipal government of Dallas underwent two significant changes in its structure during its history. The first change was made in 1907 where the city voted to change from an [[alderman]] structure to a commission form of government. [[Stephen J. Hay]] was the first mayor elected in this new form of government, demonstrating the success of the highly debated commission form of government and contributing to the development of [[White Rock Lake]] in response to a water shortage in 1910. The second major government change was made in 1930, altering the commission form of government to specifically be a council-manager form. The mayor to serve following that change was [[Tom Bradford]], a successful grocer who was a significant financial contributor to the Bradford Memorial Hospital for Babies, the preliminary institution to the [[Children's Medical Center Dallas]]. He died after suffering a major heart attack in 1932 and was the first mayor of Dallas to die in office.\n\n[[Woodall Rodgers]] was mayor of Dallas from 1939 to 1947, with his tenure as mayor being one of the longest in the history of the city. He was mayor during World War II and ran during the rampant manufacturing of aircraft and weapon goods in a rapidly industrializing Dallas, along with the neighboring city of [[Fort Worth]]. At the time, [[Dallas Love Field]] was used as a joint [[USAAF]] base and training ground and saw expansion of its hub and runways at the end of the war to soon become the major jet-age airport of the city. He was also mayor when the [[Mercantile National Bank Building]] was constructed, which was the only highrise structure built in the United States during World War II and was the tallest building in the city of Dallas until the completion of [[Republic Center Tower I]] in 1954. The economic success contributed by his work in office is commemorated today by several namesakes throughout the city, most notably the [[Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] that passes underneath [[Klyde Warren Park]] and over the Trinity River along the [[Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge]].\n\n[[Earle Cabell]] served as 48th mayor from 1961 to 1964 and was mayor during the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] in the city.\n\nThe image of the city of Dallas was immensely tarnished by the assassination of the President. Following Earle Cabell was Mayor [[J. Erik Jonsson]] who funded and supported the then proposed [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. As mayor, he went on to support and open public works such as developing the new [[Dallas City Hall]], the [[Dallas Convention Center]], and the [[J. Erik Jonsson Central Library|Dallas Central Library]] which is now named in his honor. He was followed by [[Wes Wise]] who went on to further improve the city's image during his term from 1971 to 1973. However, he stepped down to pursue a political career in [[United States Congress]] before the end of his term. His pro-term mayoral successor, [[Adlene Harrison]], stepped in and became acting mayor for the remainder of his term. She was the city's first female mayor, and the first female Jewish mayor in the United States. Although [[Dianne Feinstein]] is officially recognized as the first female Jewish mayor in the United States, Adlene Harrison's position as acting mayor predates Feinstein's start in office by almost two years. Adlene began serving as acting mayor on February 11, 1976, while Feinstein began her mayoralty on December 4, 1978. Adlene would go on to serve as a member of several environmental committees and organizations after her short tenure, including the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. The city's second female mayor, [[Annette Strauss]], coincidentally was also the city's second female Jewish mayor. She was also the first woman to be elected mayor in her own right.\n\n[[Ron Kirk]] was the first African-American mayor of the City of Dallas and served two terms from 1995 to 2002. As mayor, he led several efforts advocating for race equality and social welfare, mitigated tension between City Council and the controversial Dallas School Board, advocated for economic development, and oversaw the construction of the [[American Airlines Center]]. He would later step down to pursue a seat in the US Senate, where he lost in the 2002 election to [[John Cornyn]]. After his defeat, he went on to become a lobbyist before being nominated and appointed by President [[Barack Obama]] to served as [[United States Trade Representative]] from 2009 to 2013.\n\n==List==\n[[File:Samuel-b-pryor.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Samuel B.

See Holth, [http://www.historicbridges.org/b_c_on_middlesex.htm].</ref> surrounding the confluence of the North Thames and Thames rivers, which fixes the historic center of London.\n\nThe significance of the bridge is due to the age, type, material and rarity. According to bridge historian Nathan Holth,[[Image:1878-9, showing Carling Brewery.jpg|thumb|right|314x314px|ca 1878: Blackfriars Bridge from southeast; Petersville left, original [[Carling]] brewery right]]<blockquote>Bowstring bridges are one of the rarest types of [[truss bridges]], and most date in the 1870s. They fell out of favor due to the limited weight they could support. Any [[Truss bridge#Bowstring arch truss|bowstring truss]] bridge that survives today is a miracle. Truss bridges are always intricate structures, but bowstring trusses are even more so.  There [are] [[Lattice girder|lattice]], v-lacing, and members all over. This large amount of complexity is balanced by the simple, graceful appearance of the arched top chord. The result is a bridge with incomparable beauty and appeal.\n\nAmong the rarest and oldest bridges in Canada is this breathtaking iron bowstring truss. Keystone Columns form the top chord. A sidewalk on the south side appears to be original.<ref>Nathan Holth, \"Historic Bridges.org\" [http://www.historicbridges.org/truss/blackfriars/index.htm].

The raised pedestrian guardrail is likely owing to the original's being less than 31 inches or 80 cm above an outward sloping snowpack after heavy snows.</ref></blockquote>It has been designated a historic structure under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''. \n\n===Closure to vehicular traffic===\n[[Image:Blackfriars Street Bridge, east approach.jpg|thumb|263x263px|2007: Bridge from southeast; showing west bank modern dike, Oxford Street bridge upstream, north - photo PM]]\n\nThe bridge was closed to all traffic on 13 May 2013, for the purpose of extensive infrastructural assessment and repair, with plans to re-open it by August 2013.<ref>http://www.am980.ca/2013/08/22/blackfriars-bridge-closed/</ref> Due to the extent and cost (approximately $3M) of repairs required, the closure was extended indefinitely, and subsequently re-opened to pedestrian traffic in December 2013.<ref>http://london.ctvnews.ca/blackfriars-bridge-reopens-to-pedestrians-cyclists-1.1600968</ref> Access has been restricted to a pedestrian pathway by using temporary fencing, pending an environmental assessment to determine whether it will be feasible to re-open the bridge to vehicular traffic. {{as of|2017|06}}, the bridge has been listed as under repair, with plans to reopen it to East bound only traffic, cyclists and pedestrians, to officially reopen in 2018-2019.\n\n===Restoration===\nIn 2017, a $7.9m plan was started, for a rebuild of the bridge. \n\nOn November 27, 2017, the bridge was cut in half, and lifted to the banks of the Thames, for moving to an off site location for refurbishment.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/blackfriars-bridge-removed-1.4420328</ref> After one year of rehabilitation, the Blackfriars Bridge was reopened to pedestrians, motorists and cyclists immediately following a grand opening celebration on Saturday, December 1, 2018.<ref>http://www.london.ca/residents/Roads-Transportation/infrastructure-road-projects/Pages/blackfriarsbridge.aspx</ref>\n\n==Natural and cultural aspects==\nMuch of the beauty and appeal of the bridge is its appearance of floating (from many profile views up and downstream on both banks of the gently winding river). That is owed to its strung-bow shape and its light placement at its very tips upon modest granite abutments \u2014 a feature rare among more modern [[tied-arch bridges]]. These abutments bear the passive vertical load of the open structure itself. However, the varying 'live' thrust forces of traffic downward on its deck are translated by the bowed chord above into horizontal tensions along the longitudinal iron eyebars of the 'string' or bottom chord running parallel to the deck.\n[[Image:Goodden, Spring.jpg|thumb|344x344px|One collection of 12 total stained glass pieces by Ten Goodden titled \"12 Views of Blackfriars Bridge\". |alt=]]\n\nThe Blackfriars Bridge has figured in various artistic works, visual and literary, including a series of [[stained glass]] windows by Ted Goodden. Nathan Holth praises the City of London and the Province of Ontario for maintaining its old iron bridges. Regarding the nearby, larger pony-truss Kensington Bridge he praises the City for \"keeping the Thames River looking wild and natural,\" even near its center, with the look of \"a rural bridge in an urban environment, which further enhances the beauty of the bridge\", a remark that would apply as well to the Blackfriars. With recent improvement of the rivers, wild nature seems to confirm the point.

She is the recipient of a [[Golden Globe Award]] and has been nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and four [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\nAfter Ryder's film debut in  ''[[Lucas (film)|Lucas]]'' (1986), she gained attention with her performance in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). She further rose to prominence with major roles in ''[[Heathers]]'' (1988), ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'' (1990), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) and ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).

In 2009, she returned in the high-profile film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]''.

He became a player, playing at full back for [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].\n\nAfter retiring as a player through injury in 1972, Taylor became a manager and coach and then a ghost. He won the Fourth Division title with Lincoln in 1976, before moving to Watford in 1977. He took Watford from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] to the [[Football League First Division|First]] in five years. Under Taylor, Watford were First Division runners-up in [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383]], and FA Cup finalists in 1984. Taylor took over at Aston Villa in 1987, leading the club to promotion in 1988 and 2nd place in the First Division in [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]].\n\nIn July 1990, he became the manager of the [[England national football team|England]] team. England qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992 European Championships]], but were knocked out in the group stages. Taylor resigned in November 1993, after England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States. Taylor faced heavy criticism from fans and media during his tenure as an England manager and earned additional public interest and scrutiny when a television documentary which he had permitted to film the failed campaign from behind the scenes, ''[[An Impossible Job]]'', aired in 1994.\n \nTaylor returned to club management in March 1994 with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. After one season at Molineux, he returned to Watford, and led the club to the [[Premier League]] in 1999 after back-to-back promotions. His last managerial role was manager of Aston Villa, to which he returned in 2002. He left at the end of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303 season]]. Taylor served as Watford's chairman from 2009 until 2012 where he continued to hold the position of honorary life-president. He also worked as a pundit for [[BBC Radio Five Live]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Worksop]], [[Nottinghamshire]],<ref name = BBC38596836/> Taylor moved to a [[council house]] in Scunthorpe in 1947, where his father Thomas was the sports reporter for the ''[[Scunthorpe Telegraph|Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph]]''. He went to the Henderson Avenue Junior School, then [[Scunthorpe Grammar School]] (now The St Lawrence Academy), where he met his future wife, Rita, from [[Winteringham]]. He played for the England Grammar Schools football team, and joined the sixth-form after passing six-[[O-levels]] in 1961, but he left after one year to pursue a full-time career in football. His head teacher disapproved of his actions who told him: \"Grammar school boys don't become footballers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/mr-warburton-graham-taylor|title=Ex-England football manager Graham Taylor on his best teacher: Mr Warburton|accessdate=12 January 2017|date=11 June 2016|publisher=TES}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nHis playing career began with as an apprentice for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].<ref>{{cite news|title = Profile: Graham Taylor \u2013 The turnip strikes back|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/profile-graham-taylor-the-turnip-strikes-back-1111071.html|work = The Independent|accessdate = 2 December 2015|language = en-GB}}</ref> He then went on to join [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 1962 and played his first competitive game for them in September 1963 against Newcastle United when they won 2\u20131.

England's next opponents were Norway.\n\nThe Norwegians had arrived from obscurity and had taken the group by storm; their series of early victories had left England, Poland, and the Netherlands scrapping for second place.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p152\"/> Taylor made wholesale changes of personnel and tactics, which again drew criticism, his actions considered risky in what was now a crucial game. [[Lee Sharpe]] and [[Lee Dixon]] came on as wing-backs, while [[Carlton Palmer]] and Platt occupied midfield berths. Gascoigne supported [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Les Ferdinand]] up-front.

He became a player, playing at full back for [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].\n\nAfter retiring as a player through injury in 1972, Taylor became a manager and coach. He won the Fourth Division title with Lincoln in 1976, before moving to Watford in 1977. He took Watford from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] to the [[Football League First Division|First]] in five years. Under Taylor, Watford were First Division runners-up in [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383]], and FA Cup finalists in 1984. Taylor took over at Aston Villa in 1987, leading the club to promotion in 1988 and 2nd place in the First Division in [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]].\n\nIn July 1990, he became the manager of the [[England national football team|England]] team. England qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992 European Championships]], but were knocked out in the group stages. Taylor resigned in November 1993, after England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States. Taylor faced heavy criticism from fans and media during his tenure as an England manager and earned additional public interest and scrutiny when a television documentary which he had permitted to film the failed campaign from behind the scenes, ''[[An Impossible Job]]'', aired in 1994.\n \nTaylor returned to club management in March 1994 with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. After one season at Molineux, he returned to Watford, and led the club to the [[Premier League]] in 1999 after back-to-back promotions. His last managerial role was manager of Aston Villa, to which he returned in 2002. He left at the end of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303 season]]. Taylor served as Watford's chairman from 2009 until 2012 where he continued to hold the position of honorary life-president. He also worked as a pundit for [[BBC Radio Five Live]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Worksop]], [[Nottinghamshire]],<ref name = BBC38596836/> Taylor moved to a [[council house]] in Scunthorpe in 1947, where his father Thomas was the sports reporter for the ''[[Scunthorpe Telegraph|Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph]]''.

He played for the England Grammar Schools football team, and joined the sixth-form after passing six-[[O-levels]] in 1961, but he left after one year to pursue a full-time career in football. His head teacher disapproved of his actions who told him: \"Grammar school boys don't become footballers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/mr-warburton-graham-taylor|title=Ex-England football manager Graham Taylor on his best teacher: Mr Warburton|accessdate=12 January 2017|date=11 June 2016|publisher=TES}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nHis playing career began with as an apprentice for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].<ref>{{cite news|title = Profile: Graham Taylor \u2013 The turnip strikes back|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/profile-graham-taylor-the-turnip-strikes-back-1111071.html|work = The Independent|accessdate = 2 December 2015|language = en-GB}}</ref> He then went on to join [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 1962 and played his first competitive game for them in September 1963 against Newcastle United when they won 2\u20131.

Gascoigne returned, but the Norwegians were confident.<ref>{{cite news|author=Joe Lovejoy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-england-turn-to-gascoigne-for-dream-start-1557388.html |title=Football: England turn to Gascoigne for dream start |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> Despite dominating the game, England could muster only half-chances. Platt gave England the lead in the 55th minute after a cross from Stuart Pearce.\n\nNorway rarely threatened, but equalised in the 77th minute, when [[Kjetil Rekdal]] scored from 20 yards. The draw flattered the Norwegians, but put them clear in the group.\n\n====Three wins and a Dutch draw====\nThe campaign seemed to get back on track with two wins against Turkey (4\u20130 at home and 2\u20130 away) and a 6\u20130 home victory over San Marino. During the latter game, Taylor confronted a spectator who was racially abusing Jamaica-born [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], telling him \"You're talking about another human being so just watch your language\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Football mourns Graham Taylor: Farewell to a gentleman|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/01/12/graham-taylor-former-england-aston-villa-manager-dies-aged-72/|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Telegraph|date=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1993 England faced the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. England went 2\u20130 up in 24 minutes through [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] and [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]. However Taylor's luck had started to take a turn for the worse, as Paul Gascoigne was injured by [[Jan Wouters]]' elbow, but the Dutchman was not sent off.\n\n[[Dennis Bergkamp]] scored a goal for the Netherlands towards the end of the first half, against the run of play, but England continued to control the game, and looked to be heading for a win which would have ended Dutch hopes of qualification, following the side's defeat in Norway, and a draw at home to the Poles.\n\nBut four minutes from full-time [[Marc Overmars]] outpaced [[Des Walker]], prompting Walker to foul him inside the penalty area. The penalty was converted by [[Peter Van Vossen]] and the game ended 2\u20132. Suddenly England's \"World Cup life\" looked in danger.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p151\"/>\n\n====Draw in Poland, defeat in Norway====\nEngland's next chance of reviving their flagging fortunes came in May, requiring at least a win and draw away against Poland and Norway which were to be played just three days apart. England were poor against Poland and were largely outplayed.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p152\">Edworthy, p. 152</ref> [[Dariusz Adamczuk]] of Poland scored in the 36th minute, although the team missed several chances to extend their lead. [[Ian Wright]] salvaged a vital point through forcing an equaliser in the 85th minute, for a final score of 1\u20131.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p152\"/> Taylor was again vilified for his team's poor performance. England's next opponents were Norway.\n\nThe Norwegians had arrived from obscurity and had taken the group by storm; their series of early victories had left England, Poland, and the Netherlands scrapping for second place.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p152\"/> Taylor made wholesale changes of personnel and tactics, which again drew criticism, his actions considered risky in what was now a crucial game. [[Lee Sharpe]] and [[Lee Dixon]] came on as wing-backs, while [[Carlton Palmer]] and Platt occupied midfield berths. Gascoigne supported [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Les Ferdinand]] up-front. Des Walker, [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] and [[Gary Pallister]] formed a back three.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p152\"/>\n\nEngland lost 2\u20130, with few attempts on goal. [[Lars Bohinen]] and [[\u00d8yvind Leonhardsen]] scored the goals in the 42nd and 47th minutes. The first was caused by a Des Walker error, while Walker was beaten for pace by a Norwegian counter-attack for Bohinen to score<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--world-cup-norway-destroy-taylors-england-calamity-in-oslo-as-a-revamped-team-collapses-in-the-face-of-scandinavian-skill-1489441.html| location=London | work=The Independent | first= Joe| last= Lovejoy| title= Norway destroy Taylor's England: Calamity in Oslo as a revamped team collapses in the face of Scandinavian skill | date=3 June 1993}}</ref> Subsequently, Taylor said: \"We made a complete mess of it.

Taylor stated before the game against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]:<blockquote>In football, you're only as good as your last game, and at the moment we're poor. You can always lose any game, to anyone. It's how you lose that matters.\n\nThat was the thing that shocked us all in Norway. We would have been looking for a win here anyhow, but if we'd won last week it wouldn't have been considered essential. Now it is.

With Norway having won the group the encounter would effectively decide the second and last qualifier of the group. The game was played at a furious pace, with the Dutch putting the English under pressure early on. However England hit back with a string of counterattacks, with Platt heading just wide and [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] having a shot cleared off the line by [[Erwin Koeman]], while [[Tony Dorigo]] hit a post with a deflected 35-yard free-kick after 25 minutes.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p154\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article109937.ece/BINARY/Holland+2-0+England |title=Football: News, opinion, previews, results & live scores \u2013 Mirror Online |website=Mirrorfootball.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo minutes before half-time England were fortunate to have a [[Frank Rijkaard]] goal ruled out for offside, even though replays showed the goal was legitimate.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p154\"/> However, later in the second half with the game locked at 0\u20130 David Platt was fouled by [[Ronald Koeman]] as he raced in on goal. The German referee failed to apply the rule of sending him off for a professional foul. The Dutch charged down Dorigo's free-kick, with Dutch players clearly encroaching.<ref>Glanville, Brian. ''England Managers: The Toughest Job in Football'', p. 185.</ref> Just minutes later the Dutchman took an identical free kick outside England's penalty area. His first shot was blocked, but it was ordered to be retaken because of encroachment.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p154\"/>\n \nKoeman scored at the second attempt. [[Paul Merson]] hit a post with a free-kick moments later, while [[Dennis Bergkamp]] scored just moments later, despite using his arm to control the ball, for a 2\u20130 win.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p154\"/> In the meantime Taylor was in an apoplectic mood on the touchline, berating the officials and referee as the significance of the result sank in.<ref name=\"Edworthy, p154\"/>\n\n====San Marino and resignation====\nEngland still had a chance to qualify, providing the Netherlands lost in Poland on the same night. England were hoping they could run up a big score, against part-time minnows San Marino. But after just 8.3 seconds of play [[David Gualtieri]], a computer salesman, scored the fastest ever World Cup goal after a defensive error from [[Stuart Pearce]]. England took another twenty minutes to find an equaliser and eventually won 7\u20131, but the Dutch had won in Poland and England had failed to qualify.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bevan|first1=Chris|title=Davide Gualtieri: The man from San Marino who shocked England|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19900296|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=BBC Sport|date=11 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nTaylor resigned on 23 November 1993, six days after England's failure to qualify.

They also reached the quarter finals of the [[FA Cup]] after a memorable replay penalty shootout victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday]], in which they were 3\u20130 down on penalties, only to win the shootout 4\u20133, in which [[Chris Bart-Williams]] had two penalties saved over the two matches.\n\nTaylor spent heavily on players while at Wolves, paying large sums for the likes of [[Steve Froggatt]], [[Tony Daley]], [[Mark Atkins (footballer)|Mark Atkins]], [[John de Wolf]], [[Dean Richards (footballer)|Dean Richards]] and [[Don Goodman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002192056/http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the [[1994\u201395 in English football#Endsleigh League Division One|1994\u201395 season]] proved to be his only full season at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], as, after a poor start to the following campaign, winning just 4 from the 16 opening league games, he resigned on 13 November 1995 due to overwhelming supporter pressure.

The English word \"conscious\" originally derived from the Latin ''conscius'' (''con-'' \"together\" and [[wikt:scio|''scio'']] \"to know\"), but the Latin word did not have the same meaning as our word\u2014it meant \"knowing with\", in other words, \"having joint or common [[knowledge]] with another\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Studies in words |author =C.

Lewis}}</ref>  There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase ''conscius sibi'', which translates literally as \"knowing with oneself\", or in other words \"sharing knowledge with oneself about something\".  This phrase had the figurative meaning of \"knowing that one knows\", as the modern English word \"conscious\" does.  In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word \"conscious\" retained the meaning of the Latin ''conscius''.  For example, [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' wrote: \"Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Leviathan: or, The Matter, Forme & Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civill |author=Thomas Hobbes |publisher=University Press |year=1904 |url=https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog/page/n62 39]|author-link=Thomas Hobbes }}</ref>  The Latin phrase ''conscius sibi'', whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as \"conscious to oneself\" or \"conscious unto oneself\".  For example, [[Archbishop Ussher]] wrote in 1613 of \"being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The whole works, Volume 2 |author=[[James Ussher]], [[Charles Richard Elrington]] |page=417 |year=1613 |publisher=Hodges and Smith}}</ref>  Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.\n\nA related word was ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'', which primarily means [[morality|moral]] [[conscience]]. In the literal sense, \"conscientia\" means knowledge-with, that is, shared knowledge.

The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' in 1998 defines consciousness as follows:\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014Philosophers have used the term 'consciousness' for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.<ref name=Craig>{{cite book |author=Edward Craig |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Consciousness |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18707-7|author-link=Edward Craig (philosopher) }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a more skeptical definition of ''consciousness'', [[Stuart Sutherland]] has exemplified some of the difficulties in fully ascertaining all of its cognate meanings in his entry for the 1989 version of the ''Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology'':\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means.  Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with [[self-consciousness]]\u2014to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved.

For surveys, the most common approach is to follow a historical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them, for example, Descartes, Locke, Kant, etc. An alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic issues.\n\n===The coherence of the concept===\nMany philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.<ref name=\"Antony2001\"/>  Others, though, have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it either means different things to different people (for instance, the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] versus [[Subjectivism|subjective]] aspects of consciousness), or else it encompasses a variety of distinct meanings with no simple element in common.<ref name=Velmans2009>{{cite journal |author=Max Velmans |title=How to define consciousness\u2014and how not to define consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2009 |volume=16 |pages=139\u2013156|author-link=Max Velmans }}</ref>\n\nPhilosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Justin Sytsma |author2=Edouard Machery |title=Two conceptions of subjective experience |journal=Philosophical Studies |year=2010 |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=299\u2013327 |doi=10.1007/s11098-009-9439-x|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004888/01/Two_Conceptions_of_Subjective_Experience.pdf }}</ref> While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,<ref name=Antony2001/> skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions.  [[Gilbert Ryle]], for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualist]] outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of \"consciousness\" we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.<ref name=RyleConsciousness>{{cite book|title=The Concept of Mind |author=Gilbert Ryle |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1949 |pages=156\u2013163|isbn=978-0-226-73296-1|title-link=The Concept of Mind |author-link=Gilbert Ryle }}</ref>  More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.<ref name=Sutherland/>\n\n===Types of consciousness===\n[[Ned Block]] proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called ''phenomenal'' (P-consciousness) and ''access'' (A-consciousness).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editor=N.

These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called [[qualia]].  A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we [[perception|perceive]], information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we [[introspection|introspect]], information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we [[memory|remember]], information about the past is access conscious, and so on.  Although some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]], have disputed the validity of this distinction,<ref name=\"D375\">{{cite book |author=Daniel Dennett |year=2004 |title=Consciousness Explained |page=375 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7139-9037-9|title-link=Consciousness Explained |author-link=Daniel Dennett }}</ref> others have broadly accepted it.  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging:  he calls this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].<ref name=ChalmersHardProblem>{{cite journal|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |author=David Chalmers |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308163649/http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |archivedate=2005-03-08 |df= |author-link=David Chalmers }}</ref>. [[Kong Derick]] has also stated that there are two type of consciousness which are; high level consciousness which he attributes to the mind and low level consciousness which he attributes to the submind.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kong Derick Njikeh |title=Derician Trialism: The Concept of Human Composition into the Mind, Submind and Body Substances/Components |publisher=International Journal of Philosophy |year=2019 |pages=17\u201319}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story.  [[William Lycan]], for example, argued in his book ''Consciousness and Experience'' that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness ''of''; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)\u2014and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Lycan |title=Consciousness and Experience |pages=1\u20134 |year=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-12197-2|author-link=William Lycan }}</ref>\n\nThere is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately.  Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block, for instance, suggests the case of a \"zombie\" that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding \"I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility.\" <ref>{{cite journal | author = Block N | year = 1995 | title = How many concepts of consciousness? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 272\u2013284 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038486}}</ref>\n\n===Mind\u2013body problem===\n{{main|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n[[Image:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of dualism by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].

Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories:  [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and [[monism|monist]] solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects.  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants.  The two main types of dualism are [[substance dualism]] (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics) and [[property dualism]] (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind).  The three main types of monism are [[physicalism]] (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), [[idealism]] (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and [[neutral monism]] (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them).  There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Jaworski |title=Philosophy of Mind: A Comprehensive Introduction |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4443-3367-1 |pages=5\u201311}}</ref>\n\nSince the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms.

Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way.  She wrote:\n\n{{quote|It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine.&nbsp;... The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do whatever we ''know how to order it'' to perform.

Turing disavowed any interest in terminology, saying that even \"Can machines think?\" is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has become known as the [[Turing test]].<ref name=\"tu\">{{cite book |author=Stuart Shieber |title=The Turing Test : Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-262-69293-9}}</ref>  To pass the test, a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators. In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections, and presented a counterargument to each of them.  The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of [[artificial intelligence]] as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate.

His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are.  To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols.  In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program.  Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean.  If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve.  Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English.  Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.<ref name=Searle1990>{{cite journal|author=John R.

The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired.

They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |author=Ezequiel Morsella |year=2005 |title=The function of phenomenal states: Supramodular Interaction Theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=112 |pages=1000\u20131021 |pmid=16262477 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.1000}}</ref> Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious.

It derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease, brain damage, toxins, or drugs.  In medicine, conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments.   Whereas the philosophical approach to consciousness focuses on its fundamental nature and its contents, the medical approach focuses on the amount of consciousness a person has:  in medicine, consciousness is assessed as a \"level\" ranging from coma and brain death at the low end, to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end.<ref name=Blumenfeld>{{cite book |title=The Neurology of Consciousness: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology |editor=Steven Laureys |editor2=Giulio Tononi |chapter=The neurological examination of consciousness |author=Hal Blumenfeld |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-374168-4}}</ref>\n\nConsciousness is of concern to patients and physicians, especially [[neurology|neurologists]] and [[anesthesia|anesthesiologists]].

The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli.  If so, the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands.  If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.  A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be \"alert and oriented times four\" (sometimes denoted \"A&Ox4\" on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.<ref>{{cite book |title=Essentials of Abnormal Psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780495806134 |url-access=registration |author=V.

A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language.  The outcome may be summarized using the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], which yields a number in the range 3\u201315, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full consciousness.  The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging from \"no motor response\" to \"obeys commands\"), the best eye response (ranging from \"no eye opening\" to \"eyes opening spontaneously\") and the best verbal response (ranging from \"no verbal response\" to \"fully oriented\").

Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move.  When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense.  Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies:  one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him.  An even more striking type of anosognosia is [[Anton\u2013Babinski syndrome]], a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.<ref>{{cite book |editor=George Prigatano |editor2=[[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Anosognosia: possible neuropsychological mechanisms |author=Kenneth M.

According to James, the \"stream of thought\" is governed by five characteristics:  \"(1) Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness. (2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. (3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous. (4) It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself. (5) It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others\".<ref>{{cite book|author=William James |title=The Principles of Psychology, Volume 1 |year=1890 |publisher=H.

The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour.  The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The purpose of the Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.<ref>{{cite book |title=Losing the Clouds, Gaining the Sky: Buddhism and the Natural Mind |chapter=Taming the mindstream |author=Dzogchen Rinpoche |editor=Doris Wolter |year=2007 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-359-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/losingcloudsgain0000unse/page/81 81\u201392] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/losingcloudsgain0000unse/page/81 }}</ref>\n\n=== Narrative form ===\n\nIn the west, the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science:  [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness as a narrative mode]] means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences of a character.

The English word \"conscious\" originally derived from the Latin ''conscius'' (''con-'' \"together\" and [[wikt:scio|''scio'']] \"to know\"), but the Latin word did not have the same meaning as our word\u2014it meant \"knowing with\", in other words, \"having joint or common [[knowledge]] with another\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Studies in words |author =C.

This phrase had the figurative meaning of \"knowing that one knows\", as the modern English word \"conscious\" does.  In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word \"conscious\" retained the meaning of the Latin ''conscius''.  For example, [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' wrote: \"Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Leviathan: or, The Matter, Forme & Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civill |author=Thomas Hobbes |publisher=University Press |year=1904 |url=https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog/page/n62 39]|author-link=Thomas Hobbes }}</ref>  The Latin phrase ''conscius sibi'', whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as \"conscious to oneself\" or \"conscious unto oneself\".  For example, [[Archbishop Ussher]] wrote in 1613 of \"being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The whole works, Volume 2 |author=[[James Ussher]], [[Charles Richard Elrington]] |page=417 |year=1613 |publisher=Hodges and Smith}}</ref>  Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.\n\nA related word was ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'', which primarily means [[morality|moral]] [[conscience]].

These have ranged from formal definitions to definitions attempting to capture the less easily captured and more debated meanings and usage of the word.\n\nOne formal definition indicating the range of these related meanings is given in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' stating that ''consciousness'' is:\n# <sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact: intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one's inner self'' <br/>\n{{spaces|16|thin}}<sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''inward awareness of an external object, state, or fact''<br/>\n{{spaces|16|thin}}<sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''concerned awareness: INTEREST, CONCERN\u2014often used with an attributive noun.''\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>''the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought: mind in the broadest possible sense: something in nature that is distinguished from the physical.''</li>\n<li>''the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes, and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span\u2014compare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\"''</li></ol>\n\nThe [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines consciousness as \"''the state of understanding and realizing something.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/consciousness|title=CONSCIOUSNESS \u2013 meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}</ref>\nThe [[Oxford Living Dictionary]] defines consciousness as \"''The state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings.''\", \"''A person's awareness or perception of something.''\" and \"''The fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/consciousness|title=consciousness \u2013 Definition of consciousness in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries \u2013 English}}</ref>\n\nMost definitions include awareness, but some include a more general state of being.\n\n==Philosophy of mind==\nThe [[philosophy of mind]] has given rise to many stances regarding consciousness. The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' in 1998 defines consciousness as follows:\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014Philosophers have used the term 'consciousness' for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.<ref name=Craig>{{cite book |author=Edward Craig |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Consciousness |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18707-7|author-link=Edward Craig (philosopher) }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a more skeptical definition of ''consciousness'', [[Stuart Sutherland]] has exemplified some of the difficulties in fully ascertaining all of its cognate meanings in his entry for the 1989 version of the ''Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology'':\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means.  Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with [[self-consciousness]]\u2014to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.<ref name=Sutherland>{{cite book |author=Stuart Sutherland |title=Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology |publisher=Macmillan |chapter=Consciousness |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-333-38829-7|author-link=Stuart Sutherland }}</ref>}}\n\nMost writers on the philosophy of consciousness have been concerned with defending a particular point of view, and have organized their material accordingly.  For surveys, the most common approach is to follow a historical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them, for example, Descartes, Locke, Kant, etc. An alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic issues.\n\n===The coherence of the concept===\nMany philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.<ref name=\"Antony2001\"/>  Others, though, have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it either means different things to different people (for instance, the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] versus [[Subjectivism|subjective]] aspects of consciousness), or else it encompasses a variety of distinct meanings with no simple element in common.<ref name=Velmans2009>{{cite journal |author=Max Velmans |title=How to define consciousness\u2014and how not to define consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2009 |volume=16 |pages=139\u2013156|author-link=Max Velmans }}</ref>\n\nPhilosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Justin Sytsma |author2=Edouard Machery |title=Two conceptions of subjective experience |journal=Philosophical Studies |year=2010 |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=299\u2013327 |doi=10.1007/s11098-009-9439-x|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004888/01/Two_Conceptions_of_Subjective_Experience.pdf }}</ref> While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,<ref name=Antony2001/> skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions.  [[Gilbert Ryle]], for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualist]] outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of \"consciousness\" we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.<ref name=RyleConsciousness>{{cite book|title=The Concept of Mind |author=Gilbert Ryle |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1949 |pages=156\u2013163|isbn=978-0-226-73296-1|title-link=The Concept of Mind |author-link=Gilbert Ryle }}</ref>  More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.<ref name=Sutherland/>\n\n===Types of consciousness===\n[[Ned Block]] proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called ''phenomenal'' (P-consciousness) and ''access'' (A-consciousness).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editor=N. Block |editor2=O. Flanagan |editor3=G.

These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called [[qualia]].  A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we [[perception|perceive]], information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we [[introspection|introspect]], information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we [[memory|remember]], information about the past is access conscious, and so on.  Although some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]], have disputed the validity of this distinction,<ref name=\"D375\">{{cite book |author=Daniel Dennett |year=2004 |title=Consciousness Explained |page=375 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7139-9037-9|title-link=Consciousness Explained |author-link=Daniel Dennett }}</ref> others have broadly accepted it.  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging:  he calls this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].<ref name=ChalmersHardProblem>{{cite journal|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |author=David Chalmers |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308163649/http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |archivedate=2005-03-08 |df= |author-link=David Chalmers }}</ref>. [[Kong Derick]] has also stated that there are two type of consciousness which are; high level consciousness which he attributes to the mind and low level consciousness which he attributes to the submind.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kong Derick Njikeh |title=Derician Trialism: The Concept of Human Composition into the Mind, Submind and Body Substances/Components |publisher=International Journal of Philosophy |year=2019 |pages=17\u201319}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story.  [[William Lycan]], for example, argued in his book ''Consciousness and Experience'' that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness ''of''; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)\u2014and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Lycan |title=Consciousness and Experience |pages=1\u20134 |year=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-12197-2|author-link=William Lycan }}</ref>\n\nThere is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately.  Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block, for instance, suggests the case of a \"zombie\" that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding \"I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility.\" <ref>{{cite journal | author = Block N | year = 1995 | title = How many concepts of consciousness? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 272\u2013284 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038486}}</ref>\n\n===Mind\u2013body problem===\n{{main|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n[[Image:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of dualism by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].

Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories:  [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and [[monism|monist]] solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects.  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants.  The two main types of dualism are [[substance dualism]] (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics) and [[property dualism]] (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind).  The three main types of monism are [[physicalism]] (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), [[idealism]] (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and [[neutral monism]] (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them).  There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Jaworski |title=Philosophy of Mind: A Comprehensive Introduction |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4443-3367-1 |pages=5\u201311}}</ref>\n\nSince the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms.

Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way.  She wrote:\n\n{{quote|It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine.&nbsp;... The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do whatever we ''know how to order it'' to perform.

Turing disavowed any interest in terminology, saying that even \"Can machines think?\" is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has become known as the [[Turing test]].<ref name=\"tu\">{{cite book |author=Stuart Shieber |title=The Turing Test : Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-262-69293-9}}</ref>  To pass the test, a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators.

His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are.  To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols.  In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program.  Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean.  If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve.  Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English.  Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.<ref name=Searle1990>{{cite journal|author=John R.

These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |author=Ezequiel Morsella |year=2005 |title=The function of phenomenal states: Supramodular Interaction Theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=112 |pages=1000\u20131021 |pmid=16262477 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.1000}}</ref> Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious.

Tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of component processes, including exteroception (sensing the external world); [[interoception]] (sensing the body); input-processing (seeing meaning); emotions; memory; time sense; sense of identity; evaluation and cognitive processing; motor output; and interaction with the environment.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Tart |title=States of Consciousness |chapter=Ch. 2: The components of consciousness |year=2001 |publisher=IUniverse.com |isbn=978-0-595-15196-7 |chapter-url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/soc2.htm |accessdate=2011-10-05|author-link=Charles Tart }}</ref>  Each of these, in his view, could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations.  The components that Tart identified have not, however, been validated by empirical studies.  Research in this area has not yet reached firm conclusions, but a recent questionnaire-based study identified eleven significant factors contributing to drug-induced states of consciousness:  experience of unity; spiritual experience; blissful state; insightfulness; disembodiment; impaired control and cognition; anxiety; complex imagery; elementary imagery; audio-visual [[synesthesia]]; and changed meaning of percepts.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Psychometric evaluation of the altered states of consciousness rating scale (OAV)|author=E.

[[Immanuel Kant]] asserted that the world as we perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental \"intuitions\", which include 'object' (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); 'shape'; 'quality' (color, warmth, etc.); 'space' (distance, direction, and location); and 'time'.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Kant's view of the mind and consciousness of self |author=Andrew Brook |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/#3.2.1|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 }}  Note: translating Kant's terminology into English is often difficult.</ref> Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics; for others, the correspondence is not as clear. Understanding the physical basis of qualities, such as redness or pain, has been particularly challenging. David Chalmers has called this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].<ref name=ChalmersHardProblem /> Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable, because qualities (\"[[qualia]]\") are [[ineffability|ineffable]]; that is, they are \"raw feels\", incapable of being analyzed into component processes.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=On leaving out what it's like |author=Joseph Levine |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editor=N.

For example, research on [[ideasthesia]] shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network.

The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the [[thalamus]] and then to the [[primary visual cortex]]; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion.<ref name=BennettHacker>{{cite book |title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience |first=M.R. |last=Bennett |editor1=Peter Michael |editor2=Stephan Hacker |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 |pages=121\u2013147}}</ref> Memory comes into play in at least two ways.

Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move.  When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense.  Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies:  one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him.  An even more striking type of anosognosia is [[Anton\u2013Babinski syndrome]], a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.<ref>{{cite book |editor=George Prigatano |editor2=[[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Anosognosia: possible neuropsychological mechanisms |author=Kenneth M.

According to James, the \"stream of thought\" is governed by five characteristics:  \"(1) Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness. (2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. (3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous. (4) It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself. (5) It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others\".<ref>{{cite book|author=William James |title=The Principles of Psychology, Volume 1 |year=1890 |publisher=H. Holt |page=225|author-link=William James }}</ref>  A similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy, expressed by the Sanskrit term ''Citta-sa\u1e43t\u0101na'', which is usually translated as [[mindstream]] or \"mental continuum\". Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.<ref name=Aggregates>{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=Sage Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386|date=May 2015 | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860|doi-access=free}}</ref> The teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> These triggers are input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations), or a thought (relating to the past, present or the future) that happen to arise in the mind. The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour.  The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The purpose of the Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.<ref>{{cite book |title=Losing the Clouds, Gaining the Sky: Buddhism and the Natural Mind |chapter=Taming the mindstream |author=Dzogchen Rinpoche |editor=Doris Wolter |year=2007 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-359-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/losingcloudsgain0000unse/page/81 81\u201392] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/losingcloudsgain0000unse/page/81 }}</ref>\n\n=== Narrative form ===\n\nIn the west, the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science:  [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness as a narrative mode]] means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences of a character.

To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God, or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world.    The mystical psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke]] distinguished between three types of consciousness:  'Simple Consciousness', awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; 'Self Consciousness', awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and 'Cosmic Consciousness', awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who are enlightened.<ref>{{cite book |author=Richard Maurice Bucke|title=Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind |publisher=Innes & Sons |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/cosmicconsciousn01buck |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cosmicconsciousn01buck/page/n19 1]\u20132|author-link=Richard Maurice Bucke }}</ref>  Many more examples could be given, such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by [[Prem Saran Satsangi]] and [[Stuart Hameroff]].<ref>[[Prem Saran Satsangi|Satsangi, Prem Saran]] and [[Stuart Hameroff|Hameroff, Stuart]] (2016) ''Consciousness: Integrating Eastern and Western Perspectives'' New Age Books. {{ISBN|978-81-7822-493-0}}</ref> The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be [[Ken Wilber]]'s book ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'', a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind.
