Taliban tactics have been described as using modern Western techniques, with a perfectly prepared ambush which pinned French troops in a C-shaped pincer.\n\nFrom their support position one kilometre from the village, ''Rouge 4'' rushed to help, reaching the heights of Sper Kunday in eight minutes. However, they were unable to make their junction with ''Carmin 2'' and had to support it from a distance, with machine gun fire and 4 Milan missiles.

Under the critical circumstances, Thunderbolts and Kiowas started close air support, in spite of the entanglement of friendly and enemy troops. Air operations lasted for one hour, during which the remnants of ''Carmin 2'' were able to reach the village. Some French soldiers complained about friendly fire incidents, either from US aircraft or from ANA elements; these were later denied by French military authorities. Two US UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters then attempted to land to evacuate wounded, but were prevented by Taliban fire.\n\nAt 18:15, two [[Eurocopter EC725|Caracal helicopters]], previously reserved for a possible evacuation of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, arrived from Kabul and landed a physician and Air commandos. They quickly turned back and returned with 4 tonnes of supply, most of it ammunition which was immediately carried to units under fire. They later evacuated the first wounded. These elements worked non-stop for 14 hours to provide supplies and medical evacuations.\n\nAt 18:25, [[LLR 81mm]] mortars of the support group started firing. One hour later, as the sun set, ''Carmin 2'' was still trying to break contact, but most of its men were still pinned down by Taliban trying to surround the village. 12.7mm machine guns began to run low on ammunition again.\n\nAt 20:00, 3 sections of the R\u00e9giment de Marche du Tchad arrived by road, with 120mm heavy mortars. As night fell, Predator drones guided mortar fire.\n\n=== Regain of control by French forces ===\nAt 21:00, ''Carmin 3'' started climbing the pass to rescue the wounded and gather the dead. One hour later, reinforcements from Kabul cleared the surroundings of the village. US aircraft, mostly OH-58 Kiowa and AC-130, pounded ridges nearby.\n\nAround midnight, the sector was under control, firing around Sper Kunday had stopped, and ''Carmin 3'' and ''Rouge 3'' had retaken the positions leading to the pass.\n\nThe first bodies were found at 1:40.

Initial official reports mentioned losses during the very first moments of the battle, as the Taliban shot a carefully aimed volley by surprise. However, further testimonies by the soldiers coming back from the field reported casualties during the entire engagements, and notably soldiers dying from otherwise recoverable wounds because they could not be evacuated.<ref name=\"Figaro\"/> ''Carmin 2'' sustained most of the casualties, with 9 killed and 17 wounded out of 31 men.\n\nSome military equipment of value was captured by the guerrillas, including: four [[FAMAS]] assault rifles, two [[FN Minimi|Minimi]] light machine guns, two [[FR F2 sniper rifle|FR-F2]] precision rifles, one [[Lance-grenade individuel|LGI]] grenade launcher, six OB 72 binoculars, several ER 350 radios, nine flak jackets, helmets, etc. In addition, six VABs were damaged.<ref name=\"Merchet\">''Mourir pour l'Afghanistan'', by [[Jean-Dominique Merchet]].

They also claimed to have destroyed five vehicles and used land mines.\n\n==== Guerrillas ====\nThe exact number of casualties among guerrilla fighters is a matter of some conjecture. The French military authorities mentioned a range of 30 to 80 killed, while on 29 September, Afghan leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], claiming responsibility for the attack, declared that ten of his men had been killed in the fighting.<ref name=\"ghul\">\n{{cite news |title=Afghan warlord Hekmatyar claims French ambush: report |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/International/30-Sep-2008/Afghan-warlord-Hekmatyar-claims-French-ambush/ |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Heads of State and heads of government such as Gordon Brown, George W. Bush, Silvio Berlusconi and Stephen Harper also gave hommage.\n\nOn 20 August, Nicolas Sarkozy travelled to Kabul to speak to the French soldiers stationed in Afghanistan.

Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon claimed to have \"''learnt the lessons of the ambush''\", and announced further military deployment, amounting to about 100 men with drones and helicopters.\n\n=== Military consequences ===\nOn 20 August, US military authorities in Afghanistan claimed to have killed two of the leaders involved in the ambush in [[Kapisa Province]].\n\nOn 18 October 2008, ISAF and Afghan forces returned to Sper Kunday as to prevent a permanent build-up of Taliban influence in the region. Fighting ensued and 7 militant fighters were killed or wounded. French military authorities claim that villagers are subject to strong pressure from the militants.\n\nIn the following months, the French military took steps to send 20mm-armed Air Force [[V\u00e9hicule d'Intervention Blind\u00e9|VIB]] vehicles to reinforce the VABs of the Army. The Army 20mm VAB, the T20/13, requires reloading the gun outside of the vehicle.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\n=== News reports and the media war ===\n\n==== Initial Taliban reports ====\nAccounts by Taliban published by ''[[Al-Somood]]'' report that \"''as for the number of French killed during the fight, it amounts to several tens. Local and international medias have reported 11 killed and 21 wounded, but that is not true at all''\". In it, the Taliban refer to themselves as \"[[Mujahideen]]\", and, occasionally, to the French as \"[[crusaders]]\".\n\nThe account goes on, describing the patrol as consisting of \"''18 tanks and armoured vehicles''\", which it claims were all destroyed, save for five that were captured. It also boasts that five French soldiers had been taken prisoners and that \"''upon arrival of airplanes, the mujahideen could not take them along and had to kill them on the spot''\". More specifically, it mentions the employment of [[improvised explosive device]]s; the French reported not finding any.\n\nThe report also claims that \"''large amounts of weapons and ammunition''\" were captured, and that a film of the fight was made, showing \"''the dead, the booty and the destroyed armoured vehicles, thanks to God''\". It finishes with an accurate assessment of French public opinion and political debate, notably mentioning Herv\u00e9 Morin and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande by name.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\nIn November, Belgian journalist [[Joanie de Rijke]] met with Sher Mohammed (''Ghurghust''), who claimed to know the full story of the attacks, and was captured and held prisoner for six days before being released.<ref name=\"johan\"/> She was shown a heart-shaped pendant that the commander claimed was taken from a female soldier in the attack, and the knife that a commander ''Ghazi'' claimed to have used to kill four of the French troops.<ref name=\"johan\" />\n\n==== Initial reports by French authorities ====\nInitial statements of the French authorities claimed that those killed were \"during the first instants\" of the ambush, which was quickly contradicted by testimonies from survivors.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Defence did not report that one of the dead had been killed by a bladed weapon. This was deliberately omitted after the Minister talked with the family, who requested that this detail be kept from the public.<ref name=\"Merchet\" /> The information nevertheless surfaced, raising suspicions as to the truthfulness of official reports. The Ministry of Defence finally confirmed the fact on 5 September.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/afghanistan-un-seul-soldat-francais-tue-a-l-arme-blanche-05-09-2008-199805.php Afghanistan : un seul soldat fran\u00e7ais tu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arme blanche]</ref>\n\nOn 18 August, general [[Beno\u00eet Puga]] characterised the outcome of the event as \n\n{{quote|The mission was a success.

Two of them were photographed wearing French flak jackets, helmets and signature [[FAMAS]] rifles, as well as French uniforms in [[Camouflage Centre Europe]] patterns. The group leader, Faruki, demanded that French forces depart Afghanistan lest they be all killed. He stated that the French had crossed a red line by entering Uzbin valley, which they consider to be their territory. He further claimed that no French had been tortured, and returned a watch taken on the body of a dead soldier as a token.\n\n''Paris Match'' published the photographs and the messages of the Taliban leader on 4 September, causing an uproar in France, particularly from the families of the dead soldiers and the government.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-match-taliban-photoshoot-shocks-france-919109.html |title=Paris Match Taliban photoshoot shocks France |accessdate=2 November 2009 |last=Lichfield |first=John |date=4 September 2008 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Part of the press accused ''Paris Match'' of allowing itself to be used as a Taliban propaganda media.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\nOn the other hand, Taliban being in possession of military equipment was seen as a patent proof that a number of bodies had been abandoned for some time, and unconfirmed suspicions that soldiers have been captured alive and executed.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\n=== Criticism of the organisation of the patrol ===\n\n==== Frenic report ====\nOn 3 September 2008, ''[[Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9]]'' published a [[FRENIC]] (French National Intelligence Cell) report to the General Staff and to military intelligence, claiming that the reconnaissance patrol had been ill-prepared.

The document claims that the patrol lacked supplies and preparation, that it ran low on ammunition 90 minutes into the fight, that the French section had only one radio, and that Afghan forces left their armament behind and fled the battle, while the Taliban seemed very well prepared.\n\nExistence of the report was at first denied by the French Defence minister, the French General Staff, and NATO. It was later acknowledged, but stated to be a mere \"field report\", redacted by the leader of the US team embedded in the patrol, and featuring errors.\n\n==== Internal criticism ====\nFrench Army officiers, both in France and in Afghanistan, criticised the lack of ammunition, radios, mortars, and air reconnaissance, and the fact that reinforcements had been brought by road only.\n\nCriticism on the website of the dead soldiers prompted the colonel of the 8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment to threaten litigation against critical commentators.<ref>\"Vos gueules, les veuves !\", ''[[Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9]]'', 24 September 2008.</ref>\n\nGeneral [[Michel Stollsteiner]], commander of Allied forces in the Kabul region during the ambush, acknowledged an \"excess of confidence\" in that the zone was considered to be largely secured.<ref name=confiance/> Another officer admitted that French forces had prepared for harassment with roadside bombs and suicide attacks, but not for coordinated guerrilla actions, and that the level of tactical skill shown by the guerrilla had been unexpected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-monde/2008-09-04/afghanistan-ce-qui-a-manque-aux-soldats-francais/924/0/271435 |title=Ce qui a manqu\u00e9 aux soldats fran\u00e7ais |accessdate=5 November 2009 |last=Guisnel |first=Jean |date=4 September 2008 |publisher=[[Le Point]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Later incidents ===\nSixteen months later, on 17 December 2009, coalition forces conducted [[Operation Septentrion]] in the Uzbin Valley, \"to show these insurgents that we can go where we want when we want\" according to a French military spokesperson.<ref name=\"BBC2009Dec18\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8419829.stm |title=French Afghan assault concludes |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=French troops lead Afghan attack on Taliban |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010535631_apeufranceafghanistan.html |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> An Afghan flag was planted in a key village of the Uzbin Valley; it was the furthest north coalition forces had been in the Valley.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/archives/article.php/406186 |agency=AFP |title=Afghanistan: d\u00e9monstration de force de la L\u00e9gion, cinq Am\u00e9ricains bless\u00e9s |author=Karim Talbi |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 August 2010 another French soldier was killed in the Uzbin Valley.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* ''Mourir pour l'Afghanistan'', by [[Jean-Dominique Merchet]].

They quickly turned back and returned with 4 tonnes of supply, most of it ammunition which was immediately carried to units under fire. They later evacuated the first wounded. These elements worked non-stop for 14 hours to provide supplies and medical evacuations.\n\nAt 18:25, [[LLR 81mm]] mortars of the support group started firing. One hour later, as the sun set, ''Carmin 2'' was still trying to break contact, but most of its men were still pinned down by Taliban trying to surround the village. 12.7mm machine guns began to run low on ammunition again.\n\nAt 20:00, 3 sections of the R\u00e9giment de Marche du Tchad arrived by road, with 120mm heavy mortars.

They also claimed to have destroyed five vehicles and used land mines.\n\n==== Guerrillas ====\nThe exact number of casualties among guerrilla fighters is a matter of some conjecture. The French military authorities mentioned a range of 30 to 80 killed, while on 29 September, Afghan leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], claiming responsibility for the attack, declared that ten of his men had been killed in the fighting.<ref name=\"ghul\">\n{{cite news |title=Afghan warlord Hekmatyar claims French ambush: report |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/International/30-Sep-2008/Afghan-warlord-Hekmatyar-claims-French-ambush/ |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Heads of State and heads of government such as Gordon Brown, George W. Bush, Silvio Berlusconi and Stephen Harper also gave hommage.\n\nOn 20 August, Nicolas Sarkozy travelled to Kabul to speak to the French soldiers stationed in Afghanistan.

Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon claimed to have \"''learnt the lessons of the ambush''\", and announced further military deployment, amounting to about 100 men with drones and helicopters.\n\n=== Military consequences ===\nOn 20 August, US military authorities in Afghanistan claimed to have killed two of the leaders involved in the ambush in [[Kapisa Province]].\n\nOn 18 October 2008, ISAF and Afghan forces returned to Sper Kunday as to prevent a permanent build-up of Taliban influence in the region. Fighting ensued and 7 militant fighters were killed or wounded. French military authorities claim that villagers are subject to strong pressure from the militants.\n\nIn the following months, the French military took steps to send 20mm-armed Air Force [[V\u00e9hicule d'Intervention Blind\u00e9|VIB]] vehicles to reinforce the VABs of the Army. The Army 20mm VAB, the T20/13, requires reloading the gun outside of the vehicle.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\n=== News reports and the media war ===\n\n==== Initial Taliban reports ====\nAccounts by Taliban published by ''[[Al-Somood]]'' report that \"''as for the number of French killed during the fight, it amounts to several tens. Local and international medias have reported 11 killed and 21 wounded, but that is not true at all''\". In it, the Taliban refer to themselves as \"[[Mujahideen]]\", and, occasionally, to the French as \"[[crusaders]]\".\n\nThe account goes on, describing the patrol as consisting of \"''18 tanks and armoured vehicles''\", which it claims were all destroyed, save for five that were captured. It also boasts that five French soldiers had been taken prisoners and that \"''upon arrival of airplanes, the mujahideen could not take them along and had to kill them on the spot''\". More specifically, it mentions the employment of [[improvised explosive device]]s; the French reported not finding any.\n\nThe report also claims that \"''large amounts of weapons and ammunition''\" were captured, and that a film of the fight was made, showing \"''the dead, the booty and the destroyed armoured vehicles, thanks to God''\". It finishes with an accurate assessment of French public opinion and political debate, notably mentioning Herv\u00e9 Morin and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande by name.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\nIn November, Belgian journalist [[Joanie de Rijke]] met with Sher Mohammed (''Ghurghust''), who claimed to know the full story of the attacks, and was captured and held prisoner for six days before being released.<ref name=\"johan\"/> She was shown a heart-shaped pendant that the commander claimed was taken from a female soldier in the attack, and the knife that a commander ''Ghazi'' claimed to have used to kill four of the French troops.<ref name=\"johan\" />\n\n==== Initial reports by French authorities ====\nInitial statements of the French authorities claimed that those killed were \"during the first instants\" of the ambush, which was quickly contradicted by testimonies from survivors.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Defence did not report that one of the dead had been killed by a bladed weapon. This was deliberately omitted after the Minister talked with the family, who requested that this detail be kept from the public.<ref name=\"Merchet\" /> The information nevertheless surfaced, raising suspicions as to the truthfulness of official reports. The Ministry of Defence finally confirmed the fact on 5 September.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/afghanistan-un-seul-soldat-francais-tue-a-l-arme-blanche-05-09-2008-199805.php Afghanistan : un seul soldat fran\u00e7ais tu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arme blanche]</ref>\n\nOn 18 August, general [[Beno\u00eet Puga]] characterised the outcome of the event as \n\n{{quote|The mission was a success.

Two of them were photographed wearing French flak jackets, helmets and signature [[FAMAS]] rifles, as well as French uniforms in [[Camouflage Centre Europe]] patterns. The group leader, Faruki, demanded that French forces depart Afghanistan lest they be all killed. He stated that the French had crossed a red line by entering Uzbin valley, which they consider to be their territory. He further claimed that no French had been tortured, and returned a watch taken on the body of a dead soldier as a token.\n\n''Paris Match'' published the photographs and the messages of the Taliban leader on 4 September, causing an uproar in France, particularly from the families of the dead soldiers and the government.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-match-taliban-photoshoot-shocks-france-919109.html |title=Paris Match Taliban photoshoot shocks France |accessdate=2 November 2009 |last=Lichfield |first=John |date=4 September 2008 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Part of the press accused ''Paris Match'' of allowing itself to be used as a Taliban propaganda media.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\nOn the other hand, Taliban being in possession of military equipment was seen as a patent proof that a number of bodies had been abandoned for some time, and unconfirmed suspicions that soldiers have been captured alive and executed.<ref name=\"Merchet\" />\n\n=== Criticism of the organisation of the patrol ===\n\n==== Frenic report ====\nOn 3 September 2008, ''[[Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9]]'' published a [[FRENIC]] (French National Intelligence Cell) report to the General Staff and to military intelligence, claiming that the reconnaissance patrol had been ill-prepared.

The document claims that the patrol lacked supplies and preparation, that it ran low on ammunition 90 minutes into the fight, that the French section had only one radio, and that Afghan forces left their armament behind and fled the battle, while the Taliban seemed very well prepared.\n\nExistence of the report was at first denied by the French Defence minister, the French General Staff, and NATO. It was later acknowledged, but stated to be a mere \"field report\", redacted by the leader of the US team embedded in the patrol, and featuring errors.\n\n==== Internal criticism ====\nFrench Army officiers, both in France and in Afghanistan, criticised the lack of ammunition, radios, mortars, and air reconnaissance, and the fact that reinforcements had been brought by road only.\n\nCriticism on the website of the dead soldiers prompted the colonel of the 8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment to threaten litigation against critical commentators.<ref>\"Vos gueules, les veuves !\", ''[[Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9]]'', 24 September 2008.</ref>\n\nGeneral [[Michel Stollsteiner]], commander of Allied forces in the Kabul region during the ambush, acknowledged an \"excess of confidence\" in that the zone was considered to be largely secured.<ref name=confiance/> Another officer admitted that French forces had prepared for harassment with roadside bombs and suicide attacks, but not for coordinated guerrilla actions, and that the level of tactical skill shown by the guerrilla had been unexpected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-monde/2008-09-04/afghanistan-ce-qui-a-manque-aux-soldats-francais/924/0/271435 |title=Ce qui a manqu\u00e9 aux soldats fran\u00e7ais |accessdate=5 November 2009 |last=Guisnel |first=Jean |date=4 September 2008 |publisher=[[Le Point]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Later incidents ===\nSixteen months later, on 17 December 2009, coalition forces conducted [[Operation Septentrion]] in the Uzbin Valley, \"to show these insurgents that we can go where we want when we want\" according to a French military spokesperson.<ref name=\"BBC2009Dec18\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8419829.stm |title=French Afghan assault concludes |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=French troops lead Afghan attack on Taliban |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010535631_apeufranceafghanistan.html |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> An Afghan flag was planted in a key village of the Uzbin Valley; it was the furthest north coalition forces had been in the Valley.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/archives/article.php/406186 |agency=AFP |title=Afghanistan: d\u00e9monstration de force de la L\u00e9gion, cinq Am\u00e9ricains bless\u00e9s |author=Karim Talbi |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 August 2010 another French soldier was killed in the Uzbin Valley.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* ''Mourir pour l'Afghanistan'', by [[Jean-Dominique Merchet]].
