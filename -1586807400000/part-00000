Directed by Ricardo Pollack. PBS, 2011. Accessed February 23, 2018.</ref> However, despite its large black population it was also the last country in the western hemisphere to [[Abolitionism|abolish]] slavery, in 1888. Brazil proudly refers to itself as a \"[[Racial democracy|Racial Democracy]],\" originally coined by Brazilian [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Gilberto Freyre]] in his work ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala]]'' (The Masters and the Slaves), published in 1933. Additionally, racism has been made illegal under [[Anti-discrimination laws in Brazil#Penal Code|Brazil's anti-discrimination laws]], which were passed in the 1950s after an African-American dancer was barred from a hotel.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2016/12/18/506045513/since-established-in-1950-s-brazilians-say-anti-racism-laws-aren-t-enough Since Established In The 1950s, Brazilians Say Anti-Racism Laws Aren't Enough]</ref> Nonetheless, race has been the subject of multiple intense debates over the years within the country.\n\n== Definition of Race in Brazil ==\n{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Brazil|l1=Race and Ethnicity in Brazil}}\n\nBecause the country has a long history of [[miscegenation]], color lines in Brazil have long been blurred.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Monk|first=Ellis P.|date=July 20, 2016|title=The Consequences of 'Race and Color' in Brazil|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/emonk/files/monk_-_the_consequences_of_race_and_color_in_brazil_-_sp.pdf.|journal=Social Problems|volume=63|issue=3|pages=413\u2013430|via=Oxford Academic|doi=10.1093/socpro/spw014}}</ref> The [[Brazilian census]] organizes the population into five, albeit imperfect, racial groups. These are ''branco'' (white), ''preto'' (black), ''pardo'' (brown, or multi-racial), ''amarelo'' (yellow, or Asian), and ''ind\u00edgena'' (indigenous). Because there was never a legal genetic definition for these categories, throughout history, each of these racial groups has been defined in different ways. Racial classification in Brazilian society is often inconsistent and influenced by a myriad of factors including: class, status, education, location and [[phenotype]].<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, a light-skinned multiracial person who held an important, well-paying position in society may be considered ''branco'' while someone else with the same [[Ethnogenesis|ethnogenetic]] make up who had darker skin or was of a lower class may be considered ''pardo'' or even ''preto''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Slavery and Abolition ===\n{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}\n\nSoon after the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] began to settle in Brazil in the year 1500, they began to enslave the indigenous population in order to sustain their growing sugar economy. However, European induced wars and disease quickly began to deplete the indigenous populations and Portuguese colonizers soon looked to Africa to satisfy their labor demands.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=24}}</ref> By the end of the Slave Trade in 1850, the Brazilian colony had imported an estimated four million slaves from Africa, the largest number of any other country in the Americas and seven times more than what was imported to the United States.<ref name=\":0\" /> Slavery brought with it dehumanization of Africans and a multitude of negative stereotypes that set the stage for a racial hierarchy in Brazil where blacks and those of African descent would become the subservient class to whites.\n\nAlong with being the largest importer of Africans during the Slave Trade, Brazil was also the last country in the Americas to eradicate Slavery. Calls for the end of slavery in Brazil began in the early 19th century. In 1825, [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada|Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio Andrada e Silva]], who was a prominent figure in leading Brazil to independence from Portugal, was in high favor of gradual emancipation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/slavery-and-aboliton/|title=Slavery and Abolition in the 19th Century {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Britain also contributed to the push for abolition in Brazil, by abolishing the slave trade. This was a significant move due to the fact that the British was Brazil's main trade partner. A small amount of legislation also helped lead up to the official abolition of slavery in 1888. First, in 1871 the [[Rio Branco Law|Law of the Free Womb]] declared that all the children of slaves that were born after the law was passed were to be freed; followed by the 1885 Sexagenarian Law, which freed slaves over sixty years of age.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lei \u00c1urea (Golden Law).tif|thumb|The Golden Law. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\nA large contributor to the lengthy abolition process in Brazil was in part due to the dynamics of the royal family. By the 1870s, the last king, Pedro II had only one surviving child, the princess Isabel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-4/abolition/|title=Abolition {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Due to her gender and her marriage to a foreigner, Isabel had trouble gaining support, despite having twice served as regent during her father's reign. During her brief time as regent, she took small measures to abolish slavery. Due to the obstacles she faced, she had to appoint an entirely new cabinet in order to completely abolish slavery. She succeeded, and the abolition of slavery was referred to as the [[Lei \u00c1urea|Golden Law]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Post Emancipation Brazil (1888- Early 1900s) ===\nThe abolition of slavery in Brazil meant the end of legal [[Racial segregation|segregation]] between blacks and whites. However, racism did not die with the institution of slavery. The racial hierarchies put in place by slavery stood strong after abolition. There was no period of \u201c[[Reconstruction (United States)|reconstruction]]\u201d such as that which was instituted in the United States.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Elizabeth|date=February 2017|title=The 'Africanization' of Salvador: Race, Work, and Politics in Post-Emancipation Salvador Da Bahia, Brazil|journal=Latin American and Caribbean Ethnic Studies|volume=12|issue=3|pages=227\u2013249|doi=10.1080/17442222.2017.1365429}}</ref> Rather, newly freed black Brazilians were left to create a life for themselves out of nothing\u2014no land, money, or education. This disadvantaged state left the country with massive amounts of inequality between whites and non-whites. Because of this, the conversation about race in Brazil became closely intertwined with conversations about poverty and class.\n\nThough there were no laws directly targeting those of African descent on the basis of race, there were laws that put in place that created inequality between whites and blacks. For example, when Brazil first became a republic in 1889, voting was restricted to only literate men, which barred the majority of the black population from voting since there were large inequities in education after the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition to this, there was a redefining of crime that criminalized many aspects of African culture.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== [[Eugenics]] ====\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fear began to spur among the elite classes about how Brazil's early history of [[miscegenation]] would affect its development.<ref name=\":1\" /> This fear in combination with the growing popularity of using [[pseudoscience]] to explain racial differences led to the growth of eugenics in Brazil.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sebasti\u00e3o de Souza|first=Vanderlei|date=December 2016|title=Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-59702016000900093&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en|journal=Hist.

One anthropologist who adopted eugenic thought, Raimundo Nina Rodgrigues, began to become concerned with the racial mixing occurring in Brazil. He conducted a \u2018study\u2019 on people of African origin in Brazil and found that the ethnic group was \u201cunequivocally inferior.\u201d<ref name=\":5\" /> He advocated for separate criminal laws by race and that blacks be subject to separate laws because they were not free to choose crime because of their diminished capacities. However, Rodrigues himself was mixed race and expressed confusion about the status of mixed race individuals in the racial hierarchy. To counter this, he proposed the creation of several categories to express the spectrum of mixed people going from superior to ordinary, to degenerate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27}}</ref>\n\nIn the end, eugenics in Brazil never took on as strong as it did in Europe or North America. Some attribute the pseudoscience's limited success to the fact that Brazil already had a very large mixed-race population. Nina Rodrigues\u2019 confusion about how racial superiority works outside of a racial binary demonstrates this thought. Even at the time slavery was abolished in 1888, 6 percent of all marriages were interracial.<ref name=\":7\" /> This means that, at some level, racial barriers had already been broken down, making it difficult to institute hardline eugenics policies like [[Racial segregation|segregation]] or racial [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Others argue that the large presence of [[Catholic Church in Brazil|Catholicism]] in Brazil may have saved the country from harsher racial policies.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>''\u201cThe broad influence of Catholicism in Brazil and the rest of Latin America constrained eugenicists\u2019 interventions in discussions on marriage restrictions and human reproduction. In the eyes of Catholic intellectuals, these were matters of a moral and religious nature and as such not open to political or medical intervention; this kept them from making any more radical proposals such as eugenic sterilization\u201d'' <ref name=\":4\" /> (From: Sebasti\u00e3o de Souza, Vanderlei (December 2016). \"Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930\")</blockquote>\n\n==== The Policy of Racial Whitening ====\n{{Main|Racial whitening|l1=Racial Whitening}}\n\nAmidst discussions of eugenics and the country's demographics hindering its development, the first Brazilian Republic decided to institute a policy of \u201cwhitening\u201d wherein it would try to dilute the black population and drive out all signs of African culture.<ref name=\":3\" /> This was done by incentives encouraging immigrants from Europe to come and skew demographics along with suppression of African culture all in an effort to erase the presence of blacks from Brazil. The policy lasted until 1910 and because of it the percentage of whites in Brazil jumped from 34 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref>\n\n== Shifting Views on Race ==\n\n=== 1910-1920s ===\nThe end of European immigration in 1910 meant the resurfacing of fears among Brazil elite about the \u201cblackening\u201d of the Brazilian population.<ref name=\":3\" /> Suggestions about increasing immigration of Afro- North Americans sparked contentious debates inside and outside of the eugenics community.<ref name=\":8\" /> One such person who was troubled by this idea was eugenicist Renato Khel. Khel was influenced by aggressive eugenics policies that were being used in Germany and advocated for similar policies in Brazil, such as the sterilization of degenerates and criminals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref> However, the majority of the Brazilian population, including those within the eugenics community, were beginning to see miscegenation as a path to racial harmony.\n\n=== 1930s to 1980s: Brazil as a \u201cRacial Democracy\u201d ===\n{{Main|Racial democracy|l1=Racial Democracy}}\n\nAs Brazilian society drew farther and farther away from ideas of racial purity, [[Gilberto Freyre|Gilberto Freye]] popularized the idea of Brazil as a racial democracy in his book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala|The Masters and the Slaves]]''. Freye's book transformed the idea of miscegenation into a positive part of Brazilian culture and national identity and it became widely accepted that Brazil's history of intermixing between races had rendered the country a post-racial society, as it would come to be hailed for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackness Without Ethnicity: constructing race in BRazil|last=Sansone|first=Livio|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=2}}</ref> Importantly, the idea of racial democracy became central dogma to the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military governments of 1964-1985]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=40}}</ref> While it was in power, the military preferred to think of race as a non-issue and pushed the idea of a unified identity among all Brazilians in order to quell resistance.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nDuring military rule, racial democracy became a consensus among almost all Brazilians.

In her article \u201c''From \u2018Racial Democracy\u2019 to Affirmative Action\u201d'' [[Mala Htun]] argues that the unwillingness of the Brazilian government to define race prevented Afro-Brazilian rights organizations from forming and limited the group's political power.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Htun|first=Mala|date=2004|title=From \"Racial Democracy\" to Affirmative Action: Changing State Policy on Race in Brazil|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=39|pages=66|doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0010}}</ref> She also argues that refusing to acknowledge race created inaction that allowed for racism to continue.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== 1980s to present: The Emergence of a Race Conscious State ===\nThe common narrative of Brazil as a racial democracy persisted until the 1990s. In 1985, [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military rule]] officially ended and the year marked the beginning of re-democratization. The public greatly influenced the writing of the 1988 constitution and black rights organization successfully petitioned for the inclusion of an anti-racist clause that would make racism a punishable offense. In the 1990s, with the reintroduction of democratic systems, the use of NGOs and international organizations brought color consciousness and issues of persisting racial inequality to the forefront of national discussions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=52}}</ref> In particular, the 2001 [[World Conference against Racism 2001|Durban conference]] (World conference on Racism) attracted large amounts of attention to existing racial inequality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Htun|first=Mala|date=2004|title=From 'Racial Democracy' to Affirmative Action: Changing State Policy on Race in Brazil|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=39|pages=68|doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0010}}</ref> The issue stayed on the front page of national newspapers for months and even prompted comments from the president.

Under the racial democracy thesis, it was assumed that any disparity in wealth between white and non-white Brazilians was due to the legacy of slavery and broader issues of inequality and lack of economic mobility in the country. The general consensus was that the problem would fix itself given enough time. This hypothesis was examined in 1982 by sociologist Jos\u00e9 Pastore in his book ''Social Mobility in Brazil''. In his book, Pastore examines the 1973 household survey and compares the income and occupations of father-son pairs. Based on his findings, he concluded that the level of economic mobility in Brazil should have been enough to overcome inequality left from slavery had opportunities been available equally.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Mobility in Brazil|last=Pastore|first=Jose|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nRacial inequality is seen primarily through lower levels of education and income for non-whites than whites.<ref name=\":2\" /> Economic inequality is most dramatically seen in the near absence of non-whites from the upper levels of Brazil's income bracket.

One particular study looked at a series of [[homicide]]s that occurred in Brazil, spanning from 2000 to 2009. The statistics were obtained by the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]]. The explanatory variables the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]] looked at for potential causes of racialized killings were, [[race (classification of humans)|race]]/[[skin color]], [[gender]] and [[education]]. In the discussion section, the findings of the study suggested that anti-gun legislation in Brazil has yielded different outcomes among Brazil's population due to race or color. The risk of death by homicide in the white population declined during the period studied. In the black population, the risk of being victimized based on race increased regardless of gender, even after gun control measures took place over the studied period of time.<ref>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en Homicide victimization according to racial characteristics in Brazil {{in lang|en}}]</ref>\n\nAs the overall homicide rate registered in Brazil has been rising, the number of homicides per 100,000 [[Afro-Brazilians|afro]] and [[Pardo Brazilians|pardo brazilians]] also increased from 32.42 in 2006 to 43.15 in 2017, whereas the number of homicides per 100,000 for [[White Brazilians|white]] and [[Asian Brazilians|asian brazilians]] has decreased from 17.12 in 2006 to 15.97 recorded in 2017.<ref>https://www.statista.com/statistics/867757/homicide-rate-brazil-ethnicity/</ref>\n\nAnother study determined that in 2008, 111.2% more blacks died proportionally than whites in Brazil. The disparity is especially pronounced among young adults between 15 and 24 years of age. Among whites, the number of murders fell from 6,592 to 4,582 between 2002 and 2008, a difference of 30%. Meanwhile, the murders of young black men rose from 11,308 to 12,749 \u2014- an increase of 13%. In 2008, 127.6% more young black men died proportionately than whites. Ten years earlier, this difference was 39%. In the State of [[Para\u00edba]] in 2008, 1083% more blacks died than whites. In the State of [[Alagoas]], 974.8% more blacks died than whites.

These are ''branco'' (white), ''preto'' (black), ''pardo'' (brown, or multi-racial), ''amarelo'' (yellow, or Asian), and ''ind\u00edgena'' (indigenous). Because there was never a legal genetic definition for these categories, throughout history, each of these racial groups has been defined in different ways. Racial classification in Brazilian society is often inconsistent and influenced by a myriad of factors including: class, status, education, location and [[phenotype]].<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, a light-skinned multiracial person who held an important, well-paying position in society may be considered ''branco'' while someone else with the same [[Ethnogenesis|ethnogenetic]] make up who had darker skin or was of a lower class may be considered ''pardo'' or even ''preto''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Slavery and Abolition ===\n{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}\n\nSoon after the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] began to settle in Brazil in the year 1500, they began to enslave the indigenous population in order to sustain their growing sugar economy. However, European induced wars and disease quickly began to deplete the indigenous populations and Portuguese colonizers soon looked to Africa to satisfy their labor demands.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton Univ.

Calls for the end of slavery in Brazil began in the early 19th century. In 1825, [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada|Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio Andrada e Silva]], who was a prominent figure in leading Brazil to independence from Portugal, was in high favor of gradual emancipation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/slavery-and-aboliton/|title=Slavery and Abolition in the 19th Century {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Britain also contributed to the push for abolition in Brazil, by abolishing the slave trade. This was a significant move due to the fact that the British was Brazil's main trade partner. A small amount of legislation also helped lead up to the official abolition of slavery in 1888. First, in 1871 the [[Rio Branco Law|Law of the Free Womb]] declared that all the children of slaves that were born after the law was passed were to be freed; followed by the 1885 Sexagenarian Law, which freed slaves over sixty years of age.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lei \u00c1urea (Golden Law).tif|thumb|The Golden Law.

During her brief time as regent, she took small measures to abolish slavery. Due to the obstacles she faced, she had to appoint an entirely new cabinet in order to completely abolish slavery. She succeeded, and the abolition of slavery was referred to as the [[Lei \u00c1urea|Golden Law]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Post Emancipation Brazil (1888- Early 1900s) ===\nThe abolition of slavery in Brazil meant the end of legal [[Racial segregation|segregation]] between blacks and whites. However, racism did not die with the institution of slavery. The racial hierarchies put in place by slavery stood strong after abolition.

This disadvantaged state left the country with massive amounts of inequality between whites and non-whites. Because of this, the conversation about race in Brazil became closely intertwined with conversations about poverty and class.\n\nThough there were no laws directly targeting those of African descent on the basis of race, there were laws that put in place that created inequality between whites and blacks. For example, when Brazil first became a republic in 1889, voting was restricted to only literate men, which barred the majority of the black population from voting since there were large inequities in education after the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition to this, there was a redefining of crime that criminalized many aspects of African culture.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== [[Eugenics]] ====\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fear began to spur among the elite classes about how Brazil's early history of [[miscegenation]] would affect its development.<ref name=\":1\" /> This fear in combination with the growing popularity of using [[pseudoscience]] to explain racial differences led to the growth of eugenics in Brazil.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sebasti\u00e3o de Souza|first=Vanderlei|date=December 2016|title=Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-59702016000900093&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en|journal=Hist.

One anthropologist who adopted eugenic thought, Raimundo Nina Rodgrigues, began to become concerned with the racial mixing occurring in Brazil. He conducted a \u2018study\u2019 on people of African origin in Brazil and found that the ethnic group was \u201cunequivocally inferior.\u201d<ref name=\":5\" /> He advocated for separate criminal laws by race and that blacks be subject to separate laws because they were not free to choose crime because of their diminished capacities. However, Rodrigues himself was mixed race and expressed confusion about the status of mixed race individuals in the racial hierarchy. To counter this, he proposed the creation of several categories to express the spectrum of mixed people going from superior to ordinary, to degenerate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27}}</ref>\n\nIn the end, eugenics in Brazil never took on as strong as it did in Europe or North America. Some attribute the pseudoscience's limited success to the fact that Brazil already had a very large mixed-race population. Nina Rodrigues\u2019 confusion about how racial superiority works outside of a racial binary demonstrates this thought. Even at the time slavery was abolished in 1888, 6 percent of all marriages were interracial.<ref name=\":7\" /> This means that, at some level, racial barriers had already been broken down, making it difficult to institute hardline eugenics policies like [[Racial segregation|segregation]] or racial [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Others argue that the large presence of [[Catholic Church in Brazil|Catholicism]] in Brazil may have saved the country from harsher racial policies.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>''\u201cThe broad influence of Catholicism in Brazil and the rest of Latin America constrained eugenicists\u2019 interventions in discussions on marriage restrictions and human reproduction.

The policy lasted until 1910 and because of it the percentage of whites in Brazil jumped from 34 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref>\n\n== Shifting Views on Race ==\n\n=== 1910-1920s ===\nThe end of European immigration in 1910 meant the resurfacing of fears among Brazil elite about the \u201cblackening\u201d of the Brazilian population.<ref name=\":3\" /> Suggestions about increasing immigration of Afro- North Americans sparked contentious debates inside and outside of the eugenics community.<ref name=\":8\" /> One such person who was troubled by this idea was eugenicist Renato Khel. Khel was influenced by aggressive eugenics policies that were being used in Germany and advocated for similar policies in Brazil, such as the sterilization of degenerates and criminals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref> However, the majority of the Brazilian population, including those within the eugenics community, were beginning to see miscegenation as a path to racial harmony.\n\n=== 1930s to 1980s: Brazil as a \u201cRacial Democracy\u201d ===\n{{Main|Racial democracy|l1=Racial Democracy}}\n\nAs Brazilian society drew farther and farther away from ideas of racial purity, [[Gilberto Freyre|Gilberto Freye]] popularized the idea of Brazil as a racial democracy in his book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala|The Masters and the Slaves]]''. Freye's book transformed the idea of miscegenation into a positive part of Brazilian culture and national identity and it became widely accepted that Brazil's history of intermixing between races had rendered the country a post-racial society, as it would come to be hailed for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackness Without Ethnicity: constructing race in BRazil|last=Sansone|first=Livio|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=2}}</ref> Importantly, the idea of racial democracy became central dogma to the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military governments of 1964-1985]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=40}}</ref> While it was in power, the military preferred to think of race as a non-issue and pushed the idea of a unified identity among all Brazilians in order to quell resistance.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nDuring military rule, racial democracy became a consensus among almost all Brazilians.

According to sociologist Edward Telles, whites are five times more likely to be earning in the highest income bracket (more than $2,000/month).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the consequences of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=110}}</ref> Overall, The salary of Whites in [[Brazil]] are, on average, 46% over the salary of Blacks.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAdditionally, racial discrimination in education is a well documented phenomenon in Brazil. Ellis Monk, Professor of sociology at Harvard University, found that one unit of darkness in a student's skin corresponds to a 26 percent lower change of the student receiving more education as compared to lighter-skinned students.<ref name=\":2\" /> Further, a study on racial bias in teacher evaluations in Brazil found that Brazilian math teachers gave better grading assessments of white students than equally proficient and equivalently well-behaved black students.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=AEJ: Applied (7,4) p. 37 - Racial Discrimination in Grading: Evidence from Brazil|doi=10.1257/app.20140352|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa721601434c10052e0321288ede89653399ec0c}}</ref>\n\n'''Quality of Life Indicators vs. Race'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#87CEFA; color:white\" | Indicators\n! style=\"background:#87CEFA; color:white\" | White Brazilian\n! style=\"background:#87CEFA; color:white\" | Black & Multiracial Brazilian\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Illiteracy]]<ref>[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/vida,analfabetismo-entre-negros-e-mais-do-dobro-que-entre-brancos,611316,0.htm Illiterecy between Whites and Blacks in Brazil {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>\n|5.9%\n|13.3%\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Academic degree|University degree]]<ref>[http://www.vermelho.org.br/noticia.php?id_secao=10&id_noticia=141963 Academic degree between Whites and Blacks in Brazil {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>\n|15.0%\n|4.7%\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Life expectancy]]<ref>[http://www.folhadoms.com.br/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=32909:negros-t%C3%AAm-expectativa-de-vida-seis-anos-menor-do-que-os-brancos&Itemid=6 Life expectancy in Brazil {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>\n|73.13\n|67.03\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Unemployment]]<ref>[http://www.socialismo.org.br/portal/identidades-racismo/204-noticia/544-populacao-de-negros-e-brancos-quase-se-iguala-mas-desigualdades-continuam-diz-ipea- Unemployment in Brazil {{in lang|pt}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118195205/http://www.socialismo.org.br/portal/identidades-racismo/204-noticia/544-populacao-de-negros-e-brancos-quase-se-iguala-mas-desigualdades-continuam-diz-ipea- |date=2012-01-18 }}</ref>\n|5.7%\n|7.1%\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[GDP per capita]]<ref>[http://www.midianews.com.br/?pg=noticias&cat=8&idnot=50347 GDP per capita in Brazil {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>\n|R$22,699 \n|R$15,068\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Homicide rate|Homicide deaths]]<ref>http://ultimainstancia.uol.com.br/conteudo/colunas/54059/mais+de+65%25+dos+assassinados+no+brasil+sao+negros.shtml Homicide rate in Brazil (2009) {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>\n|29%\n|65.5%\n|}\n\n== Studies on Racialized Violence ==\n\nDue to the ongoing questions surrounding race in Brazil, there have been various studies of violence in the country and whether race was a contributing or main factor in these crimes. One particular study looked at a series of [[homicide]]s that occurred in Brazil, spanning from 2000 to 2009. The statistics were obtained by the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]]. The explanatory variables the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]] looked at for potential causes of racialized killings were, [[race (classification of humans)|race]]/[[skin color]], [[gender]] and [[education]]. In the discussion section, the findings of the study suggested that anti-gun legislation in Brazil has yielded different outcomes among Brazil's population due to race or color. The risk of death by homicide in the white population declined during the period studied. In the black population, the risk of being victimized based on race increased regardless of gender, even after gun control measures took place over the studied period of time.<ref>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en Homicide victimization according to racial characteristics in Brazil {{in lang|en}}]</ref>\n\nAs the overall homicide rate registered in Brazil has been rising, the number of homicides per 100,000 [[Afro-Brazilians|afro]] and [[Pardo Brazilians|pardo brazilians]] also increased from 32.42 in 2006 to 43.15 in 2017, whereas the number of homicides per 100,000 for [[White Brazilians|white]] and [[Asian Brazilians|asian brazilians]] has decreased from 17.12 in 2006 to 15.97 recorded in 2017.<ref>https://www.statista.com/statistics/867757/homicide-rate-brazil-ethnicity/</ref>\n\nAnother study determined that in 2008, 111.2% more blacks died proportionally than whites in Brazil. The disparity is especially pronounced among young adults between 15 and 24 years of age. Among whites, the number of murders fell from 6,592 to 4,582 between 2002 and 2008, a difference of 30%. Meanwhile, the murders of young black men rose from 11,308 to 12,749 \u2014- an increase of 13%. In 2008, 127.6% more young black men died proportionately than whites. Ten years earlier, this difference was 39%. In the State of [[Para\u00edba]] in 2008, 1083% more blacks died than whites. In the State of [[Alagoas]], 974.8% more blacks died than whites. In 11 States, this ratio exceeds 200%.<ref>[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,1-branco-e-morto-no-pais-para-cada-2-negros,683821,0.htm For every death of a white person in Brazil, 2 black people die {{in lang|pt}}]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Race and ethnicity in Brazil]]\n*[[Social apartheid in Brazil]]\n*[[Racial whitening]]\n*[[Racial democracy]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Juanma S\u00e1nchez Arteaga.
