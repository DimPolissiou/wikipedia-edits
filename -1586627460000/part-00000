A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he has represented a district based in the state capital and his hometown, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], since 1995, currently numbered as [[Texas's 35th congressional district]]. Although Austin is heavily Democratic, it is split between multiple congressional districts, and Doggett is currently the only Democrat to represent any part of it in Congress.<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2017-03-17/the-texas-hammer-gerrymandering-gerrymandering/</ref>\n\nDoggett received a [[bachelor's degree]] in Business Administration from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]].\n\nDoggett has held office as a legislator in the [[Texas State Senate]] and the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. He has also held office as a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]], before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nDoggett was born in Austin, the son of Alyce Paulin (Freydenfeldt) and Lloyd Alton Doggett. His maternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~battle/genealogy/reps/doggett.htm|title=lloyd doggett|website=freepages.rootsweb.com}}</ref> Doggett received both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Business Administration]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he served as student body president his senior year. While attending the [[University of Texas at Austin]], he also joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity.\n\n==Texas government==\nHis electoral career began in 1973, when he was elected to the [[Texas State Senate]], a position which he filled until 1985.  In 1984, he was the Democratic [[nomination|nominee]] for the [[United States Senate]] seat vacated by the perennial [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[John Tower]], but he lost to the Republican candidate, [[Phil Gramm]]. Doggett authored the bill creating the Texas Commission on Human Rights, as well as a law outlawing \"cop killer\" bullets and a \"sunset law\" requiring periodic review of government agencies. He gained attention in 1979, as a member of the \"[[Killer Bees (Texas Senate)|Killer Bees]]\" \u2014 a group of 12 Democratic state senators who opposed a plan to move the state's presidential primary to March 11. The intent was to give former [[governor of Texas|governor]] [[John Connally]] a leg up on the 1980 Republican nomination. The Killer Bees wanted a [[closed primary]]. When this proposal was rejected, they walked out of the chamber and left the Senate two members short of a [[quorum]]. The bill was withdrawn five days later.\n\nIn 1989, he became both a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]] and an adjunct [[professor]] at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], his [[alma mater]], serving until his election to Congress.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n[[File:Al Gore, Lloyd Doggett and Nancy Pelosi at Netroots Nation 2008 (2728793940).jpg|thumb|Doggett with [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Al Gore]] at Netroots Nation 2008]]\nDescribed as an \"endangered species\", Doggett was one of only three white male Democratic House members from Texas in the 113th Congress (the others being [[Gene Green]] and [[Beto O'Rourke]]) in a state with mostly Republicans and minority members of the Democratic Party.<ref name=\"Politico Doggett\">{{cite news|title=Is Lloyd Doggett Texas toast?|author= Alex Isenstadt|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59034.html|newspaper= Politico}}</ref> Following the retirements of Green and O'Rourke in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 election]], Doggett is the only white male Democrat representing Texas in Congress.

He was elected to the House of Representatives in [[U.S. House election, 1994|1994]] in what was then the [[Texas's 10th congressional district|10th District]] after 32-year incumbent [[Jake Pickle]] retired.  He was one of the few Democrats to win an open seat in that year's massive Republican landslide. Running for re-election in [[U.S. House election, 1996|1996]], Congressman Doggett defeated a challenger in [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Teresa Doggett, to whom he is no relation. It marked the second election in a row in which he defeated a black female Republican. In the years following his first re-election, Doggett would consistently win around 85% of the vote, facing only [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]] opponents. The 10th, which had once been represented by [[Lyndon Johnson]], had long been a liberal Democratic bastion in increasingly Republican Texas.\n\n[[2003 Texas redistricting|Redistricting by the Texas Legislature]] in 2003 split Austin, which had been located entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, among three districts.  Through Republican [[gerrymandering]], Doggett's home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the [[Houston]] suburbs.  Most of Doggett's former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. It was called \"the [[fajita]] strip\" or \"the [[bacon]] strip\" because of its shape. Doggett moved to the newly configured 25th and entered the Democratic primary\u2014the real contest in the heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. He won the primary and went on to victory in November. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nOn June 28, 2006, frick manted States Supreme Court]] ruled that the nearby 23rd District's lines violated the rights of Latino voters.  As part of the 2003 redistricting, heavily Democratic and majority-Latino [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] had largely been cut out of the 23rd and replaced by several heavily Republican areas near San Antonio. The decision turned on the fact that the 23rd was a protected majority-Latino district\u2014in other words, if the 23rd was ever redrawn to put Latinos in a minority, an acceptable majority-Latino district had to be created in its place.  While the new 23rd was 55% Latino, only 46% of its voting population was Latino. The Court therefore found that the 23rd was not an acceptable Latino-majority district. It also found that the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement because the two Latino communities in the district were more than 300 miles apart, creating the impression that it had been deliberately drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness.<ref name=\"Decision in LULAC v.

For the 2006 election, Doggett regained most of his old base in Austin (though not the area around the [[University of Texas at Austin]], which stayed in the 21st), and also picked up several suburbs southeast of the city.  After skating to reelection in 2006 and 2008, he was held to only 52 percent of the vote in 2010\u2014his closest race since 1996.\n\n;2012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2012#District 35}}\nIt was reported that the new Congressional maps in Texas turned Doggett's district from a strongly Democratic district into a strongly Republican one.<ref>{{cite news |title= The GOP's big Texas gerrymander|author= Aaron Blake|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-gops-strong-texas-gerrymander/2011/06/02/AGP56VHH_blog.html|newspaper= Washington Post|access-date=June 2, 2011|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>  The new map split Doggett's old territory among five districts. His home was placed in a new, heavily Republican 25th District stretching from east Austin all the way to the fringes of Fort Worth.  Much of his old base, however, was placed in the newly created 35th district, a majority-Hispanic district stretching from San Antonio to eastern Austin.<ref>[ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.state.tx.us/PlanC235/Maps/Individual%20Districts/map_C235_25-36.pdf Map of Texas Congressional districts 25-36]</ref> Doggett's home was located approximately five blocks east of the 35th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled state legislature had [[gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] the district by packing as many Democrats in the San Antonio-Austin corridor into it as possible.<ref name=AC/>\n\nDoggett accused the Republicans of wanting to make it difficult, if not impossible, for an Anglo Democrat to be elected to Congress from Texas, saying, \"The Republican Party is determined to make the Democratic Party a party of minorities \u2014 that is what this is about, as well.\"  He added that the Republicans were deliberately trying to reduce Austin's clout in Congress by \"deny(ing) the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city.\" He was faced with the choice between running in the reconfigured 25th or moving, joking that he would live in a Winnebago to be able to run in the newly created 35th.<ref>{{cite news |title= Doggett: Texas GOP's redistricting plan aims to eliminate white Dems|author=Sean Miller|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/redistricting/165959-doggett-texas-gops-redistricting-plan-aims-to-eliminate-white-dems|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>\n\nDoggett was set to face State Representative [[Joaquin Castro]] in the District 35 primary election. The potential race was described as the biggest threat to Doggett's survival yet, with Castro being seen as a \"rising star\" in the Democratic party. Doggett accused Castro of working alongside Republicans throughout the redistricting process. The Republican House Redistricting Committee later clarified, saying that any discussions with Castro took place after the area for the district was decided.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doggett vs. Castro: Getting Ugly Already|author=Cindy Casares|url=http://www.texasobserver.org/big-beat/doggett-vs-castro-getting-ugly-already|newspaper= Texas Observer}}</ref> However, Castro opted to run in the neighboring 20th District after its incumbent, [[Charlie Gonzalez]], announced his retirement.\n\nDoggett eventually decided to run in the 35th District, facing [[Bexar County]] assessor [[Sylvia Romo]]. Before the primaries, he said that he would move into the district if he were to win. Political commentators suggested that Romo had the district numbers in her favor, but was attempting the difficult leap from local office to Congress, while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. Doggett has stressed his long tenure as a progressive Democrat, saying he wants to \"stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care, and also notes his strong support for both higher education programs and public education.\" By contrast, Romo's campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth.<ref name=AC>{{cite news|title= CD 35: Doggett, Romo, Alvarado|author=Michael King|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-05-11/cd-35-doggett-romo-alvarado|newspaper=Austin Chronicle}}</ref>\n\nDoggett won the primary with 73.2% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|title= Election 2012: The Morning After cheat sheet|author=Brad Rollins|url=http://smmercury.com/2012/05/30/election-2012-the-morning-after-cheat-sheet|newspaper=San Marcos Mercury}}</ref> He performed strongly in San Antonio, an area he had never before represented.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he has represented a district based in the state capital and his hometown, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], since 1995, currently numbered as [[Texas's 35th congressional district]]. Although Austin is heavily Democratic, it is split between multiple congressional districts, and Doggett is currently the only Democrat to represent any part of it in Congress.<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2017-03-17/the-texas-hammer-gerrymandering-gerrymandering/</ref>\n\nDoggett received a [[bachelor's degree]] in Business Administration from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]].\n\nDoggett has held office as a legislator in the [[Texas State Senate]] and the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. He has also held office as a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]], before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nDoggett was born in Austin, the son of Alyce Paulin (Freydenfeldt) and Lloyd Alton Doggett. His maternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~battle/genealogy/reps/doggett.htm|title=lloyd doggett|website=freepages.rootsweb.com}}</ref> Doggett received both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Business Administration]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he served as student body president his senior year. While attending the [[University of Texas at Austin]], he also joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity.\n\n==Texas government==\nHis electoral career began in 1973, when he was elected to the [[Texas State Senate]], a position which he filled until 1985.  In 1984, he was the Democratic [[nomination|nominee]] for the [[United States Senate]] seat vacated by the perennial [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[John Tower]], but he lost to the Republican candidate, [[Phil Gramm]]. Doggett authored the bill creating the Texas Commission on Human Rights, as well as a law outlawing \"cop killer\" bullets and a \"sunset law\" requiring periodic review of government agencies. He gained attention in 1979, as a member of the \"[[Killer Bees (Texas Senate)|Killer Bees]]\" \u2014 a group of 12 Democratic state senators who opposed a plan to move the state's presidential primary to March 11. The intent was to give former [[governor of Texas|governor]] [[John Connally]] a leg up on the 1980 Republican nomination. The Killer Bees wanted a [[closed primary]]. When this proposal was rejected, they walked out of the chamber and left the Senate two members short of a [[quorum]]. The bill was withdrawn five days later.\n\nIn 1989, he became both a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]] and an adjunct [[professor]] at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], his [[alma mater]], serving until his election to Congress.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n[[File:Al Gore, Lloyd Doggett and Nancy Pelosi at Netroots Nation 2008 (2728793940).jpg|thumb|Doggett with [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Al Gore]] at Netroots Nation 2008]]\nDescribed as an \"endangered species\", Doggett was one of only three white male Democratic House members from Texas in the 113th Congress (the others being [[Gene Green]] and [[Beto O'Rourke]]) in a state with mostly Republicans and minority members of the Democratic Party.<ref name=\"Politico Doggett\">{{cite news|title=Is Lloyd Doggett Texas toast?|author= Alex Isenstadt|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59034.html|newspaper= Politico}}</ref> Following the retirements of Green and O'Rourke in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 election]], Doggett is the only white male Democrat representing Texas in Congress.

He was elected to the House of Representatives in [[U.S. House election, 1994|1994]] in what was then the [[Texas's 10th congressional district|10th District]] after 32-year incumbent [[Jake Pickle]] retired.  He was one of the few Democrats to win an open seat in that year's massive Republican landslide. Running for re-election in [[U.S. House election, 1996|1996]], Congressman Doggett defeated a challenger in [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Teresa Doggett, to whom he is no relation. It marked the second election in a row in which he defeated a black female Republican. In the years following his first re-election, Doggett would consistently win around 85% of the vote, facing only [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]] opponents. The 10th, which had once been represented by [[Lyndon Johnson]], had long been a liberal Democratic bastion in increasingly Republican Texas.\n\n[[2003 Texas redistricting|Redistricting by the Texas Legislature]] in 2003 split Austin, which had been located entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, among three districts.  Through Republican [[gerrymandering]], Doggett's home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the [[Houston]] suburbs.  Most of Doggett's former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. It was called \"the [[fajita]] strip\" or \"the [[bacon]] strip\" because of its shape. Doggett moved to the newly configured 25th and entered the Democratic primary\u2014the real contest in the heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. He won the primary and went on to victory in November. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nOn June 28, 2006, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that the nearby 23rd District's lines violated the rights of Latino voters.  As part of the 2003 redistricting, heavily Democratic and majority-Latino [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] had largely been cut out of the 23rd and replaced by several heavily Republican areas near San Antonio. The decision turned on the fact that the 23rd was a protected majority-Latino district\u2014in other words, if the 23rd was ever redrawn to put Latinos in a minority, an acceptable majority-Latino district had to be created in its place.  While the new 23rd was 55% Latino, only 46% of its voting population was Latino. The Court therefore found that the 23rd was not an acceptable Latino-majority district. It also found that the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement because the two Latino communities in the district were more than 300 miles apart, creating the impression that it had been deliberately drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness.<ref name=\"Decision in LULAC v.

Dubbed the Cardcaptor by the cards' guardian Cerberus (better known as Kero-chan), Sakura must wield the Clow Staff to capture the card spirits and turn them back into cards for her use. Sakura is aided by her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, who creates battle costumes for her as well as videotaping her ventures as Cardcaptor; and later by Syaoran Li, a Chinese boy who is a direct descendant of the Clow Cards' creator Clow Reed. The anime also introduced a fourth companion, Meiling Li, Syaoran's cousin. The rest of the characters are mostly oblivious to Sakura's magical life, aside from her brother Toya who has his own magical powers, and later Eriol Hiiragizawa, who is a reincarnated Clow Reed.\n\nThe anime was dubbed into English by [[Nelvana]] under the title of ''Cardcaptors'', with most of the character names changed to English ones with the exception of Sakura (repronounced as \"Sa-KU-ra\" instead of \"SA-ku-ra\" though), Meiling (slightly reduced in spelling as \"Meilin\"), Cerberus (repronounced as \"Keroberos\" based on the Japanese pronunciation of his name; \"Kero\" was repronounced as \"kir\u014d\" instead of \"ker\u014d\"), Mr. Terada, Wang Wei, Ruby Moon, Yue, and Clow Reed (\"Clow\" was repronounced as \"klau\u0307\" instead of \"kl\u014d\").\n\nA large number of the characters reappear as alternate selves in Clamp's other series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Main characters==\n<!-- http://ccsakura-official.com/intro/index2.html   for who are credited as main, listed generally in order of appearance -->\n\n===Sakura Kinomoto===\n{{main|Sakura Kinomoto}}\n{{nihongo|'''Sakura Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u3055\u304f\u3089|Kinomoto Sakura}} is the titular heroine of ''Cardcaptor Sakura,'' named after the Japanese word for \"[[cherry blossom]]\". Her most defining character traits are her unyielding determination, caring nature and loyalty to her friends. Sakura is portrayed as a perceptively sweet, extremely energetic and cheerful character who is well-loved, pretty, cheerful, cute and at times a na\u00efve, clumsy, and clueless. Sakura is athletically gifted and skilled in sports at school, being  an excellent runner and called the \"best baton twirler in school\" by her friends.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 1 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book''</ref> She hates math and is openly [[phasmophobia|phasmophobic]]. She has a big brother that is a [[wikt:babe magnet|chick magnet]]. Sakura maintains a crush on Yukito Tsukishiro for most of the manga and anime, but when she finally confesses to Yukito, she is gently rejected and she realizes that she loved him because of his resemblance to her father. Eventually, Sakura realizes she is actually in love with Syaoran, but doesn't realize her feelings until he first confesses his love for her. Although she fails to admit her feelings in the final episode, Sakura later manages to finally confess her love to Syaoran when he and Meiling return to visit in the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]''. However, in the Nelvana dub, they never develop their romance as it was heavily edited out.\n\nShe becomes the entitled Cardcaptor by guardian beast Cerberus after accidentally opening and releasing the Clow Cards from the Clow Book. Aided by Cerberus, her best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidouji, and later Syaoran, Sakura successfully captures all the cards and is named the new Clow Mistress by the cards' second guardian Yue (Yukito's true form).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 46 ''Sakura and the Final Judgment''</ref> In the second half of the manga and anime, Sakura must use the power of her own star to transform the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, or else the cards would lose their powers. In the beginning of the ''Clear Card'' arc, all the Sakura cards suddenly turn blank, losing their powers and while looking for a way to restore them, Sakura must capture new cards of an unknown origin that started appearing around town. She later learns that Syaoran was responsible for the Sakura cards' disappearance in a move to protect her, as her own power had grown too strong for her to control, leading to the creation of the Clear cards.\n\nFor all Japanese-language productions of the anime (including movies, audio CDs, and video games), Sakura is voiced by [[Sakura Tange]]. In the Nelvana dub ''Cardcaptors'', she is known as '''Sakura Avalon''', her initial romantic feelings for Yukito are removed, and is voiced by [[Carly McKillip]]. In the Animax dub, she is voiced by Andrea Kwan. In the English dub of the [[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card|second movie]], she is voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].<ref name=\"them ccs movie 2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=874 | title=Card Captor Sakura the Movie 2: The Sealed Card \u2013 Review | work=THEM Anime Reviews | accessdate=November 27, 2013 | last=Laeno | first=Dominic}}</ref> In the English dub of the ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card|Clear Card]]'' arc, she is voiced by [[Monica Rial]], who reprised her role as Sakura from ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-01-22/monica-rial-jason-liebrecht-return-for-cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card-english-dub/.126791|title=Monica Rial, Jason Liebrecht Return for Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card English Dub|date=January 22, 2018|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Cerberus {{anchor|Kero|Keroberos|Kero-chan}} ===\n<!-- Wikipedia uses the official English spelling from the manga, which is the primary work.

He is one of two magical creatures created by Clow Reed along with the Clow Cards. Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his \"brother\" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the Final Judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear.\n\nHaving spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in [[Osaka]], Cerberus speaks with a pointed [[Kansai dialect|Osakan-accent]].<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical and gluttonous, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger.

However, his master must have control of the Firey and Earthy cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged [[Cougar|mountain lion]]. In the anime adaptation, the Light card is changed to the Earthy card to delay his obtaining his true form.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Cerberus' name is taken from the [[Greek mythological]] figure, [[Cerberus]], a large three-headed dog who was assigned to guard the gates of the [[Greek underworld]]. In the bilingual Kodansha version of the manga, the name for Cerberus' borrowed form is Cero.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by [[Aya Hisakawa]], while his hidden form is voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, his name is spelled Keroberos. His false form is voiced by [[Matt Hill]] with a New York accent, and [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]] voices his true form, though the accent is not as distinct. In the second film, he is voiced by [[Wendee Lee]] and [[Dave Wittenberg]], in his respective forms. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Kero's false form is voiced by Mikaela Krantz and Kero's true form is voiced by [[Christopher Sabat]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/shows/cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card/|title=Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card English Cast & Crew|website=www.funimation.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\nCerberus appears in Episode 44 of ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'' in his borrowed form, although in the parallel world he dwells in it appears to be his singular body.<ref>''Tsubasa Chronicle'', Episode 44 ''Kero-chan and Mokona''</ref> Cerberus (using \"Kero\" as a nickname) guards the Country of Kero, and has a prophetic dream of Syaoran, Sakura, Fai, Kurogane and Mokona, the protagonists of ''Tsubasa'', arriving in his world and recruits Mokona to climb up a mountain to retrieve one of Sakura's memory feathers which shrinks down the protagonists in size.

The daughter of the president of [[Daid\u014dji family|Daid\u014dji]] Toy Company, Sonomi Daidoji,<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 10 ''Sakura and the Sports Day of Flowers''</ref> Tomoyo lives a life of wealth and is watched over by a team of female maids and bodyguards.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 2 ''Sakura's Wonderful Friend''</ref> She has access to a variety of [[state of the art]] [[prototype]] technological gadgets from her mother's company, and supplies Sakura and Cerberus with different [[mobile device]]s throughout the series. Her most defining character traits is her attentiveness, integrity and selflessness towards Sakura's welfare. \n\nTomoyo is initially comes of as stereotypical \"Ojou-san\"; a demure and wealthy high-class female stock character. However, she is depicted as being emotionally matured, hard-working, highly motivated, compassionate, intelligent, meticulous; giving her a unique air of cultured politeness and refinement amongst the cast. She regularly speaks using more formal verb [[Japanese language|conjugations]] and expressions than normally seen in elementary students. She is artistically gifted, having displayed talents as an amateur fashion designer, beautician, cinematographer, seamstress, choreographer and vocalist. Tomoyo is shown announcing, performing, or costume designing in various school events; in the anime, her musical ability causes her to be targeted by both the Voice and Song cards. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable perceptiveness, cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card|The Sealed Card]]'' film.\n\nBecause Tomoyo lacks magical powers and athletic abilities, Sakura takes on a protective responsibility most times when capturing or transforming cards. If Tomoyo is ever in danger (or missing), Sakura will be the one concerned for her most, and her focus changes from that of the Card at hand to Tomoyo's safety. Fortunately, Sakura has always succeeded and hugs Tomoyo warmly whenever she reunites with her.\n\nTomoyo is notable for her crafty streak and obsession of documenting every single detail of Sakura's personal life on video as much as possible, much to Sakura's discomfort. When she learns of Sakura's new role as a Cardcaptor, she insists that Sakura must wear \"special outfits\", is responsible for choreographing Sakura's new action poses and begins providing Sakura with the various \"magical girl\" protective-costumes she wears during her captures, as well as accompanying her on magical (and non-magical) endeavors to record the events with her video camera. These \"art project\" seems to serve Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment than improving Sakura's performance. Tomoyo faithfully keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need.\n\nIn both the manga and anime adaptations, Tomoyo admits that she loves Sakura, but Sakura replies innocently, \"I love you, too,\" in the platonic sense. This is emphasized using manga conventions: Tomoyo declares her love against a background of flowers, while Sakura replies against a blank white background. In the manga, some scenes give the appearance that Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura's brother Toya; however, according to Volume 1 of ''Clamp No Kiseki: The Ultimate Collection'', and an interview in the ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', this was an error caused by one of the finishing artists not being aware that CLAMP intended for Tomoyo to have romantic feelings for Sakura.<ref name=\"hawt\">interview printed in ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', published by Nakayoshi.</ref> Instead, she encourages Sakura's love of Yukito, and later becomes Syaoran's confidante and [[Wingman (social)|wingman]] when he begins to fall in love with Sakura.\n\nCLAMP stated that the reason that Sakura does not return her friend Tomoyo's feelings is not because Tomoyo is another girl, as Sakura does not consider sex or gender as barrier for her romantic attraction. She simply doesn't have romantic feelings for Tomoyo in particular.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Demonstrating this, Sakura confesses that she has a crush on a female teacher in the series.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nIn the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', Tomoyo's name is changed to '''Madison Taylor''', and her elegant speech was replaced with [[valley girl]] speech. J.D. Considine of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated:\n<blockquote>''\"A United States audience would have a hard enough time accepting the deference and politeness of Sakura's best friend, Tomoyo, as merely a sign of good breeding. But her intense devotion to Sakura -- sewing elaborate costumes for each Clow Card chase, documenting Sakura's successes on video, assuring Sakura that she \"really likes\" her -- verges on the creepy. No wonder the American version simply paints Madison (the Tomoyo character) as a video obsessive who sees Sakura's adventures as mere camera fodder.\"''<ref name=\"Considine\">Considine, J.D. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/television-radio-making-anime-a-little-safer-for-americans.html TELEVISION/RADIO; Making Anime A Little Safer For Americans].\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In ''Cardcaptors'', she is voiced by [[Maggie Blue O'Hara]]. In the English dub of ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]'', her voice is supplied by [[Michelle Ruff]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Tomoyo is voiced by [[Natalie Hoover]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Touya Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Touya Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c [[wiktionary:\u6843\u77e2|\u6843\u77e2]]|Kinomoto T\u014dya}} is Sakura's older brother. His birthday is February 29. Though he teases her frequently, he cares a great deal for her and works to protect her. He is fully aware of what she is doing as a Cardcaptor, and regularly takes on several part-time jobs that put him in a position to be nearby when she is working on capturing a card. He disliked Syaoran and often holds a grudge against him but deep down he thought to himself that if there was someone Sakura should be with it would be Syaoran. Touya possesses several magical powers, including the ability to see ghosts and other non-humans, the ability to sense when Sakura is in danger, and mild [[precognition]]. He has an extremely close relationship with his best friend [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito]], despite knowing he is the alter-ego of Yue. To save both Yukito and Yue, Touya becomes a normal human being after he gives all of his magical powers to Yue, making him promise to protect Sakura in his stead as well as himself (and, by extension, Yukito).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 65 ''Sakura, Yukito, and the Vanishing Power''</ref> However, it has been revealed in the last chapter of Clear Card Arc that he is gradually regaining his magic and seems to be developing new and greater abilities that he shall reveal until the time is right. \n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Touya is voiced by [[Tomokazu Seki]]. In the English manga his name is spelled \"Toya\". In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Darren Pleavin. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'' his name is changed to '''Tori Avalon''', and he is voiced by [[Tony Sampson]]. In the English dub of the second film, [[Kirk Thornton]] takes over the voicing role. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Touya is voiced by [[Clifford Chapin]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yukito Tsukishiro / Yue {{anchor|Yukito Tsukishiro|Yue}} ===\nYue/Yukito are a [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]: Yukito is a \"false\" persona created to mask Yue's \"true\" identity. For most of the series, Yue remained in a \"[[Hibernation|state of hibernation]]\"; Yukito is unaware of Yue's existence, though he maintains an enormous appetite for food in an unconscious attempt to give Yue power. Yue's existence is revealed to the other characters after all of the Clow Cards are collected, and Toya states he knew of Yue's existence all along and was just waiting for Yukito to notice himself.\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yukito Tsukishiro'''|\u6708\u57ce \u96ea\u514e|Tsukishiro Yukito|nicknamed 'Yuki' by Toya, and 'Yuki-usagi' by Kerberus}} is the best friend of Sakura's older brother, Touya, and the human alter-ego of the Clow Card guardian, [[#Yue|Yue]]. Though he is certainly Yue's \"temporary form\", he is referenced several times by other characters (including Eriol and Yue himself) as being simultaneously a completely separate \"heart\" from Yue's \"true form\". As Yukito, he displays a kind and gentle nature, and at the start of the series, Sakura develops a strong [[limerence]] towards him. When she confessed her feelings, he gently rejects her, as the one he loves most is Touya.\n\n:Once Sakura collects all of the cards, Yue begins needing greater power as her magic isn't strong enough to sustain him. Subconsciously, Yukito begins eating even more to try to compensate, but it is not enough and he starts sleeping constantly, even while standing, and eventually finds his body fading away altogether. Once Touya gives his magical energy to Yue to sustain them, Yukito begins to grow aware of Yue's existence; the grandparents with whom Yukito thought he lived were a false memory and thus did not exist. It is suggested that he came into existence shortly before he met Touya, to be near the future new guardian of the Clow Cards. Eriol tells Yue that while he (and Clow) did know Sakura was predestined to be the future master of the cards, and had predicted that both Sakura and Yue would be [[Romance (love)|romantically involved]] with each other; however, Yukito had deviated from this prophetic vision by [[falling in love]] with Touya.\n\n:In the Japanese anime adaptation Yukito is voiced by [[Megumi Ogata]]. In ''Cardcaptors'', Yukito's name is changed to '''Julian Star''', his relationship with Touya is removed, and he is voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]]. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Steve Staley]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Yukito is voiced by [[Justin Briner]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yue'''|\u6708|extra=[[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Pinyin]]: ''Yu\u00e8''}} is the one of two Guardians of the Clow Cards, along with Cerberus. His name, which is written in ''[[kanji]]'' rather than ''[[hiragana]]'' is the [[Mandarin Chinese]] word for \"moon\". Whereas Cerberus is the elector of the new Clow Card Master, Yue is the judge who is allowed to test the candidate for their worthiness. He spends most of the series in his temporary form, [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]], who initially has no memory or knowledge of his other self. Unlike Cerberus, Yue's powers are heavily dependent on the power of his master. Sakura's power is not yet strong enough to sustain him after he awakens, particularly after she begins transforming the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards. Yue's growing need for power is reflected in Yukito's ravenous appetite and later constant sleeping. Similarly, the deficit affects Yue himself in instances such as the blatant failure of his magic which causes he and Sakura to fall out of the sky during one of Eriol's synthesized 'situations'. Eventually, Sakura's brother Toya reveals that he knows Yue and Yukito are not human and gives his power to Yue to sustain his existence so he does not lose Yukito.\n\n:As with [[Ruby Moon]], Yue's \"true form\" has no biological sex or gender; though not \"human or male\", Yue has the appearance of a [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] beautiful \"angelic-[[bish\u014dnen]]\" young man (male pronouns used) with long, silver, braided hair, silver-purple feline eyes, and a pair of white angel wings which he uses for flight. Yue sports a white suit and spats-like coverings on his feet. His personality is depicted as serious and aloof in contrast to Yukito's, and while Yukito is fond of Sakura, Yue is reluctant to accept her. As the series progress, he comes to respond to Sakura's request that rather than being his master, she just wants to be his friend. Yue has jurisdiction over the elements wind and water, though he is stated by Cerberus to have control over other cards, including the Wood, Time and Dark.\n\n:{{anime voices2|Yue|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]|type=tv}} In the English dub of the second anime film, his voice is provided by [[Steve Staley]].

As such, he initially rivals against Sakura because he believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards and tries to capture the cards for himself. As the series progresses, however, Syaoran comes to respect Sakura and becomes her friend and ally. He eventually falls in love with her, though she is slow to realize it due to her own feelings for Yukito.\n\nOriginally, Syaoran appeared [[Infatuation|smitten]] with Yukito, but later revealed that the attraction was due to high moon power inside of Yukito. Eventually, in the beginning of the third season, Syaoran finally begins to realize he has deeply fallen in love with Sakura, as he constantly blushes whenever he is around her.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 47 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Transfer Student''</ref> In the manga, Syaoran begins to develop feelings for Sakura around the time of the Erase Card's capture. Once Syaoran realizes his feelings, he tries to admit his love for Sakura several times, but is both too nervous to confess his feelings while also being constantly interrupted. Syaoran also becomes extremely jealous whenever he sees Sakura spending time with Eriol, believing he harbours romantic feelings for Sakura and considers him a rival. Syaoran's love for Sakura is proven to be really strong as he thinks strongly of her well being and needs before his own as shown when after Yukito rejects Sakura's feelings, Syaoran comforts her even though Sakura is still unaware about his own romantic feelings towards her. Nearing the end of the series, Syaoran finally confesses his feelings to Sakura, but decides to return to [[Hong Kong]], since Sakura has now become the new master of the cards.\n\nIn the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]'', he and Meiling return from Hong Kong a few months later to visit. Throughout the movie, Syaoran waits for Sakura to reply to his confession, but as Sakura constantly keeps trying to tell him how she feels, they are repeatedly interrupted. Syaoran and Sakura work together to defeat the Nothing Card that has been secretly stealing the Sakura cards while making parts of Tomoeda disappear. Eventually at the end of the movie, they manage to defeat the Nothing Card, which becomes the Hope Card and Sakura finally confesses her love for Syaoran and jumps into his arms.\n\nTwo years later, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda and enrolls at the same middle school as Sakura and most of her friends. However, his true objective is to watch over Sakura and help her with the mystery surrounding the Clear Cards. He also keeps contact with Eriol, who instructs him to not interfere until the time is right. Later he reveals to Sakura that he was the one who took away the spirits contained within the Sakura Cards in order to protect herself from her own power, which is growing out of control, thus leading to the creation of the Clear Cards. Despite intending to reveal all the truth to Sakura, Syaoran becomes unable to tell her anything about Akiho or Kaito's involvement due to a spell Kaito placed on him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Syaoran manages to catch several cards by playing a major role in helping Sakura seal them. He is allowed to attempt the final judgment but fails. Syaoran is shown to have similar powers to Sakura, such as sensing Clow Cards and magical auras, is a skilled martial artist, and wields a sword which he can use to cast spells when equipped with incantation papers. He can also use a device dubbed a \"[[wiktionary:\u7f85\u91dd\u76e4|lasenboard]]\" in ''Cardcaptors'',<ref>''Cardcaptors'', Episode 9 ''The Rival''</ref> which can detect and direct him to magical entities. A running gag is Kero calling him \"kid\". In the Dub as well for Sakura, Syaoran never told his feelings towards Sakura as he did in episode 69, one episode before the finale.\n\nIn the English ''Cardcaptors'' adaptation, he is renamed '''Li Showron''' and he is introduced in the first episode, as the male lead. He is also called a \"Cardcaptor\".\n\nIn Japanese media, Syaoran is voiced by [[Motoko Kumai]]. Syaoran is voiced by [[Rhys Huber]] during the Clow Cards arc and the first movie, Jordan Kilik in the Sakura Cards arc, and [[Mona Marshall]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Jason Liebrecht]], who reprised his role as Syaoran from ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Meiling Li===\n'''Meiling Li''' (\u674e\u8393\u9234 ''L\u01d0 M\u00e9il\u00edng'', \u30ea\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ea\u30f3 ''Ri Meirin'', Cantonese Jyutping: ''lei5 mui4 ling4''), is [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]'s cousin and fianc\u00e9e, and only appears in the anime adaptation of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Introduced towards the end of episode 19, she is a very impulsive, bratty, straightforward, clingy, and overconfident girl. As children living in Hong Kong, Meiling and Syaoran trained in martial arts under the tutelage of Wang Wei. One night her pet bird escaped from its cage, and the normally quiet and withdrawn Syaoran told her not to cry, then left. After spending hours in the rain, he returned with the bird and Meiling was both grateful and touched. From that day, she devoted herself to him, eventually declaring that she liked Syaoran above all others and, reasoning that he liked her as well, she declared them to be engaged, much to Syaoran's chagrin. At the same time, she promised that if he found someone he liked more than her, he would tell her and she would release him from the promise.<ref>Ep 43<!-- proper ref later --></ref>\n\nIn coming to Tokyo, Meiling intends to help Syaoran find and gather the Clow Cards, and actively dislikes Sakura. As the series progresses, Meiling develops a grudging respect for Sakura that turns into a good friendship by the time Meiling returns to Hong Kong in episode 43 by her mother due to unknown reasons. During her initial visit, Meiling seemed to recognize that Syaoran was falling in love with Sakura, but it wasn't until she briefly returned in episode 60 that she acknowledges and accepts Sakura  as the person Syaoran loves. Wanting to keep her promise, Syaoran attempts to tell her that he loves Sakura, but Meiling interrupts and tells him that she knows because he is now calling Sakura by her first name, something he only does for his sisters and her. She releases Syaoran from their promise, then quickly leaves. Meiling spends the night at [[#Tomoyo Daid\u014dji|Tomoyo Daid\u014dji]]'s house and releases all of her frustration by crying without burdening Syaoran. At the end of the episode, Meiling returns home and is not seen again in the main series. She returns in the second movie, with Syaoran, to see her old friends, but secretly came back to help Sakura finally confess her love to Syaoran. Meiling also occasionally appears in the anime adaptation of ''Clear Card'', talking to Sakura on phone and giving her hints at developing her relationship with Syaoran. A running gag is Kero calling her \"brat\".\n\nAlong with her temporary stay in Tomoeda, Meiling also plays a limited and insignificant role in the story because, unlike Syaoran, she has no magical abilities, relying solely on her physical fighting abilities and a healthy dose of pride. Her lack of powers and tendency to leap before thinking, however, results in her hindering more than helping Syaoran in most battles against the cards. She challenges The Fight card in episode 20, and was nearly badly wounded and had to be rescued by Syaoran. Recognizing that she was being a burden, Meiling grew upset and lashed out at Syaoran. However, she was then able to be an aid to him while fighting The Twin card, as their years of practicing martial arts together enables them to match the card's synchronized fighting style.<!-- ep 43 -->\n\nIn ''Clear Card'' episode 13, Meiling matured and is much less of a brat than she used to be. Even Sakura is amazed to see Meiling speak so politely to Fujitaka, to which Meiling responds, \u201cIt\u2019s just good manners,\u201d as if that's how she's always been.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/04/23/meiling-is-the-most-delightful-surprise-in-cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card|title=Meiling is the Most Delightful Surprise in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMeiling sports an [[Odango (hairstyle)|odango hairstyle]] on every episode that she is in.\n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Meiling is voiced by [[Yukana|Yukana Nogami]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', she is known as '''Meilin Rae''' and is voiced by [[Nicole Oliver]]. Her unrequited engagement with Syaoran was omitted along with the fact that she and Syaoran were cousins. Rather she is portrayed as a long time friend of Syaoran and her romantic feelings toward him were watered down but still evident. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by [[Julie Maddalena]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Trina Nishimura]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Recurring characters in the manga==\n===Clow Reed===\n{{nihongo|'''Clow Reed'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30a6\u30fb\u30ea\u30fc\u30c9|Kur\u014d R\u012bdo}} is the sorcerer who originally created the Clow Cards, and their magical guardians [[#Cerberus|Cerberus]] and [[#Yue|Yue]]. Along with Kohaku of ''[[Wish (manga)|Wish]],'' and Yuuko of ''[[xxxHolic]],'' he is one of the few Clamp-created characters to appear in more than one work.\n\nBorn of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications. However, few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], as he has long been dead before the series starts. Few details are revealed about his character, personality, or life, though multiple characters comment on his eccentricity. He displays a gentle and affable personality in his interactions with his creations.\n\nWhen Clow knew he was about to die, he chose his then-unborn descendant [[Sakura Kinomoto]] to become the new guardian of the cards and the new master of Yue and Cerberus. Clow's magical ability allowed him to foresee most of the future and plan many of the situations that would enable Sakura to succeed in taking full possession of the Clow Cards. Likewise, he deliberately made the sealing wand pink, reflecting that its future user would be a young girl.<!-- Ep 46 of anime; vol 6 manga --> He also split his soul into two reincarnations: [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] who had all of his memories and magic, and [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka Kinomoto]], Sakura's father. In the anime adaptation, Clow does not split his soul, instead passing on his memories, soul, and powers to Eriol exclusively. Syaoran Li is also an indirect descendant of Clow's Chinese lineage.\n\nIn the anime adaptation and the film, he is voiced by [[Kazuo Hayashi]]. In the English adaptation, ''Cardcaptors'', he is voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]. Clow Reed also appears in two additional CLAMP works, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', where he has another descendant named [[Fei-Wang Reed]] and worked with the Dimensional Witch [[Y\u016bko Ichihara]] in arranging the series of events in the former series.\n\n===Fujitaka Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Fujitaka Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u85e4\u9686|Kinomoto Fujitaka}} is the father of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and her brother Touya Kinomoto. A busy professor of [[archaeology]] at Towa University, Fujitaka is a kind and caring father. He met his late wife [[#Nadeshiko Kinomoto|Nadeshiko]] while doing his first year as a teacher at her high school. Nadeshiko had climbed a tree to return a baby bird to its nest, but fell out of the tree, landing on Fujitaka. Upon seeing her, he stated that \"an angel has fallen from the sky.\" They fell in love and married when she was sixteen. Though Nadeshiko died seven years before the start of the series, Fujitaka is shown to still be very much in love with her and devoted to her memory. He keeps a picture of her in the dining room, changing it each morning.\n\nLittle is initially said about Fujitaka's family or past. During the second half of the series, it is revealed that when Clow Reed divided his soul (seeking to no longer be the most powerful magician in the world), he split it into two halves. One of these halves became [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]], holding all of Clow's magic and memories, and the other being Fujitaka, who has no magic of his own, but fathered the one who would inherit the cards. It is stated that Fujitaka has no magical powers of his own, but he is also unaffected by other Clow's magic, such as the Eriol's sleep spell. At the end of the series, Eriol gives half of his magic to Fujitaka. This enables Fujitaka to finally see the spirit of Nadeshiko, who has been watching over her family since her death.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Fujitaka's role as the other half of Clow Reed's reincarnation is completely removed as is his immunity to Eriol's magic and he is never able to see Nadeshiko's spirit. He is voiced by [[Hideyuki Tanaka]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, his name is changed to '''Aiden Avalon''' and he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Scott Evans. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Michael McConnohie]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Fujitaka is voiced by [[Jason Douglas]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Sonomi Daidouji===\n{{nihongo|'''Sonomi Daidouji'''|\u5927\u9053\u5bfa \u5712\u7f8e|Daid\u014dji Sonomi}} is the mother of titular character Sakura's best friend [[#Tomoyo Daidouji|Tomoyo Daidouji]], and the first cousin of Sakura's late mother [[#Nadeshiko Kinomoto|Nadeshiko Kinomoto]]. She is rarely seen in the series, but is said to be a wealthy woman and the President of a large toy corporation. She greatly loved her cousin Nadeshiko, and disapproved of her marriage to Fujitaka, later blaming Fujitaka for Nadeshiko's death at a young age. During the marriage, it is implied that Nadeshiko was at least partially cut off from her family. Sonomi maintains a [[pixie cut]], a hairstyle Nadeshiko loved giving her when they were kids; and has Tomoyo keep her hair long because it reminds her of Nadeshiko.\n\nAfter meeting Sakura for the first time, Sonomi realizes that Nadeshiko had lived a happy life and is able to come to terms with the marriage. At times, she still treats Fujitaka as a \"rival\" competing to love Nadeshiko more, but she also helps him pass on gifts from Sakura to her grandfather and to arrange for Sakura to meet her great-grandfather while on a family vacation. Sonomi shows great affection for Sakura\u2013treating her like her own daughter\u2013and often clears her busy work schedule to join her and Tomoyo whenever Sakura comes over to visit.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, her name is changed to '''Samantha Taylor''' and her declaration of love for Nadeshiko is modified to a purely familiar love rather than a romantic love.\n\nSonomi is voiced by [[Miki It\u014d]] in anime series. She is voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub and by [[Wendee Lee]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Michelle Rojas]].\n\n===Nadeshiko Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Nadeshiko Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c [[wiktionary:\u64ab\u5b50|\u64ab\u5b50]]|Kinomoto Nadeshiko}} is Sakura and Toya's mother, Fujitaka's late wife, and the first cousin of [[#Sonomi Daidouji|Sonomi Daidouji]]. She worked as a model from her teens up until her death. She was sixteen when she met Fujitaka when he worked as a student teacher at her high school. She met Fujitaka when she climbed a tree to rescue a bird nest and accidentally fell, and landed on him as he saved her from getting hurt. He then remarked, \"l had thought an angel fell from the sky\". With those words, she fell in love with him. Soon after, against the wishes of her family, they got married despite their nine-year age gap (he was 25, she was 16). She died from an unnamed illness when Sakura was three. Because she was 27 when she died and Sakura was three and Toya was eight, it is likely that she gave birth to Toya at 19. Although she has died, she is still very much remembered and loved by her family; Fujitaka keeps her picture in the family room and Sakura never fails to greet her photo every morning. She appears occasionally as a spirit and is seen only by Toya, Eriol, and Sakura (beginning with volume 4 of the Clear Card arc).\n\nNadeshiko is voiced by [[Y\u016bko Minaguchi]] in the anime series.  In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaption, her name is changed to '''Natasha Avalon''' and she is voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Megan Shipman.\n\n===Yoshiyuki Terada===\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshiyuki Terada'''|\u5bfa\u7530 \u826f\u5e78|Terada Yoshiyuki}} is a [[teacher]] at Tomoeda Elementary School. During the series, as the main characters go through fourth grade, and enter the fifth grade, he acts as their home room teacher. He is also shown teaching in other classes, including the [[physical education]] classes, and he acts as the chaperon on several school field trips. As the series progresses, it is revealed that he is having a romantic relationship with his student [[#Rika Sasaki|Rika Sasaki]]. In the manga, they become engaged when he gives her a ring, noting that he hopes it will one day become her wedding ring. Rika gives him a teddy bear she made and named after herself, which legends says will allow them to remain in love forever. Towards the end of the series, when Sakura is unsure of her feelings about Syaoran, the couple is shown having a picnic at a park, with Terada slipping away so Sakura doesn't notice him. During the series, none of the other characters appear to know about the relationship, though when Rika is taken over by the Sword card, Sakura hears her call out \"Sensei\" (teacher) when she uses the Illusion card to show Rika her most beloved.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, their relationship is not shown in the same light. Their engagement and more romantic scenes between them are removed, and Rika notes that Terada reminds her of her absentee father. Terada is also shown accepting cakes made by Rika and in accepting the bear and naming it after his \"hardest working student.\" In the ''Cardcaptors'' English dub, he is simply called '''Mr. Terada''', and all aspects of the romantic relationship between Terada and Rika are completely removed, with Rika's shyness and reactions to him made to appear to be more of a general fear of men than romantic feelings.\n\nIn the anime series, he is voiced by [[T\u014dru Furusawa]] for the first season and first movie, and by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] for the second and third seasons and the second film. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. He is voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Zach Bolton]].\n\n===Rika Sasaki===\n{{nihongo|'''Rika Sasaki'''|\u4f50\u3005\u6728 \u5229\u4f73|Sasaki Rika}} is a classmate and friend of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]]. She is considered to be very elegant and mature for her age, though she can also be shy. During the series, she is also shown to be a skilled cook and very good at crafts. During the series, Rika is affected by the Clow Cards several times. Early in the series, she buys a brooch that is actually The Sword card. The card takes her over and causes her to attack Sakura. Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved (or greatest fear in the English dub), allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card.\n\nDuring the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher [[#Yoshiyuki Terada|Yoshiyuki Terada]]. In the manga series, they are engaged to be married when she is old enough, and they frequently spend time alone together on \"dates.\" In the anime adaptation, the engagement is removed as are many of their dates, however they are still shown to have affection for one another (it's implied that he reminds her of her father, who's oft busy on overseas business). Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. In both the manga and anime, when Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika's attacks induced by the Sword card, she calls the image \"Sensei\" which means \"teacher\" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look.\n\nAfter graduating from Elementary School, Rika is the only among Sakura's friends who enrolled in a different Junior High School, and thus is not seen with them in ''Clear Card'', although they usually keep in touch.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, Rika's name is changed to '''Rita''' and all hints of her relationship with Terada are removed. Instead of being a good student, she is depicted as having trouble with her school work and her blushing around Terada is explained away as being embarrassed at having to stay after school so often and that she is afraid of him.\n\nIn the original anime series, she is voiced by [[Tomoko Kawakami]]. In the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Saki Fujita]]. In the English dub of the second film, she is voiced by [[Dina Sherman|Stevie Bloch]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Alex Moore.\n\n===Takashi Yamazaki===\n{{nihongo|'''Takashi Yamazaki'''|\u5c71\u5d0e \u8cb4\u53f2|Yamazaki Takashi}} is a classmate and friend of Sakura Kinomoto and Syaoran Li. He is infamously known for fabricating highly detailed stories on the supposed history of practically any subject, usually whatever Sakura and her friends happening to be discussing.  Sakura and Syaoran are often gullible enough to believe the stories, which often provide an element of humour in the series.  His stories are primarily interrupted by Chiharu, who physically disciplines him by strangling him until he stops talking and will resort to dragging him away when she proves to be unsuccessful.  His storytelling is later supplemented by Eriol, who helps to reinforce the false validity of his stories and whose presence prevents Chiharu from stopping Yamazaki's lies.  Notably, Yamazaki's eyes are almost never open, causing Meiling to hypothesize that he only opens his eyes when telling the truth, a hypothesis that is later proven false.\n\nWhile generally viewed as lighthearted and energetic, Yamazaki can also be sensitive and serious. In the last volume of the manga, when Sakura was down, he leaves the scene in order for Chiharu to talk to Sakura. Chiharu adds that he understands that Sakura needs her guidance and counseling, which is why he left so they could talk rather than stay to tell stories.\n\nYamazaki is named after film director, [[Takashi Yamazaki (film director)|Takashi Yamazaki]], who is a friend of CLAMP.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  He is known as '''Zachary Marker''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'' and his relationship with Chiharu is written so that they are cousins and her acts of strangling are the result of [[sibling rivalry]].  Yamazaki also makes an appearance in Clamp's manga series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' in Piffle Country as an announcer, where he retains his tendency to fabricate elaborate stories.\n\nIn the Japanese version, he is voiced by [[Issei Miyazaki]]. He is voiced by Philip Pacaud in the English ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Joshua Seth]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Takashi is voiced by Alejandro Saab.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Chiharu Mihara===\n{{nihongo|'''Chiharu Mihara'''|\u4e09\u539f \u5343\u6625|Mihara Chiharu}} is one of Sakura Kinomoto's friends and classmates in school.  Along with Rika Sasaki and Naoko Yanagisawa, Chiharu often appears alongside Sakura at school and during school events. She is also on the school's cheerleading squad with Sakura.  Chiharu's most notable trait is her relationship with Takashi Yamazaki, whom she has known since kindergarten.<ref>\"Sakura's Scary Test of Courage\" (Episode 17). ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. 1998. CLAMP, NHK.</ref>  She is never fooled by his rampant storytelling and is usually driven silence him by comically strangling him, which usually does not prevent him from continuing. Despite the rough-handling, she and Yamazaki actually share a close relationship and it is implied that they care for one another in a more affectionate manner. In the last volume of the series, Chiharu speaks openly about her relationship with Yamazaki when Sakura turns to her for advice on love and true feelings as Sakura reflects on her own relationship with Syaoran.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, she is known as '''Chelsea''' and Yamazaki is written as her cousin to justify the random acts of strangling as sibling rivalry.\n\nIn the Japanese version, she is voiced by [[Miwa Matsumoto]]. She is voiced by [[Jocelyne Loewen]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Jill Harris.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Naoko Yanagisawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Naoko Yanagisawa'''|\u67f3\u6ca2 \u5948\u7dd2\u5b50|Yanagisawa Naoko}} is one of Sakura Kinomoto's classmates and friends in school and often appears at school events with Sakura's other friends, Chiharu and Rika.  Despite being bad at gymnastics, she is also a member of the school's cheerleading squad alongside Sakura.\n\nNaoko loves reading various types of stories, especially fantasy stories and ghost stories. While Sakura reacts to scary situations with utmost fear, Naoko reacts with fascination and a brave willingness to explore these mysterious situations further.  In the anime, Naoko's love of stories causes trouble when she finds ''The Create'' card in the form of a notebook and writes a fantastic story within it, forcing Sakura to defeat Naoko's creations before recovering ''The Create''.  When Naoko wakes up the next morning to find her book suddenly missing, she believes she just had a supernatural experience.\n\nShe is known as '''Nikki''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors''. She is voiced by [[Emi Motoi]] in the Japanese anime, [[Kelly Sheridan]] in ''Cardcaptors'', and by [[Sherry Lynn]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Naoko is voiced by Dani Chambers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Masaki Amamiya===\n{{nihongo|'''Masaki Amamiya'''|\u96e8\u5bae \u771f\u5b09|Amamiya Masaki}} is the great-grandfather of Sakura Kinomoto, Toya Kinomoto and Tomoyo Daidouji on her mother's side. Initially objecting to Nadeshiko's marriage to Fujitaka Kinomoto, he became more accepting upon meeting Sakura and later receiving a gift from her as a form of peace between family members. In the episode, ''Sakura and the Rainbow of Memories'', Sakura doesn't know who he was and they spent a good time together, playing tennis, having tea, Sakura giving him cookies and Masaki giving Sakura the dress her mother wore. Just before leaving, Sakura used the Rain card to make a rainbow for Masaki, prompting him to remember when Nadeshiko had first pointed out a rainbow to him. Sakura discovers the present Masaki left her was the dress she wore at his summer house, although she does not seem to realizes who he actually is despite Cerberus pointing out its origins.\n\nMasaki later appears in ''Clear Card'', inviting Sakura and Syaoran for another visit to his summer house. In the occasion, he presents Sakura with a mysterious key that once belonged to her mother, and later states that he intends is to have Sakura inherit the summer house itself after he passes away.\n\nIn the anime series, Masaki is voiced by [[Osamu Saka]]. In the English dub, '''Mr. Avalon''' was portrayed instead as the father of Natasha Avalon, making him the grandfather of Sakura instead of her great-grandfather. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Masaki is voiced by Charlie Campbell.\n\n===Kaho Mizuki===\n{{nihongo|'''Kaho Mizuki'''|\u89b3\u6708 \u6b4c\u5e06|Mizuki Kaho}} is a [[miko|shrine maiden]] and the daughter of the priest at the Tsukimine Shrine. She first appears in the series as a new substitute teacher at Tomoeda Elementary School for the math class of [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]. While Sakura instantly [[Puppy love|crushes]] on the female teacher and feels a connection with her, Syaoran is distrustful and believes she is up to no good.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nWhen Sakura, Syaoran, Meiling and Tomoyo are trapped by the Maze card, Kaho uses a mysterious bell to break through Maze's walls allowing Sakura to capture it. After this incident, the readers learn that Sakura's older brother Toya dated Kaho when she was his junior high school teacher and that they broke up when Kaho left to study in England. Before she left, she told them that when they met again, they would be in love with different people which he acknowledges is now true.\n\nAfter meeting her, [[#Cerberus|Cerberus]] incorrectly believes that Kaho is the false form of his fellow guardian [[#Yue|Yue]], which is later shown to actually be [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]]. Kaho's role is to use the bell left at her family's shrine to give Sakura another chance when she is unable to defeat Yue out of fear of hurting him. The bell changes Sakura's staff into a new staff containing her own power of the stars and gives her the power to use the cards to defeat Yue. After fulfilling this duty, she returns to England. During the third season of the series, she is primarily \"seen\" through providing a steady, but oftentimes enigmatic exchange of letters with Sakura over the mysterious attacks. After [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] reveals the truth behind the attacks, they learn that Kaho had met Eriol three years before Sakura discovered the Book of the Clow. As they leave for England, Kaho and Eriol confirm their feelings for one another and vow to remain together. She is later seen beside Eriol on a few occasions in both the second movie and the ''Clear Card'' arc.\n\nIn the anime series, Kaho is voiced by [[Emi Shinohara]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', her name is changed to '''Layla MacKenzie''' and she is voiced by [[Linda Rae Jurgens]]. She is voiced by [[Philece Sampler]] in the English adaptation of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Kaho is voiced by [[Morgan Garrett]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Eriol Hiragizawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Eriol Hiragizawa'''|\u67ca\u6ca2 \u30a8\u30ea\u30aa\u30eb|H\u012bragizawa Erioru}} is the principal antagonist in the second half of the series, commonly called the ''Master of the Clow'' arc. The reincarnation of [[Clow Reed]], Eriol has both Clow's memories and all of his magic power. He has a magical staff similar to Clow Reed's, can restrain Clow's creations Yue and Cerberus, and has created his own similar pair of guardians: [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]] and [[#Spinel Sun|Spinel Sun]]. He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after [[Sakura Kinomoto]] passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate [[#Takashi Yamazaki|Takashi Yamazaki]] in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran Li is suspicious of him, mainly due to that Eriol is overly nice to Sakura which makes Syaoran jealous. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow's, and Eriol must erase Yue's memories of encountering him after he is accidentally seen by him.\n\nEriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura's brother to \"feed\" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying.\n\nSakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are forcing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her. He puts the city to sleep and challenges Sakura to convert the last two cards, the Dark and the Light, which must be changed together. After Sakura successfully does so, he then tells her that she is now more powerful than Clow Reed and asks her to perform one final task for him: to divide his own magical power between himself and her father [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka]]\u2014the other reincarnation of Clow Reed\u2014so that Eriol will no longer be the most powerful magician in the world. He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo, Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have been dangerous for Sakura.\n\nEriol's true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with [[#Kaho Mizuki|Kaho Mizuki]], whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc. At the end of the manga series, she returns with him to England, and in the second anime movie, they are shown together when Sakura calls for advice, though their love is never confessed like in the manga, only hinted at indirectly. In the ''Clear Card'' arc. Eriol ceases all contact with Sakura after the Sakura cards turn blank, but keeps in touch with Syaoran who informs him about everything that happens around her. While questioned about his reasons, Eriol claims that he is waiting for the right time to interfere, and thus forbids both Syaoran and his companions in England from taking action until then.\n\nIn the anime series, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, with all of the elements from the manga regarding Fujitaka's relation to Clow and inheriting of half of his powers removed. The final explanation at Eriol's house is also shifted slightly so it takes place the day after the final battle, rather than immediately after, and it is done because Sakura seeks him out rather than him giving an invitation.\n\nThe character of Eriol is voiced by [[Nozomu Sasaki]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, his name is changed to '''Eli Moon''' and he is voiced by [[Bill Switzer]]. In the English dub of the second film, his voice is supplied by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Eriol is voiced by [[Micah Solusod]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Spinel Sun===\n{{nihongo|'''Spinel Sun'''|\u30b9\u30d4\u30cd\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30f3|Supineru San}} is the cat-like magical guardian created by Eriol Hiiragizawa. The counterpart to Clow Reed's original guardian Kerberus. Spinel Sun's true form is a [[butterfly]]-winged [[black panther]] with cat-like ears and ruffs of fur on the side of his head, while his false form is similar to a small [[winged cat]] with the same wing type as his true form. Nicknamed Suppi by [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]], Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form (though this encounter is exclusive to the anime). Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn't suspect anything and instead declares Spinel Sun a monster and feeds him sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn him into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle where the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however Cerberus' greater determination to protect Sakura enables him to defeat him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] in his true form, and by [[Yumi T\u014dma]] in his false form. In the second ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' movie, his false form briefly appears and is voiced by [[Philece Sampler]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', his name is changed to '''Spinner Sun''' and both forms are voiced by Colin Murdock. In the ''Clear Card'' arc, Spinel's false form is voiced by [[Apphia Yu]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Ruby Moon===\n{{nihongo|'''Ruby Moon'''|\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30fb\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3|Rub\u012b M\u016bn}} is one of two magical guardians created by [[Eriol Hiiragizawa]]. The counterpart to the original guardian Yue. When Eriol transfers to Tomoeda Elementary, Ruby Moon created a false form named {{nihongo|'''Nakuru Akizuki'''|\u79cb\u6708 \u5948\u4e45\u7559|''Akizuki Nakuru''}} and enrolls in Seijou High School, entering the same class as [[#Toya Kinomoto|Toya Kinomoto]], Sakura's brother, and [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]], the false form of Yue who is unaware of his true nature. Her true form resembles a human-sized [[fairy]] that performs ruby-based attacks. Ruby Moon is [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] and has no biological sex, but prefers feminine pronouns; her \"human sex\" is unspecified, though Akizuki has stated a preference for women's clothing and enjoys \"[[Kawaii|being cute]]\".\n\nUnlike the Yue/Yukito relationship, both Ruby/Nakuru forms are fully aware and display no [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]. As the alias, Nakuru Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Toya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter's dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Toya's energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn't simply steal it. When Toya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue's life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to Yue's greater determination and desire to protect Sakura.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Ruby Moon is voiced by [[Ry\u014dka Yuzuki]]. In the English adaptation, ''Cardcaptors'', both her true form and false form is called '''Ruby Moon''' and she is voiced by [[Willow Johnson]].

She is a young girl who bears a strong resemblance to Sakura, being around the same age and height. Akiho is rarely seen without her stuffed rabbit Momo, which she has owned since she was a small child.\n\nAkiho makes her first appearance in chapter 7 of the ''Clear Card'' arc as a transfer student in Sakura and Tomoyo's class. Akiho used to live in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[England]], and [[Hong Kong]] before moving to Japan, and is initially shy around her classmates due to her nervousness about speaking Japanese. Akiho is gifted at singing and, with Tomoyo and Sakura's encouragement, joins the school choir club.\n\nAkiho lives with her caretaker Yuna D. Kaito in Eriol's old house. She tells Sakura that Yuna has cared for her since she was very young, and suggests that she is distant from her blood relatives. Many of Akiho's relatives are avid [[Bibliophilia|book collectors]] who travel the world in search of rare books. Akiho's family installed its massive library of books in her house, among them one of her most prized possessions, a novel titled \"Alice in Clockland\" written in a foreign script only she can read. Akiho states that she has moved from country to country for most of her life in search of a particular book. When it became apparent that for some unknown reason Akiho and Sakura have shared dreams, it was revealed that Akiho not only possesses strong magic abilities, she is also the figure in the robe that continuously confronted Sakura in her dreams, although Akiho herself doesn't know that, however as Sakura and Akiho continue to enter the same dream, Akiho develops a knowledge of why she is present in those dreams: the mysterious person she is watching has something she wants.\n\nLater is revealed that Akiho is part of the \"D\" magician clan, but despite having born from the two most powerful magicians of the clan at the time, she has no magic power at all, thus the clan decides to use her to create the ultimate magic tool by implanting all kinds of spells inside her body, despite knowing that it would destroy her soul, until Kaito takes her with him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Akiho Shinomoto is voiced by [[Minori Suzuki]] in Japanese and [[AmaLee|Amanda Lee]] in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yuna D.

He has served as Akiho Shinomoto's legal guardian and caretaker since she was young. Yuna is a tall, dark-haired young man who appears dressed in full formal uniform, including an unusual pocket watch which he holds dear. He is professional and polite in his interactions with others, and is skilled at various domestic tasks including baking and sewing.\n\nSyaoran senses that Yuna possesses strong [[moon magic]], and Eriol confirms that the \"D.\" in Yuna's name is a title from a notorious English wizarding society. Yuna appears to be aware of both the existence of the Clear Cards and the fact that Sakura is a magician.  Thus-far, it has been hinted that he's after the Clear Cards as a means of powering a certain spell, possibly connected to a magical object, a magical time-controlling pocket watch (mentioned above), which he had stolen from the society of sorcerers he was formally-apart of, and that he's using both Sakura and Akiho to get them (having some-how created a connection between then before they had even met, which is evident by them sharing the same reoccurring dreams but are completely oblivious that they have been seeing one another), but that the ones that Sakura has created so far are not yet enough for his purpose to activate that certain spell of the ancient, forbidden relic that he had taken from the magic association from which he was excommunicated. As such, he turns back time but is certain that Sakura may gradually recall what had occurred between her and the cloaked figure, finally uncovering its identity as her good friend Akiho.\n\nIn the incomplete anime adaptation, Yuna D. Kaito is voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] and Brandon McInnis in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Momo===\n{{nihongo|'''Momo'''|\u30e2\u30e2|}} first appears in ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]]''. Momo appears to be a stuffed toy animal in the form of a white rabbit with light blue scarf around her neck and ears which Akiho Shinomoto usually carries around on her bag as a plushie of sorts. However she was eventually revealed to be actually a magical creature much like Kero and Spinel, but while Akiho is unaware of this, Yuna is the only one who has been seen to communicate with Momo as of yet. Both of them are of the consensus that they need to watch over Akiho.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Momo is voiced by [[Minako Kotobuki]] and [[Jad Saxton]] in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Recurring characters in the anime==\nThese characters only appears in the animated films and television series adaptations.\nThese are character that appears only in the anime adaptation of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''.\n\n===Wang Wei===\n{{nihongo|'''Wang Wei'''|\u5049\u671b|W\u011biw\u00e0ng}} is a character that appears only in the ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' anime adaptation.

Dubbed the Cardcaptor by the cards' guardian Cerberus (better known as Kero-chan), Sakura must wield the Clow Staff to capture the card spirits and turn them back into cards for her use. Sakura is aided by her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, who creates battle costumes for her as well as videotaping her ventures as Cardcaptor; and later by Syaoran Li, a Chinese boy who is a direct descendant of the Clow Cards' creator Clow Reed. The anime also introduced a fourth companion, Meiling Li, Syaoran's cousin. The rest of the characters are mostly oblivious to Sakura's magical life, aside from her brother Toya who has his own magical powers, and later Eriol Hiiragizawa, who is a reincarnated Clow Reed.\n\nThe anime was dubbed into English by [[Nelvana]] under the title of ''Cardcaptors'', with most of the character names changed to English ones with the exception of Sakura (repronounced as \"Sa-KU-ra\" instead of \"SA-ku-ra\" though), Meiling (slightly reduced in spelling as \"Meilin\"), Cerberus (repronounced as \"Keroberos\" based on the Japanese pronunciation of his name, and his nickname \"Kero\" was repronounced as \"kir\u014d\" instead of \"ker\u014d\"), Mr. Terada, Wang Wei, Ruby Moon, Yue, and Clow Reed (\"Clow\" was repronounced as \"klau\u0307\" instead of \"kl\u014d\").\n\nA large number of the characters reappear as alternate selves in Clamp's other series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Main characters==\n<!-- http://ccsakura-official.com/intro/index2.html   for who are credited as main, listed generally in order of appearance -->\n\n===Sakura Kinomoto===\n{{main|Sakura Kinomoto}}\n{{nihongo|'''Sakura Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u3055\u304f\u3089|Kinomoto Sakura}} is the titular heroine of ''Cardcaptor Sakura,'' named after the Japanese word for \"[[cherry blossom]]\". Her most defining character traits are her unyielding determination, caring nature and loyalty to her friends. Sakura is portrayed as a perceptively sweet, extremely energetic and cheerful character who is well-loved, pretty, cheerful, cute and at times a na\u00efve, clumsy, and clueless. Sakura is athletically gifted and skilled in sports at school, being  an excellent runner and called the \"best baton twirler in school\" by her friends.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 1 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book''</ref> She hates math and is openly [[phasmophobia|phasmophobic]]. She has a big brother that is a [[wikt:babe magnet|chick magnet]]. Sakura maintains a crush on Yukito Tsukishiro for most of the manga and anime, but when she finally confesses to Yukito, she is gently rejected and she realizes that she loved him because of his resemblance to her father. Eventually, Sakura realizes she is actually in love with Syaoran, but doesn't realize her feelings until he first confesses his love for her. Although she fails to admit her feelings in the final episode, Sakura later manages to finally confess her love to Syaoran when he and Meiling return to visit in the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]''. However, in the Nelvana dub, they never develop their romance as it was heavily edited out.\n\nShe becomes the entitled Cardcaptor by guardian beast Cerberus after accidentally opening and releasing the Clow Cards from the Clow Book. Aided by Cerberus, her best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidouji, and later Syaoran, Sakura successfully captures all the cards and is named the new Clow Mistress by the cards' second guardian Yue (Yukito's true form).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 46 ''Sakura and the Final Judgment''</ref> In the second half of the manga and anime, Sakura must use the power of her own star to transform the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, or else the cards would lose their powers. In the beginning of the ''Clear Card'' arc, all the Sakura cards suddenly turn blank, losing their powers and while looking for a way to restore them, Sakura must capture new cards of an unknown origin that started appearing around town. She later learns that Syaoran was responsible for the Sakura cards' disappearance in a move to protect her, as her own power had grown too strong for her to control, leading to the creation of the Clear cards.\n\nFor all Japanese-language productions of the anime (including movies, audio CDs, and video games), Sakura is voiced by [[Sakura Tange]]. In the Nelvana dub ''Cardcaptors'', she is known as '''Sakura Avalon''', her initial romantic feelings for Yukito are removed, and is voiced by [[Carly McKillip]].

However, she is depicted as being emotionally matured, hard-working, highly motivated, compassionate, intelligent, meticulous; giving her a unique air of cultured politeness and refinement amongst the cast. She regularly speaks using more formal verb [[Japanese language|conjugations]] and expressions than normally seen in elementary students. She is artistically gifted, having displayed talents as an amateur fashion designer, beautician, cinematographer, seamstress, choreographer and vocalist. Tomoyo is shown announcing, performing, or costume designing in various school events; in the anime, her musical ability causes her to be targeted by both the Voice and Song cards. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable perceptiveness, cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card|The Sealed Card]]'' film.\n\nBecause Tomoyo lacks magical powers and athletic abilities, Sakura takes on a protective responsibility most times when capturing or transforming cards. If Tomoyo is ever in danger (or missing), Sakura will be the one concerned for her most, and her focus changes from that of the Card at hand to Tomoyo's safety. Fortunately, Sakura has always succeeded and hugs Tomoyo warmly whenever she reunites with her.\n\nTomoyo is notable for her crafty streak and obsession of documenting every single detail of Sakura's personal life on video as much as possible, much to Sakura's discomfort. When she learns of Sakura's new role as a Cardcaptor, she insists that Sakura must wear \"special outfits\", is responsible for choreographing Sakura's new action poses and begins providing Sakura with the various \"magical girl\" protective-costumes she wears during her captures, as well as accompanying her on magical (and non-magical) endeavors to record the events with her video camera. These \"art project\" seems to serve Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment than improving Sakura's performance. Tomoyo faithfully keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need.\n\nIn both the manga and anime adaptations, Tomoyo admits that she loves Sakura, but Sakura replies innocently, \"I love you, too,\" in the platonic sense. This is emphasized using manga conventions: Tomoyo declares her love against a background of flowers, while Sakura replies against a blank white background. In the manga, some scenes give the appearance that Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura's brother Toya; however, according to Volume 1 of ''Clamp No Kiseki: The Ultimate Collection'', and an interview in the ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', this was an error caused by one of the finishing artists not being aware that CLAMP intended for Tomoyo to have romantic feelings for Sakura.<ref name=\"hawt\">interview printed in ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', published by Nakayoshi.</ref> Instead, she encourages Sakura's love of Yukito, and later becomes Syaoran's confidante and [[Wingman (social)|wingman]] when he begins to fall in love with Sakura.\n\nCLAMP stated that the reason that Sakura does not return her friend Tomoyo's feelings is not because Tomoyo is another girl, as Sakura does not consider sex or gender as barrier for her romantic attraction. She simply doesn't have romantic feelings for Tomoyo in particular.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Demonstrating this, Sakura confesses that she has a crush on a female teacher in the series.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nIn the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', Tomoyo's name is changed to '''Madison Taylor''', and her elegant speech was replaced with [[valley girl]] speech. J.D. Considine of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated:\n<blockquote>''\"A United States audience would have a hard enough time accepting the deference and politeness of Sakura's best friend, Tomoyo, as merely a sign of good breeding. But her intense devotion to Sakura -- sewing elaborate costumes for each Clow Card chase, documenting Sakura's successes on video, assuring Sakura that she \"really likes\" her -- verges on the creepy. No wonder the American version simply paints Madison (the Tomoyo character) as a video obsessive who sees Sakura's adventures as mere camera fodder.\"''<ref name=\"Considine\">Considine, J.D. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/television-radio-making-anime-a-little-safer-for-americans.html TELEVISION/RADIO; Making Anime A Little Safer For Americans].\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In ''Cardcaptors'', she is voiced by [[Maggie Blue O'Hara]]. In the English dub of ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]'', her voice is supplied by [[Michelle Ruff]].

His birthday is February 29. Though he teases her frequently, he cares a great deal for her and works to protect her. He is fully aware of what she is doing as a Cardcaptor, and regularly takes on several part-time jobs that put him in a position to be nearby when she is working on capturing a card. He disliked Syaoran and often holds a grudge against him but deep down he thought to himself that if there was someone Sakura should be with it would be Syaoran. Touya possesses several magical powers, including the ability to see ghosts and other non-humans, the ability to sense when Sakura is in danger, and mild [[precognition]]. He has an extremely close relationship with his best friend [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito]], despite knowing he is the alter-ego of Yue. To save both Yukito and Yue, Touya becomes a normal human being after he gives all of his magical powers to Yue, making him promise to protect Sakura in his stead as well as himself (and, by extension, Yukito).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 65 ''Sakura, Yukito, and the Vanishing Power''</ref> However, it has been revealed in the last chapter of Clear Card Arc that he is gradually regaining his magic and seems to be developing new and greater abilities that he shall reveal until the time is right. \n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Touya is voiced by [[Tomokazu Seki]]. In the English manga his name is spelled \"Toya\". In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Darren Pleavin. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'' his name is changed to '''Tori Avalon''', and he is voiced by [[Tony Sampson]]. In the English dub of the second film, [[Kirk Thornton]] takes over the voicing role. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Touya is voiced by [[Clifford Chapin]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yukito Tsukishiro / Yue {{anchor|Yukito Tsukishiro|Yue}} ===\nYue/Yukito are a [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]: Yukito is a \"false\" persona created to mask Yue's \"true\" identity. For most of the series, Yue remained in a \"[[Hibernation|state of hibernation]]\"; Yukito is unaware of Yue's existence, though he maintains an enormous appetite for food in an unconscious attempt to give Yue power. Yue's existence is revealed to the other characters after all of the Clow Cards are collected, and Toya states he knew of Yue's existence all along and was just waiting for Yukito to notice himself.\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yukito Tsukishiro'''|\u6708\u57ce \u96ea\u514e|Tsukishiro Yukito|nicknamed 'Yuki' by Toya, and 'Yuki-usagi' by Kerberus}} is the best friend of Sakura's older brother, Touya, and the human alter-ego of the Clow Card guardian, [[#Yue|Yue]]. Though he is certainly Yue's \"temporary form\", he is referenced several times by other characters (including Eriol and Yue himself) as being simultaneously a completely separate \"heart\" from Yue's \"true form\". As Yukito, he displays a kind and gentle nature, and at the start of the series, Sakura develops a strong [[limerence]] towards him. When she confessed her feelings, he gently rejects her, as the one he loves most is Touya.\n\n:Once Sakura collects all of the cards, Yue begins needing greater power as her magic isn't strong enough to sustain him. Subconsciously, Yukito begins eating even more to try to compensate, but it is not enough and he starts sleeping constantly, even while standing, and eventually finds his body fading away altogether. Once Touya gives his magical energy to Yue to sustain them, Yukito begins to grow aware of Yue's existence; the grandparents with whom Yukito thought he lived were a false memory and thus did not exist. It is suggested that he came into existence shortly before he met Touya, to be near the future new guardian of the Clow Cards. Eriol tells Yue that while he (and Clow) did know Sakura was predestined to be the future master of the cards, and had predicted that both Sakura and Yue would be [[Romance (love)|romantically involved]] with each other; however, Yukito had deviated from this prophetic vision by [[falling in love]] with Touya.\n\n:In the Japanese anime adaptation Yukito is voiced by [[Megumi Ogata]]. In ''Cardcaptors'', Yukito's name is changed to '''Julian Star''', his relationship with Touya is removed, and he is voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]]. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Steve Staley]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Yukito is voiced by [[Justin Briner]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yue'''|\u6708|extra=[[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Pinyin]]: ''Yu\u00e8''}} is the one of two Guardians of the Clow Cards, along with Cerberus. His name, which is written in ''[[kanji]]'' rather than ''[[hiragana]]'' is the [[Mandarin Chinese]] word for \"moon\". Whereas Cerberus is the elector of the new Clow Card Master, Yue is the judge who is allowed to test the candidate for their worthiness. He spends most of the series in his temporary form, [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]], who initially has no memory or knowledge of his other self. Unlike Cerberus, Yue's powers are heavily dependent on the power of his master. Sakura's power is not yet strong enough to sustain him after he awakens, particularly after she begins transforming the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards. Yue's growing need for power is reflected in Yukito's ravenous appetite and later constant sleeping. Similarly, the deficit affects Yue himself in instances such as the blatant failure of his magic which causes he and Sakura to fall out of the sky during one of Eriol's synthesized 'situations'. Eventually, Sakura's brother Toya reveals that he knows Yue and Yukito are not human and gives his power to Yue to sustain his existence so he does not lose Yukito.\n\n:As with [[Ruby Moon]], Yue's \"true form\" has no biological sex or gender; though not \"human or male\", Yue has the appearance of a [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] beautiful \"angelic-[[bish\u014dnen]]\" young man (male pronouns used) with long, silver, braided hair, silver-purple feline eyes, and a pair of white angel wings which he uses for flight. Yue sports a white suit and spats-like coverings on his feet. His personality is depicted as serious and aloof in contrast to Yukito's, and while Yukito is fond of Sakura, Yue is reluctant to accept her. As the series progress, he comes to respond to Sakura's request that rather than being his master, she just wants to be his friend. Yue has jurisdiction over the elements wind and water, though he is stated by Cerberus to have control over other cards, including the Wood, Time and Dark.\n\n:{{anime voices2|Yue|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]|type=tv}} In the English dub of the second anime film, his voice is provided by [[Steve Staley]].

As such, he initially rivals against Sakura because he believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards and tries to capture the cards for himself. As the series progresses, however, Syaoran comes to respect Sakura and becomes her friend and ally. He eventually falls in love with her, though she is slow to realize it due to her own feelings for Yukito.\n\nOriginally, Syaoran appeared [[Infatuation|smitten]] with Yukito, but later revealed that the attraction was due to high moon power inside of Yukito. Eventually, in the beginning of the third season, Syaoran finally begins to realize he has deeply fallen in love with Sakura, as he constantly blushes whenever he is around her.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 47 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Transfer Student''</ref> In the manga, Syaoran begins to develop feelings for Sakura around the time of the Erase Card's capture. Once Syaoran realizes his feelings, he tries to admit his love for Sakura several times, but is both too nervous to confess his feelings while also being constantly interrupted. Syaoran also becomes extremely jealous whenever he sees Sakura spending time with Eriol, believing he harbours romantic feelings for Sakura and considers him a rival. Syaoran's love for Sakura is proven to be really strong as he thinks strongly of her well being and needs before his own as shown when after Yukito rejects Sakura's feelings, Syaoran comforts her even though Sakura is still unaware about his own romantic feelings towards her. Nearing the end of the series, Syaoran finally confesses his feelings to Sakura, but decides to return to [[Hong Kong]], since Sakura has now become the new master of the cards.\n\nIn the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]'', he and Meiling return from Hong Kong a few months later to visit. Throughout the movie, Syaoran waits for Sakura to reply to his confession, but as Sakura constantly keeps trying to tell him how she feels, they are repeatedly interrupted. Syaoran and Sakura work together to defeat the Nothing Card that has been secretly stealing the Sakura cards while making parts of Tomoeda disappear. Eventually at the end of the movie, they manage to defeat the Nothing Card, which becomes the Hope Card and Sakura finally confesses her love for Syaoran and jumps into his arms.\n\nTwo years later, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda and enrolls at the same middle school as Sakura and most of her friends. However, his true objective is to watch over Sakura and help her with the mystery surrounding the Clear Cards. He also keeps contact with Eriol, who instructs him to not interfere until the time is right. Later he reveals to Sakura that he was the one who took away the spirits contained within the Sakura Cards in order to protect herself from her own power, which is growing out of control, thus leading to the creation of the Clear Cards. Despite intending to reveal all the truth to Sakura, Syaoran becomes unable to tell her anything about Akiho or Kaito's involvement due to a spell Kaito placed on him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Syaoran manages to catch several cards by playing a major role in helping Sakura seal them. He is allowed to attempt the final judgment but fails. Syaoran is shown to have similar powers to Sakura, such as sensing Clow Cards and magical auras, is a skilled martial artist, and wields a sword which he can use to cast spells when equipped with incantation papers. He can also use a device dubbed a \"[[wiktionary:\u7f85\u91dd\u76e4|lasenboard]]\" in ''Cardcaptors'',<ref>''Cardcaptors'', Episode 9 ''The Rival''</ref> which can detect and direct him to magical entities. A running gag is Kero calling him \"kid\". In the Dub as well for Sakura, Syaoran never told his feelings towards Sakura as he did in episode 69, one episode before the finale.\n\nIn the English ''Cardcaptors'' adaptation, he is renamed '''Li Showron''' and he is introduced in the first episode, as the male lead. He is also called a \"Cardcaptor\".\n\nIn Japanese media, Syaoran is voiced by [[Motoko Kumai]]. Syaoran is voiced by [[Rhys Huber]] during the Clow Cards arc and the first movie, Jordan Kilik in the Sakura Cards arc, and [[Mona Marshall]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Jason Liebrecht]], who reprised his role as Syaoran from ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Meiling Li===\n'''Meiling Li''' (\u674e\u8393\u9234 ''L\u01d0 M\u00e9il\u00edng'', \u30ea\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ea\u30f3 ''Ri Meirin'', Cantonese Jyutping: ''lei5 mui4 ling4''), is [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]'s cousin and fianc\u00e9e, and only appears in the anime adaptation of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Introduced towards the end of episode 19, she is a very impulsive, bratty, straightforward, clingy, and overconfident girl. As children living in Hong Kong, Meiling and Syaoran trained in martial arts under the tutelage of Wang Wei. One night her pet bird escaped from its cage, and the normally quiet and withdrawn Syaoran told her not to cry, then left. After spending hours in the rain, he returned with the bird and Meiling was both grateful and touched. From that day, she devoted herself to him, eventually declaring that she liked Syaoran above all others and, reasoning that he liked her as well, she declared them to be engaged, much to Syaoran's chagrin. At the same time, she promised that if he found someone he liked more than her, he would tell her and she would release him from the promise.<ref>Ep 43<!-- proper ref later --></ref>\n\nIn coming to Tokyo, Meiling intends to help Syaoran find and gather the Clow Cards, and actively dislikes Sakura. As the series progresses, Meiling develops a grudging respect for Sakura that turns into a good friendship by the time Meiling returns to Hong Kong in episode 43 by her mother due to unknown reasons. During her initial visit, Meiling seemed to recognize that Syaoran was falling in love with Sakura, but it wasn't until she briefly returned in episode 60 that she acknowledges and accepts Sakura  as the person Syaoran loves. Wanting to keep her promise, Syaoran attempts to tell her that he loves Sakura, but Meiling interrupts and tells him that she knows because he is now calling Sakura by her first name, something he only does for his sisters and her. She releases Syaoran from their promise, then quickly leaves. Meiling spends the night at [[#Tomoyo Daid\u014dji|Tomoyo Daid\u014dji]]'s house and releases all of her frustration by crying without burdening Syaoran. At the end of the episode, Meiling returns home and is not seen again in the main series. She returns in the second movie, with Syaoran, to see her old friends, but secretly came back to help Sakura finally confess her love to Syaoran. Meiling also occasionally appears in the anime adaptation of ''Clear Card'', talking to Sakura on phone and giving her hints at developing her relationship with Syaoran. A running gag is Kero calling her \"brat\".\n\nAlong with her temporary stay in Tomoeda, Meiling also plays a limited and insignificant role in the story because, unlike Syaoran, she has no magical abilities, relying solely on her physical fighting abilities and a healthy dose of pride. Her lack of powers and tendency to leap before thinking, however, results in her hindering more than helping Syaoran in most battles against the cards. She challenges The Fight card in episode 20, and was nearly badly wounded and had to be rescued by Syaoran. Recognizing that she was being a burden, Meiling grew upset and lashed out at Syaoran. However, she was then able to be an aid to him while fighting The Twin card, as their years of practicing martial arts together enables them to match the card's synchronized fighting style.<!-- ep 43 -->\n\nIn ''Clear Card'' episode 13, Meiling matured and is much less of a brat than she used to be. Even Sakura is amazed to see Meiling speak so politely to Fujitaka, to which Meiling responds, \u201cIt\u2019s just good manners,\u201d as if that's how she's always been.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/04/23/meiling-is-the-most-delightful-surprise-in-cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card|title=Meiling is the Most Delightful Surprise in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMeiling sports an [[Odango (hairstyle)|odango hairstyle]] on every episode that she is in.\n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Meiling is voiced by [[Yukana|Yukana Nogami]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', she is known as '''Meilin Rae''' and is voiced by [[Nicole Oliver]]. Her unrequited engagement with Syaoran was omitted along with the fact that she and Syaoran were cousins. Rather she is portrayed as a long time friend of Syaoran and her romantic feelings toward him were watered down but still evident. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by [[Julie Maddalena]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Trina Nishimura]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Recurring characters in the manga==\n===Clow Reed===\n{{nihongo|'''Clow Reed'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30a6\u30fb\u30ea\u30fc\u30c9|Kur\u014d R\u012bdo}} is the sorcerer who originally created the Clow Cards, and their magical guardians [[#Cerberus|Cerberus]] and [[#Yue|Yue]]. Along with Kohaku of ''[[Wish (manga)|Wish]],'' and Yuuko of ''[[xxxHolic]],'' he is one of the few Clamp-created characters to appear in more than one work.\n\nBorn of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications. However, few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], as he has long been dead before the series starts. Few details are revealed about his character, personality, or life, though multiple characters comment on his eccentricity. He displays a gentle and affable personality in his interactions with his creations.\n\nWhen Clow knew he was about to die, he chose his then-unborn descendant [[Sakura Kinomoto]] to become the new guardian of the cards and the new master of Yue and Cerberus. Clow's magical ability allowed him to foresee most of the future and plan many of the situations that would enable Sakura to succeed in taking full possession of the Clow Cards. Likewise, he deliberately made the sealing wand pink, reflecting that its future user would be a young girl.<!-- Ep 46 of anime; vol 6 manga --> He also split his soul into two reincarnations: [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] who had all of his memories and magic, and [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka Kinomoto]], Sakura's father. In the anime adaptation, Clow does not split his soul, instead passing on his memories, soul, and powers to Eriol exclusively. Syaoran Li is also an indirect descendant of Clow's Chinese lineage.\n\nIn the anime adaptation and the film, he is voiced by [[Kazuo Hayashi]]. In the English adaptation, ''Cardcaptors'', he is voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]. Clow Reed also appears in two additional CLAMP works, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', where he has another descendant named [[Fei-Wang Reed]] and worked with the Dimensional Witch [[Y\u016bko Ichihara]] in arranging the series of events in the former series.\n\n===Fujitaka Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Fujitaka Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u85e4\u9686|Kinomoto Fujitaka}} is the father of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and her brother Touya Kinomoto. A busy professor of [[archaeology]] at Towa University, Fujitaka is a kind and caring father. He met his late wife [[#Nadeshiko Kinomoto|Nadeshiko]] while doing his first year as a teacher at her high school. Nadeshiko had climbed a tree to return a baby bird to its nest, but fell out of the tree, landing on Fujitaka. Upon seeing her, he stated that \"an angel has fallen from the sky.\" They fell in love and married when she was sixteen. Though Nadeshiko died seven years before the start of the series, Fujitaka is shown to still be very much in love with her and devoted to her memory. He keeps a picture of her in the dining room, changing it each morning.\n\nLittle is initially said about Fujitaka's family or past. During the second half of the series, it is revealed that when Clow Reed divided his soul (seeking to no longer be the most powerful magician in the world), he split it into two halves. One of these halves became [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]], holding all of Clow's magic and memories, and the other being Fujitaka, who has no magic of his own, but fathered the one who would inherit the cards. It is stated that Fujitaka has no magical powers of his own, but he is also unaffected by other Clow's magic, such as the Eriol's sleep spell. At the end of the series, Eriol gives half of his magic to Fujitaka. This enables Fujitaka to finally see the spirit of Nadeshiko, who has been watching over her family since her death.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Fujitaka's role as the other half of Clow Reed's reincarnation is completely removed as is his immunity to Eriol's magic and he is never able to see Nadeshiko's spirit. He is voiced by [[Hideyuki Tanaka]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, his name is changed to '''Aiden Avalon''' and he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Scott Evans. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Michael McConnohie]].

She is rarely seen in the series, but is said to be a wealthy woman and the President of a large toy corporation. She greatly loved her cousin Nadeshiko, and disapproved of her marriage to Fujitaka, later blaming Fujitaka for Nadeshiko's death at a young age. During the marriage, it is implied that Nadeshiko was at least partially cut off from her family. Sonomi maintains a [[pixie cut]], a hairstyle Nadeshiko loved giving her when they were kids; and has Tomoyo keep her hair long because it reminds her of Nadeshiko.\n\nAfter meeting Sakura for the first time, Sonomi realizes that Nadeshiko had lived a happy life and is able to come to terms with the marriage. At times, she still treats Fujitaka as a \"rival\" competing to love Nadeshiko more, but she also helps him pass on gifts from Sakura to her grandfather and to arrange for Sakura to meet her great-grandfather while on a family vacation. Sonomi shows great affection for Sakura\u2013treating her like her own daughter\u2013and often clears her busy work schedule to join her and Tomoyo whenever Sakura comes over to visit.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, her name is changed to '''Samantha Taylor''' and her declaration of love for Nadeshiko is modified to a purely familiar love rather than a romantic love.\n\nSonomi is voiced by [[Miki It\u014d]] in anime series. She is voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub and by [[Wendee Lee]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Michelle Rojas]].\n\n===Nadeshiko Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Nadeshiko Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c [[wiktionary:\u64ab\u5b50|\u64ab\u5b50]]|Kinomoto Nadeshiko}} is Sakura and Toya's mother, Fujitaka's late wife, and the first cousin of [[#Sonomi Daidouji|Sonomi Daidouji]]. She worked as a model from her teens up until her death. She was sixteen when she met Fujitaka when he worked as a student teacher at her high school. She met Fujitaka when she climbed a tree to rescue a bird nest and accidentally fell, and landed on him as he saved her from getting hurt. He then remarked, \"l had thought an angel fell from the sky\". With those words, she fell in love with him. Soon after, against the wishes of her family, they got married despite their nine-year age gap (he was 25, she was 16). She died from an unnamed illness when Sakura was three. Because she was 27 when she died and Sakura was three and Toya was eight, it is likely that she gave birth to Toya at 19. Although she has died, she is still very much remembered and loved by her family; Fujitaka keeps her picture in the family room and Sakura never fails to greet her photo every morning. She appears occasionally as a spirit and is seen only by Toya, Eriol, and Sakura (beginning with volume 4 of the Clear Card arc).\n\nNadeshiko is voiced by [[Y\u016bko Minaguchi]] in the anime series.  In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaption, her name is changed to '''Natasha Avalon''' and she is voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Megan Shipman.\n\n===Yoshiyuki Terada===\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshiyuki Terada'''|\u5bfa\u7530 \u826f\u5e78|Terada Yoshiyuki}} is a [[teacher]] at Tomoeda Elementary School. During the series, as the main characters go through fourth grade, and enter the fifth grade, he acts as their home room teacher. He is also shown teaching in other classes, including the [[physical education]] classes, and he acts as the chaperon on several school field trips. As the series progresses, it is revealed that he is having a romantic relationship with his student [[#Rika Sasaki|Rika Sasaki]]. In the manga, they become engaged when he gives her a ring, noting that he hopes it will one day become her wedding ring. Rika gives him a teddy bear she made and named after herself, which legends says will allow them to remain in love forever. Towards the end of the series, when Sakura is unsure of her feelings about Syaoran, the couple is shown having a picnic at a park, with Terada slipping away so Sakura doesn't notice him. During the series, none of the other characters appear to know about the relationship, though when Rika is taken over by the Sword card, Sakura hears her call out \"Sensei\" (teacher) when she uses the Illusion card to show Rika her most beloved.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, their relationship is not shown in the same light. Their engagement and more romantic scenes between them are removed, and Rika notes that Terada reminds her of her absentee father. Terada is also shown accepting cakes made by Rika and in accepting the bear and naming it after his \"hardest working student.\" In the ''Cardcaptors'' English dub, he is simply called '''Mr. Terada''', and all aspects of the romantic relationship between Terada and Rika are completely removed, with Rika's shyness and reactions to him made to appear to be more of a general fear of men than romantic feelings.\n\nIn the anime series, he is voiced by [[T\u014dru Furusawa]] for the first season and first movie, and by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] for the second and third seasons and the second film. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. He is voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Zach Bolton]].\n\n===Rika Sasaki===\n{{nihongo|'''Rika Sasaki'''|\u4f50\u3005\u6728 \u5229\u4f73|Sasaki Rika}} is a classmate and friend of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]]. She is considered to be very elegant and mature for her age, though she can also be shy. During the series, she is also shown to be a skilled cook and very good at crafts. During the series, Rika is affected by the Clow Cards several times. Early in the series, she buys a brooch that is actually The Sword card. The card takes her over and causes her to attack Sakura. Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved (or greatest fear in the English dub), allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card.\n\nDuring the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher [[#Yoshiyuki Terada|Yoshiyuki Terada]]. In the manga series, they are engaged to be married when she is old enough, and they frequently spend time alone together on \"dates.\" In the anime adaptation, the engagement is removed as are many of their dates, however they are still shown to have affection for one another (it's implied that he reminds her of her father, who's oft busy on overseas business). Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. In both the manga and anime, when Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika's attacks induced by the Sword card, she calls the image \"Sensei\" which means \"teacher\" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look.\n\nAfter graduating from Elementary School, Rika is the only among Sakura's friends who enrolled in a different Junior High School, and thus is not seen with them in ''Clear Card'', although they usually keep in touch.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, Rika's name is changed to '''Rita''' and all hints of her relationship with Terada are removed. Instead of being a good student, she is depicted as having trouble with her school work and her blushing around Terada is explained away as being embarrassed at having to stay after school so often and that she is afraid of him.\n\nIn the original anime series, she is voiced by [[Tomoko Kawakami]]. In the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Saki Fujita]]. In the English dub of the second film, she is voiced by [[Dina Sherman|Stevie Bloch]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Alex Moore.\n\n===Takashi Yamazaki===\n{{nihongo|'''Takashi Yamazaki'''|\u5c71\u5d0e \u8cb4\u53f2|Yamazaki Takashi}} is a classmate and friend of Sakura Kinomoto and Syaoran Li. He is infamously known for fabricating highly detailed stories on the supposed history of practically any subject, usually whatever Sakura and her friends happening to be discussing.  Sakura and Syaoran are often gullible enough to believe the stories, which often provide an element of humour in the series.  His stories are primarily interrupted by Chiharu, who physically disciplines him by strangling him until he stops talking and will resort to dragging him away when she proves to be unsuccessful.  His storytelling is later supplemented by Eriol, who helps to reinforce the false validity of his stories and whose presence prevents Chiharu from stopping Yamazaki's lies.  Notably, Yamazaki's eyes are almost never open, causing Meiling to hypothesize that he only opens his eyes when telling the truth, a hypothesis that is later proven false.\n\nWhile generally viewed as lighthearted and energetic, Yamazaki can also be sensitive and serious. In the last volume of the manga, when Sakura was down, he leaves the scene in order for Chiharu to talk to Sakura. Chiharu adds that he understands that Sakura needs her guidance and counseling, which is why he left so they could talk rather than stay to tell stories.\n\nYamazaki is named after film director, [[Takashi Yamazaki (film director)|Takashi Yamazaki]], who is a friend of CLAMP.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  He is known as '''Zachary Marker''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'' and his relationship with Chiharu is written so that they are cousins and her acts of strangling are the result of [[sibling rivalry]].

He is voiced by Philip Pacaud in the English ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Joshua Seth]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Takashi is voiced by Alejandro Saab.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Chiharu Mihara===\n{{nihongo|'''Chiharu Mihara'''|\u4e09\u539f \u5343\u6625|Mihara Chiharu}} is one of Sakura Kinomoto's friends and classmates in school.  Along with Rika Sasaki and Naoko Yanagisawa, Chiharu often appears alongside Sakura at school and during school events. She is also on the school's cheerleading squad with Sakura.  Chiharu's most notable trait is her relationship with Takashi Yamazaki, whom she has known since kindergarten.<ref>\"Sakura's Scary Test of Courage\" (Episode 17). ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. 1998. CLAMP, NHK.</ref>  She is never fooled by his rampant storytelling and is usually driven silence him by comically strangling him, which usually does not prevent him from continuing. Despite the rough-handling, she and Yamazaki actually share a close relationship and it is implied that they care for one another in a more affectionate manner. In the last volume of the series, Chiharu speaks openly about her relationship with Yamazaki when Sakura turns to her for advice on love and true feelings as Sakura reflects on her own relationship with Syaoran.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, she is known as '''Chelsea''' and Yamazaki is written as her cousin to justify the random acts of strangling as sibling rivalry.\n\nIn the Japanese version, she is voiced by [[Miwa Matsumoto]]. She is voiced by [[Jocelyne Loewen]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] in the second movie.

Despite being bad at gymnastics, she is also a member of the school's cheerleading squad alongside Sakura.\n\nNaoko loves reading various types of stories, especially fantasy stories and ghost stories. While Sakura reacts to scary situations with utmost fear, Naoko reacts with fascination and a brave willingness to explore these mysterious situations further.  In the anime, Naoko's love of stories causes trouble when she finds ''The Create'' card in the form of a notebook and writes a fantastic story within it, forcing Sakura to defeat Naoko's creations before recovering ''The Create''.  When Naoko wakes up the next morning to find her book suddenly missing, she believes she just had a supernatural experience.\n\nShe is known as '''Nikki''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors''.

Initially objecting to Nadeshiko's marriage to Fujitaka Kinomoto, he became more accepting upon meeting Sakura and later receiving a gift from her as a form of peace between family members. In the episode, ''Sakura and the Rainbow of Memories'', Sakura doesn't know who he was and they spent a good time together, playing tennis, having tea, Sakura giving him cookies and Masaki giving Sakura the dress her mother wore. Just before leaving, Sakura used the Rain card to make a rainbow for Masaki, prompting him to remember when Nadeshiko had first pointed out a rainbow to him. Sakura discovers the present Masaki left her was the dress she wore at his summer house, although she does not seem to realizes who he actually is despite Cerberus pointing out its origins.\n\nMasaki later appears in ''Clear Card'', inviting Sakura and Syaoran for another visit to his summer house. In the occasion, he presents Sakura with a mysterious key that once belonged to her mother, and later states that he intends is to have Sakura inherit the summer house itself after he passes away.\n\nIn the anime series, Masaki is voiced by [[Osamu Saka]]. In the English dub, '''Mr. Avalon''' was portrayed instead as the father of Natasha Avalon, making him the grandfather of Sakura instead of her great-grandfather. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Masaki is voiced by Charlie Campbell.\n\n===Kaho Mizuki===\n{{nihongo|'''Kaho Mizuki'''|\u89b3\u6708 \u6b4c\u5e06|Mizuki Kaho}} is a [[miko|shrine maiden]] and the daughter of the priest at the Tsukimine Shrine. She first appears in the series as a new substitute teacher at Tomoeda Elementary School for the math class of [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]. While Sakura instantly [[Puppy love|crushes]] on the female teacher and feels a connection with her, Syaoran is distrustful and believes she is up to no good.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nWhen Sakura, Syaoran, Meiling and Tomoyo are trapped by the Maze card, Kaho uses a mysterious bell to break through Maze's walls allowing Sakura to capture it. After this incident, the readers learn that Sakura's older brother Toya dated Kaho when she was his junior high school teacher and that they broke up when Kaho left to study in England. Before she left, she told them that when they met again, they would be in love with different people which he acknowledges is now true.\n\nAfter meeting her, [[#Cerberus|Cerberus]] incorrectly believes that Kaho is the false form of his fellow guardian [[#Yue|Yue]], which is later shown to actually be [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]]. Kaho's role is to use the bell left at her family's shrine to give Sakura another chance when she is unable to defeat Yue out of fear of hurting him. The bell changes Sakura's staff into a new staff containing her own power of the stars and gives her the power to use the cards to defeat Yue. After fulfilling this duty, she returns to England. During the third season of the series, she is primarily \"seen\" through providing a steady, but oftentimes enigmatic exchange of letters with Sakura over the mysterious attacks. After [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] reveals the truth behind the attacks, they learn that Kaho had met Eriol three years before Sakura discovered the Book of the Clow. As they leave for England, Kaho and Eriol confirm their feelings for one another and vow to remain together. She is later seen beside Eriol on a few occasions in both the second movie and the ''Clear Card'' arc.\n\nIn the anime series, Kaho is voiced by [[Emi Shinohara]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', her name is changed to '''Layla MacKenzie''' and she is voiced by [[Linda Rae Jurgens]]. She is voiced by [[Philece Sampler]] in the English adaptation of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Kaho is voiced by [[Morgan Garrett]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Eriol Hiragizawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Eriol Hiragizawa'''|\u67ca\u6ca2 \u30a8\u30ea\u30aa\u30eb|H\u012bragizawa Erioru}} is the principal antagonist in the second half of the series, commonly called the ''Master of the Clow'' arc. The reincarnation of [[Clow Reed]], Eriol has both Clow's memories and all of his magic power. He has a magical staff similar to Clow Reed's, can restrain Clow's creations Yue and Cerberus, and has created his own similar pair of guardians: [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]] and [[#Spinel Sun|Spinel Sun]]. He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after [[Sakura Kinomoto]] passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate [[#Takashi Yamazaki|Takashi Yamazaki]] in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran Li is suspicious of him, mainly due to that Eriol is overly nice to Sakura which makes Syaoran jealous. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow's, and Eriol must erase Yue's memories of encountering him after he is accidentally seen by him.\n\nEriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura's brother to \"feed\" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying.\n\nSakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are forcing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her. He puts the city to sleep and challenges Sakura to convert the last two cards, the Dark and the Light, which must be changed together. After Sakura successfully does so, he then tells her that she is now more powerful than Clow Reed and asks her to perform one final task for him: to divide his own magical power between himself and her father [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka]]\u2014the other reincarnation of Clow Reed\u2014so that Eriol will no longer be the most powerful magician in the world. He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo, Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have been dangerous for Sakura.\n\nEriol's true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with [[#Kaho Mizuki|Kaho Mizuki]], whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc. At the end of the manga series, she returns with him to England, and in the second anime movie, they are shown together when Sakura calls for advice, though their love is never confessed like in the manga, only hinted at indirectly. In the ''Clear Card'' arc. Eriol ceases all contact with Sakura after the Sakura cards turn blank, but keeps in touch with Syaoran who informs him about everything that happens around her. While questioned about his reasons, Eriol claims that he is waiting for the right time to interfere, and thus forbids both Syaoran and his companions in England from taking action until then.\n\nIn the anime series, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, with all of the elements from the manga regarding Fujitaka's relation to Clow and inheriting of half of his powers removed. The final explanation at Eriol's house is also shifted slightly so it takes place the day after the final battle, rather than immediately after, and it is done because Sakura seeks him out rather than him giving an invitation.\n\nThe character of Eriol is voiced by [[Nozomu Sasaki]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, his name is changed to '''Eli Moon''' and he is voiced by [[Bill Switzer]]. In the English dub of the second film, his voice is supplied by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]].

The counterpart to Clow Reed's original guardian Kerberus. Spinel Sun's true form is a [[butterfly]]-winged [[black panther]] with cat-like ears and ruffs of fur on the side of his head, while his false form is similar to a small [[winged cat]] with the same wing type as his true form. Nicknamed Suppi by [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]], Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form (though this encounter is exclusive to the anime). Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn't suspect anything and instead declares Spinel Sun a monster and feeds him sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn him into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle where the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however Cerberus' greater determination to protect Sakura enables him to defeat him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] in his true form, and by [[Yumi T\u014dma]] in his false form.

Her true form resembles a human-sized [[fairy]] that performs ruby-based attacks. Ruby Moon is [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] and has no biological sex, but prefers feminine pronouns; her \"human sex\" is unspecified, though Akizuki has stated a preference for women's clothing and enjoys \"[[Kawaii|being cute]]\".\n\nUnlike the Yue/Yukito relationship, both Ruby/Nakuru forms are fully aware and display no [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]. As the alias, Nakuru Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Toya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter's dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Toya's energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn't simply steal it. When Toya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue's life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to Yue's greater determination and desire to protect Sakura.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Ruby Moon is voiced by [[Ry\u014dka Yuzuki]].

She is a young girl who bears a strong resemblance to Sakura, being around the same age and height. Akiho is rarely seen without her stuffed rabbit Momo, which she has owned since she was a small child.\n\nAkiho makes her first appearance in chapter 7 of the ''Clear Card'' arc as a transfer student in Sakura and Tomoyo's class. Akiho used to live in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[England]], and [[Hong Kong]] before moving to Japan, and is initially shy around her classmates due to her nervousness about speaking Japanese. Akiho is gifted at singing and, with Tomoyo and Sakura's encouragement, joins the school choir club.\n\nAkiho lives with her caretaker Yuna D. Kaito in Eriol's old house. She tells Sakura that Yuna has cared for her since she was very young, and suggests that she is distant from her blood relatives. Many of Akiho's relatives are avid [[Bibliophilia|book collectors]] who travel the world in search of rare books. Akiho's family installed its massive library of books in her house, among them one of her most prized possessions, a novel titled \"Alice in Clockland\" written in a foreign script only she can read. Akiho states that she has moved from country to country for most of her life in search of a particular book. When it became apparent that for some unknown reason Akiho and Sakura have shared dreams, it was revealed that Akiho not only possesses strong magic abilities, she is also the figure in the robe that continuously confronted Sakura in her dreams, although Akiho herself doesn't know that, however as Sakura and Akiho continue to enter the same dream, Akiho develops a knowledge of why she is present in those dreams: the mysterious person she is watching has something she wants.\n\nLater is revealed that Akiho is part of the \"D\" magician clan, but despite having born from the two most powerful magicians of the clan at the time, she has no magic power at all, thus the clan decides to use her to create the ultimate magic tool by implanting all kinds of spells inside her body, despite knowing that it would destroy her soul, until Kaito takes her with him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Akiho Shinomoto is voiced by [[Minori Suzuki]] in Japanese and [[AmaLee|Amanda Lee]] in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yuna D.

Yuna is a tall, dark-haired young man who appears dressed in full formal uniform, including an unusual pocket watch which he holds dear. He is professional and polite in his interactions with others, and is skilled at various domestic tasks including baking and sewing.\n\nSyaoran senses that Yuna possesses strong [[moon magic]], and Eriol confirms that the \"D.\" in Yuna's name is a title from a notorious English wizarding society. Yuna appears to be aware of both the existence of the Clear Cards and the fact that Sakura is a magician.  Thus-far, it has been hinted that he's after the Clear Cards as a means of powering a certain spell, possibly connected to a magical object, a magical time-controlling pocket watch (mentioned above), which he had stolen from the society of sorcerers he was formally-apart of, and that he's using both Sakura and Akiho to get them (having some-how created a connection between then before they had even met, which is evident by them sharing the same reoccurring dreams but are completely oblivious that they have been seeing one another), but that the ones that Sakura has created so far are not yet enough for his purpose to activate that certain spell of the ancient, forbidden relic that he had taken from the magic association from which he was excommunicated. As such, he turns back time but is certain that Sakura may gradually recall what had occurred between her and the cloaked figure, finally uncovering its identity as her good friend Akiho.\n\nIn the incomplete anime adaptation, Yuna D.

However she was eventually revealed to be actually a magical creature much like Kero and Spinel, but while Akiho is unaware of this, Yuna is the only one who has been seen to communicate with Momo as of yet.

Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, except for 1973 when no tournament was held, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], which won its third title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by six different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout this article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> have won six times (four as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Cup winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] with 3 titles; [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] with 2 titles; and [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] and [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winners a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\n[[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] (considered as the inheritors of the records of the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] are the only teams that have won the Men's World Cup more than once.\n\nThe Soviets took the gold at the opening edition of the tournament, in 1965. Four years later, the winner was also a socialist nation, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]].\n\nScheduled for [[Uruguay]], the 1973 edition was cancelled. In 1977, competition was resumed in Japan, and the Soviet Union came back for two wins in a row. In 1985, they were once again runners-up, but lost the decisive match to United States in five sets. In 1989, [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]] surprised the world and beat a rising [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] to take the gold.\n\nWith the competition now set as a qualifying event for the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union, led by Dmitri Fomin won the title in 1991, at the brink of dissolution. The Italians, who hadn't participated in this edition, finally conquered their gold medal in 1995. Inheriting a large part of the former Soviet volleyball programme, Russia were the winners in 1999.\n\nThe following two editions, played in 2003 and 2007 respectively, were won by favorites Brazil. In 2011, Russia regained the title, while the 2015 edition was won by the United States for the second time. Brazil won the title for the third time in 2019.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*Top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%;

Men's World Cup]\n}}\n\nThe '''FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup''' is an international [[volleyball]] competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of ''{{lang|fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball}}'' ([[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]), the sport's global governing body. Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, except for 1973 when no tournament was held, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], which won its third title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by six different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout this article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> have won six times (four as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Cup winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] with 3 titles; [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] with 2 titles; and [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] and [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winners a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\n[[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] (considered as the inheritors of the records of the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] are the only teams that have won the Men's World Cup more than once.\n\nThe Soviets took the gold at the opening edition of the tournament, in 1965. Four years later, the winner was also a socialist nation, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]].\n\nScheduled for [[Uruguay]], the 1973 edition was cancelled. In 1977, competition was resumed in Japan, and the Soviet Union came back for two wins in a row. In 1985, they were once again runners-up, but lost the decisive match to United States in five sets. In 1989, [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]] surprised the world and beat a rising [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] to take the gold.\n\nWith the competition now set as a qualifying event for the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union, led by Dmitri Fomin won the title in 1991, at the brink of dissolution. The Italians, who hadn't participated in this edition, finally conquered their gold medal in 1995. Inheriting a large part of the former Soviet volleyball programme, Russia were the winners in 1999.\n\nThe following two editions, played in 2003 and 2007 respectively, were won by favorites Brazil. In 2011, Russia regained the title, while the 2015 edition was won by the United States for the second time. Brazil won the title for the third time in 2019.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*Top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%;

Note the \"No snapping of cables\" sign]]\n[[Image:Flyers-StrickersGrove.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Flyers in operation at [[Stricker's Grove]]]]\n'''Flying Scooters''', also known simply as ''Flyers'', is an [[amusement ride]] consisting of a center post with ride vehicles suspended from arms attached to the center post. The ride dates back to the 1930s and 1940s when Bisch-Rocco manufactured the ride. In the early 2000s, [[Larson International]] revived the concept and is the sole manufacturer of these rides.\n\nWhen the ride is in operation, a motor causes the arms to spin, with [[centrifugal force]]s causing the ride vehicles to fly outwards. Each ride vehicle is equipped with a large rudder, allowing riders to control the motion of their vehicle. The minimum rider height requirement is usually 36 inches tall or more.\n\n==Cable snapping==\nAlthough ''Flying Scooters'' are generally considered a mild ride, a skilled rider can \"snap\" the cables suspending the vehicle, and thus gain a more extreme and out-of-control experience. Snapping is caused by the cables slacking due to quick motions of the vehicle. Snapping is made easier on older and faster Flying Scooters rides such as the ''Flyer'' at [[Knoebels]] or others manufactured by Bisch-Rocco. Some newer models, such as those manufactured by Larson, are designed to prevent snapping. Snapping is sometimes discouraged due to maintenance and safety reasons, and in the case of some parks, snapping is punishable by the ride cycle being stopped early and the offending rider being removed from the ride.\n\n==Installations==\n\n<!-- This is a list of existing projects and CONFIRMED future projects. \"Confirmed\" means the park has issued a press release announcing it (acceptable) or a reliable source (i.e., local newspaper) has published an article mentioning its construction (preferable). This is not a wish-list nor is it a place for speculation and rumor. -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name !! Park !! Location !! Manufacturer !! Opened !!

Note the \"No snapping of cables\" sign]]\n[[Image:Flyers-StrickersGrove.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Flyers in operation at [[Stricker's Grove]]]]\n'''Flying Scooters''', also known simply as ''Flyers'', is an [[amusement ride]] consisting of a center post with ride vehicles suspended from arms attached to the center post. The ride dates back to the 1930s and 1940s when Bisch-Rocco manufactured the ride. In the early 2000s, [[Larson International]] revived the concept and is the sole manufacturer of these rides.\n\nWhen the ride is in operation, a motor causes the arms to spin, with [[centrifugal force]]s causing the ride vehicles to fly outwards. Each ride vehicle is equipped with a large rudder, allowing riders to control the motion of their vehicle. The minimum rider height requirement is usually 36 inches tall or more.\n\n==Cable snapping==\nAlthough ''Flying Scooters'' are generally considered a mild ride, a skilled rider can \"snap\" the cables suspending the vehicle, and thus gain a more extreme and out-of-control experience. Snapping is caused by the cables slacking due to quick motions of the vehicle. Snapping is made easier on older and faster Flying Scooters rides such as the ''Flyer'' at [[Knoebels]] or others manufactured by Bisch-Rocco. Some newer models, such as those manufactured by Larson, are designed to prevent snapping. Snapping is sometimes discouraged due to maintenance and safety reasons, and in the case of some parks, snapping is punishable by the ride cycle being stopped early and the offending rider being removed from the ride.\n\n==Installations==\n\n<!-- This is a list of existing projects and CONFIRMED future projects. \"Confirmed\" means the park has issued a press release announcing it (acceptable) or a reliable source (i.e., local newspaper) has published an article mentioning its construction (preferable). This is not a wish-list nor is it a place for speculation and rumor. -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name !! Park !! Location !! Manufacturer !! Opened !!

The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1962 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|1962]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champion is [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], which won its third title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 tournament]] defending the championship title.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 19 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> (as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]) have won six times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Championship winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], and [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], with three titles each; [[Czech Republic men's national volleyball team|Czech Republic]] (as [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]) with two titles; [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as  [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 World Championship]] was co-hosted by Italy and Bulgaria.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the [[Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://worldgrandprix.2017.fivb.com/en/finals-3/competition Competition introduction].</ref>.\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nThe history of the World Championship clearly demonstrates how volleyball was originally dominated by European nations.\n\nThe first two editions were won by the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. In 1956, twice runner-up [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]] took the gold. There followed two more consecutive wins for the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in both cases over [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]. The Czechs won a gold medal in the 1966 edition.\n\nIn 1970, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]] prevailed over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]] for their first and only title. In 1974, the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] threatened to take the lead once more, but ended up being defeated by [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] at the final. Nevertheless, they would confirm their leadership by winning, for the third time, two editions in a row.\n\n1986 saw the first relevant confrontation between [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], the rising major force of the decade, and the traditional leader [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] after the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984. As would be the case two years later at the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympic Games]], the issue was settled in favour of the Americans led by [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]]. [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] completely dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning all the editions that took place in this decade (1990, 1994, 1998), led by such players as [[Lorenzo Bernardi]] and [[Andrea Giani]].\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] became the leading force in the sport, winning three consecutive editions (2002, 2006 and 2010), the first of which in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the same stage where the Brazilians had been runners-up in 1982. In 2014, [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], playing in home, defeated [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in 4 sets at the final achieving their second gold medal and preventing what would be a historical fourth title in a row.\n\nAs of 2014, 18 editions of the men's Volleyball World Championship have been played: 14 went to European teams, and four to [[Americas|American]] teams (three times to [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and once to [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]]).\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB

The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1962 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|1962]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champion is [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], which won its third title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 tournament]] defending the championship title.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 19 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> (as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]) have won six times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Championship winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], and [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], with three titles each; [[Czech Republic men's national volleyball team|Czech Republic]] (as [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]) with two titles; [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as  [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 World Championship]] was co-hosted by Italy and Bulgaria.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the [[Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://worldgrandprix.2017.fivb.com/en/finals-3/competition Competition introduction].</ref>.\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nThe history of the World Championship clearly demonstrates how volleyball was originally dominated by European nations.\n\nThe first two editions were won by the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. In 1956, twice runner-up [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]] took the gold. There followed two more consecutive wins for the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in both cases over [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]. The Czechs won a gold medal in the 1966 edition.\n\nIn 1970, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]] prevailed over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]] for their first and only title. In 1974, the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] threatened to take the lead once more, but ended up being defeated by [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] at the final. Nevertheless, they would confirm their leadership by winning, for the third time, two editions in a row.\n\n1986 saw the first relevant confrontation between [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], the rising major force of the decade, and the traditional leader [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] after the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984. As would be the case two years later at the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympic Games]], the issue was settled in favour of the Americans led by [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]]. [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] completely dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning all the editions that took place in this decade (1990, 1994, 1998), led by such players as [[Lorenzo Bernardi]] and [[Andrea Giani]].\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] became the leading force in the sport, winning three consecutive editions (2002, 2006 and 2010), the first of which in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the same stage where the Brazilians had been runners-up in 1982. In 2014, [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], playing in home, defeated [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in 4 sets at the final achieving their second gold medal and preventing what would be a historical fourth title in a row.\n\nAs of 2014, 18 editions of the men's Volleyball World Championship have been played: 14 went to European teams, and four to [[Americas|American]] teams (three times to [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and once to [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]]).\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB
