The centre was built and owned by the [[Myer|Myer Emporium]], and marked the transformation of shopping in Australia from the traditional central city and strip-shopping precincts to the now familiar mall-type shopping centre.<ref>Hutson (1999), page 17</ref>\n\nThe site of the current shopping centre was once extensive paddocks of the Convent of the Good Shepherd on which cattle grazed until the mid-1950s. The initial {{convert|30|acres|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of land was sold to Myer in March 1958.<ref name=\"Huston 1999, page 24\">Hutson (1999), page 24</ref>\n\nThe development of Chadstone was driven by [[Ken Myer]], who in 1949 looked to the USA for the lead in retail developments, with decentralised centres fuelled by expanding suburban growth and car reliance.<ref>Hutson (1999), page 18</ref> Further development of the concept occurred after Myer's 1953 visit to the USA, where he met with a number of architects involved with the design of shopping malls, and in 1954 Myer secured {{convert|86|acres|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of land in [[Burwood, Victoria|Burwood]] for a shopping centre. The Burwood site was ultimately not used for the project.<ref>Hutson (1999), page 22</ref>\n\nIn 1958 the American firm of [[Welton Becket|Welton Becket and Associates]] was appointed as the design architect, with Tompkins and Shaw Architects as the production architect. During the project the senior board of Myer was unhappy with the process, concerned that the architects did not understand the \"Australian Concept\", and were blindly adopting the American shopping mall model.<ref name=\"Huston 1999, page 24\" />\n\nIn 1960 the Myer board wrote:<ref name=\"p25\">Hutson (1999), page 25</ref>\n\n:''\"Although based in a broad way on the pattern of shopping centres in the United States, Chadstone has been individually designed to suit local needs and its own location.\"''\n\nThe original shopping centre consisted of a single open-air mall with Myer at the southern end and a [[Coles Supermarkets|Dickins New World]] supermarket at the northern end; following the US pattern of shopping malls.\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Chadstone Shopping Centre Central Atrium 2017.jpg|thumb|Atrium completed in 1980s]]\nThe first major change was made to the centre in the 1970s or 1980s: the mall was roofed over with translucent fibreglass, an acknowledgement that the open mall did not suit the Melbourne climate. During the same period a bowling alley and auditorium were opened, and the Dickens store was altered to be more easily accessed from the mall.<ref>Hutson (1999), page 27</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Myer Emporium sold the shopping centre to the [[Gandel Group]], which has since managed and developed the complex. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn 1984 the centre had its first major expansion: in 1985 now Coles New World was relocated into a new mall and a Target Discount Department Store was relocated from downstairs to a new store where Coles used to be, and in 1986 a Hoyts 8 Cinema Complex was opened. A major extension doubled the lettable area in the late 1980s, and during the same era the Convent of the Good Shepherd was demolished to extend the carpark of the complex. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Redevelopments===\n[[File:Chadstone Shopping Centre GF view1 2017.JPG|thumb|GF shops to Chadstone SC Bus Interchange]]\n[[File:Chadstone Shopping Centre LG View 2017.JPG|thumb|LG Level Shops corridor]]\nChadstone has reclaimed the title \"Southern hemisphere's largest shopping centre\" since 2009 and also \"Australia's largest shopping centre\" since 2007, thanks to regular development.<ref name=\"SuperChaddy\" /> Westfield Knox held the latter title from November 2002 until 2007 after the completion of their own expansion works.

The Burwood site was ultimately not used for the project.<ref>Hutson (1999), page 22</ref>\n\nIn 1958 the American firm of [[Welton Becket|Welton Becket and Associates]] was appointed as the design architect, with Tompkins and Shaw Architects as the production architect. During the project the senior board of Myer was unhappy with the process, concerned that the architects did not understand the \"Australian Concept\", and were blindly adopting the American shopping mall model.<ref name=\"Huston 1999, page 24\" />\n\nIn 1960 the Myer board wrote:<ref name=\"p25\">Hutson (1999), page 25</ref>\n\n:''\"Although based in a broad way on the pattern of shopping centres in the United States, Chadstone has been individually designed to suit local needs and its own location.\"''\n\nThe original shopping centre consisted of a single open-air mall with Myer at the southern end and a [[Coles Supermarkets|Dickins New World]] supermarket at the northern end; following the US pattern of shopping malls.\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Chadstone Shopping Centre Central Atrium 2017.jpg|thumb|Atrium completed in 1980s]]\nThe first major change was made to the centre in the 1970s or 1980s: the mall was roofed over with translucent fibreglass, an acknowledgement that the open mall did not suit the Melbourne climate. During the same period a bowling alley and auditorium were opened, and the Dickens store was altered to be more easily accessed from the mall.<ref>Hutson (1999), page 27</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Myer Emporium sold the shopping centre to the [[Gandel Group]], which has since managed and developed the complex. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn 1984 the centre had its first major expansion: in 1985 now Coles New World was relocated into a new mall and a Target Discount Department Store was relocated from downstairs to a new store where Coles used to be, and in 1986 a Hoyts 8 Cinema Complex was opened.
