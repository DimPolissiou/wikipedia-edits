Internationally he is best known for his opera ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'' and for the symphonic cycle ''[[M\u00e1 vlast]]'' (\"My Homeland\"), which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native [[Bohemia]]. It contains the famous symphonic poem ''\"[[M\u00e1 vlast#Vltava|Vltava]]\"'', also known by its English name ''\"The Moldau\"''.\n\nSmetana was naturally gifted as a composer, and gave his first public performance at the age of 6. After conventional schooling, he studied music under [[Josef Proksch]] in [[Prague]]. His first nationalistic music was written during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|1848 Prague uprising]], in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for [[Sweden]], where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in [[Gothenburg]], and began to write large-scale orchestral works. During this period of his life Smetana was twice married; of six daughters, three died in infancy.\n\nIn the early 1860s, a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, ''[[The Brandenburgers in Bohemia]]'' and ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'', were premiered at Prague's new [[Provisional Theatre (Prague)|Provisional Theatre]], the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]] inimical to the development of a distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and might have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.\n\nBy the end of 1874, Smetana had become completely deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost the rest of his life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] as a more significant Czech composer.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Family background and childhood===\nBed\u0159ich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in [[Litomy\u0161l]] (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], then provinces of the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. He was the third child, and first son, of Franti\u0161ek Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynkov\u00e1. Franti\u0161ek had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood.<ref name=Clap9>Clapham (1972), pp. 9\u201311</ref><ref name=\"Large395\" /> At this time, under Habsburg rule, [[German language|German]] was the official language of Bohemia. Franti\u0161ek knew [[Czech language|Czech]] but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives.<ref name=\"Large, p. 3\">Large, p. 3</ref>\n[[File:AntoninMachek-FrantisekSmetana.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The father, Franti\u0161ek Smetana (1832). Portrait by [[Anton\u00edn Machek]]]]\nThe Smetana family came from the [[Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] (German: K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz) region of Bohemia. Franti\u0161ek had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomy\u0161l in 1823 as brewer to [[Waldstein family|Count Waldstein]], whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.<ref name=Clap9 /><ref name=Steen694>Steen, p. 694</ref>\n\nThe elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet.<ref name=Ottlov1>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Ottlov\u00e1|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia=[[Grove Music Online]], ed.

At a concert held in Litomy\u0161l's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]]'s overture to ''[[La muette de Portici]]'', to a rapturous reception.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 12</ref><ref>Newmarch, p. 54</ref> In 1831 the family moved to [[Jind\u0159ich\u016fv Hradec]] in the south of Bohemia\u2014the region where, a generation later, [[Gustav Mahler]] grew up.<ref name=\" Steen694\" /><ref name=Large5 /> Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (''Kvapi\u010dek'', or \"Little Galop\"), survives in sketch form.<ref name=Large5>Large, p. 5</ref><ref name=Clap13>Clapham (1972), pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nIn 1835, Franti\u0161ek retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.<ref name=Clap13 /> There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to the gymnasium at [[Jihlava]], where he was homesick and unable to study. He then transferred to the [[Premonstratensian]] school at [[N\u011bmeck\u00fd Brod]], where he was happier and made good progress.<ref name=Clap13 /> Among the friends he made here was the future Czech revolutionary poet [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd|Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek]],<ref>Large, pp. 6\u20137. Havl\u00ed\u010dek was also known as Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd.</ref> whose departure for Prague in 1838 may have influenced Smetana's own desire to experience life in the capital. The following year, with Franti\u0161ek's approval, he enrolled at Prague's Academic Grammar School under [[Josef Jungmann]], a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the [[Czech National Revival|movement for Czech national revival]].<ref name=Large7>Large, pp. 7\u201310</ref>\n\n===Apprentice musician===\n\n====First steps====\nSmetana arrived in Prague in the autumn of 1839. Finding Jungmann's school uncongenial (he was mocked by his classmates for his country manners),<ref name=Large7 /> he soon began missing classes. He attended concerts, visited the opera, listened to military bands and joined an amateur string quartet for whom he composed simple pieces.<ref name=Large7 /> After Liszt gave a series of piano recitals in the city, Smetana became convinced that he would find satisfaction only in a musical career.<ref name=Large7 /> He confided to his journal that he wanted \"to become a Mozart in composition and a Liszt in technique\".<ref name=\"Schonberg77\" /><ref name=Rosa56>Newmarch, p. 56</ref> However, the Prague idyll ended when Franti\u0161ek discovered his son's truancy, and removed him from the city.<ref name=Large7 /> Franti\u0161ek at this time saw music as a diverting pastime, not as a career choice.<ref name=\"Large, p. 3\" /> Smetana was placed temporarily with his uncle in [[Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto nad Metuj\u00ed|Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto]], where he enjoyed a brief romance with his cousin Louisa. He commemorated their passion in ''Louisa's Polka'', Smetana's earliest complete composition that has survived.<ref>Large, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nAn older cousin, Josef Smetana, a teacher at the Premonstratensian School in [[Plze\u0148]] (German: Pilsen), then offered to supervise the boy's remaining schooling, and in the summer of 1840 Smetana departed for Plze\u0148.<ref name=Ottlov1 /> He remained there until he completed his schooling in 1843. His skills as a pianist were in great demand at the town's many soir\u00e9es, and he enjoyed a hectic social life.<ref name=Rosa56 /> This included a number of romances, the most important of which was with Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, whom he had known briefly in his early childhood. Smetana was entirely captivated with her, writing in his journal: \"When I am not with her I am sitting on hot coals and have no peace\".<ref>Large, p. 17</ref> He composed several pieces for her, among which are two ''[[Quadrille]]s'', a song duet, and an incomplete piano study for the left hand.<ref name=Large19>Large, p. 19</ref> He also composed his first orchestral piece, a B-flat minuet.<ref name=Clap15>Clapham (1972), pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\n====Student and teacher====\nBy the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although Franti\u0161ek now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support.<ref name=Rosa56 /><ref name=Large19 /> In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]],<ref>Newmarch, p. 57</ref><ref>It is difficult to equate the value of a mid-19th century Austro-Hungarian gulden to 21st century dollars or sterling. A general assessment might be made on the basis of Smetana's annual salary in 1866, when he was appointed conductor of the Czech Provisional Theatre \u2013 1,200 gulden. Clapham (1972), p. 34</ref> and no immediate prospects.<ref name=Clap17>Clapham (1972), p. 17</ref> Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1's mother to [[Josef Proksch]], head of the Prague Music Institute\u2014where Kate\u0159ina was now studying.<ref name=Ottlov1 /><ref name=Large19 /> Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and the Leipzig circle of Liszt.<ref name=Ottlov1 /> In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.<ref name=Ottlov1 />\n\nFor the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, [[Bagatelle (music)|bagatelles]], [[impromptu]]s and the G minor Piano Sonata.<ref>Large, pp. 29\u201335</ref> In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch.<ref name=Clap19>Clapham (1972), p. 19</ref> At the home of Count Thun he met [[Robert Schumann|Robert]] and [[Clara Schumann]], and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work\u2014they detected too much of Berlioz in it.<ref name=Ottlov1 /> Meanwhile, his friendship with Kate\u0159ina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist.<ref>Large, p. 39</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n\n====Revolutionary====\nSmetana's concert tour to Western Bohemia was poorly supported, so he abandoned it and returned to Prague, where he made a living from private pupils and occasional appearances as an accompanist in chamber concerts.<ref name=Clap19 /> He also began work on his first major orchestral work, the Overture in D major.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 21</ref>\n[[File:Praha Barricades Charles Bridge panel 1848.jpg|thumb|left|Barricades on the [[Charles Bridge]], Prague, 1848. Smetana was briefly a participant in the uprising.]]\nFor a brief period in 1848, Smetana was a revolutionary. In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|climate of political change and upheaval]] that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana's old friend Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy.<ref name=Large42 /> A Citizens' Army (\"Svornost\") was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two [[March (music)|marches]] dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students' Legion of the University of Prague, and ''The Song of Freedom'' to words by [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]].<ref name=Steen696>Steen, p. 696</ref> In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz|the Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]]. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man the barricades on the [[Charles Bridge]].<ref name=Large42>Large, pp. 42\u201343</ref> The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havl\u00ed\u010dek.<ref name=Large42 /> During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, [[Karel Sabina]], who would later provide [[libretto|libretti]] for Smetana's first two operas.<ref name=Large42 />\n\n====Piano Institute====\nEarly in 1848, Smetana wrote to [[Franz Liszt]], whom he had not yet met, asking him to accept the dedication of a new piano work, ''Six Characteristic Pieces'', and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400&nbsp;gulden, to enable him to open a music school. Liszt replied cordially, accepting the dedication and promising to help find a publisher, but he offered no financial assistance.<ref>Steen, pp. 695\u201396</ref><ref name=Ottlov2>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Ottlov\u00e1|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

Proksch wrote of Smetana's support for his people's cause, and said that he \"could well become the transformer of my ideas in the Czech language.\"<ref name=Large48>Large, pp. 48\u201349</ref> In 1849 the Institute was relocated to the home of Kate\u0159ina's parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former Austrian emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]], who had settled in Prague, attended the school's matin\u00e9e concerts.<ref name=Large48 /> Smetana's performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague's musical life. In this time of relative financial stability Smetana married his beloved, the young pianist Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, on 27 August 1849. Four daughters were born to the couple between 1851 and 1855.<ref name=Ottlov2 />\n\n====Budding composer====\nIn 1850, notwithstanding his revolutionary sentiments, Smetana accepted the post of Court Pianist in Ferdinand's establishment in [[Prague Castle]].<ref name=\"Steen696\" /><ref name=Large48 /> He continued teaching in the Piano Institute, and devoted himself increasingly to composition. His works, mainly for the piano, included the three-part ''Wedding Scenes'', some of the music of which was later used in ''The Bartered Bride''.<ref name=Large51>Large, pp. 51\u201354</ref> He also wrote numerous short experimental pieces collected under the name ''Album Leaves'', and a series of [[polka]]s.<ref name=Large51 /> During 1853\u201354 he worked on a major orchestral piece, the ''Triumphal Symphony'', composed to commemorate the wedding of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]].<ref name=Ottlov2 /> The symphony was rejected by the Imperial Court, possibly on the grounds that the brief musical references to the [[Deutschlandlied#Melody|Austrian national anthem]] were not sufficiently prominent. Undeterred, Smetana hired an orchestra at his own expense to perform the symphony at the Konvikt Hall in Prague on 26 February 1855. The work was coolly received, and the concert was a financial failure.<ref>Large, pp. 57\u201362</ref>\n\n====Private sorrows and professional disenchantment====\n[[File:Smetana1854portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|An oil portrait of Smetana, 1854, by [[Geskel Saloman]]]]\nIn the years between 1854 and 1856 Smetana suffered a series of personal blows. In July 1854 his second daughter, Gabriela, died of [[tuberculosis]]. A year later his eldest daughter Bed\u0159i\u0161ka, who at the age of four was showing signs of musical precocity, died of [[scarlet fever]].<ref name=Clap22>Clapham (1972), p. 22</ref> Smetana wrote his Piano Trio in G minor as a tribute to her memory; it was performed in Prague on 3 December 1855 and, according to the composer, was received \"harshly\" by the critics, although Liszt praised it.<ref name=Ottlov1 /><ref>Large, pp. 63\u201365</ref> Smetana's sorrows continued; just after Bed\u0159i\u0161ka's death a fourth daughter, Kate\u0159ina, had been born but she, too, died in June 1856. By this time Smetana's wife Kate\u0159ina had also been diagnosed with tuberculosis.<ref name=Clap22 />\n\nIn July 1856, Smetana received news of the death in exile of his revolutionary friend [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd|Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek]].<ref name=Large67>Large, pp. 67\u201369</ref> The political climate in Prague was a further source of gloom; hopes of a more enlightened government and social reform following Franz Joseph's accession in 1848 had faded as [[Bach's absolutism|Austrian absolutism reasserted itself under Baron Alexander von Bach]].<ref name=Large67 /> Despite the good name of the Piano Institute, Smetana's status as a concert pianist was generally considered below that of contemporaries such as [[Alexander Dreyschock]].<ref name=Large67 /> Critics acknowledged Smetana's \"delicate, crystalline touch\", closer in style to [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] than [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], but believed that his physical frailty was a serious drawback to his concert-playing ambitions.<ref name=Large51 /> His main performance success during this period was his playing of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|D minor Piano Concerto]] at a concert celebrating the centenary of Mozart's birth, in January 1856.<ref name=Large67 /> His disenchantment with Prague was growing and, perhaps influenced by Dreyschock's accounts of opportunities in Sweden, Smetana decided to seek success there. On 11 October 1856, after writing to his parents that \"Prague did not wish to acknowledge me, so I left it\", he departed for [[Gothenburg]].<ref name=Ottlov3>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Ottlov\u00e1|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

Writing to Liszt, he said that the people there were musically unsophisticated, but he saw this as an opportunity \"...for an impact I could never have achieved in Prague.\"<ref name=Ottlov3 /> Within a few weeks of his arrival, he had given his first recital, opened a music school that was rapidly overwhelmed by applications,<ref name=Large71>Large, pp. 71\u201375</ref> and become conductor of the Gothenburg Society for Classical Choral Music.<ref name=Large71 /> In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled ''Frithjof'' and ''The Viking's Voyage'', were sketched but abandoned.<ref>Large. p. 78</ref>\n[[File:G\u00f6teborg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gothenburg]], Sweden, Smetana's base between 1856 and 1861]]\nIn summer 1857, Smetana came home to Prague and found Kate\u0159ina in failing health. In June, Smetana's father Franti\u0161ek died.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 25</ref> That autumn Smetana returned to Gothenburg, with Kate\u0159ina and their surviving daughter \u017dofie, but before doing so he visited Liszt in [[Weimar]]. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's ''[[Faust Symphony]]'' and the symphonic poem ''Die Ideale'', which invigorated and inspired him.<ref name=\"Large, p. 79\">Large, p. 79</ref> Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.<ref name=Ottlov3 />\n\nBack in Sweden, Smetana found among his new pupils a young housewife, Fr\u00f6jda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana transcribed two songs from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] ''[[Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin]]'' cycle, and transformed one of his own early piano pieces into a polka entitled ''Vision at the Ball''.<ref>Large, pp. 80\u201382</ref> He also began composing on a more expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem ''Richard III'', his first major orchestral composition since the ''Triumphal Symphony''. He followed this with ''Wallenstein's Camp'', inspired by [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[Wallenstein (play)|''Wallenstein'' drama trilogy]],<ref>Newmarch, p. 60</ref> and began a third symphonic poem ''[[Hakon Jarl (Smetana)|Hakon Jarl]]'', based on the tragic drama by Danish poet [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]].<ref name=Clap28 /> Smetana also wrote two large-scale piano works: ''Macbeth and the Witches'', and an \u00c9tude in C in the style of Liszt.<ref name=Large84>Large, pp. 84\u201394</ref>\n\n====Bereavement, remarriage and return to Prague====\n{{Listen|type=music\n| filename    = Smetana - polka a minor op 12.ogg\n| title       = Polka in A minor from ''Memories of Bohemia in Polka Form'', Op.&nbsp;12, 1859\n| description = Piano: Veronika Pt\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1\n}}\n\nKate\u0159ina's health gradually worsened and in the spring of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at [[Dresden]] on 19 April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died \"gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew my attention to her.\"<ref>Large, pp. 95\u201397</ref> After placing \u017dofie with Kate\u0159ina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera ''[[Der Barbier von Bagdad]]'', by Liszt's pupil [[Peter Cornelius]].<ref>According to [[Gerald Abraham]], Smetana had met Cornelius at Weimar two years previously, while the latter was working on ''Der Barbier''. Reportedly the two composers discussed the need for \"a modern type of comic opera as a complement to Wagner.\" Abraham, p. 29</ref> This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer.<ref>Large, pp. 98\u201399 and p. 160</ref> Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, and fell in love with Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiov\u00e1, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859\u201360 winter.<ref name=Ottlov3 /> The marriage took place the following year, on 10 July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in [[Stockholm]], attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zde\u0148ka, was born in September 1861.<ref name=Clap28>Clapham (1972), pp. 28\u201330</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the defeat of Franz Joseph's army at [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] in 1859 had weakened the Habsburg Empire, and led to the fall from power of von Bach.<ref>Large, p. 114</ref> This had gradually brought a more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture.<ref name=Schonberg77>Schonberg, p. 77</ref><ref name=Clap28 /> Before deciding his own future, in September Smetana set out on a concert tour of the Netherlands and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure.<ref name=Clap28 /> Back in Prague, he conducted performances of ''Richard III'' and ''Wallenstein's Camp'' in the \u017dof\u00edn Island concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the \"New German\" school represented primarily by Liszt;<ref>Clapham (1980) p. 393</ref> Smetana responded that \"a prophet is without honour in his own land.\"<ref name=Clap28 /> In March 1862 he made a last brief visit to Gothenburg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to him a provincial backwater and, whatever the difficulties, he now determined to seek his musical future in Prague: \"My home has rooted itself into my heart so much that only there do I find real contentment. It is to this that I will sacrifice myself.\"<ref>Large, p. 120</ref>\n\n===National prominence===\n\n====Seeking recognition====\nIn 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera.<ref>The official title for this theatre was the \"Royal Provincial Czech Theatre\" ({{cite encyclopedia|last= Ottlov\u00e1|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist,<ref name=Large140>Large, pp. 140\u201343</ref> and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by [[Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto of Brandenburg]].

He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; ''The Three Riders'' and ''The Renegade'' were performed at concerts in early 1863.<ref name=Large121>Large, pp. 121\u201325</ref> In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Um\u011bleck\u00e1 Beseda, a society for Czech artists.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper ''N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy''.<ref>Newmarch, p. 62</ref> Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Bo\u017eena.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 33</ref>\n\nOn 23 April 1864, Smetana conducted Berlioz's [[choral symphony]] ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (Berlioz)|Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'' at a concert celebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary, adding to the programme his own ''March for the Shakespearean Festival''.<ref name=Clap32 /><ref name=Ottlov4 /> That year, Smetana's bid to become Director of the [[Prague Conservatory]] failed. He had set high hopes on this appointment: \"My friends are trying to persuade me that this post might have been especially created for me,\" he wrote to a Swedish friend.<ref>Large, p. 134</ref> Again his hopes were thwarted by his association with the perceived radical Liszt, and the appointing committee chose the conservative patriot Josef Krej\u010d\u00ed for the post.<ref>Clapham (1980), p. 394</ref>\n\n[[File:Dvorak Bedrich Smetana and friends in 1865.jpg|thumbnail|''Bed\u0159ich Smetana Among his Friends'', 1865; oil painting by [[Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (painter)|Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]]]\nAlmost three years passed before Smetana was declared the winner of Harrach's opera competition.<ref name=Clap32 /> Before then, on 5 January 1866, ''The Brandenburgers'' had been performed to an enthusiastic reception at the Provisional Theatre\u2014over strong opposition from Ma\u00fdr, who had refused to rehearse or conduct the piece. The idiom was too advanced for Ma\u00fdr's liking, and the opera was eventually staged under the composer's own direction.<ref name=Clap32 /> \"I was called on stage nine times,\" Smetana wrote, recording that the house was sold out and that the critics were full of praise.<ref name=Large145>Large, p. 145</ref> Music historian [[Rosa Newmarch]] believes that, although ''The Brandenburgers'' has not stood the test of time, it contains all the germs of Smetana's operatic art.<ref>Newmarch, p. 64</ref>\n\n====Opera maestro====\nIn July 1863, Sabina had delivered the libretto for a second opera, a light comedy entitled ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'', which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because of the success of ''The Brandenburgers'', the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30 May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> The opera went through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation.<ref name=Large167>Large, pp. 167\u201368</ref><ref>Large, pp. 399\u2013408</ref> The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on one of the hottest evenings of the year, on the eve of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by [[Prussia]]n troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs.<ref name=Large165>Large, pp. 165\u201367</ref> When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it was a tremendous public success.<ref name=\"Newmarch, p. 69\">Newmarch, p. 69</ref>\n\nBack in 1866, as the composer of ''The Brandenburgers'' with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana thought he might be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased.<ref name=Large165 /> He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition\u2014appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200&nbsp;gulden.<ref name=Clap34 /> In the absence of a body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], Mozart, [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and Glinka, with a revival of his own ''Bartered Bride''.<ref name=Large167 /><ref name=Clap34>Clapham (1972), pp. 34\u201336</ref> The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' angered Glinka's champion [[Mily Balakirev]], who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men.<ref name=Clap34 /><ref>Large, pp. 209\u201310</ref> On 28 February 1868 Smetana conducted another national opera by another Slavic composer, ''[[Halka]]'' by [[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]]. On 16 May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]];<ref name=\"Newmarch, p. 69\" /> he had written a ''Festive Overture'' for the occasion. That same evening Smetana's third opera, ''[[Dalibor (opera)|Dalibor]]'', was premi\u00e8red at Prague's New Town Theatre.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.<ref name=Large197>Large, p. 197</ref>\n\n====Opposition====\nEarly in his Provisional Theatre conductorship Smetana had made a powerful enemy in Franti\u0161ek Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana, Pivoda was aggrieved when the conductor recruited singing talent from abroad rather than from Pivoda's school.<ref>Steen, p. 701</ref><ref>Clapham (1980) p. 394</ref> In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda claimed that Smetana was using his position to further his own career, at the expense of other composers.<ref name=Clap40>Clapham (1972), pp. 38\u201340</ref>\n\nPivoda then took issue with ''Dalibor'', calling it an example of extreme \"Wagnerism\" and thus, unsuited as a model for Czech national opera.<ref>Newmarch, p. 71</ref> \"Wagnerism\" meant the adoption of Wagner's theories of a continuous role for the orchestra and the building of an integrated musical drama, rather than a stringing together of lyrical numbers.<ref name=Ottlov4 /><ref name=Newmarch65 /> The Provisional Theatre's chairman, Franti\u0161ek Rieger, had first accused Smetana of Wagnerist tendencies after the first performance of ''The Brandenburgers'',<ref name=Large145 /> and the issue eventually divided Prague's musical society. The music critic [[Otakar Hostinsk\u00fd]] believed that [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s theories should be the basis of the national opera, and argued that ''Dalibor'' was the beginning of the \"correct\" direction. The opposite camp, led by Pivoda, supported the principles of [[Italian opera]], in which the voice rather than the orchestra was the predominant dramatic device.<ref name=Ottlov4 />\n\nEven within the theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a campaign to eject Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Ma\u00fdr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86&nbsp;subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation.<ref name=Clap40 /> Strong support from vice-chairman Anton\u00edn \u010c\u00edsek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.<ref name=Ottlov4 /><ref name=Clap40 />\n\nSmetana gradually brought more operas by emergent Czech composers to the theatre, but little of his own work.<ref name=Clap40 /> By 1872 he had completed his monumental fourth opera, ''[[Libu\u0161e (opera)|Libu\u0161e]]'', his most ambitious work to date,<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 99</ref> but was withholding its premiere for the future opening of the forthcoming National Theatre.<ref>Large, p. 220</ref> The machinations of Pivoda and his supporters distracted Smetana from composition,<ref name=Clap40 /> and he had further vexation when ''The Bartered Bride'' was produced in [[Saint Petersburg]], in January 1871. Although the audience was enthusiastic,<ref name=Clap40 /> press reports were hostile, one describing the work as \"no better than that of a gifted fourteen-year-old boy.\"<ref name=Large171>Large, p. 171</ref> Smetana was deeply offended, and blamed his old adversary, Balakirev, for inciting negative feelings against the opera.<ref name=Large171 />\n\n===Final decade===\n[[File:Smetana-old-age.jpg|thumb|upright|Smetana in about 1883, near the end of his life]]\n\n====Deafness====\nIn the respite following his reappointment, Smetana concentrated on his fifth opera, ''[[The Two Widows]]'', composed between June 1873 and January 1874.<ref name=Clap41>Clapham (1972), pp. 41\u201342</ref> After its first performance at the Provisional Theatre on 27 March 1874, Smetana's supporters presented him with a decorative baton.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> But his opponents continued to attack him, comparing his conductorship unfavourably with the Ma\u00fdr regime and claiming that under Smetana \"Czech opera sickens to death at least once annually.\"<ref name=Clap41 /> By the summer Smetana was ill; a throat infection was followed by a rash and an apparent blockage to the ears. By mid-August, unable to work, he transferred his duties to his deputy, [[Adolf \u010cech]]. A press announcement stated that Smetana had \"become ill as a result of nervous strain caused by certain people recently.\"<ref name=Clap41 />\n\nIn September, Smetana told the theatre he would resign his appointment unless his health improved.<ref name=Clap43>Clapham (1972), pp. 43\u201345</ref> He had become totally deaf in his right ear, and in October lost all hearing in his left ear also. After his subsequent resignation the theatre offered him an annual pension of 1,200&nbsp;gulden for the continued right to perform his operas, an arrangement Smetana reluctantly accepted.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 44. It appears (Clapham, 1972, pp. 48\u201349) that this pension was withheld from time to time, causing Smetana much financial hardship.</ref> Money raised in Prague by former students, and by former lover Fr\u00f6jda Benecke in Gothenburg, amounted to 1,244&nbsp;gulden.<ref>Large, pp. 294\u201395</ref> This allowed Smetana to seek medical treatment abroad, but to no avail.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> In January 1875 Smetana wrote in his journal: \"If my disease is incurable, then I should prefer to be liberated from this life.\"<ref>Large, p. 303</ref> His spirits were further lowered at this time by a deterioration in his relationship with Bettina, mainly over money matters.<ref>Large, pp. 322\u201323</ref> \"I cannot live under the same roof as a person who hates and persecutes me,\" Smetana informed her.<ref>Large, p. 374, from an undated letter to Bettina</ref> Although divorce was considered, the couple stayed unhappily together.<ref>Large, p. 374</ref>\n\n====Late flowering====\nIn worsening health, Smetana continued to compose. In June 1876 he, Bettina, and their two daughters left Prague for [[Jabkenice]], the home of his eldest daughter \u017dofie where, in tranquil surroundings, Smetana was able to work undisturbed.<ref>Steen, p. 702</ref> Before leaving Prague he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems, called ''[[M\u00e1 vlast]]'' (\"My Fatherland\"),<ref>Originally, the work was entitled simply ''Vlast'' (\"Fatherland\").

As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public's lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously,<ref name=Large121 /> and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his \"prophet without honour\" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of ''Richard III'' and ''Wallenstein's Camp'' at \u017dof\u00edn Island in January 1862.<ref>Large, p. 119</ref>\n\nSmetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera ''The Brandenburgers in Bohemia'', in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, ''The Bartered Bride'', survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, ''Dalibor'', closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song.<ref>Large, pp. 204\u201305</ref><ref name=Clapham36 /> It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances.<ref name=Clapham36>Clapham (1972), p. 36</ref> Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874.\n\nIn his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition.

He has been regarded in his homeland as the father of [[Music of the Czech Lands|Czech music]]. Internationally he is best known for his opera ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'' and for the symphonic cycle ''[[M\u00e1 vlast]]'' (\"My Homeland\"), which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native [[Bohemia]]. It contains the famous symphonic poem ''\"[[M\u00e1 vlast#Vltava|Vltava]]\"'', also known by its English name ''\"The Moldau\"''.\n\nSmetana was naturally gifted as a composer, and gave his first public performance at the age of 6. After conventional schooling, he studied music under [[Josef Proksch]] in [[Prague]]. His first nationalistic music was written during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|1848 Prague uprising]], in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for [[Sweden]], where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in [[Gothenburg]], and began to write large-scale orchestral works. During this period of his life Smetana was twice married; of six daughters, three died in infancy.\n\nIn the early 1860s, a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, ''[[The Brandenburgers in Bohemia]]'' and ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'', were premiered at Prague's new [[Provisional Theatre (Prague)|Provisional Theatre]], the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]] inimical to the development of a distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and might have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.\n\nBy the end of 1874, Smetana had become completely deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost the rest of his life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] as a more significant Czech composer.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Family background and childhood===\nBed\u0159ich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in [[Litomy\u0161l]] (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], then provinces of the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. He was the third child, and first son, of Franti\u0161ek Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynkov\u00e1. Franti\u0161ek had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood.<ref name=Clap9>Clapham (1972), pp. 9\u201311</ref><ref name=\"Large395\" /> At this time, under Habsburg rule, [[German language|German]] was the official language of Bohemia. Franti\u0161ek knew [[Czech language|Czech]] but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives.<ref name=\"Large, p. 3\">Large, p. 3</ref>\n[[File:AntoninMachek-FrantisekSmetana.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The father, Franti\u0161ek Smetana (1832).

Franti\u0161ek had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army.

At a concert held in Litomy\u0161l's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]]'s overture to ''[[La muette de Portici]]'', to a rapturous reception.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 12</ref><ref>Newmarch, p. 54</ref> In 1831 the family moved to [[Jind\u0159ich\u016fv Hradec]] in the south of Bohemia\u2014the region where, a generation later, [[Gustav Mahler]] grew up.<ref name=\" Steen694\" /><ref name=Large5 /> Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (''Kvapi\u010dek'', or \"Little Galop\"), survives in sketch form.<ref name=Large5>Large, p. 5</ref><ref name=Clap13>Clapham (1972), pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nIn 1835, Franti\u0161ek retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.<ref name=Clap13 /> There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to the gymnasium at [[Jihlava]], where he was homesick and unable to study. He then transferred to the [[Premonstratensian]] school at [[N\u011bmeck\u00fd Brod]], where he was happier and made good progress.<ref name=Clap13 /> Among the friends he made here was the future Czech revolutionary poet [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd|Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek]],<ref>Large, pp. 6\u20137.

The following year, with Franti\u0161ek's approval, he enrolled at Prague's Academic Grammar School under [[Josef Jungmann]], a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the [[Czech National Revival|movement for Czech national revival]].<ref name=Large7>Large, pp. 7\u201310</ref>\n\n===Apprentice musician===\n\n====First steps====\nSmetana arrived in Prague in the autumn of 1839. Finding Jungmann's school uncongenial (he was mocked by his classmates for his country manners),<ref name=Large7 /> he soon began missing classes. He attended concerts, visited the opera, listened to military bands and joined an amateur string quartet for whom he composed simple pieces.<ref name=Large7 /> After Liszt gave a series of piano recitals in the city, Smetana became convinced that he would find satisfaction only in a musical career.<ref name=Large7 /> He confided to his journal that he wanted \"to become a Mozart in composition and a Liszt in technique\".<ref name=\"Schonberg77\" /><ref name=Rosa56>Newmarch, p. 56</ref> However, the Prague idyll ended when Franti\u0161ek discovered his son's truancy, and removed him from the city.<ref name=Large7 /> Franti\u0161ek at this time saw music as a diverting pastime, not as a career choice.<ref name=\"Large, p. 3\" /> Smetana was placed temporarily with his uncle in [[Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto nad Metuj\u00ed|Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto]], where he enjoyed a brief romance with his cousin Louisa. He commemorated their passion in ''Louisa's Polka'', Smetana's earliest complete composition that has survived.<ref>Large, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nAn older cousin, Josef Smetana, a teacher at the Premonstratensian School in [[Plze\u0148]] (German: Pilsen), then offered to supervise the boy's remaining schooling, and in the summer of 1840 Smetana departed for Plze\u0148.<ref name=Ottlov1 /> He remained there until he completed his schooling in 1843. His skills as a pianist were in great demand at the town's many soir\u00e9es, and he enjoyed a hectic social life.<ref name=Rosa56 /> This included a number of romances, the most important of which was with Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, whom he had known briefly in his early childhood. Smetana was entirely captivated with her, writing in his journal: \"When I am not with her I am sitting on hot coals and have no peace\".<ref>Large, p. 17</ref> He composed several pieces for her, among which are two ''[[Quadrille]]s'', a song duet, and an incomplete piano study for the left hand.<ref name=Large19>Large, p. 19</ref> He also composed his first orchestral piece, a B-flat minuet.<ref name=Clap15>Clapham (1972), pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\n====Student and teacher====\nBy the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although Franti\u0161ek now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support.<ref name=Rosa56 /><ref name=Large19 /> In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]],<ref>Newmarch, p. 57</ref><ref>It is difficult to equate the value of a mid-19th century Austro-Hungarian gulden to 21st century dollars or sterling.

Clapham (1972), p. 34</ref> and no immediate prospects.<ref name=Clap17>Clapham (1972), p. 17</ref> Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1's mother to [[Josef Proksch]], head of the Prague Music Institute\u2014where Kate\u0159ina was now studying.<ref name=Ottlov1 /><ref name=Large19 /> Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and the Leipzig circle of Liszt.<ref name=Ottlov1 /> In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.<ref name=Ottlov1 />\n\nFor the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, [[Bagatelle (music)|bagatelles]], [[impromptu]]s and the G minor Piano Sonata.<ref>Large, pp. 29\u201335</ref> In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch.<ref name=Clap19>Clapham (1972), p. 19</ref> At the home of Count Thun he met [[Robert Schumann|Robert]] and [[Clara Schumann]], and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work\u2014they detected too much of Berlioz in it.<ref name=Ottlov1 /> Meanwhile, his friendship with Kate\u0159ina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist.<ref>Large, p. 39</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n\n====Revolutionary====\nSmetana's concert tour to Western Bohemia was poorly supported, so he abandoned it and returned to Prague, where he made a living from private pupils and occasional appearances as an accompanist in chamber concerts.<ref name=Clap19 /> He also began work on his first major orchestral work, the Overture in D major.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 21</ref>\n[[File:Praha Barricades Charles Bridge panel 1848.jpg|thumb|left|Barricades on the [[Charles Bridge]], Prague, 1848. Smetana was briefly a participant in the uprising.]]\nFor a brief period in 1848, Smetana was a revolutionary. In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|climate of political change and upheaval]] that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana's old friend Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy.<ref name=Large42 /> A Citizens' Army (\"Svornost\") was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two [[March (music)|marches]] dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students' Legion of the University of Prague, and ''The Song of Freedom'' to words by [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]].<ref name=Steen696>Steen, p. 696</ref> In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz|the Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]]. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man the barricades on the [[Charles Bridge]].<ref name=Large42>Large, pp. 42\u201343</ref> The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havl\u00ed\u010dek.<ref name=Large42 /> During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, [[Karel Sabina]], who would later provide [[libretto|libretti]] for Smetana's first two operas.<ref name=Large42 />\n\n====Piano Institute====\nEarly in 1848, Smetana wrote to [[Franz Liszt]], whom he had not yet met, asking him to accept the dedication of a new piano work, ''Six Characteristic Pieces'', and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400&nbsp;gulden, to enable him to open a music school.

Proksch wrote of Smetana's support for his people's cause, and said that he \"could well become the transformer of my ideas in the Czech language.\"<ref name=Large48>Large, pp. 48\u201349</ref> In 1849 the Institute was relocated to the home of Kate\u0159ina's parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former Austrian emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]], who had settled in Prague, attended the school's matin\u00e9e concerts.<ref name=Large48 /> Smetana's performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague's musical life. In this time of relative financial stability Smetana married his beloved, the young pianist Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, on 27 August 1849. Four daughters were born to the couple between 1851 and 1855.<ref name=Ottlov2 />\n\n====Budding composer====\nIn 1850, notwithstanding his revolutionary sentiments, Smetana accepted the post of Court Pianist in Ferdinand's establishment in [[Prague Castle]].<ref name=\"Steen696\" /><ref name=Large48 /> He continued teaching in the Piano Institute, and devoted himself increasingly to composition. His works, mainly for the piano, included the three-part ''Wedding Scenes'', some of the music of which was later used in ''The Bartered Bride''.<ref name=Large51>Large, pp. 51\u201354</ref> He also wrote numerous short experimental pieces collected under the name ''Album Leaves'', and a series of [[polka]]s.<ref name=Large51 /> During 1853\u201354 he worked on a major orchestral piece, the ''Triumphal Symphony'', composed to commemorate the wedding of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]].<ref name=Ottlov2 /> The symphony was rejected by the Imperial Court, possibly on the grounds that the brief musical references to the [[Deutschlandlied#Melody|Austrian national anthem]] were not sufficiently prominent. Undeterred, Smetana hired an orchestra at his own expense to perform the symphony at the Konvikt Hall in Prague on 26 February 1855. The work was coolly received, and the concert was a financial failure.<ref>Large, pp. 57\u201362</ref>\n\n====Private sorrows and professional disenchantment====\n[[File:Smetana1854portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|An oil portrait of Smetana, 1854, by [[Geskel Saloman]]]]\nIn the years between 1854 and 1856 Smetana suffered a series of personal blows. In July 1854 his second daughter, Gabriela, died of [[tuberculosis]]. A year later his eldest daughter Bed\u0159i\u0161ka, who at the age of four was showing signs of musical precocity, died of [[scarlet fever]].<ref name=Clap22>Clapham (1972), p. 22</ref> Smetana wrote his Piano Trio in G minor as a tribute to her memory; it was performed in Prague on 3 December 1855 and, according to the composer, was received \"harshly\" by the critics, although Liszt praised it.<ref name=Ottlov1 /><ref>Large, pp. 63\u201365</ref> Smetana's sorrows continued; just after Bed\u0159i\u0161ka's death a fourth daughter, Kate\u0159ina, had been born but she, too, died in June 1856. By this time Smetana's wife Kate\u0159ina had also been diagnosed with tuberculosis.<ref name=Clap22 />\n\nIn July 1856, Smetana received news of the death in exile of his revolutionary friend [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd|Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek]].<ref name=Large67>Large, pp. 67\u201369</ref> The political climate in Prague was a further source of gloom; hopes of a more enlightened government and social reform following Franz Joseph's accession in 1848 had faded as [[Bach's absolutism|Austrian absolutism reasserted itself under Baron Alexander von Bach]].<ref name=Large67 /> Despite the good name of the Piano Institute, Smetana's status as a concert pianist was generally considered below that of contemporaries such as [[Alexander Dreyschock]].<ref name=Large67 /> Critics acknowledged Smetana's \"delicate, crystalline touch\", closer in style to [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] than [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], but believed that his physical frailty was a serious drawback to his concert-playing ambitions.<ref name=Large51 /> His main performance success during this period was his playing of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|D minor Piano Concerto]] at a concert celebrating the centenary of Mozart's birth, in January 1856.<ref name=Large67 /> His disenchantment with Prague was growing and, perhaps influenced by Dreyschock's accounts of opportunities in Sweden, Smetana decided to seek success there. On 11 October 1856, after writing to his parents that \"Prague did not wish to acknowledge me, so I left it\", he departed for [[Gothenburg]].<ref name=Ottlov3>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Ottlov\u00e1|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

Writing to Liszt, he said that the people there were musically unsophisticated, but he saw this as an opportunity \"...for an impact I could never have achieved in Prague.\"<ref name=Ottlov3 /> Within a few weeks of his arrival, he had given his first recital, opened a music school that was rapidly overwhelmed by applications,<ref name=Large71>Large, pp. 71\u201375</ref> and become conductor of the Gothenburg Society for Classical Choral Music.<ref name=Large71 /> In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled ''Frithjof'' and ''The Viking's Voyage'', were sketched but abandoned.<ref>Large. p. 78</ref>\n[[File:G\u00f6teborg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gothenburg]], Sweden, Smetana's base between 1856 and 1861]]\nIn summer 1857, Smetana came home to Prague and found Kate\u0159ina in failing health. In June, Smetana's father Franti\u0161ek died.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 25</ref> That autumn Smetana returned to Gothenburg, with Kate\u0159ina and their surviving daughter \u017dofie, but before doing so he visited Liszt in [[Weimar]]. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's ''[[Faust Symphony]]'' and the symphonic poem ''Die Ideale'', which invigorated and inspired him.<ref name=\"Large, p. 79\">Large, p. 79</ref> Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.<ref name=Ottlov3 />\n\nBack in Sweden, Smetana found among his new pupils a young housewife, Fr\u00f6jda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana transcribed two songs from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] ''[[Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin]]'' cycle, and transformed one of his own early piano pieces into a polka entitled ''Vision at the Ball''.<ref>Large, pp. 80\u201382</ref> He also began composing on a more expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem ''Richard III'', his first major orchestral composition since the ''Triumphal Symphony''. He followed this with ''Wallenstein's Camp'', inspired by [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[Wallenstein (play)|''Wallenstein'' drama trilogy]],<ref>Newmarch, p. 60</ref> and began a third symphonic poem ''[[Hakon Jarl (Smetana)|Hakon Jarl]]'', based on the tragic drama by Danish poet [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]].<ref name=Clap28 /> Smetana also wrote two large-scale piano works: ''Macbeth and the Witches'', and an \u00c9tude in C in the style of Liszt.<ref name=Large84>Large, pp. 84\u201394</ref>\n\n====Bereavement, remarriage and return to Prague====\n{{Listen|type=music\n| filename    = Smetana - polka a minor op 12.ogg\n| title       = Polka in A minor from ''Memories of Bohemia in Polka Form'', Op.&nbsp;12, 1859\n| description = Piano: Veronika Pt\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1\n}}\n\nKate\u0159ina's health gradually worsened and in the spring of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at [[Dresden]] on 19 April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died \"gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew my attention to her.\"<ref>Large, pp. 95\u201397</ref> After placing \u017dofie with Kate\u0159ina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera ''[[Der Barbier von Bagdad]]'', by Liszt's pupil [[Peter Cornelius]].<ref>According to [[Gerald Abraham]], Smetana had met Cornelius at Weimar two years previously, while the latter was working on ''Der Barbier''. Reportedly the two composers discussed the need for \"a modern type of comic opera as a complement to Wagner.\" Abraham, p. 29</ref> This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer.<ref>Large, pp. 98\u201399 and p. 160</ref> Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, and fell in love with Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiov\u00e1, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859\u201360 winter.<ref name=Ottlov3 /> The marriage took place the following year, on 10 July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in [[Stockholm]], attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zde\u0148ka, was born in September 1861.<ref name=Clap28>Clapham (1972), pp. 28\u201330</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the defeat of Franz Joseph's army at [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] in 1859 had weakened the Habsburg Empire, and led to the fall from power of von Bach.<ref>Large, p. 114</ref> This had gradually brought a more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture.<ref name=Schonberg77>Schonberg, p. 77</ref><ref name=Clap28 /> Before deciding his own future, in September Smetana set out on a concert tour of the Netherlands and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure.<ref name=Clap28 /> Back in Prague, he conducted performances of ''Richard III'' and ''Wallenstein's Camp'' in the \u017dof\u00edn Island concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the \"New German\" school represented primarily by Liszt;<ref>Clapham (1980) p. 393</ref> Smetana responded that \"a prophet is without honour in his own land.\"<ref name=Clap28 /> In March 1862 he made a last brief visit to Gothenburg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to him a provincial backwater and, whatever the difficulties, he now determined to seek his musical future in Prague: \"My home has rooted itself into my heart so much that only there do I find real contentment. It is to this that I will sacrifice myself.\"<ref>Large, p. 120</ref>\n\n===National prominence===\n\n====Seeking recognition====\nIn 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera.<ref>The official title for this theatre was the \"Royal Provincial Czech Theatre\" ({{cite encyclopedia|last= Ottlov\u00e1|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist,<ref name=Large140>Large, pp. 140\u201343</ref> and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by [[Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto of Brandenburg]].

He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; ''The Three Riders'' and ''The Renegade'' were performed at concerts in early 1863.<ref name=Large121>Large, pp. 121\u201325</ref> In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Um\u011bleck\u00e1 Beseda, a society for Czech artists.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper ''N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy''.<ref>Newmarch, p. 62</ref> Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Bo\u017eena.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 33</ref>\n\nOn 23 April 1864, Smetana conducted Berlioz's [[choral symphony]] ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (Berlioz)|Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'' at a concert celebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary, adding to the programme his own ''March for the Shakespearean Festival''.<ref name=Clap32 /><ref name=Ottlov4 /> That year, Smetana's bid to become Director of the [[Prague Conservatory]] failed. He had set high hopes on this appointment: \"My friends are trying to persuade me that this post might have been especially created for me,\" he wrote to a Swedish friend.<ref>Large, p. 134</ref> Again his hopes were thwarted by his association with the perceived radical Liszt, and the appointing committee chose the conservative patriot Josef Krej\u010d\u00ed for the post.<ref>Clapham (1980), p. 394</ref>\n\n[[File:Dvorak Bedrich Smetana and friends in 1865.jpg|thumbnail|''Bed\u0159ich Smetana Among his Friends'', 1865; oil painting by [[Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (painter)|Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]]]\nAlmost three years passed before Smetana was declared the winner of Harrach's opera competition.<ref name=Clap32 /> Before then, on 5 January 1866, ''The Brandenburgers'' had been performed to an enthusiastic reception at the Provisional Theatre\u2014over strong opposition from Ma\u00fdr, who had refused to rehearse or conduct the piece. The idiom was too advanced for Ma\u00fdr's liking, and the opera was eventually staged under the composer's own direction.<ref name=Clap32 /> \"I was called on stage nine times,\" Smetana wrote, recording that the house was sold out and that the critics were full of praise.<ref name=Large145>Large, p. 145</ref> Music historian [[Rosa Newmarch]] believes that, although ''The Brandenburgers'' has not stood the test of time, it contains all the germs of Smetana's operatic art.<ref>Newmarch, p. 64</ref>\n\n====Opera maestro====\nIn July 1863, Sabina had delivered the libretto for a second opera, a light comedy entitled ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'', which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because of the success of ''The Brandenburgers'', the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30 May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> The opera went through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation.<ref name=Large167>Large, pp. 167\u201368</ref><ref>Large, pp. 399\u2013408</ref> The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on one of the hottest evenings of the year, on the eve of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by [[Prussia]]n troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs.<ref name=Large165>Large, pp. 165\u201367</ref> When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it was a tremendous public success.<ref name=\"Newmarch, p. 69\">Newmarch, p. 69</ref>\n\nBack in 1866, as the composer of ''The Brandenburgers'' with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana thought he might be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased.<ref name=Large165 /> He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition\u2014appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200&nbsp;gulden.<ref name=Clap34 /> In the absence of a body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], Mozart, [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and Glinka, with a revival of his own ''Bartered Bride''.<ref name=Large167 /><ref name=Clap34>Clapham (1972), pp. 34\u201336</ref> The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' angered Glinka's champion [[Mily Balakirev]], who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men.<ref name=Clap34 /><ref>Large, pp. 209\u201310</ref> On 28 February 1868 Smetana conducted another national opera by another Slavic composer, ''[[Halka]]'' by [[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]]. On 16 May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]];<ref name=\"Newmarch, p. 69\" /> he had written a ''Festive Overture'' for the occasion. That same evening Smetana's third opera, ''[[Dalibor (opera)|Dalibor]]'', was premi\u00e8red at Prague's New Town Theatre.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.<ref name=Large197>Large, p. 197</ref>\n\n====Opposition====\nEarly in his Provisional Theatre conductorship Smetana had made a powerful enemy in Franti\u0161ek Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana, Pivoda was aggrieved when the conductor recruited singing talent from abroad rather than from Pivoda's school.<ref>Steen, p. 701</ref><ref>Clapham (1980) p. 394</ref> In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda claimed that Smetana was using his position to further his own career, at the expense of other composers.<ref name=Clap40>Clapham (1972), pp. 38\u201340</ref>\n\nPivoda then took issue with ''Dalibor'', calling it an example of extreme \"Wagnerism\" and thus, unsuited as a model for Czech national opera.<ref>Newmarch, p. 71</ref> \"Wagnerism\" meant the adoption of Wagner's theories of a continuous role for the orchestra and the building of an integrated musical drama, rather than a stringing together of lyrical numbers.<ref name=Ottlov4 /><ref name=Newmarch65 /> The Provisional Theatre's chairman, Franti\u0161ek Rieger, had first accused Smetana of Wagnerist tendencies after the first performance of ''The Brandenburgers'',<ref name=Large145 /> and the issue eventually divided Prague's musical society. The music critic [[Otakar Hostinsk\u00fd]] believed that [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s theories should be the basis of the national opera, and argued that ''Dalibor'' was the beginning of the \"correct\" direction. The opposite camp, led by Pivoda, supported the principles of [[Italian opera]], in which the voice rather than the orchestra was the predominant dramatic device.<ref name=Ottlov4 />\n\nEven within the theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a campaign to eject Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Ma\u00fdr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86&nbsp;subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation.<ref name=Clap40 /> Strong support from vice-chairman Anton\u00edn \u010c\u00edsek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.<ref name=Ottlov4 /><ref name=Clap40 />\n\nSmetana gradually brought more operas by emergent Czech composers to the theatre, but little of his own work.<ref name=Clap40 /> By 1872 he had completed his monumental fourth opera, ''[[Libu\u0161e (opera)|Libu\u0161e]]'', his most ambitious work to date,<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 99</ref> but was withholding its premiere for the future opening of the forthcoming National Theatre.<ref>Large, p. 220</ref> The machinations of Pivoda and his supporters distracted Smetana from composition,<ref name=Clap40 /> and he had further vexation when ''The Bartered Bride'' was produced in [[Saint Petersburg]], in January 1871. Although the audience was enthusiastic,<ref name=Clap40 /> press reports were hostile, one describing the work as \"no better than that of a gifted fourteen-year-old boy.\"<ref name=Large171>Large, p. 171</ref> Smetana was deeply offended, and blamed his old adversary, Balakirev, for inciting negative feelings against the opera.<ref name=Large171 />\n\n===Final decade===\n[[File:Smetana-old-age.jpg|thumb|upright|Smetana in about 1883, near the end of his life]]\n\n====Deafness====\nIn the respite following his reappointment, Smetana concentrated on his fifth opera, ''[[The Two Widows]]'', composed between June 1873 and January 1874.<ref name=Clap41>Clapham (1972), pp. 41\u201342</ref> After its first performance at the Provisional Theatre on 27 March 1874, Smetana's supporters presented him with a decorative baton.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> But his opponents continued to attack him, comparing his conductorship unfavourably with the Ma\u00fdr regime and claiming that under Smetana \"Czech opera sickens to death at least once annually.\"<ref name=Clap41 /> By the summer Smetana was ill; a throat infection was followed by a rash and an apparent blockage to the ears. By mid-August, unable to work, he transferred his duties to his deputy, [[Adolf \u010cech]]. A press announcement stated that Smetana had \"become ill as a result of nervous strain caused by certain people recently.\"<ref name=Clap41 />\n\nIn September, Smetana told the theatre he would resign his appointment unless his health improved.<ref name=Clap43>Clapham (1972), pp. 43\u201345</ref> He had become totally deaf in his right ear, and in October lost all hearing in his left ear also. After his subsequent resignation the theatre offered him an annual pension of 1,200&nbsp;gulden for the continued right to perform his operas, an arrangement Smetana reluctantly accepted.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 44. It appears (Clapham, 1972, pp. 48\u201349) that this pension was withheld from time to time, causing Smetana much financial hardship.</ref> Money raised in Prague by former students, and by former lover Fr\u00f6jda Benecke in Gothenburg, amounted to 1,244&nbsp;gulden.<ref>Large, pp. 294\u201395</ref> This allowed Smetana to seek medical treatment abroad, but to no avail.<ref name=Ottlov4 /> In January 1875 Smetana wrote in his journal: \"If my disease is incurable, then I should prefer to be liberated from this life.\"<ref>Large, p. 303</ref> His spirits were further lowered at this time by a deterioration in his relationship with Bettina, mainly over money matters.<ref>Large, pp. 322\u201323</ref> \"I cannot live under the same roof as a person who hates and persecutes me,\" Smetana informed her.<ref>Large, p. 374, from an undated letter to Bettina</ref> Although divorce was considered, the couple stayed unhappily together.<ref>Large, p. 374</ref>\n\n====Late flowering====\nIn worsening health, Smetana continued to compose. In June 1876 he, Bettina, and their two daughters left Prague for [[Jabkenice]], the home of his eldest daughter \u017dofie where, in tranquil surroundings, Smetana was able to work undisturbed.<ref>Steen, p. 702</ref> Before leaving Prague he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems, called ''[[M\u00e1 vlast]]'' (\"My Fatherland\"),<ref>Originally, the work was entitled simply ''Vlast'' (\"Fatherland\").

As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public's lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously,<ref name=Large121 /> and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his \"prophet without honour\" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of ''Richard III'' and ''Wallenstein's Camp'' at \u017dof\u00edn Island in January 1862.<ref>Large, p. 119</ref>\n\nSmetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera ''The Brandenburgers in Bohemia'', in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, ''The Bartered Bride'', survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, ''Dalibor'', closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song.<ref>Large, pp. 204\u201305</ref><ref name=Clapham36 /> It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances.<ref name=Clapham36>Clapham (1972), p. 36</ref> Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874.\n\nIn his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition.

No imperial power in India based on the Indo-Gangetic plains could be secure if a rival centre of power existed on its flank in Rajputana.<ref name=\"Chandra\"/> The Mughals had already established domination over parts of northern Rajputana in [[Mewar|Mewat]], [[Ajmer]], and Nagor.<ref name=\"Richards2\"/><ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Now, Akbar was determined to drive into the heartlands of the [[Rajput]] kings that had never previously submitted to the Muslim rulers of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Beginning in 1561, the Mughals actively engaged the Rajputs in warfare and diplomacy.<ref name=\"Richards4\"/> Most Rajput states accepted Akbar's suzerainty; the rulers of Mewar and Marwar, [[Udai Singh II|Udai Singh]] and [[Chandrasen Rathore]], however, remained outside the imperial fold.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Rana Udai Singh was descended from the Sisodia ruler, [[Rana Sanga]], who had died fighting Babur at the [[Battle of Khanwa]] in 1527.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> As the head of the Sisodia clan, he possessed the highest ritual status of all the Rajput kings and chieftains in India.

The fortress-capital of Mewar was of great strategic importance as it lay on the shortest route from Agra to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat]] and was also considered a key to holding the interior parts of Rajputana.

Moreover, Akbar had received invitations from cliques in Gujarat to oust the reigning king, which served as justification for his military expedition.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> In 1572, he moved to occupy [[Ahmedabad]], the capital, and other northern cities, and was proclaimed the lawful sovereign of Gujarat. By 1573, he had driven out the Mirzas who, after offering token resistance, fled for refuge in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. [[Surat]], the commercial capital of the region and other coastal cities soon capitulated to the Mughals.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> The king, [[Muzaffar Shah III]], was caught hiding in a corn field; he was pensioned off by Akbar with a small allowance.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/>\n\nHaving established his authority over Gujarat, Akbar returned to Fatehpur Sikiri, where he built the [[Buland Darwaza]] to commemorate his victories, but a rebellion by Afghan nobles supported by the Rajput ruler of [[Idar]], and the renewed intrigues of the Mirzas forced his return to Gujarat.<ref name=\"Richards5\"/> Akbar crossed the Rajputana and reached Ahmedabad in eleven days \u2013 a journey that normally took six weeks. The outnumbered Mughal army then won a decisive victory on 2 September 1573. Akbar slew the rebel leaders and erected a tower out of their severed heads.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> The conquest and subjugation of Gujarat proved highly profitable for the Mughals; the territory yielded a revenue of more than five million rupees annually to Akbar's treasury, after expenses.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/>\n\nAkbar had now defeated most of the Afghan remnants in India. The only centre of Afghan power was now in Bengal, where Sulaiman Khan Karrani, an Afghan chieftain whose family had served under Sher Shah Suri, was reigning in power.

Only [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] was left in the hands of the [[Karrani dynasty]] as a fief of the Mughal Empire. A year later, however, Daud Khan rebelled and attempted to regain Bengal. He was defeated by the Mughal general, [[Khan Jahan I|Khan Jahan Quli]], and had to flee into exile. Daud Khan was later captured and executed by Mughal forces.

He besieged [[Ahmednagar Fort]] in 1595, forcing [[Chand Bibi]] to cede [[Berar Subah|Berar]]. A subsequent revolt forced Akbar to take the fort in August 1600. Akbar occupied [[Burhanpur]] and besieged [[Asirgarh Fort]] in 1599, and took it on 17 January 1601, when Miran Bahadur Shah refused to submit [[Khandesh]]. Akbar then established the [[Subah (province)|Subahs]] of Ahmadnagar, Berar and Khandesh under Prince Daniyal. \"By the time of his death in 1605, Akbar controlled a broad sweep of territory from the Bay of Bengal to Qandahar and Badakshan.

The ''mir bakshi'' was in charge of intelligence gathering, and also made recommendations to the emperor for military appointments and promotions.\n* The ''mir saman'' was in charge of the imperial household, including the harems, and supervised the functioning of the court and royal bodyguard.\n* The judiciary was a separate organisation headed by a chief ''[[qazi]]'', who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices\n\n===Taxation===\nAkbar set about reforming the administration of his empire's land revenue by adopting a system that had been used by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. A cultivated area where crops grew well was measured and taxed through fixed rates based on the area's crop and productivity. However, this placed hardship on the peasantry because tax rates were fixed on the basis of prices prevailing in the imperial court, which were often higher than those in the countryside.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=233}}</ref> Akbar changed to a decentralised system of annual assessment, but this resulted in corruption among local officials and was abandoned in 1580, to be replaced by a system called the ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}''.<ref name=\"dahsala\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=234}}</ref> Under the new system, revenue was calculated as one-third of the average produce of the previous ten years, to be paid to the state in cash. This system was later refined, taking into account local prices, and grouping areas with similar productivity into assessment circles. Remission was given to peasants when the harvest failed during times of flood or drought.<ref name=\"dahsala\"/> Akbar's ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}'' system (also known as ''{{transl|bn|zabti}})'' is credited to [[Raja Todar Mal]], who also served as a revenue officer under Sher Shah Suri,<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=236}}</ref> and the structure of the revenue administration was set out by the latter in a detailed memorandum submitted to the emperor in 1582\u201383.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=160}}</ref>\n\nOther local methods of assessment continued in some areas. Land which was fallow or uncultivated was charged at concessional rates.<ref name=\"localassessment\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=235}}</ref> Akbar also actively encouraged the improvement and extension of agriculture. The village continued to remain the primary unit of revenue assessment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|pp=164\u2013165}}</ref> [[Zamindar]]s of every area were required to provide loans and agricultural implements in times of need, to encourage farmers to plough as much land as possible and to sow seeds of superior quality. In turn, the zamindars were given a hereditary right to collect a share of the produce. Peasants had a hereditary right to cultivate the land as long as they paid the land revenue.<ref name=\"localassessment\"/> While the revenue assessment system showed concern for the small peasantry, it also maintained a level of distrust towards the revenue officials. Revenue officials were guaranteed only three-quarters of their salary, with the remaining quarter dependent on their full realisation of the revenue assessed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=165}}</ref>\n\n===Military organization===\n{{Main|Mansabdari}}\n[[File:The Adventures of Akbar artillery.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mughal Army]] [[artillery]] men during the reign of Akbar]]\n\nAkbar organised his army as well as the nobility by means of a system called the ''mansabdari''. Under this system, each officer in the army was assigned a rank (a ''mansabdar''), and assigned a number of [[cavalry]] that he had to supply to the imperial army.<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\"/> The ''mansabdars'' were divided into 33 classes. The top three commanding ranks, ranging from 7000 to 10000 troops, were normally reserved for princes. Other ranks between 10 and 5000 were assigned to other members of the nobility. The empire's permanent [[standing army]] was quite small and the imperial forces mostly consisted of contingents maintained by the ''mansabdars''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=359}}</ref> Persons were normally appointed to a low ''mansab'' and then promoted, based on their merit as well as the favour of the emperor.<ref name=\"mansabdari\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=238}}</ref> Each ''mansabdar'' was required to maintain a certain number of cavalrymen and twice that number of horses. The number of horses was greater because they had to be rested and rapidly replaced in times of war. Akbar employed strict measures to ensure that the quality of the armed forces was maintained at a high level; horses were regularly inspected and only [[Arabian horse]]s were normally employed.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=237}}</ref> The ''mansabdars'' were remunerated well for their services and constituted the highest paid military service in the world at the time.<ref name=\"mansabdari\"/>\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Audienzhalle.jpg|thumb|''Diwan-i-Khas'' (Hall of Private Audience) in Fatehpur Sikri]]\n\nAkbar was a follower of [[Salim Chishti]], a [[Asceticism|holy man]] who lived in the region of Sikri near Agra. Believing the area to be a lucky one for himself, he had a mosque constructed there for the use of the priest. Subsequently, he celebrated the victories over Chittor and Ranthambore by laying the foundation of a new walled capital, {{convert|23|mi|km}} west of Agra in 1569, which was named Fatehpur (\"''town of victory''\") after the conquest of Gujarat in 1573 and subsequently came to be known as [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in order to distinguish it from other similarly named towns.<ref name=\"earlyconquest\"/> Palaces for each of Akbar's senior queens, a huge artificial lake, and sumptuous water-filled courtyards were built there. However, the city was soon abandoned and the capital was moved to [[Lahore]] in 1585. The reason may have been that the water supply in Fatehpur Sikri was insufficient or of poor quality. Or, as some historians believe, Akbar had to attend to the northwest areas of his empire and therefore moved his capital northwest. Other sources indicate Akbar simply lost interest in the city<ref>Petersen, A. (1996). ''Dictionary of Islamic Architecture''. New York: Routledge.</ref> or realised it was not militarily defensible. In 1599, Akbar shifted his capital back to Agra from where he reigned until his death.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Trade===\nThe reign of Akbar was characterised by commercial expansion.<ref name=\"Economy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html#n10|title=Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals|publisher=columbia.edu |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref> The Mughal government encouraged traders, provided protection and security for transactions, and levied a very low custom duty to stimulate foreign trade. Furthermore, it strived to foster a climate conductive to commerce by requiring local administrators to provide restitution to traders for goods stolen while in their territory. To minimise such incidents, bands of highway police called ''{{transl|bn|rahdars}}'' were enlisted to patrol roads and ensure safety of traders.

The coins of Akbar set a new chapter in India's numismatic history.<ref>Mughals coins, https://www.indian-coins.com/joomla/index.php/coins-catalogue/akbar-coins</ref> The coins of Akbar's grandfather, Babur, and father, Humayun, are basic and devoid of any innovation as the former was busy establishing the foundations of the Mughal rule in India while the latter was ousted by the Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, and returned to the throne only to die a year later. While the reign of both Babur and Humayun represented turmoil, Akbar's relative long reign of 50 years allowed him to experiment with coinage.\n\nAkbar introduced coins with decorative floral motifs, dotted borders, quatrefoil and other types. His coins were both round and square in shape with a unique 'mehrab' (lozenge) shape coin highlighting numismatic calligraphy at its best.<ref>Coins of Akbar, https://www.mintageworld.com/blog/coins-of-akbar/</ref> Akbar's portrait type gold coin (Mohur) is generally attributed to his son, Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir), who had rebelled and then sought reconciliation thereafter by minting and presenting his father with gold Mohur's bearing Akbar's portrait. The tolerant view of Akbar is represented by the 'Ram-Sita' silver coin type while during the latter part of Akbar's reign, we see coins portraying the concept of Akbar's newly promoted religion 'Din-e-ilahi' with the Ilahi type and Jalla Jalal-Hu type coins.\n\nThe coins,<ref>Mughal Empire coins and Rulers, http://www.chiefacoins.com/Database/Countries/Mughal.htm</ref> left, represent examples of these innovative concepts introduced by Akbar that set the precedent for Mughal coins which was refined and perfected by his son, Jahangir, and later by his grandson, Shah Jahan.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n\n===Matrimonial alliances===\nThe practice of arranging marriages between Hindu princesses and Muslim kings was known much before Akbar's time, but in most cases these marriages did not lead to any stable relations between the families involved, and the women were lost to their families and did not return after marriage.<ref name=\"Eraly\">{{cite book|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne, The Saga of the Great Mughals|last=Eraly|first=Abraham|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2000|page=136|isbn=0-14-100143-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/><ref name=\"Sarkar 37\">{{harvnb|Sarkar|1984|p=37}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances marked a departure in India from previous practice in that the marriage itself marked the beginning of a new order of relations, wherein the Hindu Rajputs who married their daughters or sisters to him would be treated on par with his Muslim fathers-in-law and brothers in-law in all respects except being able to dine and pray with him or take Muslim wives. These Rajputs were made members of his court and their daughters' or sisters' marriage to a Muslim ceased to be a sign of degradation, except for certain proud elements who still considered it a sign of humiliation.<ref name=\"Sarkar 37\"/>\n\n[[File:Birth of jahangir.jpg|thumb|Birth of Salim, the future emperor Jahangir]]\n\nThe [[Kacchwaha]] [[Rajput]], Raja [[Bharmal]], of the small kingdom of [[Amer, India|Amer]], who had come to Akbar's court shortly after the latter's accession, entered into an alliance by giving his daughter in marriage to the emperor. Bharmal was made a noble of high rank in the imperial court, and subsequently his son [[Bhagwant Das]] and grandson [[Man Singh]] also rose to high ranks in the nobility.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\">{{Harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=243}}</ref>\n\nOther Rajput kingdoms also established matrimonial alliances with Akbar, but matrimony was not insisted on as a precondition for forming alliances. Two major Rajput clans remained aloof \u2013 the [[Sisodiya]]s of [[Mewar]] and [[Hada (clan)|Hadas]] of Ranthambore. In another turning point of Akbar's reign, [[Raja Man Singh]] I of Amber went with Akbar to meet the Hada leader, Surjan Hada, to effect an alliance. Surjan accepted an alliance on the condition that Akbar did not marry any of his daughters. Consequently, no matrimonial alliance was entered into, yet Surjan was made a noble and placed in charge of Garh-Katanga.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/>\n\nThe political effect of these alliances was significant. While some Rajput women who entered Akbar's harem converted to Islam, they were generally provided full religious freedom, and their relatives, who continued to remain Hindu, formed a significant part of the nobility and served to articulate the opinions of the majority of the common populace in the imperial court.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/> The interaction between Hindu and Muslim nobles in the imperial court resulted in exchange of thoughts and blending of the two cultures. Further, newer generations of the Mughal line represented a merger of Mughal and Rajput blood, thereby strengthening ties between the two. As a result, the Rajputs became the strongest allies of the Mughals, and Rajput soldiers and generals fought for the Mughal army under Akbar, leading it in several campaigns including the conquest of Gujarat in 1572.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1984|pp=38\u201340}}</ref> Akbar's policy of religious tolerance ensured that employment in the imperial administration was open to all on merit irrespective of creed, and this led to an increase in the strength of the administrative services of the empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1984|p=38}}</ref>\n\nAnother legend is that Akbar's daughter Meherunnissa was enamoured by [[Tansen]] and had a role in his coming to Akbar's court.<ref name=dawn>{{cite news\n | title =        Profile: Tansen \u2013 the mesmerizing maestro\n | author =       Maryam Juzer Kherulla\n | publisher =    [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | url =          http://dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/021012/yworld5.htm\n | date =         12 October 2002\n | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20071121000709/http://dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/021012/yworld5.htm\n | archive-date=  2007-11-21\n | accessdate =   2007-10-02\n}}</ref> Tansen converted to [[Islam]] from [[Hinduism]], apparently on the eve of his marriage with Akbar's daughter.<ref>India Divided, By Rajendra Prasad, p. 63</ref><ref>A History of Hindi Literature, By F.

He often plunged on his horse into the flooded river during the rainy seasons and safely crossed it. He rarely indulged in cruelty and is said to have been affectionate towards his relatives.

He firmly entrenched the authority of the Mughal Empire in India and beyond, after it had been threatened by the Afghans during his father's reign,<ref>{{Harvnb|Habib|1997|p=79}}</ref> establishing its military and diplomatic superiority.<ref>{{Harvnb|Majumdar|1984|p=170}}</ref> During his reign, the nature of the state changed to a secular and liberal one, with emphasis on cultural integration. He also introduced several far-sighted social reforms, including prohibiting ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'', legalising widow remarriage and raising the age of marriage. [[Folklore|Folk tales]] revolving around him and Birbal, one of his ''navratnas'', are popular in India.\n\n''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'' is a minor ''[[Purana]]'' that depicts the various Hindu holy days and includes a section devoted to the various dynasties that ruled India, dating its oldest portion to 500 CE and newest to the 18th century. It contains a story about Akbar in which he is compared to the other Mughal rulers. The section called \"Akbar Bahshaha Varnan\", written in Sanskrit, describes his birth as a \"[[reincarnation]]\" of a sage who immolated himself on seeing the first Mughal ruler Babur, who is described as the \"cruel king of Mlecchas (Muslims)\". In this text it is stated that Akbar \"was a miraculous child\" and that he would not follow the previous \"violent ways\" of the Mughals.<ref name=\"Khanna, Culture of Medieval India\">{{cite book|author=Meenakshi Khanna|title=Cultural History Of Medieval India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbKv3zyIFD8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA24#v=onepage |year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-81-87358-30-5|pages=34\u201335 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref><ref name=\"Review colonial record\">{{cite book|title=The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review and Oriental and Colonial Record|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialandasia00unkngoog |year=1900|publisher=Oriental Institute|pages=[https://archive.org/details/imperialandasia00unkngoog/page/n166 158]\u2013161 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref>\n\nCiting Akbar's melding of the disparate 'fiefdoms' of India into the [[Mughal Empire]] as well as the lasting legacy of \"pluralism and tolerance\" that \"underlies the values of the modern republic of India\", [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] included his name in its list of top 25 world leaders.<ref name=time>{{cite journal |last=Tharoor |first=Ishaan |date=4 February 2011 |title=Top 25 Political Icons:Akbar the Great |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2046303,00.html |journal=Time}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, his legacy is explicitly negative in [[Pakistan]] for the same reasons. Historian [[Mubarak Ali]], while studying the image of Akbar in Pakistani textbooks, observes that Akbar \"is conveniently ignored and not mentioned in any school textbook from class one to matriculation\", as opposed to the omnipresence of [[emperor Aurangzeb]]. He quotes historian [[Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi]], who said that, due to his religious tolerance, \"Akbar had so weakened Islam through his policies that it could not be restored to its dominant position in the affairs.\" A common thread among Pakistani historians is to blame Akbar's [[Rajput]] policy. As a conclusion, after analyzing many textbooks, Mubarak Ali says that \"Akbar is criticized for bringing Muslims and Hindus together as one nation and putting the separate identity of the Muslims in danger. This policy of Akbar contradicts the [[Two-nation theory|theory of Two-Nation]] and therefore makes him an unpopular figure in Pakistan.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ali |first=Mubarak |date=September\u2013October 1992 |title=Akbar in Pakistani Textbooks |journal=Social Scientist |volume=20 |issue=9/10 |pages=73\u201376 |jstor=3517719|doi=10.2307/3517719 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}\n;Films and television\n* Akbar was portrayed in the award-winning 1960 [[Bollywood|Hindi movie]] ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (The great Mughal), in which his character was played by [[Prithviraj Kapoor]].\n* Akbar was portrayed by [[Hrithik Roshan]] in the 2008 Bollywood film ''[[Jodhaa Akbar]]''.\n* Akbar and Birbal were portrayed in the Hindi series ''Akbar-Birbal'' aired on [[Zee TV]] in late 1990s where Akbar's role was played by [[Vikram Gokhale]].\n* A television series, called ''Akbar the Great'', directed by [[Akbar Khan (director)|Akbar Khan]] was aired on [[DD National]] in the 1990s.\n* Since 2013\u20132015, a television series, called ''[[Jodha Akbar (TV series)|Jodha Akbar]]'' aired on Zee TV, in which the role of Akbar was played by actor [[Rajat Tokas]].\n* Akbar was portrayed by [[Uday Tikekar]] in [[EPIC (TV channel)|EPIC]] channel's critically acclaimed historical drama ''[[Siyaasat]]'' (based on the novel ''The Twentieth Wife'').\n* In [[Sony TV]]'s historical drama ''[[Bharat Ka Veer Putra \u2013 Maharana Pratap]]'', Akbar was at first portrayed by [[Krip Suri]] and later by [[Avinesh Rekhi]].\n* Akbar is portrayed by [[Kiku Sharda]] in [[BIG Magic]]'s sitcom ''[[Akbar Birbal]]''.\n* Abhishek Nigam portrayed Akbar in BIG MAGIC's historical drama ''Akbar \u2013 Rakht Se Takht Tak Ka Safar''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Farzeen|first1=Sana|title=Abhishek Nigam to play the grown-up Akbar in Big Magic show|url=http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/abhishek-nigam-play-the-grown-akbar-big-magic-show-170411|website=Tellychakkar.com|publisher=Tellychakkar.com|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Mohammed Iqbal Khan]] played the role of Akbar in ABP News' documentary series, [[Bharatvarsh (TV series)|Bharatvarsh]].\n*[[Shahbaz Khan (actor)|Shahbaz Khan]] played the role of Akbar in Colors television show [[Dastaan-E-Mohabbat Salim Anarkali]]\n\n;Fiction\n* Akbar is a principal character in [[Indu Sundaresan]]'s award-winning historical novel ''The Twentieth Wife'' (2002) as well as in its sequel ''The Feast of Roses'' (2003).\n* A fictionalised Akbar plays an important supporting role in [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s 2002 novel, ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]''.\n* Akbar is also a major character in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s 2008 novel ''[[The Enchantress of Florence]]''.\n* [[Bertrice Small]] is known for incorporating historical figures as primary characters in her romance novels, and Akbar is no exception.

Akbar succeeded his father, [[Humayun]], under a regent, [[Bairam Khan]], who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in India.\n\nA strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the [[Mughal Empire]] to include much of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strove to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an [[Indo-Persian culture]], to himself as an emperor.\n\nMughal India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture. Akbar himself was a patron of art and culture. He was fond of literature, and created a library of over 24,000 volumes written in [[Sanskrit]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], staffed by many scholars, translators, artists, [[calligraphers]], scribes, bookbinders and readers. He did much of the cataloging himself through three main groupings.<ref name=\"Murray, Stuart 2009\">Murray, Stuart. 2009. The library: an illustrated history. Chicago, ALA Editions</ref> Akbar also established the library of Fatehpur Sikri exclusively for women,{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis, Jr.|1994|p=273}} and he decreed that schools for the education of both Muslims and Hindus should be established throughout the realm. He also encouraged bookbinding to become a high art.<ref name=\"Murray, Stuart 2009\"/> Holy men of many faiths, poets, architects, and artisans adorned his court from all over the world for study and discussion. Akbar's courts at [[Delhi]], [[Agra]], and [[Fatehpur Sikri]] became centres of the arts, letters, and learning. Perso-Islamic culture began to merge and blend with indigenous Indian elements, and a distinct Indo-Persian culture emerged characterized by Mughal style arts, [[Mughal painting|painting]], and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]]. Disillusioned with orthodox Islam and perhaps hoping to bring about religious unity within his empire, Akbar promulgated [[Din-i-Ilahi]], a syncretic creed derived mainly from [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]] as well as some parts of [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Christianity]].\n\nAkbar's reign significantly influenced the course of Indian history. During his rule, the Mughal Empire tripled in size and wealth. He created a powerful military system and instituted effective political and social reforms. By abolishing the [[Jizya|sectarian tax]] on non-Muslims and appointing them to high civil and military posts, he was the first Mughal ruler to win the trust and loyalty of the native subjects. He had [[Sanskrit literature]] translated, participated in native festivals, realising that a stable empire depended on the co-operation and good-will of his subjects. Thus, the foundations for a multicultural empire under Mughal rule were laid during his reign. Akbar was succeeded as emperor by his son, Prince Salim, later known as [[Jahangir]].\n\n==Early years==\nDefeated in battles at [[Chausa]] and [[Kannauj]] in 1539 to 1541 by the forces of [[Sher Shah Suri]], Mughal emperor [[Humayun]] fled westward to [[Sindh]].<ref name=\"Multiple5\">{{cite book|author=Banjerji, S.K.|title=Humayun Badshah|url=https://archive.org/details/humayunbadshah035068mbp|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1938}}</ref> There he met and married the then 14-year-old [[Hamida Banu Begum]], daughter of Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, a [[Persians|Persian]] teacher of Humayun's younger brother [[Hindal Mirza]].

No imperial power in India based on the Indo-Gangetic plains could be secure if a rival centre of power existed on its flank in Rajputana.<ref name=\"Chandra\"/> The Mughals had already established domination over parts of northern Rajputana in [[Mewar|Mewat]], [[Ajmer]], and Nagor.<ref name=\"Richards2\"/><ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Now, Akbar was determined to drive into the heartlands of the [[Rajput]] kings that had never previously submitted to the Muslim rulers of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Beginning in 1561, the Mughals actively engaged the Rajputs in warfare and diplomacy.<ref name=\"Richards4\"/> Most Rajput states accepted Akbar's suzerainty; the rulers of Mewar and Marwar, [[Udai Singh II|Udai Singh]] and [[Chandrasen Rathore]], however, remained outside the imperial fold.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Rana Udai Singh was descended from the Sisodia ruler, [[Rana Sanga]], who had died fighting Babur at the [[Battle of Khanwa]] in 1527.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> As the head of the Sisodia clan, he possessed the highest ritual status of all the Rajput kings and chieftains in India. Unless Udai Singh was reduced to submission, the imperial authority of the Mughals would be lessened in Rajput eyes.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Furthermore, Akbar, at this early period, was still enthusiastically devoted to the cause of Islam and sought to impress the superiority of his faith over the most prestigious warriors in Brahminical Hinduism.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/>\n\nIn 1567, Akbar moved to reduce the [[Chittor Fort]] in Mewar. The fortress-capital of Mewar was of great strategic importance as it lay on the shortest route from Agra to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat]] and was also considered a key to holding the interior parts of Rajputana.

Moreover, Akbar had received invitations from cliques in Gujarat to oust the reigning king, which served as justification for his military expedition.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> In 1572, he moved to occupy [[Ahmedabad]], the capital, and other northern cities, and was proclaimed the lawful sovereign of Gujarat. By 1573, he had driven out the Mirzas who, after offering token resistance, fled for refuge in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. [[Surat]], the commercial capital of the region and other coastal cities soon capitulated to the Mughals.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> The king, [[Muzaffar Shah III]], was caught hiding in a corn field; he was pensioned off by Akbar with a small allowance.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/>\n\nHaving established his authority over Gujarat, Akbar returned to Fatehpur Sikiri, where he built the [[Buland Darwaza]] to commemorate his victories, but a rebellion by Afghan nobles supported by the Rajput ruler of [[Idar]], and the renewed intrigues of the Mirzas forced his return to Gujarat.<ref name=\"Richards5\"/> Akbar crossed the Rajputana and reached Ahmedabad in eleven days \u2013 a journey that normally took six weeks. The outnumbered Mughal army then won a decisive victory on 2 September 1573. Akbar slew the rebel leaders and erected a tower out of their severed heads.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> The conquest and subjugation of Gujarat proved highly profitable for the Mughals; the territory yielded a revenue of more than five million rupees annually to Akbar's treasury, after expenses.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/>\n\nAkbar had now defeated most of the Afghan remnants in India. The only centre of Afghan power was now in Bengal, where Sulaiman Khan Karrani, an Afghan chieftain whose family had served under Sher Shah Suri, was reigning in power.

The Mughal army was subsequently victorious at the [[Battle of Tukaroi]] in 1575, which led to the annexation of Bengal and parts of Bihar that had been under the dominion of Daud Khan. Only [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] was left in the hands of the [[Karrani dynasty]] as a fief of the Mughal Empire. A year later, however, Daud Khan rebelled and attempted to regain Bengal. He was defeated by the Mughal general, [[Khan Jahan I|Khan Jahan Quli]], and had to flee into exile. Daud Khan was later captured and executed by Mughal forces.

He did not leave Fatehpur Sikri on a military campaign until 1581, when Punjab was again invaded by his brother, Mirza Muhammad Hakim.<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> Akbar expelled his brother to Kabul and this time pressed on, determined to end the threat from Muhammad Hakim once and for all.<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> In contrast to the problem that his predecessors once had in getting Mughal nobles to stay on in India, the problem now was to get them to leave India.<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> They were, according to Abul Fazl \"afraid of the cold of Afghanistan.\"<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> The Hindu officers, in turn, were additionally inhibited by the traditional taboo against crossing the Indus.

However, this placed hardship on the peasantry because tax rates were fixed on the basis of prices prevailing in the imperial court, which were often higher than those in the countryside.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=233}}</ref> Akbar changed to a decentralised system of annual assessment, but this resulted in corruption among local officials and was abandoned in 1580, to be replaced by a system called the ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}''.<ref name=\"dahsala\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=234}}</ref> Under the new system, revenue was calculated as one-third of the average produce of the previous ten years, to be paid to the state in cash. This system was later refined, taking into account local prices, and grouping areas with similar productivity into assessment circles. Remission was given to peasants when the harvest failed during times of flood or drought.<ref name=\"dahsala\"/> Akbar's ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}'' system (also known as ''{{transl|bn|zabti}})'' is credited to [[Raja Todar Mal]], who also served as a revenue officer under Sher Shah Suri,<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=236}}</ref> and the structure of the revenue administration was set out by the latter in a detailed memorandum submitted to the emperor in 1582\u201383.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=160}}</ref>\n\nOther local methods of assessment continued in some areas. Land which was fallow or uncultivated was charged at concessional rates.<ref name=\"localassessment\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=235}}</ref> Akbar also actively encouraged the improvement and extension of agriculture. The village continued to remain the primary unit of revenue assessment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|pp=164\u2013165}}</ref> [[Zamindar]]s of every area were required to provide loans and agricultural implements in times of need, to encourage farmers to plough as much land as possible and to sow seeds of superior quality. In turn, the zamindars were given a hereditary right to collect a share of the produce. Peasants had a hereditary right to cultivate the land as long as they paid the land revenue.<ref name=\"localassessment\"/> While the revenue assessment system showed concern for the small peasantry, it also maintained a level of distrust towards the revenue officials. Revenue officials were guaranteed only three-quarters of their salary, with the remaining quarter dependent on their full realisation of the revenue assessed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=165}}</ref>\n\n===Military organization===\n{{Main|Mansabdari}}\n[[File:The Adventures of Akbar artillery.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mughal Army]] [[artillery]] men during the reign of Akbar]]\n\nAkbar organised his army as well as the nobility by means of a system called the ''mansabdari''. Under this system, each officer in the army was assigned a rank (a ''mansabdar''), and assigned a number of [[cavalry]] that he had to supply to the imperial army.<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\"/> The ''mansabdars'' were divided into 33 classes. The top three commanding ranks, ranging from 7000 to 10000 troops, were normally reserved for princes. Other ranks between 10 and 5000 were assigned to other members of the nobility. The empire's permanent [[standing army]] was quite small and the imperial forces mostly consisted of contingents maintained by the ''mansabdars''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=359}}</ref> Persons were normally appointed to a low ''mansab'' and then promoted, based on their merit as well as the favour of the emperor.<ref name=\"mansabdari\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=238}}</ref> Each ''mansabdar'' was required to maintain a certain number of cavalrymen and twice that number of horses. The number of horses was greater because they had to be rested and rapidly replaced in times of war. Akbar employed strict measures to ensure that the quality of the armed forces was maintained at a high level; horses were regularly inspected and only [[Arabian horse]]s were normally employed.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=237}}</ref> The ''mansabdars'' were remunerated well for their services and constituted the highest paid military service in the world at the time.<ref name=\"mansabdari\"/>\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Audienzhalle.jpg|thumb|''Diwan-i-Khas'' (Hall of Private Audience) in Fatehpur Sikri]]\n\nAkbar was a follower of [[Salim Chishti]], a [[Asceticism|holy man]] who lived in the region of Sikri near Agra. Believing the area to be a lucky one for himself, he had a mosque constructed there for the use of the priest. Subsequently, he celebrated the victories over Chittor and Ranthambore by laying the foundation of a new walled capital, {{convert|23|mi|km}} west of Agra in 1569, which was named Fatehpur (\"''town of victory''\") after the conquest of Gujarat in 1573 and subsequently came to be known as [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in order to distinguish it from other similarly named towns.<ref name=\"earlyconquest\"/> Palaces for each of Akbar's senior queens, a huge artificial lake, and sumptuous water-filled courtyards were built there. However, the city was soon abandoned and the capital was moved to [[Lahore]] in 1585. The reason may have been that the water supply in Fatehpur Sikri was insufficient or of poor quality. Or, as some historians believe, Akbar had to attend to the northwest areas of his empire and therefore moved his capital northwest. Other sources indicate Akbar simply lost interest in the city<ref>Petersen, A. (1996). ''Dictionary of Islamic Architecture''. New York: Routledge.</ref> or realised it was not militarily defensible. In 1599, Akbar shifted his capital back to Agra from where he reigned until his death.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Trade===\nThe reign of Akbar was characterised by commercial expansion.<ref name=\"Economy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html#n10|title=Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals|publisher=columbia.edu |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref> The Mughal government encouraged traders, provided protection and security for transactions, and levied a very low custom duty to stimulate foreign trade. Furthermore, it strived to foster a climate conductive to commerce by requiring local administrators to provide restitution to traders for goods stolen while in their territory. To minimise such incidents, bands of highway police called ''{{transl|bn|rahdars}}'' were enlisted to patrol roads and ensure safety of traders. Other active measures taken included the construction and protection of routes of commerce and communications.<ref name=\"Levi\">{{Cite book\n| publisher = Brill\n| page = 39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qVkNBge8mIC&pg=PA39#v=onepage|isbn=978-90-04-12320-5\n| last =  Levi\n| first =  S.

The coins of Akbar set a new chapter in India's numismatic history.<ref>Mughals coins, https://www.indian-coins.com/joomla/index.php/coins-catalogue/akbar-coins</ref> The coins of Akbar's grandfather, Babur, and father, Humayun, are basic and devoid of any innovation as the former was busy establishing the foundations of the Mughal rule in India while the latter was ousted by the Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, and returned to the throne only to die a year later. While the reign of both Babur and Humayun represented turmoil, Akbar's relative long reign of 50 years allowed him to experiment with coinage.\n\nAkbar introduced coins with decorative floral motifs, dotted borders, quatrefoil and other types. His coins were both round and square in shape with a unique 'mehrab' (lozenge) shape coin highlighting numismatic calligraphy at its best.<ref>Coins of Akbar, https://www.mintageworld.com/blog/coins-of-akbar/</ref> Akbar's portrait type gold coin (Mohur) is generally attributed to his son, Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir), who had rebelled and then sought reconciliation thereafter by minting and presenting his father with gold Mohur's bearing Akbar's portrait. The tolerant view of Akbar is represented by the 'Ram-Sita' silver coin type while during the latter part of Akbar's reign, we see coins portraying the concept of Akbar's newly promoted religion 'Din-e-ilahi' with the Ilahi type and Jalla Jalal-Hu type coins.\n\nThe coins,<ref>Mughal Empire coins and Rulers, http://www.chiefacoins.com/Database/Countries/Mughal.htm</ref> left, represent examples of these innovative concepts introduced by Akbar that set the precedent for Mughal coins which was refined and perfected by his son, Jahangir, and later by his grandson, Shah Jahan.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n\n===Matrimonial alliances===\nThe practice of arranging marriages between Hindu princesses and Muslim kings was known much before Akbar's time, but in most cases these marriages did not lead to any stable relations between the families involved, and the women were lost to their families and did not return after marriage.<ref name=\"Eraly\">{{cite book|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne, The Saga of the Great Mughals|last=Eraly|first=Abraham|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2000|page=136|isbn=0-14-100143-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/><ref name=\"Sarkar 37\">{{harvnb|Sarkar|1984|p=37}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances marked a departure in India from previous practice in that the marriage itself marked the beginning of a new order of relations, wherein the Hindu Rajputs who married their daughters or sisters to him would be treated on par with his Muslim fathers-in-law and brothers in-law in all respects except being able to dine and pray with him or take Muslim wives. These Rajputs were made members of his court and their daughters' or sisters' marriage to a Muslim ceased to be a sign of degradation, except for certain proud elements who still considered it a sign of humiliation.<ref name=\"Sarkar 37\"/>\n\n[[File:Birth of jahangir.jpg|thumb|Birth of Salim, the future emperor Jahangir]]\n\nThe [[Kacchwaha]] [[Rajput]], Raja [[Bharmal]], of the small kingdom of [[Amer, India|Amer]], who had come to Akbar's court shortly after the latter's accession, entered into an alliance by giving his daughter in marriage to the emperor. Bharmal was made a noble of high rank in the imperial court, and subsequently his son [[Bhagwant Das]] and grandson [[Man Singh]] also rose to high ranks in the nobility.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\">{{Harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=243}}</ref>\n\nOther Rajput kingdoms also established matrimonial alliances with Akbar, but matrimony was not insisted on as a precondition for forming alliances. Two major Rajput clans remained aloof \u2013 the [[Sisodiya]]s of [[Mewar]] and [[Hada (clan)|Hadas]] of Ranthambore. In another turning point of Akbar's reign, [[Raja Man Singh]] I of Amber went with Akbar to meet the Hada leader, Surjan Hada, to effect an alliance. Surjan accepted an alliance on the condition that Akbar did not marry any of his daughters. Consequently, no matrimonial alliance was entered into, yet Surjan was made a noble and placed in charge of Garh-Katanga.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/>\n\nThe political effect of these alliances was significant. While some Rajput women who entered Akbar's harem converted to Islam, they were generally provided full religious freedom, and their relatives, who continued to remain Hindu, formed a significant part of the nobility and served to articulate the opinions of the majority of the common populace in the imperial court.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/> The interaction between Hindu and Muslim nobles in the imperial court resulted in exchange of thoughts and blending of the two cultures. Further, newer generations of the Mughal line represented a merger of Mughal and Rajput blood, thereby strengthening ties between the two. As a result, the Rajputs became the strongest allies of the Mughals, and Rajput soldiers and generals fought for the Mughal army under Akbar, leading it in several campaigns including the conquest of Gujarat in 1572.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1984|pp=38\u201340}}</ref> Akbar's policy of religious tolerance ensured that employment in the imperial administration was open to all on merit irrespective of creed, and this led to an increase in the strength of the administrative services of the empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1984|p=38}}</ref>\n\nAnother legend is that Akbar's daughter Meherunnissa was enamoured by [[Tansen]] and had a role in his coming to Akbar's court.<ref name=dawn>{{cite news\n | title =        Profile: Tansen \u2013 the mesmerizing maestro\n | author =       Maryam Juzer Kherulla\n | publisher =    [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | url =          http://dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/021012/yworld5.htm\n | date =         12 October 2002\n | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20071121000709/http://dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/021012/yworld5.htm\n | archive-date=  2007-11-21\n | accessdate =   2007-10-02\n}}</ref> Tansen converted to [[Islam]] from [[Hinduism]], apparently on the eve of his marriage with Akbar's daughter.<ref>India Divided, By Rajendra Prasad, p. 63</ref><ref>A History of Hindi Literature, By F.

As a consequence of this colonialism, all other trading entities were subject to the terms and conditions of the Portuguese, and this was resented by the rulers and traders of the time including [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Habib|1997|p=256}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Death of Sultan Bahadur in front of Diu against the Portuguese 1537 Akbar Nama end of 16th century.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Death of [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] at [[Siege of Diu|Diu]], in front of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1537<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Dodwell |editor-first=Henry H. |date=1929 |title=The Cambridge history of the British Empire |volume=Volume IV: British India, 1497\u20131858 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA14 |location=Cambridge |publisher=The University Press |page=14 |oclc=1473561}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the year 1572 the [[Mughal Empire]] annexed [[Gujarat]] and acquired its first access to the sea after local officials informed Akbar that the Portuguese had begun to exert control in the Indian Ocean.

An orthodox Muslim at the outset, he later came to be influenced by [[Sufi]] mysticism that was being preached in the country at that time, and moved away from orthodoxy, appointing to his court several talented people with liberal ideas, including Abul Fazl, [[Faizi]] and [[Birbal]]. In 1575, he built a hall called the [[Ibadat Khana]] (''\"House of Worship\"'') at Fatehpur Sikri, to which he invited theologians, mystics and selected courtiers renowned for their intellectual achievements and discussed matters of [[spirituality]] with them.<ref name=\"religion1\"/> These discussions, initially restricted to Muslims, were acrimonious and resulted in the participants shouting at and abusing each other. Upset by this, Akbar opened the Ibadat Khana to people of all religions as well as atheists, resulting in the scope of the discussions broadening and extending even into areas such as the validity of the [[Quran]] and the nature of God. This shocked the orthodox theologians, who sought to discredit Akbar by circulating rumours of his desire to forsake Islam.<ref name=\"religion6\"/>\n\nAkbar's effort to evolve a meeting point among the representatives of various religions was not very successful, as each of them attempted to assert the superiority of their respective religions by denouncing other religions.

As a conclusion, after analyzing many textbooks, Mubarak Ali says that \"Akbar is criticized for bringing Muslims and Hindus together as one nation and putting the separate identity of the Muslims in danger.

The growth of the film society movement in Kerala introduced the works of the French and Italian New Wave directors to the discerning Malayali film enthusiasts. [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]]'s first film, ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), brought Malayalam cinema to the international film arena. In 1973 [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], who was by then recognized as an important author in Malayalam, directed his first film, ''[[Nirmalyam]]'', which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]].\n\n[[G. Aravindan]] followed [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan|Adoor]]'s lead with his ''[[Uttarayanam]]'' in 1974. [[K. P. Kumaran]]'s ''Adhithi'' (1974) was another film which was acclaimed by the critics. [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematographers who won the National Award]] for their work on Malayalam films in the 1970s were [[Mankada Ravi Varma]] for ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), [[P.

Panikkar were products of the [[Pune Film Institute]].\nThe 1970s also saw the emergence of the notable director [[P. G. Viswambharan]] with his debut film ''Ozhukinethire'' and mythical film ''Sathyavan Savithri'', which was well accepted.\n\nAlso, commercial cinema in this period saw several worker-class themed films which mostly had [[M. G. Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Sudheer (Malayalam actor)|Sudheer]] in the lead followed by the emergence of a new genre of pure action-themed films, in a movement led by action star [[Jayan]] who is usually considered the first genuine commercial superstar of Malayalam cinema. However, this was short-lived, and almost ended with Jayan's untimely death while performing a [[stunt]] in ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (1980).\n\n== Socially Relevant Cinema ==\nThere has been many malayalam movies that are reflective of social issues. [[Ozhimuri]] unveils many subtle emotions, the importance of the freedom from a marriage for a woman and history behind the matrilineal marriage system and the period of transition to patriarchy. [[Virus_(2019_film)]] a medical thriller depicts how Kerala handled a Nipah outbreak. In the post Covid-19 world, this could be a great case study. [[Kumbalangi Nights]] vibrantly portrays men in different shades bringing out toxic masculinity and abuse to simple humanity.The story is based on a real incident that occurred at the time of the 2014 Lok Sabha election, when a police unit from Kerala was sent to a Maoist affected area of Chhattisgarh as part of election duty in [[unda(film)]]\n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Priyadarshan at a press conference for \u2018Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal\u2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Priyadarshan]]]]\nThe Malayalam cinema of this period was characterised by detailed [[screenplay]]s dealing with everyday life with a lucid narration of plot intermingling with humour and melancholy. This was aided by the [[cinematography]] and lighting. The films had warm background music. In 1981 Fazil directed Manjil Virinja Pookal the film also introduced superstar [[Mohanlal]] to the world. [[K. G. George]] released films including  ''[[Yavanika]]'' (1982), and ''[[Adaminte Vaariyellu]]'' (1984).\n\nThis was the period during which script writer [[M. T.

The growth of the film society movement in Kerala introduced the works of the French and Italian New Wave directors to the discerning Malayali film enthusiasts. [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]]'s first film, ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), brought Malayalam cinema to the international film arena. In 1973 [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], who was by then recognized as an important author in Malayalam, directed his first film, ''[[Nirmalyam]]'', which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]].\n\n[[G. Aravindan]] followed [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan|Adoor]]'s lead with his ''[[Uttarayanam]]'' in 1974. [[K. P. Kumaran]]'s ''Adhithi'' (1974) was another film which was acclaimed by the critics. [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematographers who won the National Award]] for their work on Malayalam films in the 1970s were [[Mankada Ravi Varma]] for ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), [[P.

Panikkar were products of the [[Pune Film Institute]].\nThe 1970s also saw the emergence of the notable director [[P. G. Viswambharan]] with his debut film ''Ozhukinethire'' and mythical film ''Sathyavan Savithri'', which was well accepted.\n\nAlso, commercial cinema in this period saw several worker-class themed films which mostly had [[M. G. Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Sudheer (Malayalam actor)|Sudheer]] in the lead followed by the emergence of a new genre of pure action-themed films, in a movement led by action star [[Jayan]] who is usually considered the first genuine commercial superstar of Malayalam cinema. However, this was short-lived, and almost ended with Jayan's untimely death while performing a [[stunt]] in ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (1980).\n\n== Socially Relevant Cinema ==\nThere has been many malayalam movies that are reflective of social issues. [[Ozhimuri]] unveils many subtle emotions, the importance of the freedom from a marriage for a woman and history behind the matrilineal marriage system and the period of transition to patriarchy. [[Virus_(2019_film)]] a medical thriller depicts how Kerala handled a Nipah outbreak. In the post Covid-19 world, this could be a great case study. [[Kumbalangi Nights]] vibrantly portrays men in different shades bringing out toxic masculinity and abuse to simple humanity. \n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Priyadarshan at a press conference for \u2018Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal\u2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Priyadarshan]]]]\nThe Malayalam cinema of this period was characterised by detailed [[screenplay]]s dealing with everyday life with a lucid narration of plot intermingling with humour and melancholy. This was aided by the [[cinematography]] and lighting. The films had warm background music. In 1981 Fazil directed Manjil Virinja Pookal the film also introduced superstar [[Mohanlal]] to the world. [[K. G. George]] released films including  ''[[Yavanika]]'' (1982), and ''[[Adaminte Vaariyellu]]'' (1984).\n\nThis was the period during which script writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] started teaming up with director [[Hariharan (director)|Hariharan]] to produce works like ''[[Panchagni]]'', ''[[Nakhakshathangal]]'', ''[[Aranyakam]]'' and ''[[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]]''.
