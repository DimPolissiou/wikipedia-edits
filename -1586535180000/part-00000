Drifting is traditionally done by [[clutch]] kicking, then intentionally oversteering and countersteering.\n\nAs a [[Motorsport|motoring]] discipline, drifting competitions were first popularized in Japan in the 1970s and further popularized by the 1995 manga series ''[[Initial D]]''. Drifting competitions are held worldwide and are judged according to the speed, angle, showmanship and line taken through a corner or set of corners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abdulrahim |first=M. |title=SAE Technical Paper Series |id=ITSD |chapter=On the Dynamics of Automobile Drifting |volume=1 |publisher=University of Florida |year=2006 |doi=10.4271/2006-01-1019 |citeseerx=10.1.1.103.9227 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origin ===\nJapan was the birthplace of drifting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKirdy |first1=Andrew |title=Drifting: Japan-born street sport roars onto global stage |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2017/10/04/more-sports/auto-racing/drifting-japan-born-street-sport-roars-onto-global-stage/#.W07Z9tIzaUm |website=The Japan Times |accessdate=18 July 2018 |date=October 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Banner |first1=Justin |title=The History of Drifting and The Future of Formula Drift |url=https://motoiq.com/The-History-of-Drifting-and-The-Future-of-Formula-Drift/ |website=MotoIQ |accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Legendary Toyota AE86 and the Origins of Drift Racing |url=https://injapan.gaijinpot.com/uncategorized/2013/07/02/origins-of-drift-racing-legendary-toyota-ae86/ |website=GaijinPot |accessdate=18 July 2018 |date=July 2, 2013}}</ref> It was most popular in the [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|All Japan Touring Car Championship]] races. Famous [[Motorcycle sport|motorcyclist]] turned driver [[Kunimitsu Takahashi]] was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s. This earned him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the spectacle of smoking tires. The [[bias-ply]] racing tires of the 1960s&ndash;1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip angle. As professional racers in Japan drove this way, so did street racers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dixon |first1=Chris |title=DRIVING; Drifting: The Fast Art of the Controlled Slide |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/07/travel/driving-drifting-the-fast-art-of-the-controlled-slide.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=18 July 2018 |date=May 7, 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[Keiichi Tsuchiya]], known as the {{Nihongo|\"Drift King\"|\u30c9\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\n|Dorifuto Kingu}}, became particularly interested by Takahashi's drift techniques. Tsuchiya began practicing his drifting skills on the [[T\u014dge|mountain roads]] of Japan, and quickly gained a reputation amongst the racing crowd. In 1987, several popular car magazines and tuning garages agreed to produce a video of Tsuchiya's drifting skills. The video, known as ''Pluspy'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVyxHVhNNgY|title=Keiichi Tsuchiya - Pluspy (part 1)|last=lnsania|date=6 August 2007|publisher=|access-date=29 March 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> became a hit and inspired many of the professional drifting drivers on the circuits today. In 1988, alongside [[Option (car magazine)|''Option'' magazine]] founder and [[Editing|chief editor]] Daijiro Inada, he helped to organize one of the first events specifically for drifting called the D1 Grand Prix. He has also drifted through every turn in [[Tsukuba Circuit]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Popularity ===\nOne of the earliest recorded drift events outside Japan took place in 1996 at [[Willow Springs Raceway]] in [[Willow Springs, Kern County, California|Willow Springs]], [[California]], hosted by the Japanese drifting magazine and organization [[Option (car magazine)|''Option'']]. Daijiro Inada (founder of the Japanese D1 Grand Prix), the [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] [[Funny Car]] [[Drag racing|drag racer]] Kenji Okazaki, and Keiichi Tsuchiya gave demonstrations in a [[Nissan 180SX]] that the magazine had brought over from Japan. Entrants included [[Rhys Millen]] and Bryan Norris.<ref>''Super Street'', Issue 4, December 1996</ref> Drifting has since exploded into a form of motorsport in North America, Australia, Asia and Europe.\n\nDrifting has evolved into a competitive sport where drivers compete (almost exclusively in rear-wheel-drive cars) to earn points from judges based on various factors. At the top levels of competition, the [[D1 Grand Prix]] in Japan pioneered the sport. Other events such as Drift Games Extreme (formally known as the IDC \u2014 Irish Drift Championship) in [[Ireland]], [[Formula D]] in the [[United States]], [[Drift Allstars]], King of Europe, Drift Masters and the [[British Drift Championship]] in Europe, [[World Drift Series|WDS]] in China, [[Russian Drift Series|RDS]] in Russia, [[Formula Drift Asia]] in the Malaysia/Singapore/Thailand/Indonesia, [[NZ Drift Series]] in New Zealand, the Australian Drifting Grand Prix, and the Greek Drift Championship (Drift Wars) have come along to further expand it into a legitimate motorsport worldwide. Drivers within these series are able to keep their cars sliding for extended periods of time, often linking several turns.\n\n== Drift competition ==\nDrifting competitions are judged based on line, angle, speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, which is usually announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such as the amount of smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, giving the crowd's reaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCcuUADvAfE |title=How drifting is judged |publisher=Youtube.com |date=|accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> The desired line is usually dictated by the judge or judges, who describe their desired line as well as highlight areas of importance, such as clipping zones, clipping points and touch-and-go areas.\n\n* Angle is the angle of a car and, more importantly, the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course.\n* The rate-to-angle is how quickly during {{Nihongo|initiation|\u632f\u51fa\u3057|furidashi}} or {{Nihongo|transitions|\u632f\u66ff\u3057|furikaeshi}} a car gets to its sliding angle.\n* Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their car around the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through turns, and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next.\n* Commitment is about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. The higher the rate-to-angle, the more speed and angle a driver can carry through the course. In addition, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher their style score.\n\n[[File:Team Drift.jpg|thumb|Team Drift Competition in [[Melbourne]]]]\nJudging takes place on just a small part of the circuit, a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and opportunities for drifting. The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, but it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car up for the first judged corner. In [[tandem]] passes, the lead driver (in the lead car, Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi); however, in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points.\n\nThere are typically two sessions &ndash; a qualifying or practice session, and a final session. In qualifying sessions, referred to as {{Nihongo|\"solo runs\"|\u5358\u8d70|tans\u014d}}, drifters get individual passes in front of judges (who may or may not be the final judges) to try to make the final 16. This is often on the day preceding the final.\n\nThe finals are tandem passes called {{Nihongo|\"chases\"|\u8ffd\u8d70|tsuis\u014d}}. Drivers are paired off, and each heat comprises two passes, with each driver taking a turn to lead. The best of the eight heats go to the next four, to the next two, to the final. The passes are judged as explained above; however, there are some provisos such as:\n\n* Overtaking the lead car under drift conditions is allowed if the chasing car doesn't interrupt the lead car's drift.\n* Overtaking the lead car under grip conditions automatically forfeits a pass.\n* Spinning forfeits a pass, unless the other driver also spins.\n* Increasing the lead under drift conditions helps to win a pass.\n* Maintaining a close gap while chasing under drift conditions helps to win a pass.\n*The level of smoke from the tires is also a factor.\n\nPoints are awarded for each pass, and usually, one driver prevails. Sometimes, the judges cannot agree, or cannot decide, or a crowd vocally disagrees with the judge's decision.<ref>{{cite web|title=One More Time (OMT)|url=http://formulad.com/info/judging-info.php|website=Formula D|accessdate=15 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625122256/http://formulad.com/info/judging-info.php|archive-date=25 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In such cases, more passes may be run until a winner is produced. On occasion, mechanical failure determines the battle's outcome, either during or preceding a heat. If a car cannot enter a tandem battle, the remaining entrant (who automatically advances) will give a solo demonstration pass. In the event of apparently close or tied runs, crowds often demonstrate their desire for another run with chants of 'one more time'.<ref>[http://www.turbomagazine.com/features/0401tur_drifting_inaugural_d1_grand_prix/index.html Drift Mania!

For example, in Australia, the chase car is judged on how accurately it emulates the drift of the lead car, as opposed to being judged on its own merit \u2014 this is only taken into consideration by the judges if the lead car is on the appropriate racing line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Drifting Grand Prix sporting regulations, section 2.10.1 Judging Criteria - Drift Battles|url=http://australiandriftinggp.com.au/adgp101/sporting-regulations/#judgingcriteriadriftbattles|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316192732/http://australiandriftinggp.com.au/adgp101/sporting-regulations/|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref> Other variations of the tans\u014d/tsuis\u014d and the tans\u014d-only method is multi-car group judging, seen in [[Drift Tengoku]] videos where the four-car team is judged in groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Judging|url=http://trackbattle.com.au/adgp/events/judging/|website=Track Battle|accessdate=15 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715202037/http://trackbattle.com.au/adgp/events/judging/|archivedate=15 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe D1GP drift series has been prototyping and fine-tuning an electronic judging system based on custom sensors that record and transmit car data to a computer that judges the run. This system is also being tested in some European series. It is designed to remove subjectivity and/or predisposition of judges. Usually the track for such a system is broken up into several sections (usually three) and the system automatically generates scores based on speed, angle and fluidity of the driver in each section, combining the scores for the final score. In certain situations judges can change or overrule a score, which happens, though rarely.\n\nFormula Drift is the top United States Drifting series. Its judging style for competition is based on line, angle, and speed. When judging for line the driver is judged based on their ability to stay on the line set in place by the judges. Points are allocated to outside zones and inner clips, and are also allocated to touch and go areas. Angle is the drivers ability to maintain a high level of angle that will be set by the angle judge in the drivers meeting. Style is judges based on three areas of focus; initiation, fluidity, and commitment. Initiation is based on how early and smooth the driver initiates into a drift. Fluidity is how smooth the driver drives from lock to lock, high angles of drift, and just overall smoothness on the track. Commitment is judges on consistent throttle throughout, and how close the driver is willing to get to walls and clipping points.<ref>http://static.formulad.com/docs/2017/2017%20Formula%20Drift%20Pro%20Sporting%20Regulations%20Version%201.0.pdf</ref>\n\nThe King of Europe Drift ProSeries has developed its own [[telemetry]] system, which uses GPS data to accurately measure speed, angle and line, thus leading to a very objective result for the qualifying sessions.<ref>Jefferies, Bill (July 11, 2014).

There have also been [[all-wheel drive]] cars that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as the [[Subaru Impreza|Subaru WRX]], [[Toyota Avensis]], [[Scion tC]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] and [[Nissan GT-R]]. Early on, AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, and usually the rules allowed only a certain percentage of power to be sent to the front wheels, but they are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.\n\nDespite the possibility of obtaining desirable [[Japanese domestic market]] vehicles in continents outside Japan,<ref>Savage, J. (2010), \"Tuner Cars\", Edge Books</ref> drifters in other countries prefer to use local versions of the same cars (for example, a [[Nissan 240SX]] instead of a [[Nissan Silvia|Nissan Silvia S13]], etc.), or even [[Domestic market|domestic cars]]. A high volume of Japanese imports were brought to countries such as Australia and New Zealand, however it is not unusual to see Australian/New Zealand domestic vehicles such as the [[Holden]] [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] or [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] used in drifting competitions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zercustoms.com/news/Ford-Typhoon-Drifting-Car-2.php |title=Ford Typhoon Drifting Car - Page 2 |publisher=[[ZerCustoms]] |date=2006-09-19 |access-date=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113712/http://www.zercustoms.com/news/Ford-Typhoon-Drifting-Car-2.php |archive-date=10 October 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe American market saw a relatively high volume of JDM cars being imported over the last decade, despite Japanese domestic vehicles being right-hand-drive only.<ref>Alvendia, A. (2006), \"Drifting Sideways: From Japan To America\", Motorbooks</ref> Locally-sold imports such as the [[Lexus SC]] and Nissan 240SX feature heavily in American drifting, but they are usually modified with JDM engines to mirror their Japanese domestic equivalents (usually with a [[Toyota JZ engine|Toyota JZ-GTE]] or Nissan CA18DET/SR20DET/RB26DETT respectively).<ref>Schuette, S \u201cDrift Cars\u201d, Capstone Press, 2007</ref>\n\nIn the UK, there are a high level of Japanese imports used within the drifting scene, due in part to the UK sharing a right-hand drive layout with Japan. However, these cars often cost more than UK-market cars, partly due to import costs. There are plenty of UK and European models used as drift cars as well \u2014 older BMWs are particularly prominent due to cost and availability, with Volvo 300 series and Ford Sierras also proving popular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.driftworks.com/drifting/|title=What is Drifting?|author=|date=|work=DriftWorks.com|access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trampdrift.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=51&Itemid=60|title=Article on Trampdrift - What to buy|author=|date=|work=Trampdrift.eu|access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the Formula Drift Professional series, cars range from highly tuned Japanese automobiles reflecting the original styles of drifting to all-new age makes and models. Due to no power limit restrictions in the series, it is not uncommon for competitors to use a variety of different powerplants. Popular variations of Chevrolet [[LS based GM small-block engine|LS engines]] are often seen bolted down to Japanese frames.<ref>Chen, L \u201cHorsepower Wars\u201d, Speed Hunters, 2015</ref>\n\nIn the King of Europe Drift Series, the main professional drift series in Europe, BMW models have long ruled the scene, winning event after event, year after year. The most successful models include the [[E30 M3|E30]], [[E36 M3|E36]] and [[E46 M3|E46]], which also present an advantage in cost (being more affordable than their Japanese rivals). For a few years, BMW V8 engine swaps were the most popular, providing a healthy 300 to 400 horsepower output. With the continuous evolution of the sport, however, these have now become obsolete, making way for more powerful American V8 engines or classic Toyota 2JZ-GTE engines.\n\nAs an example, the top 15 cars in the 2003 D1GP,<ref name=\"db1\">{{cite book|title=Drift Battle 1|last=Ellis|first=Ben|publisher=Express Motoring Publications|year=2004|page=24|display-authors=etal}}</ref> top 10 in the 2004 D1GP,<ref name=\"db4\">{{cite book|title=Drift Battle 4|last=Ellis|first=Ben|publisher=Express Motoring Publications|year=2004|page=22|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and top 10 in the 2005 D1GP<ref name=\"db12\">{{cite book|title=Drift Battle 12|last=Ellis|first=Ben|publisher=Express Motoring Publications|year=2005|page=77|display-authors=etal}}\n</ref> were as follows:\n\n[[File:D1NZ07072007.jpg|thumb|Nissan Silvia S15 drifting]]\n<!--Do not edit the information in the table below.

Drifting with an open or viscous differential in a sustained slide generally yields relatively less impressive results. All other modifications are secondary to the LSD.<ref name=\"topsecret\">{{cite book | first = Ben | last = Ellis | year = 2004 | pages = 53\u201356 | title = Drift Battle 1 | publisher = Express Motoring Publications | quote = It might surprise some people to see this listed first, but a proper mechanical limited-slip diff is absolutely essential for drift.|display-authors=etal}}\n</ref>\n\nThe preferred form of LSD for drifting is the clutch type, in \"two-way\" form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under both acceleration and deceleration. Some drift cars use a spool \"differential\", which actually has no differential action at all \u2014 the wheels are locked to each other. Drifters on a budget may use a [[welding|welded]] differential, where the [[differential (mechanics)|side gears]] are welded to give the same effect as a spool. This makes it easier to break rear traction, because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an inherent risk involved: due to the tremendous amount of internal stress, the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the [[Torsen]] or [[Quaife]] (available on cars in certain stock trims such as the [[Nissan Silvia|S15]], [[Mazda RX-7|FD3S]], [[Mazda MX-5|MX-5]], [[Toyota Supra|JZA80]], and [[Toyota Soarer|UZZ3x]]) are also adequate. It is common for drifters to change the final gear ratio depending on the type of track layout.\n\nThe [[clutch]]es on drift cars tend to be very tough ceramic-brass button or multiple-plate varieties for durability, as well as to allow rapid \"clutch kick\" techniques to upset the grip of the rear wheels. Gearbox and engine mounts are often replaced with [[polyurethane|urethane]] or aluminum mounts, and dampers are added to control the violent motion of the engine and gearbox under these conditions. The driveshafts are often replaced with carbon fiber drive shafts, as they offer the highest rotational mass savings, are stronger than alternative metals, and flexible enough to absorb and dissipate vibrations, thus easing the load on the gearbox as well as the rest of the drivetrain.\n\nGear sets may be replaced with [[Close-ratio transmission|closer ratios]] to keep the engine in the [[power band]], or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions similar to the ones used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that [[Vaughn Gittin |Vaughn Gittin Jr.]] ran in his 2016 Mustang<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/Events/15%20SEMA/mustang_sema_sheet_09.pdf mustang_sema_sheet_09.pdf]</ref>) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement [[Spur gears|straight cut]] gears instead of [[Syncromesh|synchronised]] [[gear#Helical gears|helical gears]], for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use [[Sequential manual gearbox|sequential gearboxes]] to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters can be used to make shifts easier without increasing shift time.\n\n=== Steering and suspension ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}Steering angles are also crucial as the driver progresses. The first stage of these modifications is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on [[MacPherson strut]] vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Many aftermarket companies have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original [[scrub radius]], [[Kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] axis, [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann angle]], amount of [[bump steer]], [[caster angle]], and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60\u00b0. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in professional drifting, [[double wishbone suspension]] vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.\n\nSprings and [[shock absorber]]s are also tuned for higher skill levels, depending on track layout.\n\nTypically, dedicated drifting cars are modified to eliminate [[Ackermann steering geometry]], which is included on almost all production cars. While Ackermann geometry is helpful in making a car turn easier, it inhibits the ability to slide sideways at full lock necessary to compete in drifting.\n\n=== Cockpit ===\n[[File:Drift Carnage.jpg|thumb|right|Cleaning up severed bumpers during drift meet]]\nBecause of the high [[centrifugal force]]s encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a [[bucket seat|racing seat]] and [[five-point harness]]. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing the body in the seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between [[Automobile pedal|clutch, brake and accelerator pedals]]. The [[steering wheel]] is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, so that it can be released and allowed to spin in the driver's hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the [[hand brake]] is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges are used to monitor [[Boost gauge|boost levels]], [[oil pressure]] and temperature, intake and [[Engine coolant temperature sensor|coolant temperatures]], and [[Air\u2013fuel ratio|air-fuel ratio]], among other data. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as [[Daigo Saito]] and his 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noriyaro.com/2014/10/speed-holes-and-methanol-daigo-saitos-2014-jzx100/|title=SPEED HOLES AND METHANOL: Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 : NORIYARO|author=|date=|work=noriyaro.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Tires ===\n[[File:Drift s13 wheel.jpg|thumb|upright|S13 Silvia - tire stretched over a wide rim, increasing sidewall rigidity. The rim has a low offset to increase track.]]\nIn the United States, competitive drifters are required to run US [[Department of transportation|DOT]]-approved (road-legal) tires similar to [[racing slick]]s in rubber composition, but with shallow treads included. This is permitted, with the exception of some major championships including D1GP and Formula Drift, which only permit commercially available tires that are approved by the sanctioning body. Professional drifting has come to the point where grip is tuned into cars to be defeated. It makes for a faster drift necessary in the current professional climate. Tires typically used by drifters are around the DOT tread wear rating of 200. Examples include the Hankook Ventus RS-3, Falken Azenis RT615K, Nitto NT05, Yokohama ADVAN Neova AD08R, and Achilles Radial 123s. Some other companies from Asia have also started developing their technology through sponsoring professional drivers. These companies include Nankang,<ref>[http://www.wreckedmagazine.com/blog/2014/12/08/nankang-tire-set-for-2015-formula-drift-arrival-rumormill/]</ref> Westlake<ref>[http://www.drifting.cz/calendar/race?slug=rd6-westlake-drift-challenge-sosnova]</ref> and Zestino.<ref>[http://www.thebritishdriftchampionship.co.uk/2017/02/28/zestino-tires-uk-partner-british-drift-championship/]</ref> Tires are often modified with [[Tire lettering|lettering]] to give them a more customized look.\n\n== R/C drifting ==\n{{Main|Radio-controlled drifting}}\nR/C drifting refers to the act of drifting with a [[radio-controlled car]]. R/C cars are equipped with special low-grip tires, usually made from [[PVC]] or ABS piping. Some manufacturers make radial drift tires that are made of actual rubber compounds. The car's setup is usually changed to allow it to drift more easily. R/C drifting is most successful on AWD R/C cars.

The technique is now considered mainstream in modern games in all their forms. In-game communities have developed within games such as ''[[Assetto Corsa]]'', ''[[Forza Motorsport]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'', made up of teams who battle in user-created tournaments.\n\nDrifting also features heavily in the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' franchise (notably games since ''[[Need for Speed: Underground]]''), the ''[[Race Driver: Grid|Grid]]'' franchise, the ''[[Juiced (video game)|Juiced]]'' franchise and in Japanese domestic console games such as ''Initial D: Extreme Stage'' ([[PlayStation 3|PS3]]), which is based solely on drifting.\n\nDrifting and the related technique of [[powersliding]] feature heavily in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' franchise, where a successful drift or powerslide around corners will award the player with a short [[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous]] boost known as a \"mini-turbo\".

The technique causes the rear [[slip angle]] to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as [[opposite lock]] or [[Countersteering#Other uses|counter-steering]]).  The sport of drifting is not to be confused with the ''four wheel drift'', a classic cornering technique established in [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] and sports car racing. Drifting is traditionally done by [[clutch]] kicking, then intentionally oversteering and countersteering.\n\nAs a [[Motorsport|motoring]] discipline, drifting competitions were first popularized in Japan in the 1970s and further popularized by the 1995 manga series ''[[Initial D]]''.

Famous [[Motorcycle sport|motorcyclist]] turned driver [[Kunimitsu Takahashi]] was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s. This earned him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the spectacle of smoking tires. The [[bias-ply]] racing tires of the 1960s&ndash;1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip angle. As professional racers in Japan drove this way, so did street racers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dixon |first1=Chris |title=DRIVING; Drifting: The Fast Art of the Controlled Slide |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/07/travel/driving-drifting-the-fast-art-of-the-controlled-slide.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=18 July 2018 |date=May 7, 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[Keiichi Tsuchiya]], known as the {{Nihongo|\"Drift King\"|\u30c9\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\n|Dorifuto Kingu}}, became particularly interested by Takahashi's drift techniques. Tsuchiya began practicing his drifting skills on the [[T\u014dge|mountain roads]] of Japan, and quickly gained a reputation amongst the racing crowd. In 1987, several popular car magazines and tuning garages agreed to produce a video of Tsuchiya's drifting skills. The video, known as ''Pluspy'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVyxHVhNNgY|title=Keiichi Tsuchiya - Pluspy (part 1)|last=lnsania|date=6 August 2007|publisher=|access-date=29 March 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> became a hit and inspired many of the professional drifting drivers on the circuits today. In 1988, alongside [[Option (car magazine)|''Option'' magazine]] founder and [[Editing|chief editor]] Daijiro Inada, he helped to organize one of the first events specifically for drifting called the D1 Grand Prix. He has also drifted through every turn in [[Tsukuba Circuit]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Popularity ===\nOne of the earliest recorded drift events outside Japan took place in 1996 at [[Willow Springs Raceway]] in [[Willow Springs, Kern County, California|Willow Springs]], [[California]], hosted by the Japanese drifting magazine and organization [[Option (car magazine)|''Option'']]. Daijiro Inada (founder of the Japanese D1 Grand Prix), the [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] [[Funny Car]] [[Drag racing|drag racer]] Kenji Okazaki, and Keiichi Tsuchiya gave demonstrations in a [[Nissan 180SX]] that the magazine had brought over from Japan. Entrants included [[Rhys Millen]] and Bryan Norris.<ref>''Super Street'', Issue 4, December 1996</ref> Drifting has since exploded into a form of motorsport in North America, Australia, Asia and Europe.\n\nDrifting has evolved into a competitive sport where drivers compete (almost exclusively in rear-wheel-drive cars) to earn points from judges based on various factors. At the top levels of competition, the [[D1 Grand Prix]] in Japan pioneered the sport. Other events such as Drift Games Extreme (formally known as the IDC \u2014 Irish Drift Championship) in [[Ireland]], [[Formula D]] in the [[United States]], [[Drift Allstars]], King of Europe, Drift Masters and the [[British Drift Championship]] in Europe, [[World Drift Series|WDS]] in China, [[Russian Drift Series|RDS]] in Russia, [[Formula Drift Asia]] in the Malaysia/Singapore/Thailand/Indonesia, [[NZ Drift Series]] in New Zealand, the Australian Drifting Grand Prix, and the Greek Drift Championship (Drift Wars) have come along to further expand it into a legitimate motorsport worldwide. Drivers within these series are able to keep their cars sliding for extended periods of time, often linking several turns.\n\n== Drift competition ==\nDrifting competitions are judged based on line, angle, speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, which is usually announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such as the amount of smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, giving the crowd's reaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCcuUADvAfE |title=How drifting is judged |publisher=Youtube.com |date=|accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> The desired line is usually dictated by the judge or judges, who describe their desired line as well as highlight areas of importance, such as clipping zones, clipping points and touch-and-go areas.\n\n* Angle is the angle of a car and, more importantly, the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course.\n* The rate-to-angle is how quickly during {{Nihongo|initiation|\u632f\u51fa\u3057|furidashi}} or {{Nihongo|transitions|\u632f\u66ff\u3057|furikaeshi}} a car gets to its sliding angle.\n* Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their car around the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through turns, and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next.\n* Commitment is about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. The higher the rate-to-angle, the more speed and angle a driver can carry through the course. In addition, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher their style score.\n\n[[File:Team Drift.jpg|thumb|Team Drift Competition in [[Melbourne]]]]\nJudging takes place on just a small part of the circuit, a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and opportunities for drifting. The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, but it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car up for the first judged corner. In [[tandem]] passes, the lead driver (in the lead car, Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi); however, in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points.\n\nThere are typically two sessions &ndash; a qualifying or practice session, and a final session. In qualifying sessions, referred to as {{Nihongo|\"solo runs\"|\u5358\u8d70|tans\u014d}}, drifters get individual passes in front of judges (who may or may not be the final judges) to try to make the final 16. This is often on the day preceding the final.\n\nThe finals are tandem passes called {{Nihongo|\"chases\"|\u8ffd\u8d70|tsuis\u014d}}. Drivers are paired off, and each heat comprises two passes, with each driver taking a turn to lead. The best of the eight heats go to the next four, to the next two, to the final. The passes are judged as explained above; however, there are some provisos such as:\n\n* Overtaking the lead car under drift conditions is allowed if the chasing car doesn't interrupt the lead car's drift.\n* Overtaking the lead car under grip conditions automatically forfeits a pass.\n* Spinning forfeits a pass, unless the other driver also spins.\n* Increasing the lead under drift conditions helps to win a pass.\n* Maintaining a close gap while chasing under drift conditions helps to win a pass.\n*The level of smoke from the tires is also a factor.\n\nPoints are awarded for each pass, and usually, one driver prevails. Sometimes, the judges cannot agree, or cannot decide, or a crowd vocally disagrees with the judge's decision.<ref>{{cite web|title=One More Time (OMT)|url=http://formulad.com/info/judging-info.php|website=Formula D|accessdate=15 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625122256/http://formulad.com/info/judging-info.php|archive-date=25 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In such cases, more passes may be run until a winner is produced. On occasion, mechanical failure determines the battle's outcome, either during or preceding a heat. If a car cannot enter a tandem battle, the remaining entrant (who automatically advances) will give a solo demonstration pass. In the event of apparently close or tied runs, crowds often demonstrate their desire for another run with chants of 'one more time'.<ref>[http://www.turbomagazine.com/features/0401tur_drifting_inaugural_d1_grand_prix/index.html Drift Mania!

For example, in Australia, the chase car is judged on how accurately it emulates the drift of the lead car, as opposed to being judged on its own merit \u2014 this is only taken into consideration by the judges if the lead car is on the appropriate racing line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Drifting Grand Prix sporting regulations, section 2.10.1 Judging Criteria - Drift Battles|url=http://australiandriftinggp.com.au/adgp101/sporting-regulations/#judgingcriteriadriftbattles|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316192732/http://australiandriftinggp.com.au/adgp101/sporting-regulations/|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref> Other variations of the tans\u014d/tsuis\u014d and the tans\u014d-only method is multi-car group judging, seen in [[Drift Tengoku]] videos where the four-car team is judged in groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Judging|url=http://trackbattle.com.au/adgp/events/judging/|website=Track Battle|accessdate=15 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715202037/http://trackbattle.com.au/adgp/events/judging/|archivedate=15 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe D1GP drift series has been prototyping and fine-tuning an electronic judging system based on custom sensors that record and transmit car data to a computer that judges the run. This system is also being tested in some European series. It is designed to remove subjectivity and/or predisposition of judges. Usually the track for such a system is broken up into several sections (usually three) and the system automatically generates scores based on speed, angle and fluidity of the driver in each section, combining the scores for the final score. In certain situations judges can change or overrule a score, which happens, though rarely.\n\nFormula Drift is the top United States Drifting series. Its judging style for competition is based on line, angle, and speed. When judging for line the driver is judged based on their ability to stay on the line set in place by the judges. Points are allocated to outside zones and inner clips, and are also allocated to touch and go areas. Angle is the drivers ability to maintain a high level of angle that will be set by the angle judge in the drivers meeting. Style is judges based on three areas of focus; initiation, fluidity, and commitment. Initiation is based on how early and smooth the driver initiates into a drift. Fluidity is how smooth the driver drives from lock to lock, high angles of drift, and just overall smoothness on the track. Commitment is judges on consistent throttle throughout, and how close the driver is willing to get to walls and clipping points.<ref>http://static.formulad.com/docs/2017/2017%20Formula%20Drift%20Pro%20Sporting%20Regulations%20Version%201.0.pdf</ref>\n\nThe King of Europe Drift ProSeries has developed its own [[telemetry]] system, which uses GPS data to accurately measure speed, angle and line, thus leading to a very objective result for the qualifying sessions.<ref>Jefferies, Bill (July 11, 2014).

There have also been [[all-wheel drive]] cars that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as the [[Subaru Impreza|Subaru WRX]], [[Toyota Avensis]], [[Scion tC]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] and [[Nissan GT-R]]. Early on, AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, and usually the rules allowed only a certain percentage of power to be sent to the front wheels, but they are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.\n\nDespite the possibility of obtaining desirable [[Japanese domestic market]] vehicles in continents outside Japan,<ref>Savage, J. (2010), \"Tuner Cars\", Edge Books</ref> drifters in other countries prefer to use local versions of the same cars (for example, a [[Nissan 240SX]] instead of a [[Nissan Silvia|Nissan Silvia S13]], etc), or even [[Domestic market|domestic cars]]. A high volume of Japanese imports were brought to countries such as Australia and New Zealand, however it is not unusual to see Australian/New Zealand domestic vehicles such as the [[Holden]] [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] or [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] used in drifting competitions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zercustoms.com/news/Ford-Typhoon-Drifting-Car-2.php |title=Ford Typhoon Drifting Car - Page 2 |publisher=[[ZerCustoms]] |date=2006-09-19 |access-date=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113712/http://www.zercustoms.com/news/Ford-Typhoon-Drifting-Car-2.php |archive-date=10 October 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe American market saw a relatively high volume of JDM cars being imported over the last decade, despite Japanese domestic vehicles being right-hand-drive only.<ref>Alvendia, A. (2006), \"Drifting Sideways: From Japan To America\", Motorbooks</ref> Locally-sold imports such as the [[Lexus SC]] and Nissan 240SX feature heavily in American drifting, but they are usually modified with JDM engines to mirror their Japanese domestic equivalents (usually with a [[Toyota JZ engine|Toyota JZ-GTE]] or Nissan CA18DET/SR20DET/RB26DETT respectively).<ref>Schuette, S \u201cDrift Cars\u201d, Capstone Press, 2007</ref>\n\nIn the UK, there are a high level of Japanese imports used within the drifting scene, due in part to the UK sharing a right-hand drive layout with Japan. However, these cars often cost more than UK-market cars, partly due to import costs. There are plenty of UK and European models used as drift cars as well \u2014 older BMWs are particularly prominent due to cost and availability, with Volvo 300 series and Ford Sierras also proving popular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.driftworks.com/drifting/|title=What is Drifting?|author=|date=|work=DriftWorks.com|access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trampdrift.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=51&Itemid=60|title=Article on Trampdrift - What to buy|author=|date=|work=Trampdrift.eu|access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the Formula Drift Professional series, cars range from highly tuned Japanese automobiles reflecting the original styles of drifting to all-new age makes and models. Due to no power limit restrictions in the series, it is not uncommon for competitors to use a variety of different powerplants. Popular variations of Chevrolet [[LS based GM small-block engine|LS engines]] are often seen bolted down to Japanese frames.<ref>Chen, L \u201cHorsepower Wars\u201d, Speed Hunters, 2015</ref>\n\nIn the King of Europe Drift Series, the main professional drift series in Europe, BMW models have long ruled the scene, winning event after event, year after year. The most successful models include the [[E30 M3|E30]], [[E36 M3|E36]] and [[E46 M3|E46]], which also present an advantage in cost (being more affordable than their Japanese rivals). For a few years, BMW V8 engine swaps were the most popular, providing a healthy 300 to 400 horsepower output. With the continuous evolution of the sport, however, these have now become obsolete, making way for more powerful American V8 engines or classic Toyota 2JZ-GTE engines.\n\nAs an example, the top 15 cars in the 2003 D1GP,<ref name=\"db1\">{{cite book|title=Drift Battle 1|last=Ellis|first=Ben|publisher=Express Motoring Publications|year=2004|page=24|display-authors=etal}}</ref> top 10 in the 2004 D1GP,<ref name=\"db4\">{{cite book|title=Drift Battle 4|last=Ellis|first=Ben|publisher=Express Motoring Publications|year=2004|page=22|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and top 10 in the 2005 D1GP<ref name=\"db12\">{{cite book|title=Drift Battle 12|last=Ellis|first=Ben|publisher=Express Motoring Publications|year=2005|page=77|display-authors=etal}}\n</ref> were as follows:\n\n[[File:D1NZ07072007.jpg|thumb|Nissan Silvia S15 drifting]]\n<!--Do not edit the information in the table below.

All other modifications are secondary to the LSD.<ref name=\"topsecret\">{{cite book | first = Ben | last = Ellis | year = 2004 | pages = 53\u201356 | title = Drift Battle 1 | publisher = Express Motoring Publications | quote = It might surprise some people to see this listed first, but a proper mechanical limited-slip diff is absolutely essential for drift.|display-authors=etal}}\n</ref>\n\nThe preferred form of LSD for drifting is the clutch type, in \"two-way\" form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under both acceleration and deceleration. Some drift cars use a spool \"differential\", which actually has no differential action at all \u2014 the wheels are locked to each other. Drifters on a budget may use a [[welding|welded]] differential, where the [[differential (mechanics)|side gears]] are welded to give the same effect as a spool. This makes it easier to break rear traction, because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an inherent risk involved: due to the tremendous amount of internal stress, the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the [[Torsen]] or [[Quaife]] (available on cars in certain stock trims such as the [[Nissan Silvia|S15]], [[Mazda RX-7|FD3S]], [[Mazda MX-5|MX-5]], [[Toyota Supra|JZA80]], and [[Toyota Soarer|UZZ3x]]) are also adequate. It is common for drifters to change the final gear ratio depending on the type of track layout.\n\nThe [[clutch]]es on drift cars tend to be very tough ceramic-brass button or multiple-plate varieties for durability, as well as to allow rapid \"clutch kick\" techniques to upset the grip of the rear wheels. Gearbox and engine mounts are often replaced with [[polyurethane|urethane]] or aluminum mounts, and dampers are added to control the violent motion of the engine and gearbox under these conditions. The driveshafts are often replaced with carbon fiber drive shafts, as they offer the highest rotational mass savings, are stronger than alternative metals, and flexible enough to absorb and dissipate vibrations, thus easing the load on the gearbox as well as the rest of the drivetrain.\n\nGear sets may be replaced with [[Close-ratio transmission|closer ratios]] to keep the engine in the [[power band]], or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions similar to the ones used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that [[Vaughn Gittin |Vaughn Gittin Jr.]] ran in his 2016 Mustang<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/Events/15%20SEMA/mustang_sema_sheet_09.pdf mustang_sema_sheet_09.pdf]</ref>) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement [[Spur gears|straight cut]] gears instead of [[Syncromesh|synchronised]] [[gear#Helical gears|helical gears]], for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use [[Sequential manual gearbox|sequential gearboxes]] to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters can be used to make shifts easier without increasing shift time.\n\n=== Steering and suspension ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}Steering angles are also crucial as the driver progresses. The first stage of these modifications is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on [[MacPherson strut]] vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Many aftermarket companies have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original [[scrub radius]], [[Kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] axis, [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann angle]], amount of [[bump steer]], [[caster angle]], and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60\u00b0. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in professional drifting, [[double wishbone suspension]] vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.\n\nSprings and [[shock absorber]]s are also tuned for higher skill levels, depending on track layout.\n\nTypically, dedicated drifting cars are modified to eliminate [[Ackermann steering geometry]], which is included on almost all production cars. While Ackermann geometry is helpful in making a car turn easier, it inhibits the ability to slide sideways at full lock necessary to compete in drifting.\n\n=== Cockpit ===\n[[File:Drift Carnage.jpg|thumb|right|Cleaning up severed bumpers during drift meet]]\nBecause of the high [[centrifugal force]]s encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a [[bucket seat|racing seat]] and [[five-point harness]]. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing the body in the seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between [[Automobile pedal|clutch, brake and accelerator pedals]]. The [[steering wheel]] is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, so that it can be released and allowed to spin in the driver's hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the [[hand brake]] is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges are used to monitor [[Boost gauge|boost levels]], [[oil pressure]] and temperature, intake and [[Engine coolant temperature sensor|coolant temperatures]], and [[Air\u2013fuel ratio|air-fuel ratio]], among other data. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as [[Daigo Saito]] and his 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noriyaro.com/2014/10/speed-holes-and-methanol-daigo-saitos-2014-jzx100/|title=SPEED HOLES AND METHANOL: Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 : NORIYARO|author=|date=|work=noriyaro.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Tires ===\n[[File:Drift s13 wheel.jpg|thumb|upright|S13 Silvia - tire stretched over a wide rim, increasing sidewall rigidity. The rim has a low offset to increase track.]]\nIn the United States, competitive drifters are required to run US [[Department of transportation|DOT]]-approved (road-legal) tires similar to [[racing slick]]s in rubber composition, but with shallow treads included. This is permitted, with the exception of some major championships including D1GP and Formula Drift, which only permit commercially available tires that are approved by the sanctioning body. Professional drifting has come to the point where grip is tuned into cars to be defeated. It makes for a faster drift necessary in the current professional climate. Tires typically used by drifters are around the DOT tread wear rating of 200. Examples include the Hankook Ventus RS-3, Falken Azenis RT615K, Nitto NT05, Yokohama ADVAN Neova AD08R, and Achilles Radial 123s. Some other companies from Asia have also started developing their technology through sponsoring professional drivers. These companies include Nankang,<ref>[http://www.wreckedmagazine.com/blog/2014/12/08/nankang-tire-set-for-2015-formula-drift-arrival-rumormill/]</ref> Westlake<ref>[http://www.drifting.cz/calendar/race?slug=rd6-westlake-drift-challenge-sosnova]</ref> and Zestino.<ref>[http://www.thebritishdriftchampionship.co.uk/2017/02/28/zestino-tires-uk-partner-british-drift-championship/]</ref> Tires are often modified with [[Tire lettering|lettering]] to give them a more customized look.\n\n== R/C drifting ==\n{{Main|Radio-controlled drifting}}\nR/C drifting refers to the act of drifting with a [[radio-controlled car]]. R/C cars are equipped with special low-grip tires, usually made from [[PVC]] or ABS piping. Some manufacturers make radial drift tires that are made of actual rubber compounds. The car's setup is usually changed to allow it to drift more easily. R/C drifting is most successful on AWD R/C cars.

In its class it is one of the most successful racing [[sports car]]s having won the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005, five of the six years it competed in total. Its streak of Le Mans victories between 2000 and 2005 was broken only in 2003 by the [[Bentley Speed 8]], another race car fielded that year by [[Volkswagen Group]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.les24heures.fr/index.php/database/palmaresdes24hdumans\n|title=Les24Heures\n|author=\n|date=\n|work=\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe petrol-powered Audi R8 race car was in 2006 replaced by the new [[Audi R10 TDI]] Diesel; however, the need to further develop the R10 meant that the R8 saw action in a few races leading up to the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\n==History==\n\n===1998: The challenge===\nIn 1997, [[sports car racing]] and especially the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]] was popular among factories like [[BMW]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche]], [[Toyota]], [[Nissan Motors]] and others. At that time, Audi Sport boss Wolfgang Ullrich started to evaluate the options of joining.\n\nWith the upcoming [[American Le Mans Series]] also providing a stage for the US-market, Audi announced plans in 1998 to compete in 1999, with the [[Audi R8R|R8R]] and powered by a {{Convert|550|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 turbo.  As it was considered the better choice for a whole race due to less weight and wider tires, Audi ordered an open top roadster from [[Dallara]], to be developed and run by [[Joest Racing]].\n\nYet, during the autumn of 1998, after the necessity of GT1 homologation was dropped in favour of LM-GTP prototypes, regarding the speed and success of these closed GT coup\u00e9s like the [[Porsche 911 GT1]], [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR]], and the [[Toyota GT-One]], Audi also ordered their newly acquired Norfolk based RTN (Racing Technology Norfolk, led by [[Tony Southgate]]) to build a closed-cockpit car using the same drivetrain.\n\nThe ACO rules for closed-top prototypes allowed cars to run with larger air restrictors, resulting in more power (about 600&nbsp;hp), which resulted in a higher top speed in combination with the lower drag. To compensate this advantage over the duration of a race, the LMGTPs were limited to smaller tyres and smaller fuel tanks.\n\n===1999: The R8R and R8C===\n{{Main|Audi R8R|Audi R8C}}\nFollowing a period of testing, two R8Rs debuted at the 1999 [[12 Hours of Sebring]].  The [[BMW V12 LMR]] won, which was a strong sign towards the race in France. The already tested open-top Audi R8R, entered by [[Joest Racing]] was not fast enough to challenge for a win, finishing 3rd.\n\nAfter further tests and modifications, the Audis returned for Le Mans.  The new debuting R8Cs lacked pace and unfortunately suffered mechanical gearbox woes.  Lap times were 10 seconds down from the leading LMP and LMGTP competitors.  Joest's R8Rs ran steady, yet still was too slow to run for pole position.  After a race which saw the spectacular flights of the [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]] as well as leading cars of Toyota and BMW crashing out, the Audi R8R took 3rd and 4th behind the surviving #15 [[BMW V12 LMR]] and the Japanese-driven Toyota.\n\nBased on the experiences, Audi decided to regroup for 2000, and built a new R8 [[Roadster (automobile)|spyder]] together with Joest and Dallara. The British-built R8C coupe was retired, but Audi-owned [[Bentley]] developed the concept of the R8C closed cockpit LMGTP and entered the [[Bentley Speed 8|Bentley EXP Speed 8]] in 2001, winning the race with the [[Bentley Speed 8]] in 2003.\n\n===1999: Retiring competitors===\nAfter the 1999 Le Mans shame, Mercedes retired from GTs to focus on the return of the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] touring cars in 2000, as well as on F1. Toyota and BMW also went to F1, with BMW at least continuing to race for two years in the [[ALMS]], where the open roadster of [[Bill Auberlen]] also suffered a \"back flip\" during the [[Petit Le Mans]] at [[Road Atlanta]] in 2000, as the closed-cockpit Porsche of [[Yannick Dalmas]] had done in 1998. Despite the BMW V12 LMR not receiving further development, the German team [[Schnitzer Motorsport]] was almost as effective as Joest. Still the BMW V12 LMR could not match the Audi R8's might in the championship and lost almost every race against it. BMW returned to race the [[BMW M3]] in the GT class since, dominating in the ALMS and in [[World Touring Car Championship|WTCC]] as well as at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]].\n\nThis left only Porsche as a major possible challenger for 2000 \u2014 however the [[Porsche LMP]] project was scrapped before it had a chance to race. Rumours at that time said that [[Ferdinand Piech]] himself made them stay away, using his influence as a co-owner of Porsche as well as his management role at [[Volkswagen]], which would develop the upcoming SUV [[VW Touareg]] in cooperation with the [[Porsche Cayenne]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael J.

The car was developed by [[Audi|Audi Motorsport]] and [[Joest Racing]] and debuted in 2000, winning the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe R8 won Le Mans five times ([[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|2000]], [[2001 24 Hours of Le Mans|2001]], [[2002 24 Hours of Le Mans|2002]], [[2004 24 Hours of Le Mans|2004]] and [[2005 24 Hours of Le Mans|2005]]) and the overall season championship in the American Le Mans Series six times in a row (from 2000 to 2005).<ref name=r&t201208>{{cite journal|last=Bornhop|first=Andrew|title=Ode to an R8|journal=[[Road & Track]]|date=August 2012|volume=63|issue=12|page=61}}</ref>\n\nThe R8 won a hat trick at Le Mans in 2000\u20132002, campaigned by Audi Sport [[Infineon]] Team Joest and driven by [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], [[Emanuele Pirro]] and [[Frank Biela]]. First time out in 2000, the team won a 1-2-3 finish. Since then, the Audi R8 has won numerous championships and races, including further wins for 'privateer' teams at Le Mans in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe R8 is powered by a 3.6&nbsp;L Audi [[Fuel Stratified Injection|FSI]] V8. FSI stands for Fuel-Stratified Injection, which is a variation on the concept of [[gasoline direct injection]] developed by VW which maximizes both power and fuel economy at the same time. FSI technology can be found in products available to the normal public, across all brands in the [[Volkswagen Group]].\n\nThe power supplied by the R8, officially listed at about {{Convert|610|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 2000, 2001 and 2002, {{Convert|550|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} in 2003 and 2004 and {{Convert|520|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 2005, is sent to the rear wheels via a [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo]] six-speed [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential transmission]] with an electro\u2013pneumatic gear change. Unofficially, the works-team Audi R8 for Le Mans (2000, 2001 and 2002) is said to have had around {{Convert|670|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} instead of the quoted {{Convert|610|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The numbers were quoted at speed, and were due to the car making 50 extra horsepower due to twin ram-air intakes at speeds over {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Official torque numbers were quoted for this version of the engine at {{Convert|516|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 6500 rpm. The equation for horsepower (torque divided by 5250, multiplied by rpm) for these numbers produces a horsepower rating of {{convert|638|hp}} at the same 6500 rpm (516/5250*6500=638). The Audi R8's structure was designed from the very beginning to expedite parts changes during the race. The car has a chassis that has been likened to a [[Lego]] model \u2014 anything on the car can be changed and changed quickly. During its campaign, the Joest pit crew was able to change the entire rear transaxle of a damaged R8 \u2014 a process which usually takes between one and three hours \u2014 in as low as three minutes and 16 seconds.<ref name=r&t201208/> The reason for this was that the transmission, rear suspension and rear subframe were built as one unit. The car had numerous quick-connect hoses and easily removable bolts. The whole rear section of the car could be removed as a whole and a new back half installed with the help of a crane. The Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), organizers of the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] and the [[American Le Mans Series]] acted quickly to void this advantage by mandating the gearbox casing be the same item through the duration of the race, with only the internals being allowed to be changed. However, the R8 still had quicker access to the gearbox internals than any other car due to its quick-change construction . This was critical as the gearbox was the weak link in the car.\n\nThe R8's structure and body are both composed of [[carbon fibre]], a strong, lightweight polymer material.\n\nPerformance - from top speed to acceleration - was, as in most race car cases, variable depending on the car's setup. The highest speed of the R8 at Le Mans was {{convert|338|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in the practice sessions of the 2002 Le Mans 24 Hours Race. A low downforce setup could generate about {{convert|350|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAudi Sport's program saw tragedy in 2001 when on April 25, popular ex-F1 driver [[Michele Alboreto]] died in an accident after suffering a high-speed tyre failure during an R8 test session at the [[Lausitzring]] in eastern Germany.<ref name=nytimes>''Alboreto Is Killed Testing Audi R8'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 26, 2001, Page D7.</ref>\n\n===2003: Bentley breaks the streak===\nThe [[Bentley Speed 8]], which ran at Le Mans from 2001 to 2003, winning in 2003, utilised a heavily modified 4.0&nbsp;L version of the V8 engine from the Audi R8 .{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\nThe Bentley racing effort was campaigned by Team [[Bentley]] (Apex Motorsport) with assistance from longtime R8 competitor Joest Racing and Audi Sport UK. After 2002 the Joest factory team dropped its R8 campaign and left it to the privateers. Restrictor changes brought the power down to 550&nbsp;bhp for anyone still racing with the R8. However the maximum torque hardly changed.\n[[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], who won the previous three 24 Hours of Le Mans races in an R8, was assigned to drive the Bentley Speed 8, and helped guide the team to victory. (Kristensen went on to win the 2004 and 2005 races in an Audi R8). There is some similarity between the Bentley Speed 8 and the Audi R8's successor, the R10 TDI.\n\n===2005: End of active Competition===\nDuring the 2005 season, it was evident that its time at the front of the pack was drawing to a close. Audi had made the development of the [[Audi R10 TDI]] diesel public, and cars from other manufacturers and teams started to catch up in terms of on-the-track speed.  The ACO still felt that the R8 needed to be kept in check, therefore they reduced the restrictor size on the R8's engine, due to the car not meeting new hybrid regulations, and stipulated the car shall carry [[ballast weight]] in an attempt to make the races more competitive. The R8 was restricted even further to only 520&nbsp;bhp. At the 2005 Le Mans, the Audis failed to qualify on pole position; the fastest R8 started the race in third position.  However, the car was able to outlast all other competitors to eventually take its fifth checkered flag at the Circuit de la Sarthe and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  This victory was also notable since it was Tom Kristensen's 6th straight 24 Hours of Le Mans victory, and a record 7th overall, beating legendary driver [[Jacky Ickx]]'s previous record of 6 career 24 Hours of Le Mans victories.  To date the R8 remains one of the fastest petrol powered LMPs, setting a 3:29 at Le Mans, which was beaten only by the Lola-Aston Martins. However, the R8's best finish was at 379 laps, which is more than the Lola-Aston Martin's best at 373 laps.\n\n===2010: Classic car racing===\nTwo 2005 Audi R8s are driven by Doug Smith and [[Travis Engen]] in the GTP-WSC Enduro class of the [[Historic Sportscar Racing|HSR]] championship.\n\n==List of Records==\n\n* [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner - {{24hLM|2000}}, {{24hLM|2001}}, {{24hLM|2002}}, {{24hLM|2004}}, {{24hLM|2005}}\n* [[American Le Mans Series]] champion: [[2000 American Le Mans Series season|2000]], [[2001 American Le Mans Series season|2001]], [[2002 American Le Mans Series season|2002]], [[2003 American Le Mans Series season|2003]], [[2004 American Le Mans Series season|2004]], [[2005 American Le Mans Series season|2005]], [[2006 American Le Mans Series season|2006]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n* [[2001 European Le Mans Series season|European Le Mans Series]] champion: [[2001 European Le Mans Series season|2001]]\n* [[Le Mans Series]] champion: [[2004 Le Mans Series season|2004]]\n\u2020 - Season partially run by the [[Audi R10]] as well.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===2006: The R10 TDI===\n{{Main|Audi R10 TDI}}\nIn response to the new level of competition, development of the successor, known as the [[Audi R10 TDI]], has been completed.  The [[V12 engine]]d [[turbodiesel]] won at its race debut at the 2006 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] with both cars starting on the front row.  However, the pole sitting R10 had to start from the pit lane due to the need to rectify heat exchanger issues.\n\nEmanuele Pirro, Frank Biela and Marco Werner made history by becoming the first drivers to win the Le Mans 24-hour race in a diesel-powered car. The Audi R10 TDI completed a record 380 laps of the La Sarthe circuit, with Pirro at the wheel for the finish.  French trio [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], [[\u00c9ric H\u00e9lary]] and [[Franck Montagny]] took second in the [[Pescarolo Sport|Pescarolo]] Judd No 17, four laps adrift. Scotsman [[Allan McNish]] was third in the other Audi, which came in 13 laps down after suffering mechanical problems.\n[[Image:Paris 2006 - Audi R8.JPG|right|thumb|Audi R8 road car at the 2006 Paris Motor Show]]\nThe R8 continued to campaign the [[American Le Mans Series]] through the first half of the 2006 season, and made its final US appearance on July 1, 2006 at [[Lime Rock Park]], [[Connecticut]], piloted by McNish and Capello.  The R8 ended its career in style by winning the race, the 50th [[American Le Mans Series]] win for the Audi R8. The R10s participated in the rest of the ALMS season, beginning with the race at [[Miller Motorsports Park]], [[Utah]].\n\n===2007: R8 road car===\nThe name Audi R8 also is used by the production road [[sports car]] [[Audi R8]] which is based on the 2003 [[Audi Le Mans quattro]] [[concept car]], and the R8 race car experiences.

Audi R8.jpg|thumb|The #1 & #2 Audi R8 LMP1 cars racing in the [[2005 Grand Prix of Atlanta]].]]\nThe '''Audi R8''' is a [[Le Mans Prototype]] sports-prototype race car introduced in 2000 for [[sports car racing]] as a redevelopment of their [[Audi R8R]] (open top [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]]) and [[Audi R8C]] (closed top [[Le Mans Prototype|LMGTP]]) used in 1999. In its class it is one of the most successful racing [[sports car]]s having won the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005, five of the six years it competed in total. Its streak of Le Mans victories between 2000 and 2005 was broken only in 2003 by the [[Bentley Speed 8]], another race car fielded that year by [[Volkswagen Group]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.les24heures.fr/index.php/database/palmaresdes24hdumans\n|title=Les24Heures\n|author=\n|date=\n|work=\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe petrol-powered Audi R8 race car was in 2006 replaced by the new [[Audi R10 TDI]] Diesel; however, the need to further develop the R10 meant that the R8 saw action in a few races leading up to the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\n==History==\n\n===1998: The challenge===\nIn 1997, [[sports car racing]] and especially the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]] was popular among factories like [[BMW]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche]], [[Toyota]], [[Nissan Motors]] and others. At that time, Audi Sport boss Wolfgang Ullrich started to evaluate the options of joining.\n\nWith the upcoming [[American Le Mans Series]] also providing a stage for the US-market, Audi announced plans in 1998 to compete in 1999, with the [[Audi R8R|R8R]] and powered by a {{Convert|550|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 turbo.  As it was considered the better choice for a whole race due to less weight and wider tires, Audi ordered an open top roadster from [[Dallara]], to be developed and run by [[Joest Racing]].\n\nYet, during the autumn of 1998, after the necessity of GT1 homologation was dropped in favour of LM-GTP prototypes, regarding the speed and success of these closed GT coup\u00e9s like the [[Porsche 911 GT1]], [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR]], and the [[Toyota GT-One]], Audi also ordered their newly acquired Norfolk based RTN (Racing Technology Norfolk, led by [[Tony Southgate]]) to build a closed-cockpit car using the same drivetrain.\n\nThe ACO rules for closed-top prototypes allowed cars to run with larger air restrictors, resulting in more power (about 600&nbsp;hp), which resulted in a higher top speed in combination with the lower drag. To compensate this advantage over the duration of a race, the LMGTPs were limited to smaller tyres and smaller fuel tanks.\n\n===1999: The R8R and R8C===\n{{Main|Audi R8R|Audi R8C}}\nFollowing a period of testing, two R8Rs debuted at the 1999 [[12 Hours of Sebring]].  The [[BMW V12 LMR]] won, which was a strong sign towards the race in France. The already tested open-top Audi R8R, entered by [[Joest Racing]] was not fast enough to challenge for a win, finishing 3rd.\n\nAfter further tests and modifications, the Audis returned for Le Mans.  The new debuting R8Cs lacked pace and unfortunately suffered mechanical gearbox woes.  Lap times were 10 seconds down from the leading LMP and LMGTP competitors.  Joest's R8Rs ran steady, yet still was too slow to run for pole position.  After a race which saw the spectacular flights of the [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]] as well as leading cars of Toyota and BMW crashing out, the Audi R8R took 3rd and 4th behind the surviving #15 [[BMW V12 LMR]] and the Japanese-driven Toyota.\n\nBased on the experiences, Audi decided to regroup for 2000, and built a new R8 [[Roadster (automobile)|spyder]] together with Joest and Dallara. The British-built R8C coupe was retired, but Audi-owned [[Bentley]] developed the concept of the R8C closed cockpit LMGTP and entered the [[Bentley Speed 8|Bentley EXP Speed 8]] in 2001, winning the race with the [[Bentley Speed 8]] in 2003.\n\n===1999: Retiring competitors===\nAfter the 1999 Le Mans shame, Mercedes retired from GTs to focus on the return of the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] touring cars in 2000, as well as on F1. Toyota and BMW also went to F1, with BMW at least continuing to race for two years in the [[ALMS]], where the open roadster of [[Bill Auberlen]] also suffered a \"back flip\" during the [[Petit Le Mans]] at [[Road Atlanta]] in 2000, as the closed-cockpit Porsche of [[Yannick Dalmas]] had done in 1998. Despite the BMW V12 LMR not receiving further development, the German team [[Schnitzer Motorsport]] was almost as effective as Joest. Still the BMW V12 LMR could not match the Audi R8's might in the championship and lost almost every race against it. BMW returned to race the [[BMW M3]] in the GT class since, dominating in the ALMS and in [[World Touring Car Championship|WTCC]] as well as at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]].\n\nThis left only Porsche as a major possible challenger for 2000 \u2014 however the [[Porsche LMP]] project was scrapped before it had a chance to race. Rumours at that time said that [[Ferdinand Piech]] himself made them stay away, using his influence as a co-owner of Porsche as well as his management role at [[Volkswagen]], which would develop the upcoming SUV [[VW Touareg]] in cooperation with the [[Porsche Cayenne]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael J.

The car was developed by [[Audi|Audi Motorsport]] and [[Joest Racing]] and debuted in 2000, winning the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe R8 won Le Mans five times ([[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|2000]], [[2001 24 Hours of Le Mans|2001]], [[2002 24 Hours of Le Mans|2002]], [[2004 24 Hours of Le Mans|2004]] and [[2005 24 Hours of Le Mans|2005]]) and the overall season championship in the American Le Mans Series six times in a row (from 2000 to 2005).<ref name=r&t201208>{{cite journal|last=Bornhop|first=Andrew|title=Ode to an R8|journal=[[Road & Track]]|date=August 2012|volume=63|issue=12|page=61}}</ref>\n\nThe R8 won a hat trick at Le Mans in 2000-2002, campaigned by Audi Sport [[Infineon]] Team Joest and driven by [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], [[Emanuele Pirro]] and [[Frank Biela]]. First time out in 2000, the team won a 1-2-3 finish. Since then, the Audi R8 has won numerous championships and races, including further wins for 'privateer' teams at Le Mans in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe R8 is powered by a 3.6&nbsp;L Audi [[Fuel Stratified Injection|FSI]] V8. FSI stands for Fuel-Stratified Injection, which is a variation on the concept of [[gasoline direct injection]] developed by VW which maximizes both power and fuel economy at the same time. FSI technology can be found in products available to the normal public, across all brands in the [[Volkswagen Group]].\n\nThe power supplied by the R8, officially listed at about {{Convert|610|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 2000, 2001 and 2002, {{Convert|550|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} in 2003 and 2004 and {{Convert|520|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 2005, is sent to the rear wheels via a [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo]] six-speed [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential transmission]] with an electro\u2013pneumatic gear change. Unofficially, the works-team Audi R8 for Le Mans (2000, 2001 and 2002) is said to have had around {{Convert|670|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} instead of the quoted {{Convert|610|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The numbers were quoted at speed, and were due to the car making 50 extra horsepower due to twin ram-air intakes at speeds over {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Official torque numbers were quoted for this version of the engine at {{Convert|516|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 6500 rpm. The equation for horsepower (torque divided by 5250, multiplied by rpm) for these numbers produces a horsepower rating of {{convert|638|hp}} at the same 6500 rpm (516/5250*6500=638). The Audi R8's structure was designed from the very beginning to expedite parts changes during the race. The car has a chassis that has been likened to a [[Lego]] model \u2014 anything on the car can be changed and changed quickly. During its campaign, the Joest pit crew was able to change the entire rear transaxle of a damaged R8 \u2014 a process which usually takes between one and three hours \u2014 in as low as three minutes and 16 seconds.<ref name=r&t201208/> The reason for this was that the transmission, rear suspension and rear subframe were built as one unit. The car had numerous quick-connect hoses and easily removable bolts. The whole rear section of the car could be removed as a whole and a new back half installed with the help of a crane. The Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), organizers of the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] and the [[American Le Mans Series]] acted quickly to void this advantage by mandating the gearbox casing be the same item through the duration of the race, with only the internals being allowed to be changed. However, the R8 still had quicker access to the gearbox internals than any other car due to its quick-change construction . This was critical as the gearbox was the weak link in the car.\n\nThe R8's structure and body are both composed of [[carbon fibre]], a strong, lightweight polymer material.\n\nPerformance - from top speed to acceleration - was, as in most race car cases, variable depending on the car's setup. The highest speed of the R8 at Le Mans was {{convert|338|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in the practice sessions of the 2002 Le Mans 24 Hours Race. A low downforce setup could generate about {{convert|350|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAudi Sport's program saw tragedy in 2001 when on April 25, popular ex-F1 driver [[Michele Alboreto]] died in an accident after suffering a high-speed tyre failure during an R8 test session at the [[Lausitzring]] in eastern Germany.<ref name=nytimes>''Alboreto Is Killed Testing Audi R8'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 26, 2001, Page D7.</ref>\n\n===2003: Bentley breaks the streak===\nThe [[Bentley Speed 8]], which ran at Le Mans from 2001 to 2003, winning in 2003, utilised a heavily modified 4.0&nbsp;L version of the V8 engine from the Audi R8 .{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\nThe Bentley racing effort was campaigned by Team [[Bentley]] (Apex Motorsport) with assistance from longtime R8 competitor Joest Racing and Audi Sport UK. After 2002 the Joest factory team dropped its R8 campaign and left it to the privateers. Restrictor changes brought the power down to 550&nbsp;bhp for anyone still racing with the R8. However the maximum torque hardly changed.\n[[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], who won the previous three 24 Hours of Le Mans races in an R8, was assigned to drive the Bentley Speed 8, and helped guide the team to victory. (Kristensen went on to win the 2004 and 2005 races in an Audi R8). There is some similarity between the Bentley Speed 8 and the Audi R8's successor, the R10 TDI.\n\n===2005: End of active Competition===\nDuring the 2005 season, it was evident that its time at the front of the pack was drawing to a close. Audi had made the development of the [[Audi R10 TDI]] diesel public, and cars from other manufacturers and teams started to catch up in terms of on-the-track speed.  The ACO still felt that the R8 needed to be kept in check, therefore they reduced the restrictor size on the R8's engine, due to the car not meeting new hybrid regulations, and stipulated the car shall carry [[ballast weight]] in an attempt to make the races more competitive. The R8 was restricted even further to only 520&nbsp;bhp. At the 2005 Le Mans, the Audis failed to qualify on pole position; the fastest R8 started the race in third position.  However, the car was able to outlast all other competitors to eventually take its fifth checkered flag at the Circuit de la Sarthe and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  This victory was also notable since it was Tom Kristensen's 6th straight 24 Hours of Le Mans victory, and a record 7th overall, beating legendary driver [[Jacky Ickx]]'s previous record of 6 career 24 Hours of Le Mans victories.  To date the R8 remains one of the fastest petrol powered LMPs, setting a 3:29 at Le Mans, which was beaten only by the Lola-Aston Martins. However, the R8's best finish was at 379 laps, which is more than the Lola-Aston Martin's best at 373 laps.\n\n===2010: Classic car racing===\nTwo 2005 Audi R8s are driven by Doug Smith and [[Travis Engen]] in the GTP-WSC Enduro class of the [[Historic Sportscar Racing|HSR]] championship.\n\n==List of Records==\n\n* [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner - {{24hLM|2000}}, {{24hLM|2001}}, {{24hLM|2002}}, {{24hLM|2004}}, {{24hLM|2005}}\n* [[American Le Mans Series]] champion: [[2000 American Le Mans Series season|2000]], [[2001 American Le Mans Series season|2001]], [[2002 American Le Mans Series season|2002]], [[2003 American Le Mans Series season|2003]], [[2004 American Le Mans Series season|2004]], [[2005 American Le Mans Series season|2005]], [[2006 American Le Mans Series season|2006]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n* [[2001 European Le Mans Series season|European Le Mans Series]] champion: [[2001 European Le Mans Series season|2001]]\n* [[Le Mans Series]] champion: [[2004 Le Mans Series season|2004]]\n\u2020 - Season partially run by the [[Audi R10]] as well.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===2006: The R10 TDI===\n{{Main|Audi R10 TDI}}\nIn response to the new level of competition, development of the successor, known as the [[Audi R10 TDI]], has been completed.  The [[V12 engine]]d [[turbodiesel]] won at its race debut at the 2006 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] with both cars starting on the front row.  However, the pole sitting R10 had to start from the pit lane due to the need to rectify heat exchanger issues.\n\nEmanuele Pirro, Frank Biela and Marco Werner made history by becoming the first drivers to win the Le Mans 24-hour race in a diesel-powered car. The Audi R10 TDI completed a record 380 laps of the La Sarthe circuit, with Pirro at the wheel for the finish.  French trio [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], [[\u00c9ric H\u00e9lary]] and [[Franck Montagny]] took second in the [[Pescarolo Sport|Pescarolo]] Judd No 17, four laps adrift. Scotsman [[Allan McNish]] was third in the other Audi, which came in 13 laps down after suffering mechanical problems.\n[[Image:Paris 2006 - Audi R8.JPG|right|thumb|Audi R8 road car at the 2006 Paris Motor Show]]\nThe R8 continued to campaign the [[American Le Mans Series]] through the first half of the 2006 season, and made its final US appearance on July 1, 2006 at [[Lime Rock Park]], [[Connecticut]], piloted by McNish and Capello.  The R8 ended its career in style by winning the race, the 50th [[American Le Mans Series]] win for the Audi R8. The R10s participated in the rest of the ALMS season, beginning with the race at [[Miller Motorsports Park]], [[Utah]].\n\n===2007: R8 road car===\nThe name Audi R8 also is used by the production road [[sports car]] [[Audi R8]] which is based on the 2003 [[Audi Le Mans quattro]] [[concept car]], and the R8 race car experiences.  Production started in 2007.\n\n==24 Hours of Le Mans results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:700px\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Team\n! No\n! Drivers\n! Pole\n! Fastest<br>lap\n! Laps\n!

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nFundamentalism stands in opposition to the so-called gradualist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]].

This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to [[nuclear weapon]]s: a policy that has remained in place ever since.<ref name=\"Mitchell19961994\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=194}}</ref> The 1964 policy document, ''SNP & You'', contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to [[full employment]], government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of [[cooperative]]s and [[credit union]]s, extensive building of [[council house]]s (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a [[minimum wage]] and an improved [[NHS Scotland|national health service]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nThe 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a co-operative.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies.<ref name=\"Brand199027\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=27|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Hassan2009121\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=121}}</ref> There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the ''Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)''.<ref name=\"Hepburn2013143\">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503092815/https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the UK wide referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devenney|first=Andrew D.|date=2008|title=Regional Resistance to European Integration: The Case of the Scottish National Party, 1961-1972|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20762312|journal=Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume=33|issue=3 (125)|pages=319\u2013345|issn=0172-6404}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37107148|title=The dilemma facing Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists|last=Ley|first=Shaun|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a \"social-democratic\" party, to an expressly \"[[socialism|socialist]]\" party. Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Economic Policy===\n[[File:Revenue Scotland logo.png|left|thumb|The [[First Sturgeon government|Sturgeon Government]] created [[Revenue Scotland]] in 2015.]]\nWith the SNP's policy base being mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition, the party is committed to polices such as [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]].

Sixty-four of the films he illustrated won [[Academy Award|Oscar]]s, including ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'', ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''.\n\nMany of his images of Hollywood actresses are instantly recognizable: [[Liza Minnelli]] in derby hat and black stockings, [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Lauren Bacall]] in beret and cape, [[Ava Gardner]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Sophia Loren]]. Equally, he portrayed the male stars: [[Marlon Brando]] astride his motorcycle as \"The Wild One\", a bare-chested [[James Dean]], [[John Wayne]] neckerchief and cowboy hat, [[Humphrey Bogart]] in his white dinner jacket.\n\nMany of Campeggi's subjects became close personal friends. Ava Gardner asked him to accompany her down the [[red carpet]] at one of her movie premieres. His wife recounted a story of Elizabeth Taylor lending her maternity clothes after having just given birth herself. He described [[Marilyn Monroe]], whom he first painted in the early 1950s, as \"my icon and surely the most enchanting woman I have ever met.\"\n\n==Return to Italy==\nIn the 1970s when film poster illustration lost impact in the face of television and newspaper advertising, Campeggi returned to Florence. There he painted a series of 50 images depicting [[Siena]]'s [[Palio]] horse race (2001). Another series of 50 images \"I Have Seen the Rush of Jousts\" (2003) was commissioned by the city of [[Arezzo]] to celebrate the Jousting Tournaments of Saracen, the title taken from ''[[Dante's Inferno]]''.\n\nCampeggi's other important commissions included the painting of five large battle scenes from the Italian [[Risorgimento]] on behalf of the [[Carabinieri]] police force (early 1970s); a portrait of the [[Italian Resistance]] hero [[Salvo D'Acquisto]] which appeared as an Italian [[postage stamp]] (1975); a series of 35 images for the City of Florence depicting their traditional \"Calcio Storico\" soccer match (1997); and the creation of one of [[Stations of the Cross|the Stations of the Cross]] for the rededication of the city of [[Assisi]] (2004). Campeggi's best known work in Italy may be the Portrait of [[Garibaldi]].\n\nIn 2008, for the 150th anniversary of the birth of [[Giacomo Puccini]], Campeggi was commissioned to produce a special tribute: \"The Girls of Puccini\". Also in 2008 he began work on a [[Napoleon]] series to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Emperor's association with the island of [[Elba]]. The \"Napoleon at Elba\" exhibition opened in September 2008 at [[Portoferraio]].\n\nThe most recent Campeggi exhibition commemorated one of the largest armed conflicts ever to take place in Italy \u2013 The Battle of Campaldino fought between the cities of Florence and Arezzo on June 11, 1289.

He described [[Marilyn Monroe]], whom he first painted in the early 1950s, as \"my icon and surely the most enchanting woman I have ever met.\"\n\n==Return to Italy==\nIn the 1970s when film poster illustration lost impact in the face of television and newspaper advertising, Campeggi returned to Florence. There he painted a series of 50 images depicting [[Siena]]'s [[Palio]] horse race (2001). Another series of 50 images \"I Have Seen the Rush of Jousts\" (2003) was commissioned by the city of [[Arezzo]] to celebrate the Jousting Tournaments of Saracen, the title taken from ''[[Dante's Inferno]]''.\n\nCampeggi's other important commissions included the painting of five large battle scenes from the Italian [[Risorgimento]] on behalf of the [[Carabinieri]] police force (early 1970s); a portrait of the [[Italian Resistance]] hero [[Salvo D'Acquisto]] which appeared as an Italian [[postage stamp]] (1975); a series of 35 images for the City of Florence depicting their traditional \"Calcio Storico\" soccer match (1997); and the creation of one of [[Stations of the Cross|the Stations of the Cross]] for the rededication of the city of [[Assisi]] (2004). Campeggi's best known work in Italy may be the Portrait of [[Garibaldi]].\n\nIn 2008, for the 150th anniversary of the birth of [[Giacomo Puccini]], Campeggi was commissioned to produce a special tribute: \"The Girls of Puccini\". Also in 2008 he began work on a [[Napoleon]] series to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Emperor's association with the island of [[Elba]]. The \"Napoleon at Elba\" exhibition opened in September 2008 at [[Portoferraio]].\n\nThe most recent Campeggi exhibition commemorated one of the largest armed conflicts ever to take place in Italy \u2013 The Battle of Campaldino fought between the cities of Florence and Arezzo on June 11, 1289. It is a spectacular assembly of large and dramatic battle scenes combined with more intimate portraits of the knights and noblemen who led the cavalry and infantry \u2013 all liberally splashed with \u201cI Colori Della Battaglia\u201d\n\nCampeggi died on 29 August 2018, at the age of 95.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[La Repubblica]]|url=https://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/cinema/2018/08/29/news/e_morto_silvano_campeggi-205173659/?ref=fbpz|title=\u00c8 morto Silvano Campeggi, cartellonista di Hollywood|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Major exhibitions==\n* ''The Movies Through the Posters of Silvano Campeggi'' - The Medici Riccardi Palace, Florence (1988, subsequently touring to [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]])\n* ''Bozzetti (Final Sketches)'' \u2013 Exhibition Palace, Rome (1995, partially touring to New York and [[Chicago]])\n* ''Florentine Women Though the Ages'' \u2013 [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence (2006)\n* ''3000 Times \u2013 The Art of the Movie Poster'' - Film Society of [[Lincoln Center]], New York (2007)\n* ''Elba \u2013 Island of the Emperor'' \u2013 Co-sponsored by the [[Region of Tuscany]], the [[Province of Livorno]] and the Town Council of Portoferriao, Portoferriao, Italy (2008)\n* ''The Women of Puccini'' \u2013 Co-sponsored by the Puccini Festival, The Town Council of [[Viareggio]] and the Region of Tuscany, [[Rive del Lago]], Italy (2009, scheduled for a world tour 2010)\n* ''Campaldino \u2013 Battle Colors'' \u2013 Major co-sponsors: the Bank of Etruria, the Region of Tuscany and the Province of Arezzo, [[Popi]], Italy (2009)\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Fiorino D'Oro]] (2000) \u2013 Italy's most prestigious award for artistic achievement.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Campeggi, Silvano}}\n[[Category:20th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Italian male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Hollywood]]\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:2018 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Florence]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMajor exhibitions:typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvano_Campeggi"}

The squares began to take shape during [[Herman Willem Daendels|Daendels']] rule in the early 19th century; ''Waterlooplein'' became the main parade and ceremonial square, while the ''Buffelsveld'' (\"buffalo field\") was renamed ''Champ de Mars'' after the [[Champ de Mars|field in Paris]] due to [[French and British interludes in the Dutch East Indies|French influence]] and used as a military exercise field.\n\nIn 1818, a few years after the formation of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the square's name was changed into ''Koningsplein'' (\"King's square\"). Around the same time the Governor-General's residence was moved to a new palace, now known as [[Merdeka Palace|Istana Merdeka]]. The colonial government built athletic tracks, a stadium and sports facilities on ''Koningsplein''. The locals called the square ''Lapangan Gambir'', after ''[[Uncaria gambir]]'', a plant which grows around the field. The ''Lapangan Gambir'' became the location of ''[[Pasar Gambir]]'', a ''[[Pasar Malam]]'' (night market) [[fair]] and festival to commemorate [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina's]] birthday in 1906. Since 1921 ''Pasar Gambir'' was held annually, turning into the annual modern [[Jakarta Fair]]. The square's name remained the same throughout colonial Dutch East Indies era until the Japanese invasion in 1942.\n\n===Lapangan Ikada===\nIn 1942, during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], the square was named ''Lapangan Ikada'' (acronym of ''Ikatan Atletik Djakarta'' or Jakarta Athletic Bond). The [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclamation of Indonesian independence]] was originally intended to be staged at Lapangan Ikada. It was however moved to a house in Jalan Pegangsaan (now Jalan Proklamasi). On 19 September 1945, [[Sukarno]] held his Indonesian independence and anti-colonialism/imperialism speech, during ''Rapat Akbar'' or grand meeting.<ref name=\"jakarta1\"/> During [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945-1949), the returning Dutch colonial forces manage to gain control over Jakarta (Batavia) and its vicinity, and renamed most of places to their colonial names; including ''Ikada'' field changed back to ''Koningsplein''.\n\n[[File:Sukarno speaking on podium, Impressions of the Fight ... in Indonesia, p8.jpg|thumb|center|550px|[[Sukarno]] speaking at the ''Rapat Akbar'' on 19 September 1945.]]\n\n===Medan Merdeka===\n[[File:Merdeka Square 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Merdeka Square in 1965]]\nIn 1949 Sukarno changed the name of ''Koningsplein'' to ''Medan Merdeka''  (\"Independence Square\"). By this time, the square was already crowded by the existence of Gambir Railway Station, Police Department Head Office, Telephone Company Office, [[Ikada Stadium]], a sport-hall, many parks, many football fields and tennis lawns.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nIn 1954, President Sukarno launched the idea of erecting a \"National Monument\" at the center of Merdeka Square. Sukarno desired that the Indonesian people and the young independent nation had something to be proud of, a monument to commemorate the struggle for independence.<ref>[http://indahnesia.com/indonesia/JAKHIS/historic_trip.php indahnesia.com - Jakarta - Historic trip - Historic trip through the old city - Discover Indonesia Online]</ref>  His ambition was to make the Monas the tallest building in Jakarta, higher than [[Borobudur]] and larger than the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref name=\"Dovey\">{{cite book| title = Becoming Places: Urbanism / Architecture / Identity / Power | first = Kim | last = [[Kim Dovey|Dovey]]|author2=Eka Permanasari| chapter = Monas and Merdeka Square | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ekx8AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=id#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher = Routledge | year = 2010 | location = New York |isbn = 9780203875001 |accessdate = 28 May 2015}}</ref> A design competition was held in 1956, followed by a second competition in 1960, however the President was not satisfied by the design entries, and no winner was announced. Instead Sukarno \u2014 who had previously studied architecture \u2014 asked architects to refine sketches made by himself. The design of the monument was eventually resulted from the work of architect Soedarsono. Sukarno's layout for Merdeka Square was based on a plan initially developed in 1892 with diagonal streets radiating from the monument.<ref name=\"Dovey\"/>\n\nThe construction of [[National Monument (Indonesia)|National Monument]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]:''Monumen Nasional'' or ''Monas'') was initiated in 1961, but it was only completed in 1976. Except the railway station, other buildings in the square \u2014 such as the [[Ikada Stadium]] and sports facilities \u2014 were demolished to make way for the construction of the monument, and replaced by four segments of garden. Today, the square is more popular with its nickname ''Lapangan Monas''.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nThe Merdeka Square is crossed by four diagonal streets which form an \"X\" with the National Monument at its center. The street is called ''Jalan Silang Monas'' and separates the square into four parts: North, East, South, and West parks. Soon after construction works of the National Monument were completed, new buildings were grown at the southern part of the square. The north, east and west park remained a park, while the southern segment was developed into a building complex. In the 1970s to early 1990s, this southern section was occupied by the fairground for [[Jakarta Fair]] from 1968 to 1992, while the southwest corner of the south park was used as ''Taman Ria Jakarta'' or Jakarta [[amusement park]], including many exhibition halls, restaurants and night-clubs.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nThe design of the parks stayed relatively unchanged from the 1970s to mid 1990s, and this situation led to the preparation of a master plan for redeveloping the square, established in 1993. The 1993 master plan guided the ongoing renovation conducted in the late 1990s to the 2000s, and gave the Merdeka square its present look. The aim was to return the function of Merdeka Square as an open space and green area. All buildings were removed and the square was transformed back to greenery.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/> Since the early 1990s the fairground and the amusement park in the southern park were demolished had been given the old park function once again. The road surrounding the monument is not accessible to motorized traffic.\n\n[[Image:Merdeka Square Chairil Anwar Bust.JPG|thumb|right|The bust memorial of [[Chairil Anwar]], Indonesian poet, northern park of Merdeka Square.]]\nIn 2002, after [[Megawati Sukarnoputri|Megawati]] was elected president, the Governor of Jakarta Sutiyoso built a high fence with gates and guards to enclose the entire square. While visitors can access the square without charge, beggars, vendors, homeless and other social groups were excluded. An army encampment has been set up within the compound to enforce the new rules.<ref name=\"Dovey\"/> Other than attracted to the National Monument stands in the center, the square itself is Jakartans' popular destination for family recreation and outdoor sports activities during weekend, such as family picnics, flying [[kite]]s, [[calisthenics]], [[association football|football]] games, [[jogging]] and bicycling.<ref name=\"Indonesia Travel\"/> The paved [[plaza]] surrounds the monument often host national events as well as [[Demonstration (people)|civic demonstrations]]. [[Military parade|Military]] and [[Float (parade)|float]] [[parade]]s usually took place during the Jakarta anniversary around 22 June and Indonesian independence commemoration around 17 August. Flag raising ceremonies are held at the north end during city-wide public anniversaries.\n\nSince 2016, all Independence Day national celebrations begin with the departure and arrival of replicas of both the national flag and the text of the Proclamation of Independence, in the monument and the square, en route to Merdeka Palace in the morning, and returning to the square in the evening.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Jakarta-Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The view of Merdeka Square and Jakarta [[skyline]] from [[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta]].]]\nThe shape of Merdeka Square has been altered several times within its two-century history. The current design is mainly based on the site plan from the 1960s \u2014 as a part of the design of the National Monument that incorporated diagonal crossed streets that separated four cardinal parks. Recent development on the square is based on a master plan produced in 1993.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nA renovation began in the mid 1990s for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Indonesian Independence in 1995, and continued well to the 2000s. The renovation moved the roundabout street further from the monument as it was feared that the vibrations from the passing vehicles would shakes and disturbs the monument foundation. However, later decided that the vehicles should be prohibited to enter the square altogether. The further roundabout create a larger central garden around the monument. The asphalt road was changed to French stone pavement and created a grand [[plaza]] around the monument.\n[[File:Merdeka Square Model 1.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural model of Merdeka Square, displayed in National Monument]]\nThe Merdeka square consists of two zones:\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka'' (Medan Merdeka Park). The large trees, reflecting ponds and fountains are located in this zone. The zone span from the fences on the outer rim of the park to the pedestrian path around the park.\n# ''Ruang Agung'' (The Grand Space). It is the grand space to enhance the view of National Monument. There are no large trees or any visual obstructions allowed to remain in this zone. It is located from the pedestrian path to the National Monument in the center. It consists of grass fields, stone paved grand plaza, and a central garden around the monument filled with colorful flowers and decorative plants.\n\nThere are four parks in Merdeka Square according to the cardinal points:\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Utara'' (North Merdeka Park). The entrance to the tunnel that leads to the National Monument is located on this north park. A reflecting pond, the [[Prince Diponegoro Monument|equestrian statue of Diponegoro]] and a bust statue of Indonesian poet [[Chairil Anwar]] also located in this area.\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Timur'' (East Merdeka Park). Immediately located near the [[Gambir Station]]. The reflecting pond and the statue of [[Kartini]], Indonesian [[heroine]] of women emancipation, donated by [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] that originally stood in front of Taman Suropati in Menteng is relocated here.\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Selatan'' (South Merdeka Park). The Rapat Akbar 19 September 1945 monument or a flag-bearing statue is located here. The [[Chital|spotted deer]] park is located on southeast corner. The south park also displays unique plants as the symbol of the [[Provinces of Indonesia|33 Indonesian provinces]]. The IRTI parking ground, souvenir and foodstalls for National Monument visitors is located in this southern park.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Barat'' (West Merdeka Park). The dancing illuminated fountain is located here. The fountain show with music is performed every weekend nights.

The squares began to take shape during [[Herman Willem Daendels|Daendels']] rule in the early 19th century; ''Waterlooplein'' became the main parade and ceremonial square, while the ''Buffelsveld'' (\"buffalo field\") was renamed ''Champ de Mars'' after the [[Champ de Mars|field in Paris]] due to [[French and British interludes in the Dutch East Indies|French influence]] and used as a military exercise field.\n\nIn 1818, a few years after the formation of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the square's name was changed into ''Koningsplein'' (\"King's square\"). Around the same time the Governor-General's residence was moved to a new palace, now known as [[Merdeka Palace|Istana Merdeka]]. The colonial government built athletic tracks, a stadium and sports facilities on ''Koningsplein''. The locals called the square ''Lapangan Gambir'', after ''[[Uncaria gambir]]'', a plant which grows around the field. The ''Lapangan Gambir'' became the location of ''[[Pasar Gambir]]'', a ''[[Pasar Malam]]'' (night market) [[fair]] and festival to commemorate [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina's]] birthday in 1906. Since 1921 ''Pasar Gambir'' was held annually, turning into the annual modern [[Jakarta Fair]]. The square's name remained the same throughout colonial Dutch East Indies era until the Japanese invasion in 1942.\n\n===Lapangan Ikada===\nIn 1942, during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], the square was named ''Lapangan Ikada'' (acronym of ''Ikatan Atletik Djakarta'' or Jakarta Athletic Bond). The [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclamation of Indonesian independence]] was originally intended to be staged at Lapangan Ikada. It was however moved to a house in Jalan Pegangsaan (now Jalan Proklamasi). On 19 September 1945, [[Sukarno]] held his Indonesian independence and anti-colonialism/imperialism speech, during ''Rapat Akbar'' or grand meeting.<ref name=\"jakarta1\"/> During [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945-1949), the returning Dutch colonial forces manage to gain control over Jakarta (Batavia) and its vicinity, and renamed most of places to their colonial names; including ''Ikada'' field changed back to ''Koningsplein''.\n\n[[File:Sukarno speaking on podium, Impressions of the Fight ... in Indonesia, p8.jpg|thumb|center|550px|[[Sukarno]] speaking at the ''Rapat Akbar'' on 19 September 1945.]]\n\n===Medan Merdeka===\n[[File:Merdeka Square 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Merdeka Square in 1965]]\nIn 1949 Sukarno changed the name of ''Koningsplein'' to ''Medan Merdeka''  (\"Independence Square\"). By this time, the square was already crowded by the existence of Gambir Railway Station, Police Department Head Office, Telephone Company Office, [[Ikada Stadium]], a sport-hall, many parks, many football fields and tennis lawns.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nIn 1954, President Sukarno launched the idea of erecting a \"National Monument\" at the center of Merdeka Square. Sukarno desired that the Indonesian people and the young independent nation had something to be proud of, a monument to commemorate the struggle for independence.<ref>[http://indahnesia.com/indonesia/JAKHIS/historic_trip.php indahnesia.com - Jakarta - Historic trip - Historic trip through the old city - Discover Indonesia Online]</ref>  His ambition was to make the Monas the tallest building in Jakarta, higher than [[Borobudur]] and larger than the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref name=\"Dovey\">{{cite book| title = Becoming Places: Urbanism / Architecture / Identity / Power | first = Kim | last = [[Kim Dovey|Dovey]]|author2=Eka Permanasari| chapter = Monas and Merdeka Square | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ekx8AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=id#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher = Routledge | year = 2010 | location = New York |isbn = 9780203875001 |accessdate = 28 May 2015}}</ref> A design competition was held in 1956, followed by a second competition in 1960, however the President was not satisfied by the design entries, and no winner was announced. Instead Sukarno \u2014 who had previously studied architecture \u2014 asked architects to refine sketches made by himself. The design of the monument was eventually resulted from the work of architect Soedarsono. Sukarno's layout for Merdeka Square was based on a plan initially developed in 1892 with diagonal streets radiating from the monument.<ref name=\"Dovey\"/>\n\nThe construction of [[National Monument (Indonesia)|National Monument]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]:''Monumen Nasional'' or ''Monas'') was initiated in 1961, but it was only completed in 1976. Except the railway station, other buildings in the square \u2014 such as the [[Ikada Stadium]] and sports facilities \u2014 were demolished to make way for the construction of the monument, and replaced by four segments of garden. Today, the square is more popular with its nickname ''Lapangan Monas''.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nThe Merdeka Square is crossed by four diagonal streets which form an \"X\" with the National Monument at its center. The street is called ''Jalan Silang Monas'' and separates the square into four parts: North, East, South, and West parks. Soon after construction works of the National Monument were completed, new buildings were grown at the southern part of the square. The north, east and west park remained a park, while the southern segment was developed into a building complex. In the 1970s to early 1990s, this southern section was occupied by the fairground for [[Jakarta Fair]] from 1968 to 1992, while the southwest corner of the south park was used as ''Taman Ria Jakarta'' or Jakarta [[amusement park]], including many exhibition halls, restaurants and night-clubs.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nThe design of the parks stayed relatively unchanged from the 1970s to mid 1990s, and this situation led to the preparation of a master plan for redeveloping the square, established in 1993. The 1993 master plan guided the ongoing renovation conducted in the late 1990s to the 2000s, and gave the Merdeka square its present look. The aim was to return the function of Merdeka Square as an open space and green area. All buildings were removed and the square was transformed back to greenery.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/> Since the early 1990s the fairground and the amusement park in the southern park were demolished had been given the old park function once again. The road surrounding the monument is not accessible to motorized traffic.\n\n[[Image:Merdeka Square Chairil Anwar Bust.JPG|thumb|right|The bust memorial of [[Chairil Anwar]], Indonesian poet, northern park of Merdeka Square.]]\nIn 2002, after [[Megawati Sukarnoputri|Megawati]] was elected president, the Governor of Jakarta Sutiyoso built a high fence with gates and guards to enclose the entire square. While visitors can access the square without charge, beggars, vendors, homeless and other social groups were excluded. An army encampment has been set up within the compound to enforce the new rules.<ref name=\"Dovey\"/> Other than attracted to the National Monument stands in the center, the square itself is Jakartans' popular destination for family recreation and outdoor sports activities during weekend, such as family picnics, flying [[kite]]s, [[calisthenics]], [[association football|football]] games, [[jogging]] and bicycling.<ref name=\"Indonesia Travel\"/> The paved [[plaza]] surrounds the monument often host national events as well as [[Demonstration (people)|civic demonstrations]]. [[Military parade|Military]] and [[Float (parade)|float]] [[parade]]s usually took place during the Jakarta anniversary around 22 June and Indonesian independence commemoration around 17 August. Flag raising ceremonies are held at the north end during city-wide public anniversaries.\n\nSince 2016, all Independence Day national celebrations begin with the departure and arrival of replicas of both the national flag and the text of the Proclamation of Independence, in the monument and the square, en route to Merdeka Palace in the morning, and returning to the square in the evening.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Jakarta-Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The view of Merdeka Square and Jakarta [[skyline]] from [[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta]].]]\nThe shape of Merdeka Square has been altered several times within its two-century history. The current design is mainly based on the site plan from the 1960s \u2014 as a part of the design of the National Monument that incorporated diagonal crossed streets that separated four cardinal parks. Recent development on the square is based on a master plan produced in 1993.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n\nA renovation began in the mid 1990s for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Indonesian Independence in 1995, and continued well to the 2000s. The renovation moved the roundabout street further from the monument as it was feared that the vibrations from the passing vehicles would shakes and disturbs the monument foundation. However, later decided that the vehicles should be prohibited to enter the square altogether. The further roundabout create a larger central garden around the monument. The asphalt road was changed to French stone pavement and created a grand [[plaza]] around the monument.\n[[File:Merdeka Square Model 1.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural model of Merdeka Square, displayed in National Monument]]\nThe Merdeka square consists of two zones:\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka'' (Medan Merdeka Park). The large trees, reflecting ponds and fountains are located in this zone. The zone span from the fences on the outer rim of the park to the pedestrian path around the park.\n# ''Ruang Agung'' (The Grand Space). It is the grand space to enhance the view of National Monument. There are no large trees or any visual obstructions allowed to remain in this zone. It is located from the pedestrian path to the National Monument in the center. It consists of grass fields, stone paved grand plaza, and a central garden around the monument filled with colorful flowers and decorative plants.\n\nThere are four parks in Merdeka Square according to the cardinal points:\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Utara'' (North Merdeka Park). The entrance to the tunnel that leads to the National Monument is located on this north park. A reflecting pond, the [[Prince Diponegoro Monument|equestrian statue of Diponegoro]] and a bust statue of Indonesian poet [[Chairil Anwar]] also located in this area.\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Timur'' (East Merdeka Park). Immediately located near the [[Gambir Station]]. The reflecting pond and the statue of [[Kartini]], Indonesian [[heroine]] of women emancipation, donated by [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] that originally stood in front of Taman Suropati in Menteng is relocated here.\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Selatan'' (South Merdeka Park). The Rapat Akbar 19 September 1945 monument or a flag-bearing statue is located here. The [[Chital|spotted deer]] park is located on southeast corner. The south park also displays unique plants as the symbol of the [[Provinces of Indonesia|33 Indonesian provinces]]. The IRTI parking ground, souvenir and foodstalls for National Monument visitors is located in this southern park.<ref name=\"Priatmodjo\"/>\n# ''Taman Medan Merdeka Barat'' (West Merdeka Park). The dancing illuminated fountain is located here. The fountain show with music is performed every weekend nights. The bust of Mohammad Husni Thamrin, a national hero from Jakarta, is located here.\n\n==In vicinity==\n[[File:Merdeka Square Jakarta Map en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Map of Merdeka Square, Jakarta, and surrounding important buildings.]]\n\nMerdeka square is the heart of [[Jakarta]] as well as the centre of Indonesia.
