Russian, late 19th century, [[Kremlin Armoury]]]]\n\nJasper is an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] rock of virtually any color stemming from the mineral content of the original sediments or ash.  Patterns arise during the consolidation process forming flow and depositional patterns in the original silica rich [[sediment]] or [[volcanic ash]]. [[Hydrothermal circulation]] is generally thought to be required in the formation of jasper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nJasper can be modified by the diffusion of minerals along discontinuities providing the appearance of vegetative growth, i.e., [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendritic]]. The original materials are often fractured and/or distorted, after deposition, into diverse patterns, which are later filled in with other colorful minerals. Weathering, with time, will create intensely colored superficial rinds.\n\nThe classification and naming of jasper varieties presents a challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofjaspers.com/index.html |title=World of Jaspers |publisher=Hans Gamma}}</ref> Terms attributed to various well-defined materials includes the geographic locality where it is found, sometimes quite restricted such as \"Bruneau\" (a canyon) and \"Lahontan\" (a lake), rivers and even individual mountains; many are fanciful, such as \"forest fire\" or \"rainbow\", while others are descriptive, such as \"autumn\" or \"porcelain\". A few are designated by the place of origin such as a brown Egyptian or red African.\n\n===Banded iron formations ===\nJasper is the main component in the silica-rich parts of [[Banded iron formation|banded iron formations]] (BIFs) which indicate low, but present, amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water such as during the [[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation Event]] or snowball earths.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to Build a Habitable Planet|last=Broecker|first=W.S.|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>  The red bands, typically more competent than the hematite layers surrounding it, are made of microcrystalline red chert, also called jasper.\n\n===Picture jaspers{{anchor|picture}}===\nPicture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns {such as banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), dendritic or color variations} resulting in what appear to be scenes or images (on a cut section).  Diffusion from a center produces a distinctive [[Orbicular jasper|orbicular]] appearance, i.e., leopard skin jasper, or linear banding from a fracture as seen in leisegang jasper. Healed, fragmented rock produces [[breccia]]ted (broken) jasper.  \n\nWhile these \"picture jaspers\" can be found all over the world, specific colors or patterns are unique to the geographic region from which they originate. The primary source of the stone is [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Purbalingga]] district.[[Oregon]]'s [[Biggs jasper]], and [[Idaho]]'s [[Bruneau jasper]] from the [[Bruneau River]] canyon are particularly fine examples. Other examples can be seen at [[Ynys Llanddwyn|Llanddwyn Island]] in [[Wales]].<ref>[http://www.gemsociety.org/article/jasper-gem-information/ Jasper Gemological Information] - International Gem Society (IGS) Retrieved 16 January 2015</ref>\n\n===Basanite{{anchor|basanite}}===\n''Basanite'', ''lydian stone'', or ''lydite'' are a variety of jasper from New England which is black [[flint]]y or [[chert]]y.

Russian, late 19th century, [[Kremlin Armoury]]]]\n\nJasper is an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] rock of virtually any color stemming from the mineral content of the original sediments or ash.  Patterns arise during the consolidation process forming flow and depositional patterns in the original silica rich [[sediment]] or [[volcanic ash]]. [[Hydrothermal circulation]] is generally thought to be required in the formation of jasper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nJasper can be modified by the diffusion of minerals along discontinuities providing the appearance of vegetative growth, i.e., [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendritic]]. The original materials are often fractured and/or distorted, after deposition, into diverse patterns, which are later filled in with other colorful minerals. Weathering, with time, will create intensely colored superficial rinds.\n\nThe classification and naming of jasper varieties presents a challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofjaspers.com/index.html |title=World of Jaspers |publisher=Hans Gamma}}</ref> Terms attributed to various well-defined materials includes the geographic locality where it is found, sometimes quite restricted such as \"Bruneau\" (a canyon) and \"Lahontan\" (a lake), rivers and even individual mountains; many are fanciful, such as \"forest fire\" or \"rainbow\", while others are descriptive, such as \"autumn\" or \"porcelain\". A few are designated by the place of origin such as a brown Egyptian or red African.\n\n===Banded iron formations ===\nJasper is the main component in the silica-rich parts of [[Banded iron formation|banded iron formations]] (BIFs) which indicate low, but present, amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water such as during the [[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation Event]] or snowball earths.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to Build a Habitable Planet|last=Broecker|first=W.S.|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>  The red bands, typically more competent than the hematite layers surrounding it, are made of microcrystalline red chert, also called jasper.\n\n===Picture jaspers{{anchor|picture}}===\nPicture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns {such as banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), dendritic or color variations} resulting in what appear to be scenes or images (on a cut section).  Diffusion from a center produces a distinctive [[Orbicular jasper|orbicular]] appearance, i.e., leopard skin jasper, or linear banding from a fracture as seen in leisegang jasper. Healed, fragmented rock produces [[breccia]]ted (broken) jasper.  \n\nWhile these \"picture jaspers\" can be found all over the world, specific colors or patterns are unique to the geographic region from which they originate. The primary source of the stone is [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Purbalingga]] district.[[Oregon]]'s [[Biggs jasper]], and [[Idaho]]'s [[Bruneau jasper]] from the [[Bruneau River]] canyon are particularly fine examples. Other examples can be seen at [[Ynys Llanddwyn|Llanddwyn Island]] in [[Wales]].<ref>[http://www.gemsociety.org/article/jasper-gem-information/ Jasper Gemological Information] - International Gem Society (IGS) Retrieved 16 January 2015</ref>\n\n===Basanite{{anchor|basanite}}===\n''Basanite'', ''lydian stone'', or ''lydite'' are a variety of jasper from New England which is black [[flint]]y or [[chert]]y.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They becam e frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

The Political Assembly is composed of designated delegates from EPP member parties, associated parties, member associations and other affiliated groups. The Political Assembly meets at least three times a year.\n\n===Congress===\nThe Congress is the highest decision-making body of the EPP. It is composed of delegates from member parties, EPP associations, [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]] MEPs, the EPP Presidency, national heads of party and government, and European Commissioners who belong to a member party, with the numbers of delegates being weighted according to the EPP's share of MEPs, and individual delegates being elected by member parties according to member parties' rules.{{sfn|Jansen|Van Hecke|2011|p=109}}\n\nUnder the EPP's statutes the Congress must meet once every three years, but it also meets normally during the years of elections for the European Parliament (every five years), and extraordinary Congresses have also been summoned. The Congress elects the EPP Presidency every three years, decides on the main policy documents and electoral programmes, and provides a platform for the EPP's heads of government and party leaders.\n\n==Activities within the party==\n\n===Summit===\nEPP leaders meet for the EPP Summit a few hours before each meeting of the [[European Council]] in order to formulate common positions.

It also invites individual Commissioners to the EPP Summit meetings and to EPP Ministerial meetings.\n\nFollowing amendments to the EU Regulation that governs [[Europarties]] in 2007, the EPP, like the other \"Europarties\", is responsible for organising a pan-European campaign for the [[European elections]] every five years. According to the [[Lisbon Treaty]], the parties must present candidates for [[President of the European Commission]], but the EPP had already done this by endorsing [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] for a second term in April 2009.\n\nThe year 2014 saw the first fully fledged campaign of the EPP ahead of the [[2014 European Parliament election|European elections of that year]]. The party nominated former Luxembourgish Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] as its candidate for President of the European Commission and led a pan-European campaign in coordination with the national campaigns of all its member parties.\n\n== Activities within European institutions ==\nAs of December 2019, the EPP will hold the Presidency of the European Commission with [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (CDU).\n\n===Overview of the European institutions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Full members are parties from EU states. They have absolute rights to vote in all the EPP's organs and on all matters. Associate members have the same voting rights as full members except for matters concerning the EU's structure or policies.

It decides on the general political guidelines of the EPP and presides over its Political Assembly. The Presidency is composed of the President, ten Vice-Presidents, the Honorary Presidents, the Secretary General and the Treasurer. The Chairperson of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the Presidents of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, and the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] (if they are a member of an EPP member party) are all ''ex officio'' Vice-Presidents.\n[[File:Donald_Tusk_(6165309851)_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|250px|President of the EPP [[Donald Tusk]]]]\n\nAs of November 2019 the Presidency<ref>{{Cite web|title = EPP Presidency|url = http://www.epp.eu/structure/presidency/|website = European People's Party}}</ref> of the EPP is (Vice Presidents in the order of votes received at the EPP Congress in Zagreb):\n\n*{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Donald Tusk]] \u2013 President (former Prime Minister and President of the European Council)\n*{{flagicon|Spain}} [[Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White]] \u2013 Secretary General (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Bulgaria}} [[Mariya Gabriel]] \u2013 Vice President (EU Commissioner)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[David McAllister]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP, former Minister-President)\n*{{flagicon|Ireland}} [[Helen McEntee]] \u2013 Vice President (Minister)\n*{{flagicon|Austria}} [[Johannes Hahn]] \u2013 Vice President (EU Commissioner)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Esther de Lange]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Antonio Tajani]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP, former European Parliament President, former Commission Vice President)\n*{{flagicon|Romania}} [[Siegfried Mure\u0219an]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Franck Proust]] \u2013 Vice President (former MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Paulo Rangel]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Petteri Orpo]] \u2013 Vice President (Leader of Kokoomus, former Minister of Finance)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Christian Schmidt (politician)|Christian Schmidt]] \u2013 Treasurer (MP, former Minister)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Ursula von der Leyen]] \u2013 ''Ex officio'' Vice-President (President-elect of the European Commission) \n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Manfred Weber]] \u2013 ''Ex officio'' Vice-President (Chairperson of the EPP Group in European Parliament) \n*{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] \u2013 Honorary President (President of Finland)\n\n===Political Assembly===\nThe Political Assembly defines the political positions of the EPP between Congresses, and decides on membership applications, political guidelines and the budget. The Political Assembly is composed of designated delegates from EPP member parties, associated parties, member associations and other affiliated groups. The Political Assembly meets at least three times a year.\n\n===Congress===\nThe Congress is the highest decision-making body of the EPP. It is composed of delegates from member parties, EPP associations, [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]] MEPs, the EPP Presidency, national heads of party and government, and European Commissioners who belong to a member party, with the numbers of delegates being weighted according to the EPP's share of MEPs, and individual delegates being elected by member parties according to member parties' rules.{{sfn|Jansen|Van Hecke|2011|p=109}}\n\nUnder the EPP's statutes the Congress must meet once every three years, but it also meets normally during the years of elections for the European Parliament (every five years), and extraordinary Congresses have also been summoned. The Congress elects the EPP Presidency every three years, decides on the main policy documents and electoral programmes, and provides a platform for the EPP's heads of government and party leaders.\n\n==Activities within the party==\n\n===Summit===\nEPP leaders meet for the EPP Summit a few hours before each meeting of the [[European Council]] in order to formulate common positions. Invitations are sent by the EPP President and attendees include, besides the members of the EPP's Presidency, all Presidents and Prime Ministers who are members of the European Council and belong to the EPP; the Presidents of the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Council]], as well as the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative for Foreign Affairs]], provided that they belong to the EPP; Deputy Prime Ministers or other ministers in those cases where the Prime Minister of a country does not belong to an EPP member party; and, where no EPP member party is part of a government, the leaders of the main EPP opposition party.\n\n[[File:EPP Summit March 2011 (65).jpg|thumb|center|600px|Reunion Picture at 2011 Summit]]\n\n===Ministerial meetings===\nFollowing the pattern of the EPP Summit the party also organises regular EPP Ministerial meetings before each meeting of the [[Council of the European Union]], with ministers, deputy ministers, secretaries of state and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] in the specific policy field attending:\n* General Affairs\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Economy and Finance\n* Home Affairs\n* Justice\n* Defence\n* Employment and Social Affairs\n* Industry\n* Agriculture\n* Energy\n* Environment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |title=EPP website |accessdate=23 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908152009/http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |archivedate=8 September 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nThe EPP also organises working groups on different issues and on an ad hoc basis, as well as meetings with its affiliated members in the [[European Commission]]. It also invites individual Commissioners to the EPP Summit meetings and to EPP Ministerial meetings.\n\nFollowing amendments to the EU Regulation that governs [[Europarties]] in 2007, the EPP, like the other \"Europarties\", is responsible for organising a pan-European campaign for the [[European elections]] every five years. According to the [[Lisbon Treaty]], the parties must present candidates for [[President of the European Commission]], but the EPP had already done this by endorsing [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] for a second term in April 2009.\n\nThe year 2014 saw the first fully fledged campaign of the EPP ahead of the [[2014 European Parliament election|European elections of that year]]. The party nominated former Luxembourgish Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] as its candidate for President of the European Commission and led a pan-European campaign in coordination with the national campaigns of all its member parties.\n\n== Activities within European institutions ==\nAs of December 2019, the EPP will hold the Presidency of the European Commission with [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (CDU).\n\n===Overview of the European institutions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The ESU is represented in 26 states with 45 organisations and about 500,000 members.\n\n===European Union of Christian Democratic Workers===\nThe European Union of Christian Democratic Workers (EUCDW) is the labour organisation of the EPP, with 24 member organisations in 18 different countries. As the officially recognised EPP association of workers, the EUCDW is led by [[Elmar Brok]], [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. It aims at the political unification of a democratic Europe, the development of the EPP on the basis of Christian social teaching, and the defence of workers' interests in European policy-making.\n\n===Women of the European People\u2019s Party===\nThe Women of the European People's Party (EPP Women) is recognised by the EPP as the official association of women from all like-minded political parties of Europe. EPP Women has more than 40 member organisations from countries of the European Union and beyond. All of them are women's organisations of political parties that are members of the EPP. EPP Women is led by [[Doris Pack]].\n\n===Youth of the European People\u2019s Party===\n{{main|Youth of the European People's Party}}\nThe Youth of the European People's Party (YEPP), led by L\u00eddia Pereira, is the EPP's official youth organisation. It has 64 member organisations, bringing together between one and two million young people in 40 countries.\n\n== Membership ==\n\nWithin the EPP there are three kinds of member organisations: full members, associate members and observers. Full members are parties from EU states. They have absolute rights to vote in all the EPP's organs and on all matters. Associate members have the same voting rights as full members except for matters concerning the EU's structure or policies. These associate membres are parties from EU candidate countries and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] countries. Observer parties can participate in all the activities of the EPP, and attend the Congresses and Political Assemblies, but they do not have any voting rights.\n\nA special status of \"supporting member\" is granted by the Presidency to individuals and associations. Although they do not have voting rights, they can be invited by the President to attend meetings of certain organs of the party.\n\n=== Full member parties ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

Systems that implement ECM generally provide a secure repository for managed items, be they analog or digital, that indexes them. They also include one or more methods for importing [[content (media)|content]] to bring new items under management and several presentation methods to make items available for use.\n\nWhile it is possible that content in an ECM is protected by [[Digital rights management|DRM]] it is not required.\n\nThe key feature of ECM that distinguishes it from \"simple\" content management is that an ECM is at least cognizant of the processes and procedures of the enterprise it is created for, and as such is particular to it.<ref name=\"AIIM whatis\">{{Cite web\n | url = https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/enterprise-content-management\n | title = What is Enterprise Content Management (ECM)?\n | work = OPENTEXT\n | publisher = OPENTEXT\n | accessdate = September 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n; Late 2005:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n; Early 2006:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n:''ECM tools and strategies allow the management of an organization's [[unstructured information]], wherever that information exists.''\n; Early 2008:\n:''Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is the [[strategy|strategies]], methods, and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.

IIM is defined as ''the strategies, methods, and tools used to create, capture, automate, deliver, secure, and analyze content and documents related to organizational processes. IIM refers to the management of content AND data, not just content itself.''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mancini|first1=John|title=The Next Wave: Moving from ECM to Intelligent Information Management|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/332414/AIIM_Blog/Intel-info-Next-Wave-2017-updated.pdf|website=AIIM|publisher=AIIM}}</ref>\nThe latest definition encompasses areas that have traditionally been addressed by [[records management]] and by [[document management]] systems. It also implies the conversion of data between various digital and traditional forms, including paper and microfilm.\n\nECM as an [[umbrella term]] covers [[document management]], [[Web content management]], search, collaboration, [[records management]], [[digital asset management]] (DAM), [[workflow management system|workflow management]], [[Optical character recognition|capture and scanning]]. ECM is primarily aimed{{by whom|date=August 2017}} at managing the life-cycle of information from initial publication or creation all the way through archival and eventual disposal. ECM applications are delivered{{by whom|date=August 2017}} in four ways:\n* on-premises software (installed on an organization's own network)\n* [[software as a service]] (SaaS) (Web access to information that is stored on a software manufacturer's system) \n* a hybrid composed of both on-premises and SaaS components\n* [[Cloud computing|Infrastructure as a Service]] (IaaS) (which refers to online services that abstract the user from the details of infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.)\n\nECM aims to make the management of corporate information easier through simplifying storage, security, version control, process routing, and retention.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The benefits to an organization include improved efficiency, better control, and reduced costs. For example, many banks have converted to storing copies of old cheques within ECM systems ('''ECMS'''s) as opposed to the older method of keeping physical cheques in massive paper warehouses. Under the old system, a customer request for a copy of a cheque might take weeks, as the bank employees had to contact the warehouse where the right box, file, and cheque, would need to be located. The cheque would then need to be pulled, a copy made and mailed to the bank where it would finally be mailed to the customer. With a suitable ECM system in place, the bank employee might simply query the system for the customer's account number and the number of the requested cheque. When the image of the cheque appears on-screen, the bank can mail a copy immediately to the customer, usually while the customer is still on the phone.\n\n==Scope==\nEnterprise content management, as a form of [[content management]], combines the capture, search and networking of documents with [[digital archiving]], document management and [[workflow]]. It specifically includes the special challenges involved in using and preserving a company's internal, often unstructured information, in all of its forms. Therefore, most ECM solutions focus on [[business-to-employee]] (B2E) systems.\n\nAs ECM solutions have evolved, new components have emerged. For example, as content is checked in and out, each use generates new [[metadata]] about the content, to some extent automatically; information about how and when people use the content can allow the system to gradually acquire new filtering, routing and search pathways, [[corporate taxonomies]] and [[semantic network]]s, and retention-rule decisions. [[Email]] and [[instant messaging]] feature increasingly in decision-making processes; ECM can provide access to data about these communications, which can be used{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in business decisions.\n\nSolutions can provide [[intranet]] services to employees (B2E), and can also include [[enterprise portal]]s for [[business-to-business]] (B2B), [[business-to-government]] (B2G), [[government-to-business]] (G2B), or other business relationships. This category includes most former document-management [[groupware]] and workflow solutions that have not {{as of | 2016 | alt = yet}} fully converted their architecture to ECM, but provide a Web interface. Digital asset management is a form of ECM concerned with content stored using digital technology.\n\n==History==\nThe technologies that comprise ECM {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} descend from the electronic [[document management system]]s (EDMS) of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original EDMS products were stand-alone products, providing functionality in one of four areas: [[Document imaging|imaging]], workflow, document management, or [[Enterprise relationship management|ERM]] (see [[#Components|components]] below).\n\nThe typical early EDMS adopter deployed a small-scale imaging and workflow system, possibly to just a single department, in order to improve a paper-intensive process and to migrate towards the mythical [[paperless office]]. The first stand-alone EDMS technologies aimed to save time or to improve information access by reducing paper handling and paper storage, thereby reducing document loss and providing faster access to information. EDMS could provide online access to information formerly available only on paper, microfilm, or microfiche. By improving control over documents and document-oriented processes, EDMS streamlined time-consuming business practices. The audit trail generated by EDMS enhanced document security and provided metrics to help measure productivity and identify efficiencies.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the EDMS industry continued to grow steadily.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAs more organizations achieved \"pockets\" of productivity with these technologies, it became clear that the various EDMS product categories were complementary. Organizations increasingly wanted to leverage multiple EDMS products. Consider, for example, a customer-service department\u2014where imaging, document management, and workflow could combine to allow agents to better resolve customer inquiries. Likewise, an accounting department might access supplier invoices from an ERM system, purchase orders from an imaging system, and contracts from a document management system as part of an approval workflow. As organizations established an [[Internet]] presence, they wanted to present information via the Web, which required managing Web content. Organizations that had automated individual departments now began to envision wider benefits from broader deployment. Many documents across multiple departments and affect multiple processes.\n\nThe movement toward integrated EDM systems merely reflected a common trend in the software industry: the ongoing integration of point systems into more comprehensive systems. For example, until the early 1990s, word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software products were standalone products. Thereafter, the market shifted toward integration.\n\nEarly leaders already offered multiple stand-alone EDMS technologies. The first phase was to offer multiple systems as a single, packaged \"suite\", with little or no functional integration. Throughout the 1990s, integration increased.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Beginning in approximately 2001, the industry began to use the term ''enterprise content management'' to refer to these integrated systems.\n\nIn 2006, [[Microsoft]] (with its [[SharePoint]] product family) and [[Oracle Corporation]] (with [[Oracle Content Management]]) joined also entered the entry-level \"value\" market segment of ECM.<ref>\nMicrosoft launched its ECM strategy with MOSS 2007; Oracle, with Oracle 10g and the acquisition of Stellent, both in late 2006.</ref><ref>\n''Evolving Electronic Document Management Solutions: The Doculabs Report'', Third Edition. Chicago: Doculabs, 2002.</ref>\n\n[[Open source]] ECM products are also available.\n\nGovernment standards, including [[HIPAA]], [[Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70: Service Organizations|SAS 70]], [[BS 7799]] and [[ISO/IEC 27001]], influence the development and deployment of ECM. Standards compliance may make [[outsourcing]] to certified service providers a viable alternative to an internal ECM deployment.{{original research inline|date=January 2016}}\n\n{{As of | 2016}} organizations can deploy a single, flexible ECM system to manage information in all functional departments, including customer service, accounting, human resources, etc.\n\n==Adoption drivers==\nThere are numerous factors driving businesses to adopt an ECM solution, such as the need to increase efficiency, improving control of information, and reducing the [[Overall|overall cost]] of information management for the enterprise. ECM applications streamline access to records through keyword and full-text search allowing employees to get to the information they need directly from their desktops in seconds rather than searching multiple applications or digging through paper records.\n\nThese management systems can enhance record control to help businesses to comply with government and industry regulations such as HIPAA, [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[PCI DSS]], and the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. Security functions including user-level, function-level, and even record-specific security options protect your most sensitive data. In fact, even information contained on a specific document can be masked using redaction features, so the rest of the document can be shared without compromising individual identity or key data. Every action taken within the system is tracked and reportable for auditing purposes for a wide variety of regulations.\n\nECM systems can reduce storage, paper and mailing needs, make employees more efficient, and result in better, more informed decisions across the enterprise\u2014all of which reduce the overhead costs of managing information. SaaS ECM services can convert expensive capital outlay for servers and network equipment into a monthly operating expense, while also reducing the IT resources required to manage enterprise records.\n\n==Characteristics==\nContent management includes ECM, Web content management (WCM), content syndication, and media asset management. Enterprise content management is not a closed-system solution or a distinct product category. Therefore, along with Document Related Technologies or Document Lifecycle Management, ECM is just one possible catch-all term for a wide range of technologies and vendors.\n\nThe content and structure of today's outward-directed [[Web portal]] will be the platform for tomorrow's internal information system. In his article in ''Computerwoche'',<ref>\nUlrich Kampffmeyer, \"ECM\u2014Herrscher \u00fcber Information\". Computerwoche, CW-exktraKT, Munich, September 24th, 2001.</ref> Ulrich Kampffmeyer distilled ECM to three key ideas that distinguish such solutions from Web content management:\n\n<blockquote>\n; Enterprise content management as integrative middleware\n: ECM is used to overcome the restrictions of former vertical applications and island architectures. The user is basically unaware of using an ECM solution. ECM offers the requisite infrastructure for the new world of Web-based IT, which is establishing itself as a kind of third platform alongside conventional host and client/server systems. Therefore, EAI ([[enterprise application integration]]) and SOA ([[service-oriented architecture]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n; Enterprise content management components as independent services\n: ECM is used to manage information without regard to the source or the required use. The functionality is provided as a service that can be used from all kinds of applications. The advantage of a service concept is that for any given functionality only one general service is available, thus avoiding redundant, expensive and difficult to maintain parallel functions. Therefore, standards for interfaces connecting different services will play an important role in the implementation of ECM.''\n; Enterprise content management as a uniform repository for all types of information\n: ECM is used as a content warehouse (both [[data warehouse]] and document warehouse) that combines company information in a repository with a uniform structure. Expensive redundancies and associated problems with [[information consistency]] are eliminated. All applications deliver their content to a single repository, which in turn provides needed information to all applications. Therefore, content integration and ILM ([[Information Lifecycle Management]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n\nEnterprise content management is working properly when it is effectively \"invisible\" to users. ECM technologies are infrastructures that support specialized applications as subordinate services.\n\nECM thus is a collection of infrastructure components that fit into a multi-layer model and include all document related technologies (DRT) for handling, delivering, and managing structured data and unstructured information jointly. As such, enterprise content management is one of the necessary basic components of the overarching e-business application area. ECM also sets out to manage all the information of a WCM and covers archiving needs as a universal repository.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Components==\nECM combines components that can also be used as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide system.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\">\n''Trends in Records, Document and Enterprise Content Management''.

Capture is also used to collect electronic files and information into a consistent structure for management. Capture technologies also encompass the creation of metadata (index values) that describe characteristics of a document for easy location through search technology. For example, a medical chart might include the patient ID, patient name, date of visit, and procedure as index values to make it easy for medical personnel to locate the chart.\n\nEarlier [[document automation]] systems photographed documents for storage on [[microfilm]] or [[microfiche]]. [[Optical scanner]]s now make digital copies of paper documents. Documents already in digital form can be copied or linked to, if they are already available online.\n\nAutomatic or semi-automatic capture can use [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] or [[XML]] documents, business and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] applications or existing specialist application systems as sources.\n\n====Recognition technologies====\nVarious recognition technologies can be used to extract information from [[Image scanning|scanned]] documents and digital [[fax]]es, including:\n\n;[[Optical character recognition]] (OCR)\n:Converts images of typeset text into alphanumeric characters\n;[[Handwriting recognition|handprint character recognition]] (HCR)\n:Converts images of handwritten text into alphanumerics. Gives better results for short text in fixed locations than for freeform text.\n;[[Intelligent character recognition]] (ICR)\n:Extends OCR and HCR to use a comparison, logical connections, and checks against reference lists and existing master data to improve recognition. For example, on a form where a column of numbers is added up, the accuracy of the recognition can be checked by adding the recognized numbers and comparing them to the sum written on the original form.\n;[[Optical mark recognition]] (OMR)\n:Reads special markings, such as checkmarks or dots, in predefined fields.\n;[[Barcode]] recognition\n:Decodes industry-standard encodings of product and other commercial data.\n\n====Image cleanup====\nImage cleanup features include rotation, straightening, color adjustment, transposition, zoom, aligning, page separation, annotations and despeckling.\n\n====Forms processing====\nIn forms capture, there are two groups of technologies, although the information content and character of the documents may be identical. ''Forms processing'' is the capture of printed forms via scanning; recognition technologies are often used here since well-designed forms enable largely automatic processing. ''Automatic processing'' can be used to capture electronic forms, such as those submitted via Web pages, as long as the layout, structure, logic, and contents are known to the capture system.\n\n====COLD====\n[[Computer Output to Laser Disc]] (COLD) records reports and other documents on optical disks, or any form of digital storage for ongoing management by ECM systems. Another term for this is [[enterprise report management]] (ERM). Originally, the technology only worked with [[laserdisc]]s; the name was not changed after other technologies supplanted the laserdisc.\n\n====Aggregation====\n[[Data aggregation|Aggregation]] combines documents from different applications. The goal is to unify data from different sources, forwarding them to storage and processing systems in a uniform structure and format.\n\n====Indexing components====\n[[Subject indexing|Indexing]] improves searches, and provides alternative ways to organize the information.\n\nManual indexing assigns index database attributes to content by hand, typically used by the database of a \"manage\" component for administration and access. Manual indexing may make use of ''input designs'' to limit the information that can be entered; for example, entry masks may use program logic to restrict inputs based on other information known about the document.\n\nBoth automatic and manual attribute indexing can be made easier and better with preset input-design profiles; these can describe document classes that limit the number of possible index values, or automatically assign certain criteria.\n\nAutomatic classification programs can extract index, category, and transfer data autonomously. Automatic classification or categorizing, based on the information contained in electronic information objects, can evaluate information based on predefined criteria or in a self-learning process. This technique can be used with OCR-converted faxes, office files, or output files.\n\n===Manage===\nThe '''Manage''' category includes five traditional application areas:\n* Document management (DM)\n* [[Collaboration]] (or collaborative software, a.k.a. groupware)\n* Web content management (including Web portals)\n* Records management\n* Workflow and [[business process management]] (BPM)\n\nThe Manage category connects the other components, which can be used in combination or separately. Document management, Web content management, collaboration, workflow and business process management address the dynamic part of the information's lifecycle. Records management focuses on managing finalized documents in accordance with the organization's [[retention period|document retention]] policy, which in turn must comply with government mandates and industry practices.\n\nAll Manage components incorporate [[database]]s and access authorization systems.\nManage components are offered individually or integrated as suites. In many cases they already include the \"store\" components.\n\n====Document management====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Document Management.jpg|ECM: Document Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n{{Main|Document management system}}\nDocument management, in this context, refers to document management systems in the narrow sense of controlling documents from creation to archiving. Document management includes functions like:\n\n;Check in/check out\n:For checking stored information for consistency\n;Version management\n:To keep track of different versions of the same information with revisions and renditions (same information in a different format)\n;Search and navigation\n:For finding information and its associated contexts\n;Organizing documents\n:In structures like files, folders, and overviews\n\nHowever, document management increasingly overlaps with other \"Manage\" components, office applications like Microsoft Outlook and Exchange, or [[Lotus Notes]] and Domino, as well as \"library services\" for administering information storage.\n\n====Collaboration {{Anchor|Collaboration (collaborative systems, groupware)}}====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Collaboration.jpg|ECM: Collaboration. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nCollaboration components in an ECM system help users work with each other to develop and process content. Many of these components were developed from [[collaborative software]], or ''groupware'', packages; ECM collaborative systems go much further, and include elements of [[knowledge management]].\n\nECM systems facilitate collaboration by using information databases and processing methods that are designed to be used simultaneously by multiple users, even when those users are working on the same content item. They make use of knowledge based on skills, resources and background data for joint information processing. Administration components, such as virtual whiteboards for brainstorming, appointment scheduling, and project management systems, communications application such as video conferencing, etc., may be included.\n\nCollaborative ECM may also integrate information from other applications, permitting joint information processing.\n\n====Web content management====\n<!--\n[[:de:bild:ECM Web Content Management.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Web Content Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nThe scope of Enterprise content management integrates [[Web content management system]]s. WCM as ECM component is used to present information already existing and managed in the ECM repository.<ref>Ulrich Kampffmeyer, Enterprise Content Management, 2006, [http://www.project-consult.de/files/ECM_Enterprise_Content_Management_eBook_Ulrich_Kampffmeyer_2006.pdf PDF]</ref> However, information presented via Web technologies\u2014on the Internet, an [[extranet]], or on a portal\u2014uses the workflow, access control, versioning, delivery and authorization modules of the WCM instead of integrated ECM functionality. There are only few examples of successful implementations whereby a shared repository for documents and Web content are managed together.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n====Records management (file and archive management)====\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Records Management.jpg|ECM: Records Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nUnlike traditional electronic archival systems, records management refers to the pure administration of records, important information, and data that companies are required to archive. Records management is independent of storage media; managed information does not necessarily need to be stored electronically, but can be on traditional physical media as well. Some of the functions of records management are:\n* Visualization of file plans and other structured indexes for the orderly storage of information\n* Unambiguous indexing of information, supported by thesauri or controlled wordlists\n* Management of record retention schedules and deletion schedules\n* Protection of information in accordance with its characteristics, sometimes down to individual content components in documents\n* Use of international, industry-specific or company-wide standardized metadata for the unambiguous identification and description of stored information\n\n====Workflow/business process management====\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Workflow.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Workflow / Business Process Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nWorkflow and business process management differ substantially.\n\n=====Workflow=====\nThere are different types of workflow: ''production workflow'' uses predefined sequences to guide and control processes, whereas in an ''ad-hoc workflow'', the user determines the process sequence on the fly.\n\nWorkflow can be implemented as ''workflow solutions'' with which users interact, or as ''workflow engines'', which act as a background service controlling the information and data flow.\n\nWorkflow management includes the following functions:\n* Visualization of process and organization structures\n* Capture, administration, visualization, and delivery of grouped information with its associated documents or data\n* Incorporation of data processing tools (such as specific applications) and documents (such as office products)\n* Parallel and sequential processing of procedures including simultaneous saving\n* Reminders, deadlines, delegation and other administration functionalities\n* Monitoring and documentation of process status, routing, and outcomes\n* Tools for designing and displaying process\n\nThe objective is to automate processes as much as possible by incorporating all necessary resources.\n\n=====Business process management=====\nDefinition cited from AIIM:\n''BPM is a way of looking at and then controlling the processes that are present in an organization. It is an effective methodology to use in times of crisis to make certain that the processes are efficient and effective, as this will result in a better and more cost efficient organization.\n''\n''Business process management'' (BPM) goes a step further than workflow. Although the words are often used interchangeably, BPM aims to completely integrate all of the affected applications within an enterprise, monitoring processes and assembling all required information. Among BPM's functions are:\n\nBPM offers complete workflow functionality, providing process and data monitoring at the server level. Enterprise application integration is used to link different applications. [[Business intelligence]], with rule structures, integrates information warehouses and provides utilities that assist users in their work.\n\n===Store===\nStore components temporarily store information that isn't required, desired, or ready for long-term storage or preservation. Even if the Store component uses media that are suitable for long-term archiving, \"Store\" is still separate from \"Preserve.\"\n\nThe Store components can be divided into three categories: '''Repositories''' as storage locations, '''Library Services''' as administration components for repositories, and storage '''Technologies'''. These infrastructure components are sometimes held at the operating system level (like the [[file system]]), and also include security technologies that work in tandem with the \"Deliver\" components. However, security technologies, including access control, are superordinated components of an ECM solution.\n\n====Repositories====\nDifferent kinds of ECM [[wikt:repository|repositories]] can be used in combination. Among the possible kinds are:\n\n; [[File system]]s\n: File systems are used primarily for temporary storage, as input and output caches. ECM's goal is to reduce the data burden on the file system, and make the information generally available through Manage, Store, and Preserve technologies.\n; [[Content management system]]s\n:This is the actual storage and repository system for content, which can be a database or a specialized storage system.\n; [[Database]]s\n: Databases administer access information, but can also be used for the direct storage of documents, content, or media assets.\n; [[Data warehouse]]s\n: These are complex storage systems based on databases, which reference or provide information from all kinds of sources. They can also be designed with global functions, such as document or information warehouses.\n\n====Library services====\n''Library services'' are the administrative components of the ECM system that handle access to information. The library service is responsible for taking in and storing information from the Capture and Manage components. It also manages the storage locations in dynamic storage, the actual \"Store,\" and in the long-term Preserve archive. The storage location is determined only by the characteristics and classification of the information. The library service works in concert with the Manage components' database to provide the necessary functions of search and [[Information Retrieval|retrieval]].\n\nWhile the database does not \"know\" the physical location of a stored object, the library service manages [[computer data storage|online storage]] (direct access to data and documents),\n[[nearline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that can be accessed quickly, but not immediately, such as data on an optical disc that is present in a storage system's racks but not currently inserted in a drive that can read it), and [[offline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that is not quickly available, such as data stored offsite).\n\nIf the document management system does not provide the functionality, the library service must have ''version management'' to control the status of information, and ''check-in/check-out'', for controlled information provision.\n\nThe library service generates logs of information usage and editing, called an \"audit trail.\"\n\n====Storage technologies====\nA wide variety of technologies can be used to store information, depending on the application and system environment:\n\n; Magnetic online media\n: [[Hard drives]], typically configured as [[RAID]] systems, may be locally attached, part of a [[storage area network]] (SAN), or mounted from another server ([[network-attached storage]]).\n; Magnetic tape\n: [[Magnetic tape data storage]], in the form of automated storage units called [[tape library|tape libraries]], use robotics to provide nearline storage. Standalone tape drives may be used for backup, but not online access.\n; Digital optical media\n: Besides the common [[Compact Disc]] and [[DVD]] optical media in write-once or rewritable forms, Storage systems may use other specialized optical formats like [[magneto-optical drive]]s for storage and distribution of data. [[Optical jukebox]]es can be used for nearline storage. Optical media in jukeboxes can be removed, transitioning it from nearline to offline storage.\n; Cloud computing\n: Data can be stored on offsite [[cloud computing]] servers, accessed via the Internet.\n\n===Preserve===\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Preserve.jpg|ECM: Preserve. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n'''Preserve''' involves the long-term, safe storage and backup of static, unchanging information. Preservation is typically accomplished by the records management features of an ECM system and many are designed to help companies comply with government and industry regulations.\n\nEventually, content ceases to change and becomes static. The [[Digital preservation|preserve]] components of ECM handle the long-term, safe storage and backup of static information, as well as the temporary storage of information that does not need to be archived. [[Archive#Electronic archiving|Electronic archiving]], a related concept, has substantially broader functionality than ECM Preserve components. Electronic archiving systems generally consist of a combination of administration software like records management, imaging or document management, library services or information retrieval systems, and storage subsystems.\n\nOther forms of media are also suitable for long-term archiving. If the desire is merely to ensure information is available in the future, microfilm is still viable; unlike many digital records, microfilm is readable without access to the specialized software that created it. Hybrid systems combine microfilm with electronic media and database-supported access.\n\nLong-term storage systems require the timely planning and regular performance of data migrations, in order to keep information available in the changing technical landscape. As storage technologies fall into disuse, information must be moved to newer forms of storage, so that the stored information remains accessible using contemporary systems. For example, data stored on [[floppy disk]]s becomes essentially unusable, if floppy disk drives are no longer readily available; migrating the data stored on floppy disks to Compact Discs preserves not only the data but the ability to access it. This ongoing process is called ''continuous migration''.\n\nThe Preserve components contain special viewers, conversion and migration tools, and long-term storage media:\n\n====Long term storage media====\n; WORM [[optical disc]]\n: [[Write once read many]] (WORM) rotating digital optical storage media, including the {{convert|5.25|in|cm}} or {{convert|3.5|in|cm}} WORM disc in a protective sleeve, as well as [[CD-R]] and [[DVD-R]]. Recording methods vary for these media, which are held in jukeboxes for online and automated near line access.\n; WORM tape\n: [[Magnetic tape]]s used in special drives, that can be as secure as optical write-once, read-many media if used properly with specially secured tapes.\n; WORM hard disk drive\n: Magnetic disk storage with special software protection against overwriting, erasure, and editing; delivers security similar to optical write-once, read-many media. This category includes [[content-addressable storage]].\n; Storage networks\n: Storage networks, such as network-attached storage and storage area networks, can be used if they meet the requirements of edit-proof auditing with unchangeable storage and protection against manipulation and erasure.\n; Microform\n: [[Microform]]s like microfilm, microfiche, and [[aperture card]]s can be used to back up information that is no longer in use and does not require machine processing. It is typically used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n; Paper\n: Paper still has use as a long-term storage medium, since it does not require migration, and can be read without any technical aids. In ECM systems, however, it is used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n\n====Long term preservation strategies====\nTo secure the long term availability of information different [[digital preservation#Strategies|strategies]] are used for electronic archives.\n\nThe continuous '''migration''' of applications, index data, metadata and objects from older systems to new ones generates a lot of work but secures the accessibility and usability of information. During this process, information that is no longer relevant can be deleted. Conversion technologies are used to update the format of the stored information, where needed.\n\n'''Emulation''' of older software allows users to run and access the original data and objects. Special viewer software can identify the format of the preserved objects and can display the objects in the new software environment.\n\nStandards for interfaces, metadata, data structures and object formats are important to secure the availability of information.\n\n===Deliver===\nThe '''deliver''' components of ECM present information from the Manage, Store, and Preserve components. The AIIM component model for ECM is function-based, and doesn't impose a strict hierarchy; the Deliver components may contain functions used to enter information into other systems (such as transferring information to portable media, or generating formatted output files); or for readying information, such as by converting its format or compressing it, for the \"Store\" and \"Preserve\" components. The Deliver category's functionality is also known as \"output\"; technologies in this category are often termed ''[[Enterprise Output Management|output management]]''.\n\nThe Deliver components break down into three groups: '''transformation technologies''', '''security technologies''', and '''distribution'''. Transformation and security, as services, are [[middleware]] and should be equally available to all ECM components. For output, two functions are of primary importance: ''layout and design'', with tools for laying out and formatting output, and ''[[electronic publishing|publishing]]'', with applications for presenting information for distribution and publication.\n\nIn short, ECM delivery provides information to users. Secure distribution, collaboration, and version control take the forefront. In some cases, these components are still deployed as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide ECM system.\n\n====Transformation technologies====\nTransformations should always be controlled and trackable. This is done by background services that the end user generally does not see. Among the transformation technologies are:\n\n; Computer output to laser disc (COLD)\n: Unlike its use in the Capture stage, when used for delivery COLD prepares output data for distribution and transfer to the archive. Typical applications are lists and formatted output (for example, individualized customer letters). These technologies also include journals and logs generated by the ECM components. Unlike most imaging media, COLD records are indexed not in a database table, but by absolute positions within the document itself (i.e. page 1, line 82, position 12). As a result, COLD index fields are not available for editing after submission unless they are converted into a standard database.\n; [[Personalization]]\n: Functions and output can be customized to a particular user's needs.\n; XML (Extensible Markup Language)\n: A computer language that allows the description of interfaces, structures, metadata, and documents in a standardized, cross-platform manner.\n; [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (Portable Document Format)\n: A cross-platform print and distribution format. Unlike image formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], PDFs permit content searches, the addition of metadata, and the embedding of electronic signatures. When generated from electronic data, PDFs are [[resolution independence|resolution-independent]], allowing crisp reproduction at any scale.\n; XPS ([[XML Paper Specification]])\n:An XML specification developed by Microsoft, describing the formats and rules for distributing, archiving, rendering, and processing XPS documents.\n; Converters and viewers\n: Serve to reformat information to generate uniform formats, and also to display and output information from different formats.\n; [[Data compression|Compression]]\n: Used to reduce the storage space needed for pictorial information.\n; [[Web syndication|Syndication]]\n: Used for presenting content in different formats, selections, and forms in the context of content management. Syndication allows the same content to be used multiple times in different forms for different purposes.\n\n====Security technologies====\nSecurity technologies are available to all ECM components. For example, [[electronic signature]]s are used not only when documents are sent, but also in data capture via scanning, in order to document the completeness of the capture. [[Public key infrastructure]] is a basic technology for electronic signatures. It manages keys and certificates and checks the authenticity of signatures. Other electronic signatures confirm the identity of the sender and the integrity of the sent data, i.e., that it is complete and unchanged.\n\nIn Europe, there are three forms of electronic signatures, of different quality and security: simple, advanced, and qualified. In most European states the qualified electronic signature is legally admissible in legal documents and contracts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Digital rights management]] and [[watermark]]ing are used in content syndication and media asset management, to manage and secure intellectual property rights and copyrights. Digital rights management works with techniques like electronic watermarks that are integrated directly into the file and seeks to protect usage rights and protect content that is published on the Internet.\n\n====Distribution====\nAll of the above technologies serve to provide an ECM's contents to users by various routes, in a controlled and user-oriented manner. These can be active components such as e-mail, data media, memos, and passive publication on websites and portals where users can get the information themselves. Possible output and distribution media include:\n\n{{Div col}}\n* The Internet\n** Extranets\n** Intranets\n** [[electronic business|E-business]] portals\n** Employee portals\n* [[E-mail]]\n* Fax\n* Data transfer by EDI, XML or other formats\n* Mobile devices, like mobile phones, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and others\n* Data media like CDs and DVDs\n* [[digital television|Digital TV]] and other [[multimedia]] services\n* [[Paper]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe various Deliver components provide information to users in the best way for the given application, while controlling its use as far as possible.\n\n==Methods==\n===On-premises===\nECM was developed as a traditional software application that companies implemented on their own corporate networks. In this scenario, each individual company manages and maintains both the ECM application, and the network storage devices that store the data. Many on-premises ECM systems are highly customized for individual organizational needs.\nSince paper document capture requires the use of physical scanning devices, like [[Image scanner|scanner]]s or multi-function devices, it is typically performed on-premises. However, it can be outsourced to businesses that provide scanning services. Known as Service Bureaus, these companies complete high-volume scanning and indexing and return the electronic files to organizations via Web transfer or on CDs, DVDs, or other external storage devices.\n\n===Software as a service (SaaS)===\n[[SaaS]] ECM means that rather than deploying software on an in-house network, users access the application and their data online. It is also known as [[cloud computing]], hosted, and on-demand. As SaaS distribution technologies mature, businesses can receive the same features and customization capabilities as from on-premises ECM applications.\nSaaS delivery allows companies to more quickly begin using ECM since they do not have to purchase hardware or configure the applications, databases, or servers. In addition, organizations trade the capital costs associated with a hardware and software purchase for a monthly operating expense and storage capabilities that grow automatically to accommodate company growth.\n\n===Hybrid===\nIn some scenarios, companies find a hybrid composed of both SaaS and on-premises software work best for their situation. For example, hybrid ECM systems are being used to bridge the gap during company moves or to simplify information exchange following an acquisition. Hybrid is also being used when companies want to manage their own ECM on-premises, but also provide easy Web access to certain information for business partners or customers using a SaaS model. Hybrid makes the most sense when the two technologies are provided by the same manufacturer so that features and interfaces are an exact match.\n\n==ECM market development==\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|{{cite check|date=September 2010}}\n{{update|inaccurate=yes|date=September 2010}}\n}}\nPrior to 2003, the ECM market was dominated by a number of medium-sized independent vendors that fell into two categories: those who had originated as Document Management companies (''[[Laserfiche]]'', [[Saros Corporation|Saros]], [[Documentum]], [[docStar]], [[OpenText]], Db technology) and had begun adding on management of other enterprise content, and those who had started as Web Content Management providers ([[Interwoven]], [[Vignette Corporation|Vignette]], [[Stellent]]) and had begun trying to branch out into managing other types of content such as business documents and rich media. Larger vendors, such as IBM and Oracle, also had offerings in this space, and the market share remained largely fragmented.\n\nIn 2002, Documentum had added collaboration capabilities with its acquisition of [[eRoom]] while Interwoven and Vignette countered with their respective acquisitions of iManage and Intraspect. Similarly, Documentum purchased Bulldog for its Digital Asset Management (DAM) capabilities while Interwoven and OpenText countered with acquisitions of MediaBin and [[Artesia Digital Media Group|Artesia]]. OpenText also acquired European companies IXOS and Red Dot to shore up its software portfolio. In October 2003, EMC Corporation acquired Documentum. Soon EMC's primary competitors in the database space responded as [[IBM]] purchased FileNet and Oracle purchased Stellent in 2006. OpenText also purchased [[Hummingbird Ltd.]] in 2006. [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) entered the ECM space with its acquisition of Australian company Tower Software in 2008. In March 2009, [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]] purchased Interwoven, in July 2009 OpenText acquired Vignette, and in February 2011 OpenText acquired MetaStorm.

Gartner also predicted that there will be further market consolidation, acquisition, and separation of vendors into platform and solution providers.<ref>Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Content Management, 2008\"</ref>{{Update after|2010|09}} The same Gartner report classifies enterprise content management systems into four main categories: First, \"Transactional content management solutions\". These systems focus on imaging, capture, business process management and workflow, records management and compliance, search and e-forms. Examples: Hyland's [[OnBase]], Lexmark's Perceptive Software, docStar's Eclipse, WareITis Technologies' Records Studio. Another category is \"Social Content Management\". As its name suggests, these systems focus on social Web content like wikis, blogs, videos, browser or portal viewing, etc. Example: Alfresco.\n\nThe \"Online Channel Optimization\" systems are mainly Web content management and digital asset management systems. Examples: Autonomy, WordPress. The fourth category is \"Content Management as infrastructure\". These are vendor solutions that are used as enterprise content management platforms with all the core functionalities of the other types of content management systems, but the focus is on building solutions on top of the platform.

They also include one or more methods for importing [[content (media)|content]] to bring new items under management and several presentation methods to make items available for use.\n\nWhile it is possible that content in an ECM is protected by [[Digital rights management|DRM]] it is not required.\n\nThe key feature of ECM that distinguishes it from \"simple\" content management is that an ECM is at least cognizant of the processes and procedures of the enterprise it is created for, and as such is particular to it.<ref name=\"AIIM whatis\">{{Cite web\n  | url = https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/enterprise-content-management\n  | title = What is Enterprise Content Management (ECM)?\n  | work = OPENTEXT\n  | publisher = OPENTEXT\n  | accessdate = September 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n; Late 2005:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n; Early 2006:\n:''Enterprise content management is the technology used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.''\n:''ECM tools and strategies allow the management of an organization's [[unstructured information]], wherever that information exists.''\n; Early 2008:\n:''Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is the [[strategy | strategies]], methods, and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes.

IIM is defined as ''the strategies, methods, and tools used to create, capture, automate, deliver, secure, and analyze content and documents related to organizational processes. IIM refers to the management of content AND data, not just content itself.''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mancini|first1=John|title=The Next Wave: Moving from ECM to Intelligent Information Management|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/332414/AIIM_Blog/Intel-info-Next-Wave-2017-updated.pdf|website=AIIM|publisher=AIIM}}</ref>\nThe latest definition encompasses areas that have traditionally been addressed by [[records management]] and by [[document management]] systems. It also implies the conversion of data between various digital and traditional forms, including paper and microfilm.\n\nECM as an [[umbrella term]] covers [[document management]], [[Web content management]], search, collaboration, [[records management]], [[digital asset management]] (DAM), [[workflow management system| workflow management]], [[Optical character recognition|capture and scanning]]. ECM is primarily aimed{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} at managing the life-cycle of information from initial publication or creation all the way through archival and eventual disposal. ECM applications are delivered{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} in four ways: \n\n* on-premises software (installed on an organization's own network)\n* [[software as a service]] (SaaS) (Web access to information that is stored on a software manufacturer's system) \n* a hybrid composed of both on-premises and SaaS components\n* [[Cloud computing|Infrastructure as a Service]] (IaaS) (which refers to online services that abstract the user from the details of infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.)\n\nECM aims to make the management of corporate information easier through simplifying storage, security, version control, process routing, and retention.{{cn|date=August 2017}} The benefits to an organization include improved efficiency, better control, and reduced costs. For example, many banks have converted to storing copies of old cheques within ECM systems ('''ECMS'''s)  as opposed to the older method of keeping physical cheques in massive paper warehouses. Under the old system, a customer request for a copy of a cheque might take weeks, as the bank employees had to contact the warehouse where the right box, file, and cheque, would need to be located. The cheque would then need to be pulled, a copy made and mailed to the bank where it would finally be mailed to the customer. With a suitable ECM system in place, the bank employee might simply query the system for the customer\u2019s account number and the number of the requested cheque. When the image of the cheque appears on-screen, the bank can mail a copy immediately to the customer, usually while the customer is still on the phone.\n\n==Scope==\nEnterprise content management, as a form of [[content management]], combines the capture, search and networking of documents with [[digital archiving]], document management and [[workflow]]. It specifically includes the special challenges involved in using and preserving a company's internal, often unstructured information, in all of its forms. Therefore, most ECM solutions focus on [[business-to-employee]] (B2E) systems.\n\nAs ECM solutions have evolved, new components have emerged. For example, as content is checked in and out, each use generates new [[metadata]] about the content, to some extent automatically; information about how and when people use the content can allow the system to gradually acquire new filtering, routing and search pathways, [[corporate taxonomies]] and [[semantic network]]s, and retention-rule decisions. [[Email]] and [[instant messaging]] feature increasingly in decision-making processes; ECM can provide access to data about these communications, which can be used{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in business decisions.\n\nSolutions can provide [[intranet]] services to employees (B2E), and can also include [[enterprise portal]]s for [[business-to-business]] (B2B), [[business-to-government]] (B2G), [[government-to-business]] (G2B), or other business relationships. This category includes most former document-management [[groupware]] and workflow solutions that have not {{as of | 2016 | alt = yet}} fully converted their architecture to ECM, but provide a Web interface. Digital asset management is a form of ECM concerned with content stored using digital technology.\n\n==History==\nThe technologies that comprise ECM {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} descend from the electronic [[document management system]]s (EDMS) of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original EDMS products were stand-alone products, providing functionality in one of four areas: [[Document imaging|imaging]], workflow, document management, or [[Enterprise relationship management|ERM]] (see [[#Components|components]] below).\n\nThe typical early EDMS adopter deployed a small-scale imaging and workflow system, possibly to just a single department, in order to improve a paper-intensive process and to migrate towards the mythical [[paperless office]]. The first stand-alone EDMS technologies aimed to save time or to improve information access by reducing paper handling and paper storage, thereby reducing document loss and providing faster access to information. EDMS could provide online access to information formerly available only on paper, microfilm, or microfiche. By improving control over documents and document-oriented processes, EDMS streamlined time-consuming business practices. The audit trail generated by EDMS enhanced document security and provided metrics to help measure productivity and identify efficiencies.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the EDMS industry continued to grow steadily.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAs more organizations achieved \"pockets\" of productivity with these technologies, it became clear that the various EDMS product categories were complementary. Organizations increasingly wanted to leverage multiple EDMS products. Consider, for example, a customer-service department\u2014where imaging, document management, and workflow could combine to allow agents to better resolve customer inquiries. Likewise, an accounting department might access supplier invoices from an ERM system, purchase orders from an imaging system, and contracts from a document management system as part of an approval workflow. As organizations established an [[Internet]] presence, they wanted to present information via the Web, which required managing Web content. Organizations that had automated individual departments now began to envision wider benefits from broader deployment. Many documents across multiple departments and affect multiple processes.\n\nThe movement toward integrated EDM systems merely reflected a common trend in the software industry: the ongoing integration of point systems into more comprehensive systems. For example, until the early 1990s, word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software products were standalone products. Thereafter, the market shifted toward integration.\n\nEarly leaders already offered multiple stand-alone EDMS technologies. The first phase was to offer multiple systems as a single, packaged \"suite\", with little or no functional integration. Throughout the 1990s, integration increased.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Beginning in approximately 2001, the industry began to use the term ''enterprise content management'' to refer to these integrated systems.\n\nIn 2006, [[Microsoft]] (with its [[SharePoint]] product family) and [[Oracle Corporation]] (with [[Oracle Content Management]]) joined also entered the entry-level \"value\" market segment of ECM.<ref>\nMicrosoft launched its ECM strategy with MOSS 2007; Oracle, with Oracle 10g and the acquisition of Stellent, both in late 2006.</ref><ref>\n''Evolving Electronic Document Management Solutions: The Doculabs Report'', Third Edition. Chicago: Doculabs, 2002.</ref>\n\n[[Open source]] ECM products are also available.\n\nGovernment standards, including [[HIPAA]], [[Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70: Service Organizations|SAS 70]], [[BS 7799]] and [[ISO/IEC 27001]], influence the development and deployment of ECM. Standards compliance may make [[outsourcing]] to certified service providers a viable alternative to an internal ECM deployment.{{original research inline|date=January 2016}}\n\n{{As of | 2016}} organizations can deploy a single, flexible ECM system to manage information in all functional departments, including customer service, accounting, human resources, etc.\n\n==Adoption drivers==\nThere are numerous factors driving businesses to adopt an ECM solution, such as the need to increase efficiency, improving control of information, and reducing the [[Overall|overall cost]] of information management for the enterprise. ECM applications streamline access to records through keyword and full-text search allowing employees to get to the information they need directly from their desktops in seconds rather than searching multiple applications or digging through paper records.\n\nThese management systems can enhance record control to help businesses to comply with government and industry regulations such as HIPAA, [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[PCI DSS]], and the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. Security functions including user-level, function-level, and even record-specific security options protect your most sensitive data. In fact, even information contained on a specific document can be masked using redaction features, so the rest of the document can be shared without compromising individual identity or key data. Every action taken within the system is tracked and reportable for auditing purposes for a wide variety of regulations.\n\nECM systems can reduce storage, paper and mailing needs, make employees more efficient, and result in better, more informed decisions across the enterprise\u2014all of which reduce the overhead costs of managing information. SaaS ECM services can convert expensive capital outlay for servers and network equipment into a monthly operating expense, while also reducing the IT resources required to manage enterprise records.\n\n==Characteristics==\nContent management includes ECM, Web content management (WCM), content syndication, and media asset management. Enterprise content management is not a closed-system solution or a distinct product category. Therefore, along with Document Related Technologies or Document Lifecycle Management, ECM is just one possible catch-all term for a wide range of technologies and vendors.\n\nThe content and structure of today's outward-directed [[Web portal]] will be the platform for tomorrow's internal information system. In his article in ''Computerwoche'',<ref>\nUlrich Kampffmeyer, \"ECM \u2014 Herrscher \u00fcber Information\". Computerwoche, CW-exktraKT, Munich, September 24th, 2001.</ref> Ulrich Kampffmeyer distilled ECM to three key ideas that distinguish such solutions from Web content management:\n\n<blockquote>\n; Enterprise content management as integrative middleware\n: ECM is used to overcome the restrictions of former vertical applications and island architectures. The user is basically unaware of using an ECM solution. ECM offers the requisite infrastructure for the new world of Web-based IT, which is establishing itself as a kind of third platform alongside conventional host and client/server systems. Therefore, EAI ([[enterprise application integration]]) and SOA ([[service-oriented architecture]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n; Enterprise content management components as independent services\n: ECM is used to manage information without regard to the source or the required use. The functionality is provided as a service that can be used from all kinds of applications. The advantage of a service concept is that for any given functionality only one general service is available, thus avoiding redundant, expensive and difficult to maintain parallel functions. Therefore, standards for interfaces connecting different services will play an important role in the implementation of ECM.''\n; Enterprise content management as a uniform repository for all types of information\n: ECM is used as a content warehouse (both [[data warehouse]] and document warehouse) that combines company information in a repository with a uniform structure. Expensive redundancies and associated problems with [[information consistency]] are eliminated. All applications deliver their content to a single repository, which in turn provides needed information to all applications. Therefore, content integration and ILM ([[Information Lifecycle Management]]) will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.\n\nEnterprise content management is working properly when it is effectively \"invisible\" to users. ECM technologies are infrastructures that support specialized applications as subordinate services.\n\nECM thus is a collection of infrastructure components that fit into a multi-layer model and include all document related technologies (DRT) for handling, delivering, and managing structured data and unstructured information jointly. As such, enterprise content management is one of the necessary basic components of the overarching e-business application area. ECM also sets out to manage all the information of a WCM and covers archiving needs as a universal repository.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Components==\nECM combines components that can also be used as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide system.<ref name=\"SER-ECM-whitepaper\">\n''Trends in Records, Document and Enterprise Content Management''.

Capture is also used to collect electronic files and information into a consistent structure for management. Capture technologies also encompass the creation of metadata (index values) that describe characteristics of a document for easy location through search technology. For example, a medical chart might include the patient ID, patient name, date of visit, and procedure as index values to make it easy for medical personnel to locate the chart.\n\nEarlier [[document automation]] systems photographed documents for storage on [[microfilm]] or [[microfiche]]. [[Optical scanner]]s now make digital copies of paper documents. Documents already in digital form can be copied or linked to, if they are already available online.\n\nAutomatic or semi-automatic capture can use [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] or [[XML]] documents, business and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] applications or existing specialist application systems as sources.\n\n====Recognition technologies====\nVarious recognition technologies can be used to extract information from [[Image scanning|scanned]] documents and digital [[fax]]es, including:\n\n;[[Optical character recognition]] (OCR)\n:Converts images of typeset text into alphanumeric characters\n;[[Handwriting recognition|handprint character recognition]] (HCR)\n:Converts images of handwritten text into alphanumerics. Gives better results for short text in fixed locations than for freeform text.\n;[[Intelligent character recognition]] (ICR)\n:Extends OCR and HCR to use a comparison, logical connections, and checks against reference lists and existing master data to improve recognition. For example, on a form where a column of numbers is added up, the accuracy of the recognition can be checked by adding the recognized numbers and comparing them to the sum written on the original form.\n;[[Optical mark recognition]] (OMR)\n:Reads special markings, such as checkmarks or dots, in predefined fields.\n;[[Barcode]] recognition\n:Decodes industry-standard encodings of product and other commercial data.\n\n====Image cleanup====\nImage cleanup features include rotation, straightening, color adjustment, transposition, zoom, aligning, page separation, annotations and despeckling.\n\n====Forms processing====\nIn forms capture, there are two groups of technologies, although the information content and character of the documents may be identical. ''Forms processing'' is the capture of printed forms via scanning; recognition technologies are often used here since well-designed forms enable largely automatic processing. ''Automatic processing'' can be used to capture electronic forms, such as those submitted via Web pages, as long as the layout, structure, logic, and contents are known to the capture system.\n\n====COLD====\n[[Computer Output to Laser Disc]] (COLD) records reports and other documents on optical disks, or any form of digital storage for ongoing management by ECM systems. Another term for this is [[enterprise report management]] (ERM). Originally, the technology only worked with [[laserdisc]]s; the name was not changed after other technologies supplanted the laserdisc.\n\n====Aggregation====\n[[Data aggregation|Aggregation]] combines documents from different applications. The goal is to unify data from different sources, forwarding them to storage and processing systems in a uniform structure and format.\n\n====Indexing components====\n[[Subject indexing|Indexing]] improves searches, and provides alternative ways to organize the information.\n\nManual indexing assigns index database attributes to content by hand, typically used by the database of a \"manage\" component for administration and access. Manual indexing may make use of ''input designs'' to limit the information that can be entered; for example, entry masks may use program logic to restrict inputs based on other information known about the document.\n\nBoth automatic and manual attribute indexing can be made easier and better with preset input-design profiles; these can describe document classes that limit the number of possible index values, or automatically assign certain criteria.\n\nAutomatic classification programs can extract index, category, and transfer data autonomously. Automatic classification or categorizing, based on the information contained in electronic information objects, can evaluate information based on predefined criteria or in a self-learning process. This technique can be used with OCR-converted faxes, office files, or output files.\n\n===Manage===\nThe '''Manage''' category includes five traditional application areas:\n\n* Document management (DM)\n* [[Collaboration]] (or collaborative software, a.k.a. groupware)\n* Web content management (including Web portals)\n* Records management\n* Workflow and [[business process management]] (BPM)\n\nThe Manage category connects the other components, which can be used in combination or separately. Document management, Web content management, collaboration, workflow and business process management address the dynamic part of the information's lifecycle. Records management focuses on managing finalized documents in accordance with the organization's [[retention period|document retention]] policy, which in turn must comply with government mandates and industry practices.\n\nAll Manage components incorporate [[database]]s and access authorization systems.\nManage components are offered individually or integrated as suites. In many cases they already include the \"store\" components.\n\n====Document management====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Document Management.jpg|ECM: Document Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n{{Main article|Document management system}}\nDocument management, in this context, refers to document management systems in the narrow sense of controlling documents from creation to archiving. Document management includes functions like:\n\n;Check in/check out\n:For checking stored information for consistency\n;Version management\n:To keep track of different versions of the same information with revisions and renditions (same information in a different format)\n;Search and navigation\n:For finding information and its associated contexts\n;Organizing documents\n:In structures like files, folders, and overviews\n\nHowever, document management increasingly overlaps with other \"Manage\" components, office applications like Microsoft Outlook and Exchange, or [[Lotus Notes]] and Domino, as well as \"library services\" for administering information storage.\n\n====Collaboration {{Anchor|Collaboration (collaborative systems, groupware)}}====\n<!--\n[[:de:image:ECM Collaboration.jpg|ECM: Collaboration. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nCollaboration components in an ECM system help users work with each other to develop and process content. Many of these components were developed from [[collaborative software]], or ''groupware'', packages; ECM collaborative systems go much further, and include elements of [[knowledge management]].\n\nECM systems facilitate collaboration by using information databases and processing methods that are designed to be used simultaneously by multiple users, even when those users are working on the same content item. They make use of knowledge based on skills, resources and background data for joint information processing. Administration components, such as virtual whiteboards for brainstorming, appointment scheduling, and project management systems, communications application such as video conferencing, etc., may be included.\n\nCollaborative ECM may also integrate information from other applications, permitting joint information processing.\n\n====Web content management====\n<!--\n[[:de:bild:ECM Web Content Management.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Web Content Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nThe scope of Enterprise content management integrates [[Web content management system]]s. WCM as ECM component is used to present information already existing and managed in the ECM repository.<ref>Ulrich Kampffmeyer, Enterprise Content Management, 2006, [http://www.project-consult.de/files/ECM_Enterprise_Content_Management_eBook_Ulrich_Kampffmeyer_2006.pdf PDF]</ref> However, information presented via Web technologies\u2014on the Internet, an [[extranet]], or on a portal\u2014uses the workflow, access control, versioning, delivery and authorization modules of the WCM instead of integrated ECM functionality. There are only few examples of successful implementations whereby a shared repository for documents and Web content are managed together.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n====Records management (file and archive management)====\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Records Management.jpg|ECM: Records Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nUnlike traditional electronic archival systems, records management refers to the pure administration of records, important information, and data that companies are required to archive. Records management is independent of storage media; managed information does not necessarily need to be stored electronically, but can be on traditional physical media as well. Some of the functions of records management are:\n\n* Visualization of file plans and other structured indexes for the orderly storage of information\n* Unambiguous indexing of information, supported by thesauri or controlled wordlists\n* Management of record retention schedules and deletion schedules\n* Protection of information in accordance with its characteristics, sometimes down to individual content components in documents\n* Use of international, industry-specific or company-wide standardized metadata for the unambiguous identification and description of stored information\n\n====Workflow/business process management====\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Workflow.jpg|ECM-Komponenten: Workflow / Business Process Management. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\nWorkflow and business process management differ substantially.\n\n=====Workflow=====\nThere are different types of workflow: ''production workflow'' uses predefined sequences to guide and control processes, whereas in an ''ad-hoc workflow'', the user determines the process sequence on the fly.\n\nWorkflow can be implemented as ''workflow solutions'' with which users interact, or as ''workflow engines'', which act as a background service controlling the information and data flow.\n\nWorkflow management includes the following functions:\n\n* Visualization of process and organization structures\n* Capture, administration, visualization, and delivery of grouped information with its associated documents or data\n* Incorporation of data processing tools (such as specific applications) and documents (such as office products)\n* Parallel and sequential processing of procedures including simultaneous saving\n* Reminders, deadlines, delegation and other administration functionalities\n* Monitoring and documentation of process status, routing, and outcomes\n* Tools for designing and displaying process\n\nThe objective is to automate processes as much as possible by incorporating all necessary resources.\n\n=====Business process management=====\nDefinition cited from AIIM:\n''BPM is a way of looking at and then controlling the processes that are present in an organization. It is an effective methodology to use in times of crisis to make certain that the processes are efficient and effective, as this will result in a better and more cost efficient organization.\n''\n''Business process management'' (BPM) goes a step further than workflow. Although the words are often used interchangeably, BPM aims to completely integrate all of the affected applications within an enterprise, monitoring processes and assembling all required information. Among BPM's functions are:\n\nBPM offers complete workflow functionality, providing process and data monitoring at the server level. Enterprise application integration is used to link different applications. [[Business intelligence]], with rule structures, integrates information warehouses and provides utilities that assist users in their work.\n\n===Store===\nStore components temporarily store information that isn't required, desired, or ready for long-term storage or preservation. Even if the Store component uses media that are suitable for long-term archiving, \"Store\" is still separate from \"Preserve.\"\n\nThe Store components can be divided into three categories: '''Repositories''' as storage locations, '''Library Services''' as administration components for repositories, and storage '''Technologies'''. These infrastructure components are sometimes held at the operating system level (like the [[file system]]), and also include security technologies that work in tandem with the \"Deliver\" components. However, security technologies, including access control, are superordinated components of an ECM solution.\n\n====Repositories====\nDifferent kinds of ECM [[wikt:repository|repositories]] can be used in combination. Among the possible kinds are:\n\n; [[File system]]s\n: File systems are used primarily for temporary storage, as input and output caches. ECM's goal is to reduce the data burden on the file system, and make the information generally available through Manage, Store, and Preserve technologies.\n; [[Content management system]]s\n:This is the actual storage and repository system for content, which can be a database or a specialized storage system.\n; [[Database]]s\n: Databases administer access information, but can also be used for the direct storage of documents, content, or media assets.\n; [[Data warehouse]]s\n: These are complex storage systems based on databases, which reference or provide information from all kinds of sources. They can also be designed with global functions, such as document or information warehouses.\n\n====Library services====\n''Library services'' are the administrative components of the ECM system that handle access to information. The library service is responsible for taking in and storing information from the Capture and Manage components. It also manages the storage locations in dynamic storage, the actual \"Store,\" and in the long-term Preserve archive. The storage location is determined only by the characteristics and classification of the information. The library service works in concert with the Manage components' database to provide the necessary functions of search and [[Information Retrieval|retrieval]].\n\nWhile the database does not \"know\" the physical location of a stored object, the library service manages [[computer data storage|online storage]] (direct access to data and documents),\n[[nearline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that can be accessed quickly, but not immediately, such as data on an optical disc that is present in a storage system's racks but not currently inserted in a drive that can read it), and [[offline storage]] (data and documents on a medium that is not quickly available, such as data stored offsite).\n\nIf the document management system does not provide the functionality, the library service must have ''version management'' to control the status of information, and ''check-in/check-out'', for controlled information provision.\n\nThe library service generates logs of information usage and editing, called an \"audit trail.\"\n\n====Storage technologies====\nA wide variety of technologies can be used to store information, depending on the application and system environment:\n\n; Magnetic online media\n: [[Hard drives]], typically configured as [[RAID]] systems, may be locally attached, part of a [[storage area network]] (SAN), or mounted from another server ([[network-attached storage]]).\n; Magnetic tape\n: [[Magnetic tape data storage]], in the form of automated storage units called [[tape library|tape libraries]], use robotics to provide nearline storage. Standalone tape drives may be used for backup, but not online access.\n; Digital optical media\n: Besides the common [[Compact Disc]] and [[DVD]] optical media in write-once or rewritable forms, Storage systems may use other specialized optical formats like [[magneto-optical drive]]s for storage and distribution of data. [[Optical jukebox]]es can be used for nearline storage. Optical media in jukeboxes can be removed, transitioning it from nearline to offline storage.\n; Cloud computing\n: Data can be stored on offsite [[cloud computing]] servers, accessed via the Internet.\n\n===Preserve===\n<!--\n[[:de:Bild:ECM Preserve.jpg|ECM: Preserve. Source: AIIM / PROJECT CONSULT 2003]]\n-->\n'''Preserve''' involves the long-term, safe storage and backup of static, unchanging information. Preservation is typically accomplished by the records management features of an ECM system and many are designed to help companies comply with government and industry regulations.\n\nEventually, content ceases to change and becomes static. The [[Digital preservation|preserve]] components of ECM handle the long-term, safe storage and backup of static information, as well as the temporary storage of information that does not need to be archived. [[Archive#Electronic archiving|Electronic archiving]], a related concept, has substantially broader functionality than ECM Preserve components. Electronic archiving systems generally consist of a combination of administration software like records management, imaging or document management, library services or information retrieval systems, and storage subsystems.\n\nOther forms of media are also suitable for long-term archiving. If the desire is merely to ensure information is available in the future, microfilm is still viable; unlike many digital records, microfilm is readable without access to the specialized software that created it. Hybrid systems combine microfilm with electronic media and database-supported access.\n\nLong-term storage systems require the timely planning and regular performance of data migrations, in order to keep information available in the changing technical landscape. As storage technologies fall into disuse, information must be moved to newer forms of storage, so that the stored information remains accessible using contemporary systems. For example, data stored on [[floppy disk]]s becomes essentially unusable, if floppy disk drives are no longer readily available; migrating the data stored on floppy disks to Compact Discs preserves not only the data but the ability to access it. This ongoing process is called ''continuous migration''.\n\nThe Preserve components contain special viewers, conversion and migration tools, and long-term storage media:\n\n====Long term storage media====\n; WORM [[optical disc]]\n: [[Write once read many]] (WORM) rotating digital optical storage media, including the {{convert|5.25|in|cm}} or {{convert|3.5|in|cm}} WORM disc in a protective sleeve, as well as [[CD-R]] and [[DVD-R]]. Recording methods vary for these media, which are held in jukeboxes for online and automated near line access.\n; WORM tape\n: [[Magnetic tape]]s used in special drives, that can be as secure as optical write-once, read-many media if used properly with specially secured tapes.\n; WORM hard disk drive\n: Magnetic disk storage with special software protection against overwriting, erasure, and editing; delivers security similar to optical write-once, read-many media. This category includes [[content-addressable storage]].\n; Storage networks\n: Storage networks, such as network-attached storage and storage area networks, can be used if they meet the requirements of edit-proof auditing with unchangeable storage and protection against manipulation and erasure.\n; Microform\n: [[Microform]]s like microfilm, microfiche, and [[aperture card]]s can be used to back up information that is no longer in use and does not require machine processing. It is typically used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n; Paper\n: Paper still has use as a long-term storage medium, since it does not require migration, and can be read without any technical aids. In ECM systems, however, it is used only to double-secure originally electronic information.\n\n====Long term preservation strategies====\nTo secure the long term availability of information different [[digital preservation#Strategies|strategies]] are used for electronic archives.\n\nThe continuous '''migration''' of applications, index data, metadata and objects from older systems to new ones generates a lot of work but secures the accessibility and usability of information. During this process, information that is no longer relevant can be deleted. Conversion technologies are used to update the format of the stored information, where needed.\n\n'''Emulation''' of older software allows users to run and access the original data and objects. Special viewer software can identify the format of the preserved objects and can display the objects in the new software environment.\n\nStandards for interfaces, metadata, data structures and object formats are important to secure the availability of information.\n\n===Deliver===\nThe '''deliver''' components of ECM present information from the Manage, Store, and Preserve components. The AIIM component model for ECM is function-based, and doesn't impose a strict hierarchy; the Deliver components may contain functions used to enter information into other systems (such as transferring information to portable media, or generating formatted output files); or for readying information, such as by converting its format or compressing it, for the \"Store\" and \"Preserve\" components. The Deliver category's functionality is also known as \"output\"; technologies in this category are often termed ''[[Enterprise Output Management|output management]]''.\n\nThe Deliver components break down into three groups: '''transformation technologies''', '''security technologies''', and '''distribution'''. Transformation and security, as services, are [[middleware]] and should be equally available to all ECM components. For output, two functions are of primary importance: ''layout and design'', with tools for laying out and formatting output, and ''[[electronic publishing|publishing]]'', with applications for presenting information for distribution and publication.\n\nIn short, ECM delivery provides information to users. Secure distribution, collaboration, and version control take the forefront. In some cases, these components are still deployed as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide ECM system.\n\n====Transformation technologies====\nTransformations should always be controlled and trackable. This is done by background services that the end user generally does not see. Among the transformation technologies are:\n\n; Computer output to laser disc (COLD)\n: Unlike its use in the Capture stage, when used for delivery COLD prepares output data for distribution and transfer to the archive. Typical applications are lists and formatted output (for example, individualized customer letters). These technologies also include journals and logs generated by the ECM components. Unlike most imaging media, COLD records are indexed not in a database table, but by absolute positions within the document itself (i.e. page 1, line 82, position 12). As a result, COLD index fields are not available for editing after submission unless they are converted into a standard database.\n; [[Personalization]]\n: Functions and output can be customized to a particular user's needs.\n; XML (Extensible Markup Language)\n: A computer language that allows the description of interfaces, structures, metadata, and documents in a standardized, cross-platform manner.\n; [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (Portable Document Format)\n: A cross-platform print and distribution format. Unlike image formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], PDFs permit content searches, the addition of metadata, and the embedding of electronic signatures. When generated from electronic data, PDFs are [[resolution independence|resolution-independent]], allowing crisp reproduction at any scale.\n; XPS ([[XML Paper Specification]])\n:An XML specification developed by Microsoft, describing the formats and rules for distributing, archiving, rendering, and processing XPS documents.\n; Converters and viewers\n: Serve to reformat information to generate uniform formats, and also to display and output information from different formats.\n; [[Data compression|Compression]]\n: Used to reduce the storage space needed for pictorial information.\n; [[Web syndication|Syndication]]\n: Used for presenting content in different formats, selections, and forms in the context of content management. Syndication allows the same content to be used multiple times in different forms for different purposes.\n\n====Security technologies====\nSecurity technologies are available to all ECM components. For example, [[electronic signature]]s are used not only when documents are sent, but also in data capture via scanning, in order to document the completeness of the capture. [[Public key infrastructure]] is a basic technology for electronic signatures. It manages keys and certificates and checks the authenticity of signatures. Other electronic signatures confirm the identity of the sender and the integrity of the sent data, i.e., that it is complete and unchanged.\n\nIn Europe, there are three forms of electronic signatures, of different quality and security: simple, advanced, and qualified. In most European states the qualified electronic signature is legally admissible in legal documents and contracts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Digital rights management]] and [[watermark]]ing are used in content syndication and media asset management, to manage and secure intellectual property rights and copyrights. Digital rights management works with techniques like electronic watermarks that are integrated directly into the file and seeks to protect usage rights and protect content that is published on the Internet.\n\n====Distribution====\nAll of the above technologies serve to provide an ECM's contents to users by various routes, in a controlled and user-oriented manner. These can be active components such as e-mail, data media, memos, and passive publication on websites and portals where users can get the information themselves. Possible output and distribution media include:\n\n{{Div col}}\n* The Internet\n** Extranets\n** Intranets\n** [[electronic business|E-business]] portals\n** Employee portals\n* [[E-mail]]\n* Fax\n* Data transfer by EDI, XML or other formats\n* Mobile devices, like mobile phones, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and others\n* Data media like CDs and DVDs\n* [[digital television|Digital TV]] and other [[multimedia]] services\n* [[Paper]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe various Deliver components provide information to users in the best way for the given application, while controlling its use as far as possible.\n\n==Methods==\n\n===On-premises===\nECM was developed as a traditional software application that companies implemented on their own corporate networks. In this scenario, each individual company manages and maintains both the ECM application, and the network storage devices that store the data. Many on-premises ECM systems are highly customized for individual organizational needs.\nSince paper document capture requires the use of physical scanning devices, like [[Image scanner|scanner]]s or multi-function devices, it is typically performed on-premises. However, it can be outsourced to businesses that provide scanning services. Known as Service Bureaus, these companies complete high-volume scanning and indexing and return the electronic files to organizations via Web transfer or on CDs, DVDs, or other external storage devices.\n\n===Software as a service (SaaS)===\n[[SaaS]] ECM means that rather than deploying software on an in-house network, users access the application and their data online. It is also known as [[cloud computing]], hosted, and on-demand. As SaaS distribution technologies mature, businesses can receive the same features and customization capabilities as from on-premises ECM applications.\nSaaS delivery allows companies to more quickly begin using ECM since they do not have to purchase hardware or configure the applications, databases, or servers. In addition, organizations trade the capital costs associated with a hardware and software purchase for a monthly operating expense and storage capabilities that grow automatically to accommodate company growth.\n\n===Hybrid===\nIn some scenarios, companies find a hybrid composed of both SaaS and on-premises software work best for their situation. For example, hybrid ECM systems are being used to bridge the gap during company moves or to simplify information exchange following an acquisition. Hybrid is also being used when companies want to manage their own ECM on-premises, but also provide easy Web access to certain information for business partners or customers using a SaaS model. Hybrid makes the most sense when the two technologies are provided by the same manufacturer so that features and interfaces are an exact match.\n\n==ECM market development==\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|{{cite check|date=September 2010}}\n{{update|inaccurate=yes|date=September 2010}}\n}}\nPrior to 2003, the ECM market was dominated by a number of medium-sized independent vendors that fell into two categories: those who had originated as Document Management companies (''[[Laserfiche]]'', [[Saros Corporation|Saros]], [[Documentum]], [[docStar]], [[OpenText]], Db technology) and had begun adding on management of other enterprise content, and those who had started as Web Content Management providers ([[Interwoven]], [[Vignette Corporation|Vignette]], [[Stellent]]) and had begun trying to branch out into managing other types of content such as business documents and rich media. Larger vendors, such as IBM and Oracle, also had offerings in this space, and the market share remained largely fragmented.\n\nIn 2002, Documentum had added collaboration capabilities with its acquisition of [[eRoom]] while Interwoven and Vignette countered with their respective acquisitions of iManage and Intraspect. Similarly, Documentum purchased Bulldog for its Digital Asset Management (DAM) capabilities while Interwoven and OpenText countered with acquisitions of MediaBin and [[Artesia Digital Media Group|Artesia]]. OpenText also acquired European companies IXOS and Red Dot to shore up its software portfolio. In October 2003, EMC Corporation acquired Documentum. Soon EMC's primary competitors in the database space responded as [[IBM]] purchased FileNet and Oracle purchased Stellent in 2006. OpenText also purchased [[Hummingbird Ltd.]] in 2006. [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) entered the ECM space with its acquisition of Australian company Tower Software in 2008. In March 2009, [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]] purchased Interwoven, in July 2009 OpenText acquired Vignette, and in February 2011 OpenText acquired MetaStorm. Most recently, OpenText acquired Global 360 in July 2011,<ref>{{cite web \n  | url = http://www.therecord.com/news/business/article/562424--opentext-profiting-from-acquisitions-as-it-extends-reach\n  | title = OpenText profiting from acquisitions as it extends reach\n  | date = July 13, 2011\n  | accessdate = August 25, 2011 }}</ref> and HP made an agreement to purchase Autonomy in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110818xc.html\n  | title = HP to Acquire Leading Enterprise Information Management Software Company Autonomy Corporation plc\n  | date = August 18, 2011\n  | accessdate = August 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2007, independent analyst firm [[CMS Watch]] noted that \"some of the biggest names in this business are undergoing substantial transformation that will lead to shifting road maps and product sets over the next few years\".<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url = http://www.webanalyticsworld.net/2007/04/cms-watch-releases-enterprise-cms.html\n  | title = CMS Watch Releases Enterprise CMS Comparison Report\n  | author = Manoj Jasra\n  | date = April 17, 2007\n  | accessdate = September 21, 2010 }}</ref>\nIn addition, 2007 saw the emergence of open-source options for ECM supplied by Nuxeo and Alfresco, along with a [[software-as-a-service]] offering from Spring CM.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url = http://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/996-Open-Source-ECM-continues-to-grow\n  | title = Open Source ECM continues to grow\n  | author = Alan Pelz-Sharpe\n  | publisher = Real Story Group\n  | work = Blog\n  | date = August 19, 2007\n  | accessdate = October 16, 2013 }}</ref> In 2008, Sense/Net released Sense/Net 6.0, an open source ECM and EPS solution.\n<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url = http://www.cmsmatrix.org/matrix/cms-matrix/sense/net-6.0-enterprise-portal--enterprise-cms?showRatings=1\n  | title = Sense/Net 6.0 (Enterprise Portal & Enterprise CMS)\n  | publisher = Plain Black Corporation\n  | work = CMS Matrix\n  | date = October 2, 2008\n  | accessdate = October 16, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n  | url = http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/enterprise-cms-socialism-sensenet-supports-cmis-003525.php\n  | title = Enterprise CMS Socialism: Sense/Net Supports CMIS\n  | publisher = Simpler Media Group\n  | work = CMS Wire\n  | date = November 14, 2008\n  | accessdate = October 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of software companies that have sprung up to develop applications to complement ECM with specific functions and features.

There are also several companies that provide plugins for ECMs.\n\nGartner estimated that the ECM market was worth approximately $3.3 billion in 2008; this was expected to grow at a [[compound annual growth rate]] of 9.5 percent through 2013. After a plethora of industry consolidation, only three or four major companies are left in this space, and the industry as a whole is undergoing a significant transformation as Microsoft commoditizes content-management components.<ref name=\"gartner quadrant\">{{Cite web\n  | url = http://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/reprints/microsoft/vol14/article8/article8.html\n  | title = Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Content Management\n  | work = Gartner.com\n  | publisher = Gartner\n  | date = November 16, 2010\n  | accessdate = August 25, 2011\n  | last = Bell\n  | first = Toby\n  | last2 = Shegda\n  | first2 = Karen M.\n  | last3 = Gilbert\n  | first3= Mark R.\n  | last4 = Chin\n  | first4 = Kenneth }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Gartner's 2010 report, 75 percent of Global 2000 companies were highly likely to have a desktop-focused, process-focused content management implementation by 2008, and ECM would continue to absorb other technologies, such as digital asset management and e-mail management. Gartner also predicted that there will be further market consolidation, acquisition, and separation of vendors into platform and solution providers.<ref>Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Content Management, 2008\"</ref>/>{{Update after|2010|09}} The same Gartner report classifies enterprise content management systems into four main categories: First, \"Transactional content management solutions\". These systems focus on imaging, capture, business process management and workflow, records management and compliance, search and e-forms. Examples: Hyland's [[OnBase]], Lexmark's Perceptive Software, docStar's Eclipse, WareITis Technologies' Records Studio. Another category is \"Social Content Management\". As its name suggests, these systems focus on social Web content like wikis, blogs, videos, browser or portal viewing, etc. Example: Alfresco.\n\nThe \"Online Channel Optimization\" systems are mainly Web content management and digital asset management systems. Examples: Autonomy, WordPress. The fourth category is \"Content Management as infrastructure\". These are vendor solutions that are used as enterprise content management platforms with all the core functionalities of the other types of content management systems, but the focus is on building solutions on top of the platform. Examples: IBM FileNet, Microsoft SharePoint, Alfresco, WareITis Technologies' Records Studio.<ref>Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Content Management, 2008</ref>\n\nIn a nod to the growing importance of simpler, cloud-based file-sharing systems among enterprise customers, analyst firm [[Real Story Group]] began to include such players as [[Box.net]] and [[WorkShare]] in its 2014 evaluations of major ECM vendors.<ref name=\"Real Story Group blog\">{{Cite web\n  | url = http://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/2686-Updated-ECM-reviews-including-Documentum-IBM-Alfresco-Oracle-Microsoft-OpenText-and-others\n  | title = Updated ECM reviews including Documentum, IBM, Alfresco, Oracle, Microsoft, OpenText, and others\n  | work = RealStoryGroup.com\n  | publisher = Real Story Group\n  | date = April 10, 2014\n  | accessdate = April 11, 2014\n  | last = Durga\n  | first = Apoorv\n }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Content Management Interoperability Services]]\n* [[Document management system]]\n* [[Enterprise content integration]]\n* [[Enterprise output management]]\n* [[Information governance]]\n* [[Information science]]\n* [[List of content management systems]]\n* [[Repository Open Service Interface Definition]]\n* [[Content management system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite conference\n  | title = ECM - Enterprise Content Management\n  | first = Michael\n  | last = Fray\n  | location = Denmark\n  | year = 2008\n  | isbn = 978-87-7900-831-1\n  | language = Danish\n  | publisher = Forlaget Globe\n}}\n* {{Cite conference\n  | title = ECM Enterprise Content Management\n  | first = Ulrich\n  | last = Kampffmeyer\n  | location = Hamburg\n  | year = 2006\n  | isbn = 978-3-936534-09-2\n  | language = English, French, German\n  | publisher = PROJECT CONSULT\n  | conference = DMS EXPO 2006, K\u00f6ln\n  | url = http://www.project-consult.de/files/ECM_Enterprise_Content_Management_eBook_Ulrich_Kampffmeyer_2006.pdf\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Content management systems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Enterprise Content Management}}\n[[Category:Content management systems]]\n[[Category:Enterprise application integration]]\n[[Category:Enterprise architecture]]\n[[Category:Information technology management]]\n[[Category:Records management technology]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_content_management"}

{"title_page": "Economy of the Empire of Japan", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2008}}\n{{copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n\nIn the half century up to 1999, [[Japan]]'s [[export]]s grew from 144 million to 5,331 million [[yen]] (\u00a5). This amounted to a share of world trade of only 3.7%, compared with 13.7% for the [[United Kingdom]] or 11.8% for the [[United States]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s also resulted in imports exceeding exports by \u00a51,000 million.\n\nIn 1936, Japan had the third-largest commercial shipping fleet in the world, valued at $1,183,000,000, or $28.10<!-- Is this US dollars? --> per person{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n==Government economic administration (Meiji through World War II)==\nThe official government entities who guided the Japanese national economy were the Economy and Finance Ministry, the [[Bank of Japan]], and the Industry and Commerce Ministry. For military spending there was the Marine and War Ministry<!-- Is this one ministry or is it two? -->, and other important government entities.\n\n==Investment in Korea (through World War II)==\nIn 1932, Japan invested $550,000,000 and similarly invested $320,000,000 in 1938. This investment produced a return of 400% in industrial monetary value.\n\nIn the fishing industry, Japan extracted a value of $20,000,000 annually. This is a high per capita statistic in fishing and comprised 15% of world fishing volumes.\n\nThe Noguchi Family put their principal investments in Banking commerce and Industry in this province. With their funds, the [[zaibatsu]] and the Japanese government founded the [[Bank of Chosen]], the central banking institution in the province, which stayed linked with the [[Central Bank of Manchou]], the Manchu central bank.\n\nOther significant industries were chemicals (30%) and Metal and machinery (10%) with a total 1,000,000 of workers in these areas, plus woodworking, textile, foods and handcrafts.\n\n==Fishing (World War II era)==\nThe important Okhotsk fisheries had a value of \u00a550 million. Other fisheries in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Karafuto]], [[South Mandate]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] came to \u00a5122,000,000 and \u00a5358,000,000 from Japan proper, for a total of \u00a5480,000,000 (1938 figures). Secondary products from fishing had a value of \u00a5150 million to \u00a5200 million. (From another source, fishing values were of \u00a5235,000,000 and \u00a5275,000,000 during 1919 to 1913, more than the British.)\n\nCoastal fishing represented 61% of the total value, with a fleet of 364,260 small boats, of which 20% had engines; the rest were sailing boats. High seas fishing represented 28% of the industry, with [[whaling]], [[coral]] and [[pearl]] collecting and a little physiculture on land making up the rest. The high\nseas vessels operated in the [[North Pacific]] area ([[Alaska]] coasts), to the South Pacific. During Japanese administration the fishing in the [[Kwantung]] leased territory was 61,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 1938, the [[fish factory vessel]]s packed 204,000,000 packages of crab, and 370 packages of sea salmon. In the same year, four whale hunting vessels fished in the waters around the [[Antarctic]]. Factories were built in [[Chisima]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Karafuto]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]] and other coastal areas to process fish products.\n\n==Forestry products (World War II era)==\nLocal forestry represented a production of 14,000,000 meters of wood with a value of \u00a575,000,000, a total value of \u00a550,000,000 in cut wood, \u00a53,000,000 in [[bamboo]] and other secondary wood products for a total value of \u00a5100,000,000. The local forests covered 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 90,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> under State administration or Imperial Family reserves. And, taking part in scientific forest research during the latter years. Coal of wood was valued at 100,000,000 yen. The Sugi (Scryptomeria Japonica), representing a quarter of the total quantity, Pine more than 20% in quantity and value and the Hinoki (Chamaecypaaris Obtusa) only 1/4% of quantity, but more than 9% in value.\n\nDespite many forests and their importance, Japan continued to buy wood overseas. In accordance with the other dates, Japan had 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest, 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in private hands, the other 75,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in state control and 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> owned by the Imperial House. Wood exports were made to the rest of the Japanese empire and to foreign markets.\n\n==Paper and cellulose industry==\nSince ancient times, Japan has manufactured assorted paper types by hand. A modern mechanized industry appeared in 1872 and became one of the most important industries in the nation. The total production was about 1,000,000 [[ton]]nes of paper and cardboard. [[Wood pulp|cellulose paste]], the principal prime material, was made in [[Shikoku]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and [[Karafuto]]. The [[Cellulose]] production resulted in 8% of U.S. manufacture; the Cellulose industry in Japan developed in [[Shikoku]], North [[Honsh\u016b]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Manchukuo]] and [[Karafuto]]. In Karafuto was the [[Shiretoru]] Cellulose Factory, the most advanced installation dedicated to the cellulose industry in all of [[East Asia]]. The first place where European-type paper was manufactured in Japan was in the city of [[Shikuka]]. Additionally, to complement this local production, these products were sold in [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]].\n\n==North Sakhalin and Japanese-Russian fishing convention==\nThe Japanese and Russian oil wells, in the same oil zone, were strictly controlled to ensure equitable exploitation. The pits stayed in direct connection with the Moskalvo port in the west coast of Ohka through a network of oil pipelines.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Government granted Japan petroliferous and carbonaceous concessions in North Sakhalin to Mitsubishi, Itoh-Korada, Mitsui and other Japanese Companies for a period of 45 years. By Protocols and agreements signed in Moscow in May 1944, these concessions expired 26 years before the accorded time in 1970, while a new Japanese-Russian accord over fishing conventions agreed to the formal retirement of some Japanese fisheries in the Far East to Japanese concessors, the right of Soviet Organizations to buy annually and for auction 10% of Japanese fish shares, and a supplementary payment in gold for Japanese owners.\n\nWhen modifying these fishing conventions in 1928, according to the activities of Soviet Fishing Organizations, citizens were subject to substantial reductions. The Japanese-Russian accord of March 1944 cancelled all restrictions previously observed.\n\nJapanese subjects and foreigners were banned from fishing in certain maritime zones in the Far East under an agreement with the Soviet Government made in July 1941. The Japanese Government also guaranteed that fishing rights on the East Coast of [[Kamchatka]] and [[Olyutorsk]] were not taken up by the Japanese.\n\n==Birth rates==\nSome dates and figures:\n*In 1914, the Japanese birth rate stood at 15%, close to that of [[Germany]] or [[Russia]], slightly lower than [[Java (island)|Java]] (Dutch Indies) at 22%. There was a reduction to 13.6% in 1924. For example, in Japan proper there were 157 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, and Hokkaido had 184 residents in per km<sup>2</sup> (cf. Java, which had 274).\n*In 1925, the population grew by 875,000 per year, in 1926 by 900,000, in 1927 this number grew to 1,000,000. In next last four years, the annual increase in population averaged 900,000, but in 1932-1940 the net growth was more than 1,000,000 per year, a rate which would double the population in 40 years. Japan imported 10% of the food for this population.\n*In 1936, Japan had 30.3 births per 1,000 residents and 17.5 deaths per 1,000. The net increase in population was 1,028,623 in 1935, but notably reduced to 653,000 in 1939 and 239,000 in 1940. Among the great countries, the birth average of Japan immediately followed British India (34.9) and was double that of the United States (16.7). This was accompanied by a growth in rice production between 1880-1940 of 60 million [[koku]] (300 million [[bushel]]s).\n*Japanese thinkers were preoccupied with demographics: to reduce of rate of deaths and increase that of births and comparing this with growth in China and Soviet Union. Army ideologists pondered the question and produced a [[eugenics]] law which ordered the sterilization or abortion of inferior or inadequate babies and ordered the increase of birth physically \"perfect\" future Samurai warriors. The Japanese government gave economic support to all mothers having many children. These experts planned a ten-year program to increase the number of soldiers to the number of 100,000,000. If needed for conquest purposes, Japanese mothers \"manufactured\" three million babies or, in other words, a sixfold increase in this \"production\" by all Japanese women.\n\nThese programs were guided by [[Katsuko Tojo]], [[General Tojo]]'s wife. She said wives should have seven children and suggested this should be the correct Japanese mother. This included participation by the central government, as she suggested creating one program for increasing the number of marriages.\n\n==Naval construction industry==\nIn 1893 naval construction was in the range 177,000 to 1,528,000 tonnes. In 1913 this increased to 3,565,000 tonnes. In 1924 with 237 500-tonnes vessels and 11 10,000-tonnes and reaching 4,140,000 tonnes in 1928. The Japanese Navy was third in the world behind British and American Navies and dominated the West Pacific area before the war. The first modern Shipyard was built in 1891, and since then naval construction rapidly advanced. Japanese boats of more than 100 tonnes represented a total registered tonnage of 5,007,000 tonnes out of 1,198,000 corresponding to naval construction of 1936\u20131938. This put Japan in third place between maritime powers, a notable realization in such short time. The old vessels were destroyed or disarmed which is why the regular fleet was efficient and modern. Without scarcity of Petrol, much of these modern vessels were designed for that energy source.\n\n==Military industry==\nThis sector was important from the [[First Chinese-Japanese war]] to the Pacific War.\n\nLarge industrial groups received large investment for making weapons for Japanese Army and Navy in national war efforts. In military aircraft industry exist the next names of important companies how:\n\nFor the Japanese Navy:\n*[[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi]] (1,643,913 weapons)\n*[[Kawanishi Aircraft Company|Kawanishi]] (1,036,435 weapons)\n*Showa/[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]\n*[[Nihon]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Yokosuka]] (980,136 weapons)\n*[[Watanabe]]\n*[[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] (218,102 weapons)\n*[[Kugisho]]\n*[[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]]\n*[[Funryu]]\nFor the Japanese Army:\n*[[Nikkoku]]\n*[[Yokoi]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kokukosho]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kogiken]]\n*[[Tachikawa]] (2,078,832 weapons)\n*[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] (2,172,875 weapons)\n*[[Kokusai]] (60,037 weapons)\n*[[Kayaba]]\nFor both armed branches:\n*[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] (2,052,157 (army) and 3,148,417 (navy) weapons)\n*[[Mitsubishi]] (2,503,194 (army) and 1,287,742 (navy) weapons)\nFor Manchukuo and the Japanese Army:\n*[[Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company|Mansh\u016b]] (125,379 weapons)\nand other related companies.\n\nIn other war material, the name of [[Nambu Company]] are charged for making hand weapons for both armed branches, the [[Mitsubishi]] heavy industries with subsidiaries ([[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] Company, [[Ikegai]] Iron Works, [[Sagami Arsenal]] (factory) and others) possess the contract to manufacture the second Tank Type in use for armed forces the Medium Tank Type 97 or Chi-Ha and Shinhoto-Chi-Ha with a total of 1,049 units made in 1938\u20131941.\n*The first prototypes of Type 97 Medium Tank are constructed for Tokyo Plant of Mitsubishi Heavy industries Ltd. and [[Osaka Arsenal]].

Theirs are collectively named \"Japanese Secret and Special Weapons\".\n\nFor this, also see \"[[Japanese Secret and Special Weapons]]\".\n\n==Natural Resources in occupied areas after 1937==\n===Occupied Chinese Mainland===\nFrom 1937, during the Japanese military occupation of territories in [[China]], they\ncontrolled certain mineral deposits in those areas. They fall into three sectors:\n\nDeposits of tungsten, tin and manganese, also.\n*[[Chekiang]]: coal reserves were 101 million tonnes and extraction 250,000 tonnes in 1934. There were certain soils rich in bauxite.\n\n====South China area====\n*[[Fujian|Fukien]]: coal reserves of 500 million tonnes in 1934.\n*[[Kwantung]] (Canton): 421 million tonnes of coal reserves, and production was 338,000 tonnes in 1934. Iron reserves in [[Hainan]], with 400 million tonnes of iron of high grade in 1934. A small tungsten production, also.\n*[[Kwangsi]]: coal reserves of 300 million tonnes, and production of 30,000 tonnes in 1940. There were some sources of tungsten, manganese (production of 1,246 tonnes in 1940) and a tin production of 417,000 tonnes too.\n*[[Hunan]]: coal reserves were 1,793 million tonnes and extraction of 1,050,000 tonnes in 1940. Some deposits of tungsten, mercury, antimony ([[Hsikwangshan]] mine), manganese and gold.\n*[[Kweichow]]: coal reserves were 1,549 million tonnes, and extraction 360,750 tonnes in 1940. Deposits of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[copper]], [[antimony]], and [[sulphur]] also.\n\n===South East Asia===\nThis zone when conquered by Japanese forces added further resources and strategic points. This had formed part of Japanese Navy plans to expand into the '[[South Sea lands]]'.\n*[[Burma]]: in the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy river]] zone, there were the [[Yenangyaung]] and [[Chauk]] oil fields, 300 miles (500&nbsp;km) north of [[Rangoon]]. These sources and other in [[Singu]] extracted 260,000,000 gallons in 1938, and there was an unexploited coal deposit. This nation had other minerals: [[amber]] and [[jade]] ([[nefrite]] stone), [[lapis lazuli]], [[lazurite]], [[rubies]], extraction {{convert|141490|carat|kg}} in 1937, [[sapphire]]s, etc. in [[Shan Mesete]]. There was a major mine in [[Bawdwin]], producing silver, lead, zinc, nickel and copper. This deposit produced 72,000 tonnes of lead and ones 5,000,000 ounces in 1933, rock with content 20% of lead and zinc as a mineral. In [[Mergui]] and [[Tavoy]] ([[Tenasseri]]n area) mines produced tungsten and tin from 1910. Tin extraction rose to 6,623 tonnes in 1937.\n*[[Thailand]]: in its ranges were abundant sources of tin, which were extracted for mining, and from rivers. On the south coast [[guano]] was mined for [[fertilizer]] production.\n*[[French Indochina]]: in [[Honggay]] (near [[Haipong]]) extracted ones 2,308,000 tonnes of coal in 1937. Minerals included Tungsten, Chromium, Tin, antimony and manganese in the northern area and Phosphate rock in the southern area. These minerals were extracted to export in bulk for processing abroad.\n*[[Malacca]]: Tin extraction was in the hands of its Chinese citizens; production in 1939 was 55,950 tonnes or some 30% of world production. There were tin factories in [[Singapore]] and [[Penang]] for processing local extractions, and those of Thailand, Burma and Indochina. In the same area Japanese pre-war investment had related to bauxite, iron and manganese. The Kelantan, Trengganu and Johore iron mineral extractions represented 1,944,701 tonnes in 1939; the manganese was from [[Kelantan]] and [[Trengganu]] and Bauxite provided from Johore in the same year. Other Japanese mining investments were in the Dutch island of [[Bintang]] and existing coal deposits.\n*[[Dutch Indies]]: Its minerals were scarce but had important value. The oil in the [[Palembang]] ([[Sumatra]]), [[Djambi]], [[Medan]] and [[Borneo]] fields in [[Balikpapan]] and [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] produced 7,938,000 tonnes in 1940; perhaps a greater yield than California and Iran. Coal was in Sumatra and Borneo, with 1,456,647 tonnes mined in the same year. Additionally there were sulphur and manganese in Java, and nickel in [[Sulawesi|Celebes]]. Tin came from [[Bangka Island|Banka]] and the [[Billington Islands]], which extracted 43,900 tonnes in 1940. The Japanese mining business in the Bintang Island tin deposits produced 275,000 tonnes that year, supposedly one sixth of world production.\n*[[Philippines]]: Its mining industry had spectacularly developed during the U.S. administration. It produced more gold than Alaska, or any other American state apart from California. Gold extraction in 1941 represented 1,109,000 troy oz (34,500&nbsp;kg), five times more than in 1931, and silver associated with gold ore at the same level. These extractions proceeded mostly from the [[Benget]] district in [[Baguio Province]], [[Luzon]]. Iron deposits were rapidly developed and during 1941 1,191,641 tonnes was exported to Japan. Iron sources were located in [[North Camarines]] ([[Luzon]]), [[Samar (island)|Samar Island]] and [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]] in [[Mindanao island]]. In the last of these, the iron reserves were estimated as 500 million tonnes; [[Laterithic]] minerals with content of silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, and an iron content of 48% were of easy extraction from coastal areas. Chromium was not discovered until 1935, but the Philippines in 1939 produced 164,000 tonnes and had fifth place, or 11%, of world production. Sources were in [[Zambales]] (Luzon) with its extraction of 10 million tonnes, chrome oxide with a high 50% of chrome content. Manganese was abundant but of medium quality, and was sent to the US from 1935; the local production was 58,038 tonnes in 1940. There were also copper, lead, zinc and coal.\n\n===Pacific Sea lands===\nIn total or partial control:\n*New Guinea: certain Gold deposits in Bulolo (East New Guinea) with other minerals in these islands.\n*Nauru: certain sources of phosphates.\n*Gilberts: are other deposits of phosphates.\n*Salomon: sources of gold, copper and phosphates.\n*Palau Islands: Source of bauxite\n\n===Summary===\nExcept for the transportation difficulties due to great distances, the frequent sinking of Japanese merchants vessels or downed transport aircraft, guerrilla and local resistance movements' strikes against the mines, centers or transport lines, aerial allied attacks against occupied areas and great colonial administrative difficulties to manage these great territories outside Japan, these active or potential resources could not be used or disposed in adequate form for the Japanese Empire and much of these potential mineral exports did not arrive in Japanese markets and industries for finishing the process during the Pacific war time.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in the Empire of Japan]]\n*[[Demographics of Imperial Japan]]\n*[[Japanese heavy industry during WW2 times]]\n*[[Japanese mining and energy resources (WWII)]]\n*[[Japanese exterior Commerce during WW2 Times]]\n*[[Japanese-German pre-WWII industrial co-operation]]\n*[[Japanese Nuclear Weapons Development]]\n*[[Empire of Japan (foreign commerce and shipping)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080312173606/http://www.users.bigpond.com/battleforAustralia/historicalbackground/JapMilaggro.html JAPAN'S MILITARY AGGRESSION IN EAST ASIA 1931-1937] at users.bigpond.com/battleforaustralia\n* [http://www.historyorb.com/asia/japan_economic_expansion.shtml Japan's Economic Expansion into Manchuria and China in World War Two] at historyorb.com Author: James Graham Published: May, 2004\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm Why Japan ''Really'' Lost The War]\n\n{{JapanEmpireNavbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Empire Of Japan, Economy Of the}}\n[[Category:Economic history of Japan]]\n[[Category:Economic history of World War II]]\n[[Category:Empire of Japan|Economy]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2008}}\n{{grammar|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n\nIn the half century up to 1999, [[Japan]]'s [[export]]s grew from 144 million to 5,331 million [[yen]] (\u00a5). This amounted to a share of world trade of only 3.7%, compared with 13.7% for the [[United Kingdom]] or 11.8% for the [[United States]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s also resulted in imports exceeding exports by \u00a51,000 million.\n\nIn 1936, Japan had the third-largest commercial shipping fleet in the world, valued at $1,183,000,000, or $28.10 per person.\n\n==Government economic administration (Meiji through World War II)==\nThe official government entities who guided the Japanese national economy were the Economy and Finance Ministry, the [[Bank of Japan]], and the Industry and Commerce Ministry. For military spending there was the Marine and War Ministry<!-- Is this one ministry or is it two? -->, and other important government entities.\n\n==Investment in Korea (through World War II)==\nIn 1932, Japan invested $550,000,000 and similarly invested $320,000,000 in 1938. This investment produced a return of 400% in industrial monetary value.\n\nIn the fishing industry, Japan extracted a value of $20,000,000 annually. This is a high per capita statistic in fishing and comprised 15% of world fishing volumes.\n\nThe Noguchi Family put their principal investments in Banking commerce and Industry in this province. With their funds, the [[zaibatsu]] and the Japanese government founded the [[Bank of Chosen]], the central banking institution in the province, which stayed linked with the [[Central Bank of Manchou]], the Manchu central bank.\n\nOther significant industries were chemicals (30%) and Metal and machinery (10%) with a total 1,000,000 of workers in these areas, plus woodworking, textile, foods and handcrafts.\n\n==Fishing (World War II era)==\nThe important Okhotsk fisheries had a value of \u00a550 million. Other fisheries in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Karafuto]], [[South Mandate]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] came to \u00a5122,000,000 and \u00a5358,000,000 from Japan proper, for a total of \u00a5480,000,000 (1938 figures). Secondary products from fishing had a value of \u00a5150 million to \u00a5200 million. (From another source, fishing values were of \u00a5235,000,000 and \u00a5275,000,000 during 1919 to 1913, more than the British.)\n\nCoastal fishing represented 61% of the total value, with a fleet of 364,260 small boats, of which 20% had engines; the rest were sailing boats. High seas fishing represented 28% of the industry, with [[whaling]], [[coral]] and [[pearl]] collecting and a little physiculture on land making up the rest. The high\nseas vessels operated in the [[North Pacific]] area ([[Alaska]] coasts), to the South Pacific. During Japanese administration the fishing in the [[Kwantung]] leased territory was 61,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 1938, the [[fish factory vessel]]s packed 204,000,000 packages of crab, and 370 packages of sea salmon. In the same year, four whale hunting vessels fished in the waters around the [[Antarctic]]. Factories were built in [[Chisima]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Karafuto]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]] and other coastal areas to process fish products.\n\n==Forestry products (World War II era)==\nLocal forestry represented a production of 14,000,000 meters of wood with a value of \u00a575,000,000, a total value of \u00a550,000,000 in cut wood, \u00a53,000,000 in [[bamboo]] and other secondary wood products for a total value of \u00a5100,000,000. The local forests covered 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 90,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> under State administration or Imperial Family reserves. And, taking part in scientific forest research during the latter years. Coal of wood was valued at 100,000,000 yen. The Sugi (Scryptomeria Japonica), representing  a quarter of the total quantity, Pine more than 20% in quantity and value and the Hinoki (Chamaecypaaris Obtusa) only 1/4% of quantity, but more than 9% in value.\n\nDespite many forests and their importance, Japan continued to buy wood overseas. In accordance with the other dates, Japan had 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest, 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in private hands, the other 75,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in state control and 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> owned by the Imperial House. Wood exports were made to the rest of the Japanese empire and to foreign markets.\n\n==Paper and cellulose industry==\nSince ancient times, Japan has manufactured assorted paper types by hand. A modern mechanized industry appeared in 1872 and became one of the most important industries in the nation. The total production was about 1,000,000 [[ton]]nes of paper and cardboard.  [[Wood pulp|cellulose paste]], the principal prime material, was made in [[Shikoku]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and [[Karafuto]]. The [[Cellulose]] production resulted in 8% of U.S. manufacture; the Cellulose industry in Japan developed in [[Shikoku]], North [[Honsh\u016b]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Manchukuo]] and [[Karafuto]]. In Karafuto was the [[Shiretoru]] Cellulose Factory, the most advanced installation dedicated to the cellulose industry in all of [[East Asia]]. The first place where European-type paper was manufactured in Japan was in the city of [[Shikuka]]. Additionally, to complement this local production, these products were sold in [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]].\n\n==North Sakhalin and Japanese-Russian fishing convention==\nThe Japanese and Russian oil wells, in the same oil zone, were strictly controlled to ensure equitable exploitation. The pits stayed in direct connection with the Moskalvo port in the west coast of Ohka through a network of oil pipelines.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Government granted Japan petroliferous and carbonaceous concessions in North Sakhalin to Mitsubishi, Itoh-Korada, Mitsui and other Japanese Companies for a period of 45 years. By Protocols and agreements signed in Moscow in May 1944, these concessions expired 26 years before the accorded time in 1970, while a new Japanese-Russian accord over fishing conventions agreed to the formal retirement of some Japanese fisheries in the Far East to Japanese concessors, the right of Soviet Organizations to buy annually and for auction 10% of Japanese fish shares, and a supplementary payment in gold for Japanese owners.\n\nWhen modifying these fishing conventions in 1928, according to the activities of Soviet Fishing Organizations, citizens were subject to substantial reductions. The Japanese-Russian accord of March 1944 cancelled all restrictions previously observed.\n\nJapanese subjects and foreigners were banned from fishing in certain maritime zones in the Far East under an agreement with the Soviet Government made in July 1941. The Japanese Government also guaranteed that fishing rights on the East Coast of [[Kamchatka]] and [[Olyutorsk]] were not taken up by the Japanese.\n\n==Birth rates==\n\nSome dates and figures:\n\n*In 1914, the Japanese birth rate stood at 15%, close to that of [[Germany]] or [[Russia]], slightly lower than [[Java (island)|Java]] (Dutch Indies) at 22%. There was a reduction to 13.6% in 1924. For example, in Japan proper there were 157 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, and Hokkaido had 184 residents in per km<sup>2</sup> (cf. Java, which had 274).\n*In 1925, the population grew by 875,000 per year, in 1926 by 900,000, in 1927 this number grew to 1,000,000. In next last four years, the annual increase in population averaged 900,000, but in 1932-1940 the net growth was more than 1,000,000 per year, a rate which would double the population in 40 years. Japan imported 10% of the food for this population.\n*In 1936, Japan had 30.3 births per 1,000 residents and 17.5 deaths per 1,000. The net increase in population was 1,028,623 in 1935, but notably reduced to 653,000 in 1939 and 239,000 in 1940. Among the great countries, the birth average of Japan immediately followed British India (34.9) and was double that of the United States (16.7). This was accompanied by a growth in rice production between 1880-1940 of 60 million [[koku]] (300 million [[bushel]]s).\n*Japanese thinkers were preoccupied with demographics: to reduce of rate of deaths and increase that of births and comparing this with growth in China and Soviet Union. Army ideologists pondered the question and produced a [[eugenics]] law which ordered the sterilization or abortion of inferior or inadequate babies and ordered the increase of birth physically \"perfect\" future Samurai warriors. The Japanese government gave economic support to all mothers having many children. These experts planned a ten-year program to increase the number of soldiers to the number of 100,000,000. If needed for conquest purposes, Japanese mothers \"manufactured\" three million babies or, in other words, a sixfold increase in this \"production\" by all Japanese women.\n\nThese programs were guided by [[Katsuko Tojo]], [[General Tojo]]'s wife. She said wives should have seven children and suggested this should be the correct Japanese mother. This included participation by the central government, as she suggested creating one program for increasing the number of marriages.\n\n==Naval construction industry==\n\nIn 1893 naval construction was in the range 177,000 to 1,528,000 tonnes. In 1913 this increased to 3,565,000 tonnes. In 1924 with 237 500-tonnes vessels and 11 10,000-tonnes and reaching 4,140,000 tonnes in 1928. The Japanese Navy was third in the world behind British and American Navies and dominated the West Pacific area before the war. The first modern Shipyard was built in 1891, and since then naval construction rapidly advanced. Japanese boats of more than 100 tonnes represented a total registered tonnage of 5,007,000 tonnes out of 1,198,000 corresponding to naval construction of 1936-1938. This put Japan in third place between maritime powers, a notable realization in such short time. The old vessels were destroyed or disarmed which is why the regular fleet was efficient and modern. Without scarcity of Petrol, much of these modern vessels were designed for that energy source.\n\n==Military industry==\n\nThis sector was important from the [[First Chinese-Japanese war]] to the Pacific War.\n\nLarge industrial groups received large investment for making weapons for Japanese Army and Navy in national war efforts.

These minerals were extracted to export in bulk for processing abroad.\n*[[Malacca]]: Tin extraction was in the hands of its Chinese citizens; production in 1939 was 55,950 tonnes or some 30% of world production. There were tin factories in [[Singapore]] and [[Penang]] for processing local extractions, and those of Thailand, Burma and Indochina. In the same area Japanese pre-war investment had related to bauxite, iron and manganese. The Kelantan, Trengganu and Johore iron mineral extractions represented 1,944,701 tonnes in 1939; the manganese was from [[Kelantan]] and [[Trengganu]] and Bauxite provided from Johore in the same year. Other Japanese mining investments were in the Dutch island of [[Bintang]] and existing coal deposits.\n*[[Dutch Indies]]: Its minerals were scarce but had important value. The oil in the [[Palembang]] ([[Sumatra]]), [[Djambi]], [[Medan]] and [[Borneo]] fields in [[Balikpapan]] and [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] produced 7,938,000 tonnes in 1940; perhaps a greater yield than California and Iran. Coal was in Sumatra and Borneo, with 1,456,647 tonnes mined in the same year. Additionally there were sulphur and manganese in Java, and nickel in [[Sulawesi|Celebes]]. Tin came from [[Bangka Island|Banka]] and the [[Billington Islands]], which extracted 43,900 tonnes in 1940. The Japanese mining business in the Bintang Island tin deposits produced 275,000 tonnes that year, supposedly one sixth of world production.\n*[[Philippines]]: Its mining industry had spectacularly developed during the U.S. administration. It produced more gold than Alaska, or any other American state apart from California. Gold extraction in 1941 represented 1,109,000 troy oz (34,500&nbsp;kg), five times more than in 1931, and silver associated with gold ore at the same level. These extractions proceeded mostly from the [[Benget]] district in [[Baguio Province]], [[Luzon]]. Iron deposits were rapidly developed and during 1941 1,191,641 tonnes was exported to Japan. Iron sources were located in [[North Camarines]] ([[Luzon]]), [[Samar (island)|Samar Island]] and [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]] in [[Mindanao island]]. In the last of these, the iron reserves were estimated as 500 million tonnes; [[Laterithic]] minerals with content of silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, and an iron content of 48% were of easy extraction from coastal areas. Chromium was not discovered until 1935, but the Philippines in 1939 produced 164,000 tonnes and had fifth place, or 11%, of world production. Sources were in [[Zambales]] (Luzon) with its extraction of 10 million tonnes, chrome oxide with a high 50% of chrome content. Manganese was abundant but of medium quality, and was sent to the USA from 1935; the local production was 58,038 tonnes in 1940. There were also copper, lead, zinc and coal.\n\n===Pacific Sea lands===\nIn total or partial control:\n*New Guinea: certain Gold deposits in Bulolo (East New Guinea) with other minerals in these islands.\n*Nauru: certain sources of phosphates.\n*Gilberts: are other deposits of phosphates.\n*Salomon: sources of gold, copper and phosphates.\n*Palau Islands: Source of bauxite\n\n===Summary===\nExcept for the transportation difficulties due to great distances, the frequent sinking of Japanese merchants vessels or downed transport aircraft, guerrilla and local resistance movements' strikes against the mines, centers or transport lines, aerial allied attacks against occupied areas and great colonial administrative difficulties to manage these great territories outside Japan, these active or potential resources could not be used or disposed in adequate form for the Japanese Empire and much of these potential mineral exports did not arrive in Japanese markets and industries for finishing the process during the Pacific war time.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in the Empire of Japan]]\n*[[Demographics of Imperial Japan]]\n*[[Japanese heavy industry during WW2 times]]\n*[[Japanese mining and energy resources (WWII)]]\n*[[Japanese exterior Commerce during WW2 Times]]\n*[[Japanese-German pre-WWII industrial co-operation]]\n*[[Japanese Nuclear Weapons Development]]\n*[[Empire of Japan (foreign commerce and shipping)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080312173606/http://www.users.bigpond.com/battleforAustralia/historicalbackground/JapMilaggro.html JAPAN'S MILITARY AGGRESSION IN EAST ASIA 1931-1937] at users.bigpond.com/battleforaustralia\n* [http://www.historyorb.com/asia/japan_economic_expansion.shtml Japan's Economic Expansion into Manchuria and China in World War Two] at historyorb.com Author: James Graham Published: May, 2004\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm Why Japan ''Really'' Lost The War]\n\n{{JapanEmpireNavbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Empire Of Japan, Economy Of the}}\n[[Category:Economic history of Japan]]\n[[Category:Economic history of World War II]]\n[[Category:Empire of Japan|Economy]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: the USA \u2192 the US, 1936-1938 \u2192 1936\u20131938 (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Empire_of_Japan"}
