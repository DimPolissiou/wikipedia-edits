Consequently, Madagascar is a [[biodiversity hotspot]]; over 90% of [[wildlife of Madagascar| its wildlife]] is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\n\nThe archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite news|title=For Thousands of Years, Humans Coexisted with the Largest Birds That Ever Lived|url=https://www.livescience.com/63568-humans-killed-elephant-birds-madagascar.html|date=13 September 2018}}</ref> Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350&nbsp;BC and 550 AD by Indianized [[Austronesian peoples]], arriving on [[outrigger canoe]]s from [[Indonesia]]. The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], along with native Indonesian culture. These were joined around the 9th century AD by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrants crossing the [[Mozambique Channel]] from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic group]] is often divided into 18 or more [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|subgroups]], of which the largest are the [[Merina people|Merina]] of the central highlands.\n\nUntil the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the [[Merina Kingdom|Kingdom of Madagascar]] by a [[List of Malagasy monarchs|series]] of Merina [[andriana|nobles]]. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the [[French colonial empire]], from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at [[Antananarivo]]. However, in a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|popular uprising in 2009]], president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to [[Andry Rajoelina]]. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]] was named president following a [[Malagasy general election, 2013|2013 election]] deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]] (AU), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), and the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]].\n\nMadagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries, according to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/|title=About LDCs |publisher=UN-OHRLLS|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and [[French language|French]] are both [[official language]]s of the state. The majority of the population adheres to [[Malagasy mythology|traditional beliefs]], [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]], or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. {{As of|2017}}, the economy has been weakened by the 2009\u20132013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn the [[Malagasy language]], the island of Madagascar is called ''Madagasikara'' ({{IPA-mg|mada\u0261as\u02b2\u02c8k\u02b2ar\u0259\u0325}}) and its people are referred to as ''[[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]''.<ref name=NatGeo1>{{cite web |last = National Geographic |title = Style Manual |url=http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/M/madagascan-malagasy |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130525104716/http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/M/madagascan-malagasy |archivedate = 25 May 2013 |url-status=dead |accessdate =31 August 2012}}</ref> The island's appellation \"Madagascar\" is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the [[Middle Ages]] by Europeans.<ref name=Cousins>Cousins (1895), pp. 11\u201312</ref> The name ''Madageiscar'' was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer [[Marco Polo]] as a corrupted transliteration of the name [[Mogadishu]], the [[Somalia|Somali]] port with which Polo had confused the island.<ref name=\"Room 2006, p. 230\">Room (2006), p. 230</ref>\n\nOn [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Laurence]]'s Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Dias]] landed on the island and named it ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o''.

Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import\u2013export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75&nbsp;percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50&nbsp;percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.<ref name=EBLand/>\n\nThe IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s.

Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration.

Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of [[zebu]] is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors.

Islam was first brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] Muslim traders, who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion took hold in only a handful of southeastern coastal communities.

However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize ''fihavanana'' (solidarity), ''vintana'' (destiny), ''tody'' (karma), and ''[[Hasina (Madagascar)|hasina]]'', a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.<ref name=\"LOC\"/><ref name=Bradtbeliefs/>\n\nAlthough social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity, and roles within the community.<ref>Middleton (1999), pp.&nbsp;259\u2013262, 272, 309</ref> Malagasy people traditionally consult ''Mpanandro'' (\"Makers of the Days\") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or ''famadihana'', according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ''ombiasy'' (from ''olona-be-hasina'', \"man of much virtue\") of the southeastern [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]] ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.<ref>Ames (2003), p. 101</ref>\n\nThe diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions.

[[Malagasy Republic]], is an [[island country]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], approximately {{convert|250|miles|km| order=flip|abbr=off}} off the coast of [[East Africa]]. At {{convert|592800|km2}} Madagascar is the world's 4th largest [[List of island countries|island country]].<ref name=\"world-atlas\"/> The nation comprises the island of [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]] (the fourth-[[List of islands by area| largest island]] in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], Madagascar split from the [[Indian peninsula|Indian subcontinent]] around 88&nbsp;million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a [[biodiversity hotspot]]; over 90% of [[wildlife of Madagascar| its wildlife]] is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\n\nThe archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite news|title=For Thousands of Years, Humans Coexisted with the Largest Birds That Ever Lived|url=https://www.livescience.com/63568-humans-killed-elephant-birds-madagascar.html|date=13 September 2018}}</ref> Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350&nbsp;BC and 550 AD by Indianized [[Austronesian peoples]], arriving on [[outrigger canoe]]s from [[Indonesia]]. The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], along with native Indonesian culture. These were joined around the 9th century AD by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrants crossing the [[Mozambique Channel]] from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic group]] is often divided into 18 or more [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|subgroups]], of which the largest are the [[Merina people|Merina]] of the central highlands.\n\nUntil the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the [[Merina Kingdom|Kingdom of Madagascar]] by a [[List of Malagasy monarchs|series]] of Merina [[andriana|nobles]]. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the [[French colonial empire]], from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at [[Antananarivo]]. However, in a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|popular uprising in 2009]], president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to [[Andry Rajoelina]]. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]] was named president following a [[Malagasy general election, 2013|2013 election]] deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]] (AU), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), and the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]].\n\nMadagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries, according to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/|title=About LDCs |publisher=UN-OHRLLS|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and [[French language|French]] are both [[official language]]s of the state. The majority of the population adheres to [[Malagasy mythology|traditional beliefs]], [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]], or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. {{As of|2017}}, the economy has been weakened by the 2009\u20132013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn the [[Malagasy language]], the island of Madagascar is called ''Madagasikara'' ({{IPA-mg|mada\u0261as\u02b2\u02c8k\u02b2ar\u0259\u0325}}) and its people are referred to as ''[[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]''.<ref name=NatGeo1>{{cite web |last = National Geographic |title = Style Manual |url=http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/M/madagascan-malagasy |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130525104716/http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/M/madagascan-malagasy |archivedate = 25 May 2013 |url-status=dead |accessdate =31 August 2012}}</ref> The island's appellation \"Madagascar\" is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the [[Middle Ages]] by Europeans.<ref name=Cousins>Cousins (1895), pp. 11\u201312</ref> The name ''Madageiscar'' was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer [[Marco Polo]] as a corrupted transliteration of the name [[Mogadishu]], the [[Somalia|Somali]] port with which Polo had confused the island.<ref name=\"Room 2006, p. 230\">Room (2006), p. 230</ref>\n\nOn [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Laurence]]'s Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Dias]] landed on the island and named it ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o''.

The [[Malagasy Republic|First Republic]] (1960\u201372), under the leadership of French-appointed President [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this \"neo-colonial\" arrangement inspired a [[rotaka|series of farmer and student protests]] that overturned his administration in 1972.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n[[Gabriel Ramanantsoa]], a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel [[Richard Ratsimandrava]], appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General [[Gilles Andriamahazo]] ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral [[Didier Ratsiraka]], who ushered in the socialist-Marxist [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Second Republic]] that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.\n\nThis period saw a political alignment with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,<ref name=\"LOC\"/> and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, [[World Bank]] and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.<ref name=ISS/>\n\nRatsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of [[Albert Zafy]] (1993\u201396), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the [[Third Republic of Madagascar|Third Republic]] (1992\u20132010).<ref name=\"crisisgroup\"/> The new [[constitution of Madagascar|Madagascar constitution]] established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade.<ref name=\"LOC\"/> Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]], was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.<ref name=ISS>{{cite journal |last = Marcus |first = Richard |title = Political change in Madagascar: populist democracy or neopatrimonialism by another name? |journal = Occasional Paper No. 89 |publisher = Institute for Security Studies |date = August 2004 |url = http://www.issafrica.org/publications/papers/political-change-in-madagascar-populist-democracy-or-neopatrimonialism-by-another-name |accessdate =15 February 2012 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040907223329/http://www.iss.org.za/pubs/papers/89/Paper89.htm |archivedate = 7 September 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe contested [[Malagasy presidential election, 2001|2001 presidential elections]] in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7&nbsp;percent per year under his administration.

Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import\u2013export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75&nbsp;percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50&nbsp;percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.<ref name=EBLand/>\n\nThe IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration.

A Canadian newspaperman and former editor of ''Yacht Racing'' (predecessor to ''[[Sailing World]]''), he designed the [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]] in 1969. Kirby started as a reporter in [[Montreal]] before editing ''Yacht Racing'' and, in his spare time, taking up yacht design and drawing the Laser.In 1970 Kirby became editor of ''Yacht Racing'', where he stayed until 1975.\n\nKirby's career began with the [[International 14]] class, a developmental skiff with relatively few rules.

His commitment to improving the workmanship at Volkswagen made the Beetle famous for its bulletproof reliability.\n\nIn 1955, shortly before the Wolfsburg factory celebrated its millionth Volkswagen, Nordhoff was awarded a [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Service Cross with star]].<ref>Rieger, p. 122.</ref>\n\nNordhoff's ability to sell cars and his achievement in first placing the Wolfsburg factory on a firm footing and then making Volkswagen a domestic and international success have not been questioned, but he has been criticised on various bases. At Brandenburg during the war, he used slave labour, although he reportedly ensured the workers had adequate food, shelter and clothing.<ref name=R110/> He took full credit for the company's successes and has been seen as overly self-promoting; in the 1950s he was nicknamed \"King Nordhoff\" by the German press.<ref>Rieger, pp. 132\u201333.</ref> Finally, as became apparent in the 1960s, Volkswagen was too slow and inefficient in developing new designs under him.<ref>Rieger, pp. 240\u201341.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Steven |last=Tolliday |title=From 'Beetle Monoculture to the 'German Model': the Transformation of Volkswagen, 1967\u20131991 |journal=Business and Economic History |volume=24 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1995 |url=http://www.thebhc.org/sites/default/files/beh/BEHprint/v024n2/p0111-p0132.pdf |type=pdf |page=113 (pdf p.&nbsp;3)}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Maryann |last=Keller |title=Collision: GM, Toyota, Volkswagen and the Race to Own the 21st Century |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=1993 |isbn=9780385467773 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/collisiongmtoyot00kell }}</ref> While publicly championing the Beetle, beginning in 1952 Nordhoff spent [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]200&nbsp;million behind the scenes seeking to develop new models, some in partnership with other manufacturers, but his indecision led to the abandonment of all such prototypes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46409424.html |title=F\u00fcr K\u00e4ferm\u00fcde | trans-title = For the Beetle-tired | newspaper=Der Spiegel |date=15 May 1967 |language=German }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Christof |last=Vieweg |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/vw-prototypen-der-er-und-er-autos-ohne-zukunft-1.2418292 |title=VW-Prototypen der 50er und 60er: Autos ohne Zukunft |newspaper=[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]] |type=Magazine |date=3 April 2015 |language=German }}</ref> By the late 1960s, the Beetle faced serious competition from Japanese, American, and other European models in different markets.
