The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two [[primary bronchus|primary bronchi]]. At the top of the trachea the [[cricoid cartilage]] attaches it to the larynx. This is the only complete tracheal ring, the others being incomplete rings of reinforcing cartilage. The [[trachealis muscle]] joins the ends of the rings and these are joined vertically by bands of fibrous [[connective tissue]] \u2013 the [[annular ligaments of trachea]].  The [[epiglottis]] closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.\n\nThe trachea develops in the second month of development. It is lined with an [[epithelium]] that has [[goblet cell]]s which produce protective [[mucin]]s. An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] condition, also involving the larynx and [[bronchi]], called [[croup]] can result in a barking cough. A [[tracheotomy]] is often performed for ventilation in surgical operations where needed. [[Intubation]] is also carried out for the same reason by the inserting of a [[tracheal tube|tube]] into the trachea. \n\nThe word \"trachea\" is used to define a very different organ in [[invertebrate]]s than in vertebrates. Insects have an open [[respiratory system of insects|respiratory system]] made up of [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracles]], tracheae, and [[tracheole]]s to transport [[metabolism|metabolic]] gases to and from tissues.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Blausen 0865 TracheaAnatomy.png|thumb|left|240px]]\nAn adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about {{convert|1.5|to|2|cm|in}} and a length of about {{convert|10|to|11|cm|in}}; wider in males than females.<ref name=GA2016>{{Cite book|title=Gray's anatomy : the anatomical basis of clinical practice|editor=Standring, Susan|isbn=9780702052309|edition=41st|location=Philadelphia|oclc=920806541|year=2016|pp=965\u2013969|section=Trachea and bronchi}}</ref> It begins at the bottom of the [[larynx]], and ends at the [[Carina of trachea|carina]], the point where the trachea branches into left and right main [[bronchus|bronchi]].<ref name=GA2016 /> The trachea is surrounded by 16 - 22 rings of [[hyaline cartilage]]; these 'rings' are 4mm high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped.<ref name=\"GA2016\" /> Ligaments connect the rings.<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" /> The [[trachealis muscle]] connects the ends of the incomplete rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea.<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" />\n\nThe trachea begins at the lower edge of the [[cricoid cartilage]] of the [[larynx]],<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" /> and ends at the [[Carina of trachea|carina]], the point where the trachea branches into left and right main [[bronchus|bronchi]].<ref name=\"GA2016\" /> The trachea begins level with the [[cervical vertebra 6|sixth cervical vertebra (C6)]] and the carina is found at the level of the fourth [[thoracic vertebra|thoracic vertebra (T4)]],<ref name=GA2016 /> although its position may change with breathing.<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" />\n\n=== Nearby structures ===\nThe trachea passes by many structures of the neck and thorax along its course.\n\nIn front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin.<ref name=\"GA2016\" /> Several other structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the [[Jugular venous arch|jugular arch]], which joins the two [[anterior jugular vein]]s, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea.

The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. This is often one of the responsibilities of an [[anaesthetist]] during surgery. The [[epiglottic vallecula]] is an important anatomical landmark for carrying out this procedure.\n\nIn an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a [[tracheotomy]] is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept open.

The Authority wrote in its ruling that \"the status of the occupied territory of the West Bank was the subject of much international dispute, and because we considered that the ad implied that the part of East Jerusalem featured in the image was part of the state of Israel, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead.\" Israel rejected the ruling, with the Ministry of Tourism releasing a statement that said the ad provided \"basic, accurate information to a prospective UK visitor\". The ruling from 2009 also included criticism about Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights being shown as part of Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8620389.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306142608/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8620389.stm |archivedate=March 6, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4633267,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 4, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416162913/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4633267,00.html |archivedate=April 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 200\n   | footer    = \n   | image1    = Scythopolis4 by Yukatan.jpg \n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Ruins of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]], [[Beit Shean]]\n   | image2    = Eilat2.jpg \n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = Eilat [[seaside resort]] on the [[Red Sea]]\n   | image3    = KeremNaftali View2HulaNationalReserve.jpg\n   | alt3      = \n   | caption3  = [[Hula Valley]] in [[Northern District (Israel)|northern Israel]]\n   | image4    = Vista general de Masada.jpg\n   | alt4      = \n   | caption4  = [[Masada]]\n   | image5    = Ruins of the Ancient Synagogue at Bar'am.jpg\n   | alt5      = \n   | caption5  = Ancient Synagogue at [[Bar'am National Park]]\n   | image6    = Christmas in The City of Nazareth.jpg\n   | alt6      = \n   | caption6  = Christmas Eve in [[Nazareth]]\n   | image7    = Ruins of a church in Shivta in the Negev.jpg\n   | alt7      = \n   | caption7  = [[Shivta National Park]], (World Heritage Site)\n   | image8    = Aerial view of Acre 1.jpg\n   | alt8      = \n   | caption8  = Old City of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]\n   | image9    = Nahal Mearot caves.jpg\n   | alt9      = \n   | caption9  = [[Nahal Me'arot Nature Reserve|Nahal Me'arot prehistoric caves]], [[Mount Carmel]]\n}}\n\n===Tel Aviv===\n* With 2.3&nbsp;million tourist visits in 2013,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.567957 |title=Tourism in Israel hits all time high |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=January 10, 2014 |accessdate=April 22, 2018}}</ref><!-- WP:CALC : 3.54 total tourists * 64% visiting Tel Aviv--> [[Tel Aviv]] is Israel's [[List of largest cities and second largest cities by country|second-largest]] city, and a [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]], cultural and financial [[global city]].

While he produced albums for dozens of different bands and artists, he is most closely associated for his work with several key musical acts of the 1960s and 1970s.  He rose to prominence working with the various bands of vocalist [[Steve Winwood]] (including [[Spencer Davis Group]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], and [[Blind Faith]]).  His best acclaimed work was his late 1960s-early 1970s work with the [[Rolling Stones]] for whom he produced a string of singles and albums that rank among the most critically and financially successful works of the band's career: ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972) and ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' (1973).<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/music/article/sunday-morning-playlist-top-twenty-record/page-5/ Sunday Morning Playlist: Top Twenty Record Producers of the Rock Era \u2013 Page 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608033942/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/sunday-morning-playlist-top-twenty-record/page-5/ |date=8 June 2012 }}</ref>  In the late 1970s, he began working with the band [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and continued to produce until his death in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jimmy+Miller |title=Jimmy Miller Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMiller was the son of Anne Wingate and [[Bill Miller (impresario)|Bill Miller]], a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] entertainment director and the man who booked [[Elvis Presley]] into the [[Westgate Las Vegas|International Hotel]] for his 1969 return to live performance.<ref name=NYTOBit>{{cite news|title=Jimmy Miller, 52, Recording Producer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/obituaries/jimmy-miller-52-recording-producer.html|accessdate=2018-03-25|work=The New York Times|agency=The Associated Press|date=1994-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nPrior to working with the Rolling Stones, Miller had trained and worked as the protege of Stanley Borden ([[RKO]], Artia, After Hours Unique). Borden, the original backer of [[Island Records]], suggested Miller to [[Chris Blackwell]], who brought him to the United Kingdom where he rose to fame producing successful releases for [[the Spencer Davis Group]] including their breakthrough hit \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" and its follow-up \"[[I'm A Man (Spencer Davis Group song)|I'm A Man]],\" which Miller co-wrote with the band's singer-keyboardist, [[Steve Winwood]]. In addition to his production work for Winwood's band [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], Miller also contributed the lyrics to the Traffic song \"Medicated Goo.\" During this period Miller also produced the first two albums by [[Spooky Tooth]] as well as the sole album by the [[Eric Clapton]]-Winwood supergroup [[Blind Faith]].\n\nFollowing his work with Blind Faith, Miller co-produced (with [[Delaney Bramlett]]) the hit [[Delaney & Bonnie]] album from 1969, ''[[On Tour with Eric Clapton]]''. He went on to produce albums for Delaney & Bonnie keyboardist [[Bobby Whitlock]], [[Kracker]], [[the Plasmatics]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and the UK band [[Nirvana (UK band)|Primal Scream]].\n\nA [[drummer]] himself, Miller created a distinctive drum sound for his productions, especially with the Rolling Stones, on whose recordings he occasionally played.  Among his contributions include the opening cowbell on \"[[Honky Tonk Women]],\" and the main drumming on tracks such as  \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]],\" (where regular Stones drummer [[Charlie Watts]] was unable to play the correct \"groove\"),<ref name=according >{{Cite book |last=Loewenstein |first=Dora |first2=Philip |last2=Dodd |title=According to the Rolling Stones |year=2003 |publisher=Chronicle Books |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8118-4060-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/accordingtorolli00jagg/page/125 125] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/accordingtorolli00jagg }}</ref> \"[[Tumbling Dice]]\" (where Watts was similarly troubled by the ending of the song), and songs such as \"[[Happy (Rolling Stones song)|Happy]]\"  and \"[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones song)|Shine a Light]]\" where Watts was absent from the recording sessions for various reasons.\n\nIn the 1980s, Miller produced acts such as [[Johnny Thunders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roir-usa.com/8248.htm |title=ROIR |publisher=Roir-usa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>  Matrix and [[Jo Jo Laine]] (wife of [[Denny Laine]], on \"Moody Blues & Wings\"). In 1990 he co-produced (along with Phil Greene) \"What's in A Name\" for Florida band Walk the Chalk.\n\nMiller went on to work with [[Primal Scream]] on their breakthrough album ''[[Screamadelica]]'' and [[William Topley (musician)|William Topley]]'s band [[The Blessing (rock band)|the Blessing]] (Miller appears on their DVD ''Sugar Train'' during the song \"Soul Love\").\n\nAmong Miller's last productions were three tracks on the 1992 [[Wedding Present]] project, ''[[Hit Parade 2]]''. Miller also produced four tracks on the World Bank's \"In Debt Interview\" which featured artists such as [[Billy Preston]] and [[Bobby Keys]], and a rare musical sideline from author [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. Miller traveled to [[Woody Creek, Colorado]] in 1994 to meet with Thompson for a memorable weekend in May.

He rose to prominence working with the various bands of vocalist [[Steve Winwood]] (including [[Spencer Davis Group]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], and [[Blind Faith]]).  His best acclaimed work was his late 1960s-early 1970s work with the [[Rolling Stones]] for whom he produced a string of singles and albums that rank among the most critically and financially successful works of the band's career: ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972) and ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' (1973).<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/music/article/sunday-morning-playlist-top-twenty-record/page-5/ Sunday Morning Playlist: Top Twenty Record Producers of the Rock Era \u2013 Page 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608033942/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/sunday-morning-playlist-top-twenty-record/page-5/ |date=8 June 2012 }}</ref>  In the late 1970s, he began working with the band [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and continued to produce until his death in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jimmy+Miller |title=Jimmy Miller Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMiller was the son of Anne Wingate and [[Bill Miller (impresario)|Bill Miller]], a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] entertainment director and the man who booked [[Elvis Presley]] into the International Hotel for his 1969 return to live performance.<ref name=NYTOBit>{{cite news|title=Jimmy Miller, 52, Recording Producer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/obituaries/jimmy-miller-52-recording-producer.html|accessdate=2018-03-25|work=New York Times|agency=The Associated Press|date=1994-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nPrior to working with the Rolling Stones, Miller had trained and worked as the protege of Stanley Borden ([[RKO]], Artia, After Hours Unique). Borden, the original backer of [[Island Records]], suggested Miller to [[Chris Blackwell]], who brought him to the United Kingdom where he rose to fame producing successful releases for [[the Spencer Davis Group]] including their breakthrough hit \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" and its follow-up \"[[I'm A Man (Spencer Davis Group song)|I'm A Man]],\" which Miller co-wrote with the band's singer-keyboardist, [[Steve Winwood]]. In addition to his production work for Winwood's band [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], Miller also contributed the lyrics to the Traffic song \"Medicated Goo.\" During this period Miller also produced the first two albums by [[Spooky Tooth]] as well as the sole album by the [[Eric Clapton]]-Winwood supergroup [[Blind Faith]].\n\nFollowing his work with Blind Faith, Miller co-produced (with [[Delaney Bramlett]]) the hit [[Delaney & Bonnie]] album from 1969, ''[[On Tour with Eric Clapton]]''. He went on to produce albums for Delaney & Bonnie keyboardist [[Bobby Whitlock]], [[Kracker]], [[the Plasmatics]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and the UK band [[Nirvana (UK band)|Primal Scream]].\n\nA [[drummer]] himself, Miller created a distinctive drum sound for his productions, especially with the Rolling Stones, on whose recordings he occasionally played.  Among his contributions include the opening cowbell on \"[[Honky Tonk Women]],\" and the main drumming on tracks such as  \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]],\" (where regular Stones drummer [[Charlie Watts]] was unable to play the correct \"groove\"),<ref name=according >{{Cite book |last=Loewenstein |first=Dora |first2=Philip |last2=Dodd |title=According to the Rolling Stones |year=2003 |publisher=Chronicle Books |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8118-4060-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/accordingtorolli00jagg/page/125 125] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/accordingtorolli00jagg }}</ref> \"[[Tumbling Dice]]\" (where Watts was similarly troubled by the ending of the song), and songs such as \"[[Happy (Rolling Stones song)|Happy]]\"  and \"[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones song)|Shine a Light]]\" where Watts was absent from the recording sessions for various reasons.\n\nIn the 1980s, Miller produced acts such as [[Johnny Thunders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roir-usa.com/8248.htm |title=ROIR |publisher=Roir-usa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>  Matrix and [[Jo Jo Laine]] (wife of [[Denny Laine]], on \"Moody Blues & Wings\"). In 1990 he co-produced (along with Phil Greene) \"What's in A Name\" for Florida band Walk the Chalk.\n\nMiller went on to work with [[Primal Scream]] on their breakthrough album ''[[Screamadelica]]'' and [[William Topley (musician)|William Topley]]'s band [[The Blessing (rock band)|the Blessing]] (Miller appears on their DVD ''Sugar Train'' during the song \"Soul Love\").\n\nAmong Miller's last productions were three tracks on the 1992 [[Wedding Present]] project, ''[[Hit Parade 2]]''. Miller also produced four tracks on the World Bank's \"In Debt Interview\" which featured artists such as [[Billy Preston]] and [[Bobby Keys]], and a rare musical sideline from author [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. Miller traveled to [[Woody Creek, Colorado]] in 1994 to meet with Thompson for a memorable weekend in May. Miller died on October 22, 1994, of liver failure.<ref name=NYTOBit/>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n<!-- Before adding the names of any other spouses here, please read talk page section 'Kerri-Anne Kennerley' about disputed identity.

It lies {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} east of [[Burnley]] and {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} west of [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. The village is in the Luddendenfoot Ward of [[Calderdale|Calderdale Council]] and forms part of the [[Hebden Royd]] [[parish]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hebdenroyd.org.uk/about.html |title=Hebden Royd Council |date=2017 |accessdate=1 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629163305/http://hebdenroyd.org.uk/about.html |archive-date=29 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nMytholmroyd was recorded in the 13th century as \"Mithomrode\" and in the 17th century as \"Mitholmroide\". The name means 'a clearing for settlement, where two rivers meet', likely derived from the [[Old English]] ''(ge)m\u0233thum'' (inflected form of ''(ge)m\u0233the'', \"river mouth\"), plus ''rodu'' (\"field\" or \"clearing\"). The ''l'' was probably inserted out of confusion with the common place-name element ''holm'', [[Old Norse]] for a small island or [[eyot]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Anthony David|title=Oxford dictionary of British place names|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=513|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_B0Ouj5VC0C&lpg=PP1&dq=british%20place%20names&pg=PT513#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Goodall|first=Armitage|title=Place-names of South-West Yorkshire|year=1913|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=216|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028042962}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nA Bronze Age urnfield exists on the moor top, north of Mytholmroyd. It is a burial ground with cremation urns, dating between the 16th and 11th centuries BC of national importance. Evidence of pre-historic farming is apparent because they cleared the upland forests for cattle grazing and created the peat moorlands. Most of the Celtic Iron Age settlements were concentrated on the hillside terraces which avoided the wooded and poorly drained valley floors. Most of the older listed buildings are located on the hillsides away from the valley. A Roman coin hoard has been found to the south of Mytholmroyd.<ref name=\"MCAA3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/environment/conservation/conservation-areas/mytholmroyd.pdf|title=Mytholmroyd Conservation Area Appraisal|publisher=Calderdale Council|page=3|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Cragg Vale Coiners===\nDuring the late 18th century, the valley to the south, known as [[Cragg Vale]], was home to a gang of [[counterfeit]]ers known as the Cragg Vale Coiners. The gang's leader, David Hartley, or King David as he was known, was found guilty of the 1769 murder of excise official William Dighton and was hanged at the [[York]] [[Knavesmire|Tyburn]] on 28 April 1770. Two other gang members were also executed for their part in the murder.\n\n===Historic buildings and structures===\n\n====Canalside Mill====\nBuilt in 1851 as Canal Wharf Mill, it was home to local company Walkley Clogs, and converted into a well known tourist attraction with cafes, shops and an open clog factory on the ground floor. It was destroyed by fire in the 1990s; consequently the top floor was demolished and re-opened under ownership of a property development company. It subsequently closed in 2002 and has since been boarded up. Numerous planning applications to continue its former use or convert it into luxury apartments have been passed but never undertaken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~calderdalecompanion/m408_c.html|title=Malcolm Bull's Calderdale Companion : Mills & Mines : C|author=|date=|work=Ancestry.com|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>  On 1 August 2019 it was once again destroyed by fire, this time so badly that Calderdale Council said it would be demolished.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/historic-mill-to-be-demolished-after-major-fire-1-9911430|title=Historic mill to be demolished after major fire|website=www.halifaxcourier.co.uk|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n====St. Michael's Church====\nThe parish church was built in 1847 in Early English style. It was badly damaged in the 2015 floods but has since re-opened. The Sunday school in front of the church was reduced to one storey and is now used as a community hall and meeting spaces available for hire. In 2009 a new car park with monument in the form of an iron spike with a stone seating surround has been constructed park and is now used for village events.\n\n====County Bridge====\nThere has been a river crossing point since 1329 in the centre of the village, at the site of the current 'County Bridge'. A bridge is recorded in this location under the name \"Elphaborough Bridge\", after the name of Elphaborough Hall on the further side of Cragg Brook. Records of a grant issued to the local township for the purchase of timber stated it was for \"repairs to Mitholmroide Bridge\", in 1638. Similar records show that the current stone bridge was erected in 1684 by Timothy Wadsworth, at a cost of \u00a350. The current bridge was constructed in two parts (and now consists of four extensions). The original packhorse style bridge in 1638, and on the upstream side, the bridge was widened and two extra arches on the south end were added to ease the gradient, although the two new arches were considerably smaller, the bridge now consists of four arches in total. In the 19th century, with shops being constructed on the north end riverbank, and a new premises being built for the Mytholmroyd Co-Operative Society right up to the water's edge on the south bank, two of the bridge's arches are mostly hidden. However, the premises were built with a large opening underneath the buildings, allowing floodwater to still pass through the two hidden arches underground. Mytholmroyd Bridge was eventually taken over by West Riding County Council, which gives the historic bridge its present name of \"County Bridge\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sunderland|first1=M.|title=It's water under the bridge!|date=December 2003|page=40}}</ref>\n\n====Railway station and viaduct====\nA prominent viaduct lies above the southern end of Mytholmroyd town centre. It was erected in 1840 by George Stephenson and is still in use as part of the modern day [[Calder Valley Line]]. In the 1850s, [[Mytholmroyd railway station]] was built, consisting of two platforms built on the Mytholmroyd Viaduct, and a three-storey ticket office, waiting hall and entrance stairwell, leading unto the viaduct. This later closed and the platforms were built a matter of yards up the track on land, and is now accessed by open staircases and long access ramps up the steep banking, where flowers and displays are maintained by the Mytholmroyd Station Partnership.\n\n====Dusty Miller Inn====\nThis late 18th century pub replaced an earlier inn on the opposite side of the road, where Bridge End cottages now stand. The earlier building was home to the Cragg Coiners in 1769. The current [[Listed building|Grade II-listed]] inn comprises a hotel, bar and restaurant. The premises were severely damaged in the 2012 and 2015 flooding, causing the business to close for repairs. The bar re-opened in April 2016 and was awarded the \"pub of the season award\" for summer 2016 by the local [[Campaign for real ale|CAMRA]] branch.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://hxcalderdalecamra.org.uk/content/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CalderCask-Issue39-web.pdf |title=Pub of the Season, Summer 2016: The Dusty Miller |page=9 |work=CalderCask |issue=39 |publisher=Halifax and Calderdale branch of the [[Campaign for real ale|CAMRA]] |accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> {{As of|February 2017}} the hotel and restaurant are yet to re-open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustymillerinn.co.uk/ |title=The Dusty Miller Inn |accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Redacre House====\nRedacre House, off Burnley Road, dates from the late 16th century, and is probably the earliest house in Calderdale exhibiting an F-plan formed by the projecting two-storey porch and crosswing.<ref name=\"MCAA3\"/>\n\n==Mytholmroyd today==\nMytholmroyd now is a designated conservation area, with more than 21 listed buildings in the centre alone. The village is located approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} from the centre of [[Hebden Bridge]], and is often known to locals as 'Royd'. The population is roughly 4,000. The village holds markets, performances at the St. Michael's Enterprise Centre, antique shows and fairs, together with events at the sports and leisure centre and at the Ted Hughes Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mytholmroyd.net/news/114.html|title=The Mytholmroyd Net  Ted Hughes Memorial at Calder High School|author=|date=|work=Mytholmroyd.net|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Mytholmroyd has business parks and a high street in the centre with mainly independent shops including a post office, hardware shop, travel centre, launderette, hair salons and takeaways. There are also many eating venues including Aux Delices Bistro & Wine Bar, the Blue Teapot bistro, Riverside Cafe, the Shoulder of Mutton and more. There is a medical complex including a dental practice, pharmacy, and GP.\n\nThe village is currently (2017/18) under development with the [[Environment Agency]]'s Mytholmroyd Flood Alleviation Scheme. This includes raising the height of flood walls on the banks of the River Calder and Cragg Brook, as well as demolishing homes and businesses on the Calder's banks to widen the river. The village's post office has been relocated to flood-proof premises, with other buildings being stabilised and strengthened. Caldene Bridge, upstream from County Bridge, is being demolished and relocated as well as the bridge at Greenhill Industrial Estate.\n\n==Flooding==\n\n===2020===\nOn 9 February 2020, [[Storm Ciara]] caused a month-and-a-half's worth of rain to fall on Mytholmroyd within 24 hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-51442199|title=Calder Valley assesses Storm Ciara flood damage|date=10 February 2020|accessdate=14 February 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/gallery/mytholmroyd-flooding-pictures-after-storm-17725741|title=Mytholmroyd flooding in pictures after Storm Ciara batters region|first=Ian|last=Hughes|date=10 February 2020|work=Huddersfield Examiner|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===2015===\nMytholmroyd was severely affected by the [[2015\u201316 Great Britain and Ireland floods|Boxing Day floods in 2015]], when the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]] and the canal both rose to cover the valley floor, and consequently the town centre of Mytholmroyd. It was the highest ever recorded river level. Hundreds of homes and businesses were devastated, with some buildings still empty in 2017.

This was a repeat of another flash flood of June, in the same year, where more than 50&nbsp;mm of rain fell causing the River Calder to burst its banks. More than 5,000 properties were severely damaged in the [[Upper Calder Valley]]; many businesses lost insurance and consequently many never recovered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===1954===\nOn Saturday, 21 August 1954, almost 8 years since the devastating 1946 flood, a flash flood devastated the village once again; the river rose by more than 6&nbsp;ft in less than two hours, with flood water entering properties at over 2&nbsp;ft every 15 minutes. The Dusty Miller Inn had almost 4&nbsp;ft of water in its bar area. Flood alleviation works in the 1960s uncovered that County Bridge was standing on foundations untouched since the wooden bridge 17th century, so as part of the works the bridge's foundations were quickly filled with concrete.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===1946===\nIn the worst flooding to ever affect the village, many properties suffered flood water up to the second storey, and the village remained underwater for almost 12 hours. Two shops on Burnley Road collapsed into the river, shops just doors down from the buildings that collapsed in the 2015 flood. By 8 am, flood waters reached up to 7 feet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===1837===\nA disastrous flood occurred in 1837; few details are known about it, although it is known that the river reached the height of the canal, built on the hillside, and ultimately overflowed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eyeoncalderdale.com/it-s-water-under-the-bridge-mytholmroyd-1946|title=Eye On Calderdale|author=|date=|work=EyeOnCalderdale.com|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mytholmroyd, St Michael's Church - geograph.org.uk - 2051499.jpg|St. Michael's Church, Mythomroyd\nFile:Elphin Brook and railway viaduct, Mytholmroyd - geograph.org.uk - 267863.jpg|Elphin Brook passing under the [[Caldervale Line]] railway viaduct\nFile:New Lane, Mytholmroyd (7th November 2010).jpg|New Road passing under the [[Caldervale Line]] railway viaduct\nFile:Drinking Fountain, Cragg Road, Mytholmroyd - geograph.org.uk - 1462296.jpg|Drinking fountain, off Cragg Road\nFile:Gorillas next to the Rochdale Canal - geograph.org.uk - 103684.jpg|Gorillas next to the Rochdale Canal\nFile:Last colours of autumn, Mytholmroyd (7th November 2010).jpg|Last colours of autumn, Mytholmroyd (7 November 2010)\n</gallery>\n\n==Education==\nMytholmroyd is the home of [[Calder High School]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calderlearningtrust.com/|title=Home - Calder High|publisher=Calder Learning Trust|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref> the largest Comprehensive School in the [[Upper Calder Valley]].

It lies {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} east of [[Burnley]] and {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} west of [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]].

The name means 'a clearing for settlement, where two rivers meet', likely derived from the [[Old English]] ''(ge)m\u0233thum'' (inflected form of ''(ge)m\u0233the'', \"river mouth\"), plus ''rodu'' (\"field\" or \"clearing\"). The ''l'' was probably inserted out of confusion with the common place-name element ''holm'', [[Old Norse]] for a small island or [[eyot]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Anthony David|title=Oxford dictionary of British place names|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=513|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_B0Ouj5VC0C&lpg=PP1&dq=british%20place%20names&pg=PT513#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Goodall|first=Armitage|title=Place-names of South-West Yorkshire|year=1913|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=216|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028042962}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nA Bronze Age urnfield exists on the moor top, north of Mytholmroyd. It is a burial ground with cremation urns, dating between the 16th and 11th centuries BC of national importance. Evidence of pre-historic farming is apparent because they cleared the upland forests for cattle grazing and created the peat moorlands. Most of the Celtic Iron Age settlements were concentrated on the hillside terraces which avoided the wooded and poorly drained valley floors. Most of the older listed buildings are located on the hillsides away from the valley. A Roman coin hoard has been found to the south of Mytholmroyd.<ref name=\"MCAA3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/environment/conservation/conservation-areas/mytholmroyd.pdf|title=Mytholmroyd Conservation Area Appraisal|publisher=Calderdale Council|page=3|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Cragg Vale Coiners===\nDuring the late 18th century, the valley to the south, known as [[Cragg Vale]], was home to a gang of [[counterfeit]]ers known as the Cragg Vale Coiners. The gang's leader, David Hartley, or King David as he was known, was found guilty of the 1769 murder of excise official William Dighton and was hanged at the [[York]] [[Knavesmire|Tyburn]] on 28 April 1770. Two other gang members were also executed for their part in the murder.\n\n===Historic buildings and structures===\n\n====Canalside Mill====\nBuilt in 1851 as Canal Wharf Mill, it was home to local company Walkley Clogs, and converted into a well known tourist attraction with cafes, shops and an open clog factory on the ground floor. It was destroyed by fire in the 1990s; consequently the top floor was demolished and re-opened under ownership of a property development company. It subsequently closed in 2002 and has since been boarded up. Numerous planning applications to continue its former use or convert it into luxury apartments have been passed but never undertaken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~calderdalecompanion/m408_c.html|title=Malcolm Bull's Calderdale Companion : Mills & Mines : C|author=|date=|work=Ancestry.com|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>  On 1 August 2019 it was once again destroyed by fire, this time so badly that Calderdale Council said it would be demolished.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/historic-mill-to-be-demolished-after-major-fire-1-9911430|title=Historic mill to be demolished after major fire|website=www.halifaxcourier.co.uk|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n====St. Michael's Church====\nThe parish church was built in 1847 in Early English style. It was badly damaged in the 2015 floods but has since re-opened. The Sunday school in front of the church was reduced to one storey and is now used as a community hall and meeting spaces available for hire. In 2009 a new car park with monument in the form of an iron spike with a stone seating surround has been constructed park and is now used for village events.\n\n====County Bridge====\nThere has been a river crossing point since 1329 in the centre of the village, at the site of the current 'County Bridge'. A bridge is recorded in this location under the name \"Elphaborough Bridge\", after the name of Elphaborough Hall on the further side of Cragg Brook. Records of a grant issued to the local township for the purchase of timber stated it was for \"repairs to Mitholmroide Bridge\", in 1638. Similar records show that the current stone bridge was erected in 1684 by Timothy Wadsworth, at a cost of \u00a350. The current bridge was constructed in two parts (and now consists of four extensions). The original packhorse style bridge in 1638, and on the upstream side, the bridge was widened and two extra arches on the south end were added to ease the gradient, although the two new arches were considerably smaller, the bridge now consists of four arches in total. In the 19th century, with shops being constructed on the north end riverbank, and a new premises being built for the Mytholmroyd Co-Operative Society right up to the water's edge on the south bank, two of the bridge's arches are mostly hidden. However, the premises were built with a large opening underneath the buildings, allowing floodwater to still pass through the two hidden arches underground. Mytholmroyd Bridge was eventually taken over by West Riding County Council, which gives the historic bridge its present name of \"County Bridge\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sunderland|first1=M.|title=It's water under the bridge!|date=December 2003|page=40}}</ref>\n\n====Railway station and viaduct====\nA prominent viaduct lies above the southern end of Mytholmroyd town centre. It was erected in 1840 by George Stephenson and is still in use as part of the modern day [[Calder Valley Line]]. In the 1850s, [[Mytholmroyd railway station]] was built, consisting of two platforms built on the Mytholmroyd Viaduct, and a three-storey ticket office, waiting hall and entrance stairwell, leading unto the viaduct. This later closed and the platforms were built a matter of yards up the track on land, and is now accessed by open staircases and long access ramps up the steep banking, where flowers and displays are maintained by the Mytholmroyd Station Partnership.\n\n====Dusty Miller Inn====\nThis late 18th century pub replaced an earlier inn on the opposite side of the road, where Bridge End cottages now stand. The earlier building was home to the Cragg Coiners in 1769. The current [[Listed building|Grade II-listed]] inn comprises a hotel, bar and restaurant. The premises were severely damaged in the 2012 and 2015 flooding, causing the business to close for repairs. The bar re-opened in April 2016 and was awarded the \"pub of the season award\" for summer 2016 by the local [[Campaign for real ale|CAMRA]] branch.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://hxcalderdalecamra.org.uk/content/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CalderCask-Issue39-web.pdf |title=Pub of the Season, Summer 2016: The Dusty Miller |page=9 |work=CalderCask |issue=39 |publisher=Halifax and Calderdale branch of the [[Campaign for real ale|CAMRA]] |accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> {{As of|February 2017}} the hotel and restaurant are yet to re-open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustymillerinn.co.uk/ |title=The Dusty Miller Inn |accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Redacre House====\nRedacre House, off Burnley Road, dates from the late 16th century, and is probably the earliest house in Calderdale exhibiting an F-plan formed by the projecting two-storey porch and crosswing.<ref name=\"MCAA3\"/>\n\n==Mytholmroyd today==\nMytholmroyd now is a designated conservation area, with more than 21 listed buildings in the centre alone. The village is located approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} from the centre of [[Hebden Bridge]], and is often known to locals as 'Royd'. The population is roughly 4,000. The village holds markets, performances at the St. Michael's Enterprise Centre, antique shows and fairs, together with events at the sports and leisure centre and at the Ted Hughes Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mytholmroyd.net/news/114.html|title=The Mytholmroyd Net  Ted Hughes Memorial at Calder High School|author=|date=|work=Mytholmroyd.net|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Mytholmroyd has business parks and a high street in the centre with mainly independent shops including a post office, hardware shop, travel centre, launderette, hair salons and takeaways. There are also many eating venues including Aux Delices Bistro & Wine Bar, the Blue Teapot bistro, Riverside Cafe, the Shoulder of Mutton and more. There is a medical complex including a dental practice, pharmacy, and GP.\n\nThe village is currently (2017/18) under development with the [[Environment Agency]]'s Mytholmroyd Flood Alleviation Scheme. This includes raising the height of flood walls on the banks of the River Calder and Cragg Brook, as well as demolishing homes and businesses on the Calder's banks to widen the river. The village's post office has been relocated to flood-proof premises, with other buildings being stabilised and strengthened. Caldene Bridge, upstream from County Bridge, is being demolished and relocated as well as the bridge at Greenhill Industrial Estate.\n\n==Flooding==\n\n===2020===\nOn 9 February 2020, [[Storm Ciara]] caused a month-and-a-half's worth of rain to fall on Mytholmroyd within 24 hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-51442199|title=Calder Valley assesses Storm Ciara flood damage|date=10 February 2020|accessdate=14 February 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/gallery/mytholmroyd-flooding-pictures-after-storm-17725741|title=Mytholmroyd flooding in pictures after Storm Ciara batters region|first=Ian|last=Hughes|date=10 February 2020|work=Huddersfield Examiner|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===2015===\nMytholmroyd was severely affected by the [[2015\u201316 Great Britain and Ireland floods|Boxing Day floods in 2015]], when the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]] and the canal both rose to cover the valley floor, and consequently the town centre of Mytholmroyd. It was the highest ever recorded river level. Hundreds of homes and businesses were devastated, with some buildings still empty in 2017. The row of shops north of County Bridge partially collapsed into the river, and \u00a310 million was earmarked for future protection of the village.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/525893/Mytholmroyd_Action_Plan_FINAL.pdf|title=Mytholmroyd Flood Alleviation Scheme|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=assets.publishing.service.gov.uk - Environment Agency|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> The whole row of shops which partially collapsed have been fully demolished, along with homes along the riverbank at Calder Grove.

This was a repeat of another flash flood of June, in the same year, where more than 50&nbsp;mm of rain fell causing the River Calder to burst its banks. More than 5,000 properties were severely damaged in the [[Upper Calder Valley]]; many businesses lost insurance and consequently many never recovered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===1954===\nOn Saturday, 21 August 1954, almost 8 years since the devastating 1946 flood, a flash flood devastated the village once again; the river rose by more than 6&nbsp;ft in less than two hours, with flood water entering properties at over 2&nbsp;ft every 15 minutes. The Dusty Miller Inn had almost 4&nbsp;ft of water in its bar area. Flood alleviation works in the 1960s uncovered that County Bridge was standing on foundations untouched since the wooden bridge 17th century, so as part of the works the bridge's foundations were quickly filled with concrete.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===1946===\nIn the worst flooding to ever affect the village, many properties suffered flood water up to the second storey, and the village remained underwater for almost 12 hours. Two shops on Burnley Road collapsed into the river, shops just doors down from the buildings that collapsed in the 2015 flood. By 8 am, flood waters reached up to 7 feet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===1837===\nA disastrous flood occurred in 1837; few details are known about it, although it is known that the river reached the height of the canal, built on the hillside, and ultimately overflowed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eyeoncalderdale.com/it-s-water-under-the-bridge-mytholmroyd-1946|title=Eye On Calderdale|author=|date=|work=EyeOnCalderdale.com|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mytholmroyd, St Michael's Church - geograph.org.uk - 2051499.jpg|St. Michael's Church, Mythomroyd\nFile:Elphin Brook and railway viaduct, Mytholmroyd - geograph.org.uk - 267863.jpg|Elphin Brook passing under the [[Caldervale Line]] railway viaduct\nFile:New Lane, Mytholmroyd (7th November 2010).jpg|New Road passing under the [[Caldervale Line]] railway viaduct\nFile:Drinking Fountain, Cragg Road, Mytholmroyd - geograph.org.uk - 1462296.jpg|Drinking fountain, off Cragg Road\nFile:Gorillas next to the Rochdale Canal - geograph.org.uk - 103684.jpg|Gorillas next to the Rochdale Canal\nFile:Last colours of autumn, Mytholmroyd (7th November 2010).jpg|Last colours of autumn, Mytholmroyd (7 November 2010)\n</gallery>\n\n==Education==\nMytholmroyd is the home of [[Calder High School]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calderlearningtrust.com/|title=Home - Calder High|publisher=Calder Learning Trust|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref> the largest Comprehensive School in the [[Upper Calder Valley]].
