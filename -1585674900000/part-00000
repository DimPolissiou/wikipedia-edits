The front side of each banknote features prominent people along with buildings, and events in the country's history while the reverse side depicts landmarks and animals.\n\n==History==\nOn May 1, 1852, the first commercial bank of the Philippines, [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino de Isabel II]] issued the following denominations initially 10, 25, 50 and 200 pesos fuertes (strong pesos). They were used until 1896.\n\n===First Philippine Republic===\nThe [[First Philippine Republic|revolutionary republic]] of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] ordered the issuance of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100-peso banknotes which were signed by Messrs. [[Pedro A. Paterno]], Telesforo Chuidan and Mariano Limjap to avoid counterfeiting. However, only the 1 and 5-peso banknotes have been printed and circulated to some areas by the end of the short-lived First Republic.\n\n===American Period===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 175\n | footer = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] design proof (top) and issued note (bottom) of the 1924 Philippine one peso.

In 1908, the [[El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino]] was allowed to print banknotes in the following denominations with text in Spanish: Cinco (5), Diez (10), Veinte (20), Cincuenta (50), Cien (100) and Dos Cientos (200) Pesos. In 1912, the bank was renamed [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI) and henceforth issued the same banknotes in English.\n\nIn 1918, the Silver Certificates were replaced by the Treasury Certificates issued with government-backing of bonds issued by the United States Government in the following denominations: One, Two, Five, Ten, Twenty, Fifty, One Hundred and Five Hundred Pesos. In 1916, the [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB) was created to administer the state-holding shares and print banknotes without any quota from the [[Philippine Assembly]]. They printed banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. During World War I, the PNB issued emergency notes printed on cardboard paper in the following denominations: 10, 20, 50 centavos and 1 peso. Also overprinted BPI Notes in Five, Ten and Twenty Pesos due to the lack of currency.\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] issued Treasury Certificates with the seal of the new government but still circulated the BPI and PNB banknotes.\n\n===Japanese government-issued Philippine peso===\n{{main|Japanese government-issued Philippine peso}}\n\n====1942 series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:175px;\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px; \"| Value\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Issue date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Series\n|-\n\n|[[File:PHI-102b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Centavo (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|1 centavo\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-103b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|5 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-104b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|10 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-105b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-50 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|50 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-106-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Peso (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|1 peso\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-107A-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Pesos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|5 pesos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-108-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Pesos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|10 pesos\n|1942\n|First\n|}\n\n====1943-1945 series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:175px;\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px; \"| Value\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Issue date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Series\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-109-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Peso (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|1 peso\n|1943\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-110-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Pesos (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|5 pesos\n|1943\n|Second \n|-\n|[[File:PHI-111-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Pesos (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|10 pesos\n|1943\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-112-Japanese Government (Philippines)-100 Pesos (1944).jpg|175px]]\n|100 pesos\n|1944\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-114-Japanese Government (Philippines)-500 Pesos (1944).jpg|175px]]\n|500 pesos\n|1944\n|Second \n|-\n|[[File:PHI-115-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1000 Pesos (1945).jpg|175px]]\n|1,000 pesos\n|1945\n|Second \n|-\n|}\n\n==Banknotes issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas==\n===\"VICTORY-CBP\" banknotes===\nThe banknotes first issued by today's [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (formerly the \"Central Bank of the Philippines\") were the VICTORY-CBP Overprints in 1949, which were merely overprints of older American-era banknotes.

The following months, a new 10-peso banknote with the face of [[Apolinario Mabini]]. In March 3, 1986, a new 20-peso banknote appeared. After the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]]<ref name= \"EDSA 1986-a\"/><ref name= \"EDSA 1986-b\">{{cite web|url=http://xiaochua.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/41-nararamdaman-mong-kapatid-mo-ang-kapwa-mo-pilipino.jpg?w=500|title=People Power Revolution 1986}}</ref> and the new [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] was promulgated, the Central Bank issued a new 50, 100- and for the second time a new 500-peso banknote with the face of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]]. In 1991, the Central Bank issued for the first time a new 1000-peso banknote, containing the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]] and [[Vicente Lim]].\n\nAfter the passage of the New Central Bank Act of 1993, the ''New Design Series'', which was initiated in 1985, was slightly changed because of the new seal of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In 1998, the 100,000-peso Centennial banknote, measuring 8.5\"x14\", accredited by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's largest legal tender note. It was issued in very limited quantity during the celebration of the Centennial of Philippine Independence. In 2001, the Bangko Sentral issued upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes with new hi-tech security features to combat counterfeiting. During the Estrada Administration, the practice in use since the Commonwealth, of reproducing the signature of the [[President of the Philippines]] over the legend \"President of the Philippines\" was abandoned in favor of explicitly stating the president's name.  In 2002, the Bangko Sentral issued a new 200-peso banknote with the security features found on the upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes and has the face of former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. His daughter, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], is at the back of the 200-peso banknote which showed her being sworn into office at the [[EDSA Shrine]]. She is the first president whose image has been included in a banknote while in office since emergency currency was issued by various provincial currency boards during World War II.\n\nThe series was renamed the '''BSP Series''' in 1993 when the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] was reestablished as the central monetary authority.\n\nThe '''New Design Series''' had less security features. (only the visible fibers, value panel, security thread and watermark.)\n\nOn July 8, 2009, the BSP announced that it would recall all bank notes made of abaca cotton soon and replace it with an all-polymer series. However, this is still in the planning stage, with no specific date set for printing and replacements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2009/07/09/484627/bangko-sentral-may-issue-polymer-money|title=Bangko Sentral may issue polymer money {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe '''BSP Series''' added more security features such as another glossy security thread, iridescent strip, fluorescent printing, optically variable ink, and microprints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philmoney.blogspot.com/search/label/Security%20Features |title=Security Features in Present Money |publisher=Philmoney.blogspot.com |date=2004-02-27 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>\n\nThese banknotes were legal tender alongside the ''New Generation Currency'' series until the end of 2015, when the ''New Generation Currency'' series became a single circulating set.<ref name=abs_dm_2016>{{cite web|title=Still hanging on to your old peso bills?

This color was changed by the printers to account for practical printing concerns. The designers further explains that printing banknotes is not like printing brochures. Due to the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] and limited printing capability of banknote printers, it can only produce a limited full color reproduction.\n\nThe alleged mislocation of the Tubbataha Reef on the one thousand peso note was due to a security feature, a smaller version of the featured species on the bills' reverse (which is also featured on all banknote denominations) was located on top of the exact location of the Tubbataha Reef on the map. Giving the option of either moving the key security feature on the standard position or locating the Tubbataha marker correctly, the bills' French printers, [[Oberthur Technologies]], decided to move the reef marker slightly south on the Philippine map.<ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view The peso\u2019s makeover from an insider\u2019s view ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206122807/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view |date=February 6, 2015 }}, Daxim Lucas, [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], January 1, 2011</ref>\n\n==Higher denominations==\n[[File:Php bill 2000.jpg|thumb|Philippine Centennial led by [[Fidel V.

[[Pedro A. Paterno]], Telesforo Chuidan and Mariano Limjap to avoid counterfeiting. However, only the 1 and 5-peso banknotes have been printed and circulated to some areas by the end of the short-lived First Republic.\n\n===American Period===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 175\n | footer = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] design proof (top) and issued note (bottom) of the 1924 Philippine one peso.

In 1908, the [[El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino]] was allowed to print banknotes in the following denominations with text in Spanish: Cinco (5), Diez (10), Veinte (20), Cincuenta (50), Cien (100) and Dos Cientos (200) Pesos. In 1912, the bank was renamed [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI) and henceforth issued the same banknotes in English.\n\nIn 1918, the Silver Certificates were replaced by the Treasury Certificates issued with government-backing of bonds issued by the United States Government in the following denominations: One, Two, Five, Ten, Twenty, Fifty, One Hundred and Five Hundred Pesos. In 1916, the [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB) was created to administer the state-holding shares and print banknotes without any quota from the [[Philippine Assembly]]. They printed banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. During World War I, the PNB issued emergency notes printed on cardboard paper in the following denominations: 10, 20, 50 centavos and 1 peso. Also overprinted BPI Notes in Five, Ten and Twenty Pesos due to the lack of currency.\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] issued Treasury Certificates with the seal of the new government but still circulated the BPI and PNB banknotes.\n\n===Japanese government-issued Philippine peso===\n{{main|Japanese government-issued Philippine peso}}\n\n====1942 series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:175px;\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px; \"| Value\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Issue date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Series\n|-\n\n|[[File:PHI-102b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Centavo (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|1 centavo\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-103b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|5 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-104b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|10 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-105b-Japanese Government (Philippines)-50 Centavos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|50 centavos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-106-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Peso (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|1 peso\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-107A-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Pesos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|5 pesos\n|1942\n|First\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-108-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Pesos (1942).jpg|175px]]\n|10 pesos\n|1942\n|First\n|}\n\n====1943-1945 series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:175px;\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px; \"| Value\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Issue date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Series\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-109-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1 Peso (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|1 peso\n|1943\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-110-Japanese Government (Philippines)-5 Pesos (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|5 pesos\n|1943\n|Second \n|-\n|[[File:PHI-111-Japanese Government (Philippines)-10 Pesos (1943).jpg|175px]]\n|10 pesos\n|1943\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-112-Japanese Government (Philippines)-100 Pesos (1944).jpg|175px]]\n|100 pesos\n|1944\n|Second\n|-\n|[[File:PHI-114-Japanese Government (Philippines)-500 Pesos (1944).jpg|175px]]\n|500 pesos\n|1944\n|Second \n|-\n|[[File:PHI-115-Japanese Government (Philippines)-1000 Pesos (1945).jpg|175px]]\n|1,000 pesos\n|1945\n|Second \n|-\n|}\n\n==Banknotes issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas==\n===\"VICTORY-CBP\" banknotes===\nThe banknotes first issued by today's [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (formerly the \"Central Bank of the Philippines\") were the VICTORY-CBP Overprints in 1949, which were merely overprints of older American-era banknotes.

In 1991, the Central Bank issued for the first time a new 1000-peso banknote, containing the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]] and [[Vicente Lim]].\n\nAfter the passage of the New Central Bank Act of 1993, the ''New Design Series'', which was initiated in 1985, was slightly changed because of the new seal of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In 1998, the 100,000-peso Centennial banknote, measuring 8.5\"x14\", accredited by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's largest legal tender note. It was issued in very limited quantity during the celebration of the Centennial of Philippine Independence. In 2001, the Bangko Sentral issued upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes with new hi-tech security features to combat counterfeiting. During the Estrada Administration, the practice in use since the Commonwealth, of reproducing the signature of the [[President of the Philippines]] over the legend \"President of the Philippines\" was abandoned in favor of explicitly stating the president's name.  In 2002, the Bangko Sentral issued a new 200-peso banknote with the security features found on the upgraded 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes and has the face of former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. His daughter, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], is at the back of the 200-peso banknote which showed her being sworn into office at the [[EDSA Shrine]]. She is the first president whose image has been included in a banknote while in office since emergency currency was issued by various provincial currency boards during World War II.\n\nThe series was renamed the '''BSP Series''' in 1993 when the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] was reestablished as the central monetary authority.\n\nThe '''New Design Series''' had less security features. (only the visible fibers, value panel, security thread and watermark.)\n\nOn July 8, 2009, the BSP announced that it would recall all bank notes made of abaca cotton soon and replace it with an all-polymer series. However, this is still in the planning stage, with no specific date set for printing and replacements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2009/07/09/484627/bangko-sentral-may-issue-polymer-money|title=Bangko Sentral may issue polymer money {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe '''BSP Series''' added more security features such as another glossy security thread, iridescent strip, fluorescent printing, optically variable ink, and microprints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philmoney.blogspot.com/search/label/Security%20Features |title=Security Features in Present Money |publisher=Philmoney.blogspot.com |date=2004-02-27 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>\n\nThese banknotes were legal tender alongside the ''New Generation Currency'' series until the end of 2015, when the ''New Generation Currency'' series became a single circulating set.<ref name=abs_dm_2016>{{cite web|title=Still hanging on to your old peso bills?

This color was changed by the printers to account for practical printing concerns. The designers further explains that printing banknotes is not like printing brochures. Due to the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] and limited printing capability of banknote printers, it can only produce a limited full color reproduction.\n\nThe alleged mislocation of the Tubbataha Reef on the one thousand peso note was due to a security feature, a smaller version of the featured species on the bills' reverse (which is also featured on all banknote denominations) was located on top of the exact location of the Tubbataha Reef on the map. Giving the option of either moving the key security feature on the standard position or locating the Tubbataha marker correctly, the bills' French printers, [[Oberthur Technologies]], decided to move the reef marker slightly south on the Philippine map.<ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view The peso\u2019s makeover from an insider\u2019s view ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206122807/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20110101-312041/The-pesos-makeover-from-an-insiders-view |date=February 6, 2015 }}, Daxim Lucas, [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], January 1, 2011</ref>\n\n==Higher denominations==\n[[File:Php bill 2000.jpg|thumb|Philippine Centennial led by [[Fidel V.

Another version, with the same design but measured at 160 x 66&nbsp;mm, was also planned to be issued as legal tender in 2001, but due to the ouster of President Joseph Estrada as the result of the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|Second EDSA revolution (EDSA People Power II)]], the notes were stored in the vaults of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

According to the ''Chronicles of Ayutthaya'', [[Sanpet III|King Ekathotsarot]] (r. 1605\u20131610) had been \"concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,\" and was \"greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations,\" especially [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[Philippines]].\n\nAyutthaya was under almost constant [[Burmese\u2013Siamese wars|Burmese threat]] from the 16th century onward, and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the [[Myanmar|Burmese]], but the [[Sino-Burmese War]]s ended in complete failure and Ayutthaya fell in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)]]. However, the Chinese efforts did divert the attention of Burma's Siam army. General [[Taksin]], himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, took advantage of this to organize his force and attack the Burmese invaders. When he became king, Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers mainly from [[Chaozhou]] prefecture came to Siam in large numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blood Brothers: The Criminal Underworld of Asia|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|isbn=1-4039-6154-9|page=234|author-link=Bertil Lintner|year=2003}}</ref> Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910. By 1932, approximately 12.2 percent of the population of Thailand was Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Short History of China and Southeast Asia: Tribute, Trade and Influence|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|isbn=1-86448-954-5|page=126|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe early Chinese immigration consisted almost entirely of men who did not bring women. Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called ''Sino-Thai''<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Thailand|author=Smith Nieminen Win|isbn=0-8108-5396-5|page=231|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|edition=2nd}}</ref> or ''luk-jin'' (\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19) in Thai.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Place of Origins: Modernity and Its Mediums in Northern Thailand|author= Rosalind C.

If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the \"[[tax farming]]\" system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues.\n\nIn the late 19th century, when Thailand was struggling to defend its independence from the colonial powers, Chinese bandits from Yunnan Province began making raids into the country in the [[Haw Wars]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e0f\u0e2e\u0e48\u0e2d}}). Thai nationalist attitudes at all levels were thus colored by anti-Chinese sentiment. Members of the Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese entered the country per year from [[southern China]] which was vulnerable to [[flood]]s and [[drought]], mostly settling in [[Bangkok]] and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Siam]]. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad laborers and [[rickshaw]] pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations,  both domestically and internationally.<ref name=\"Sowell 1997 182\u2013184\"/> However, [[republicanism|republican]] ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'' was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated [[Chinese school]]s even before [[compulsory education]] was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918.

The present Thai royal family, the [[Chakri dynasty]], was founded by King [[Rama I]] who himself was partly Chinese. His predecessor, King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]], was the son of a Thai mother and a Chinese immigrant from [[Guangdong]] Province. With the highly successful integration of historic Chinese immigrant communities throughout Thailand, a significant number of Thai Chinese are the descendants of intermarriages between ethnic Chinese and native Thais.

According to the ''Chronicles of Ayutthaya'', [[Sanpet III|King Ekathotsarot]] (r. 1605\u20131610) had been \"concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,\" and was \"greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations,\" especially [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[Philippines]].\n\nAyutthaya was under almost constant [[Burmese\u2013Siamese wars|Burmese threat]] from the 16th century onward, and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the [[Myanmar|Burmese]], but the [[Sino-Burmese War]]s ended in complete failure and Ayutthaya fell in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)]]. However, the Chinese efforts did divert the attention of Burma's Siam army. General [[Taksin]], himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, took advantage of this to organize his force and attack the Burmese invaders. When he became king, Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers mainly from [[Chaozhou]] prefecture came to Siam in large numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blood Brothers: The Criminal Underworld of Asia|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|isbn=1-4039-6154-9|page=234|author-link=Bertil Lintner|year=2003}}</ref> Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910. By 1932, approximately 12.2 percent of the population of Thailand was Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Short History of China and Southeast Asia: Tribute, Trade and Influence|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|isbn=1-86448-954-5|page=126|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe early Chinese immigration consisted almost entirely of men who did not bring women. Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called ''Sino-Thai''<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Thailand|author=Smith Nieminen Win|isbn=0-8108-5396-5|page=231|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|edition=2nd}}</ref> or ''luk-jin'' (\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19) in Thai.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Place of Origins: Modernity and Its Mediums in Northern Thailand|author= Rosalind C.

If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the \"[[tax farming]]\" system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues.\n\nIn the late 19th century, when Thailand was struggling to defend its independence from the colonial powers, Chinese bandits from Yunnan Province began making raids into the country in the [[Haw Wars]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e0f\u0e2e\u0e48\u0e2d}}). Thai nationalist attitudes at all levels were thus colored by anti-Chinese sentiment. Members of the Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese entered the country per year from [[southern China]] which was vulnerable to [[flood]]s and [[drought]], mostly settling in [[Bangkok]] and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Siam]]. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad laborers and [[rickshaw]] pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations,  both domestically and internationally.<ref name=\"Sowell 1997 182\u2013184\"/> However, [[republicanism|republican]] ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'' was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated [[Chinese school]]s even before [[compulsory education]] was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918. This act required all foreign teachers to pass a [[Thai language]] test and for principals of all schools to implement standards set by the Thai [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"W\">{{cite news|title=Contending for a Claim on Civilization: The Sino-Siamese Struggle to Control Overseas Chinese Education in Siam|first=Wasana|last=Wongsurawat|journal=Journal of Chinese Overseas|volume=4|number=2| date=November 2008 |pages=161\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nLegislation by King [[Vajiravudh|Rama VI (1910\u20131925)]] that required the adoption of Thai surnames was largely directed at the Chinese community as a number of ethnic Chinese families left [[Burma]] between 1930 and 1950 and settled in the [[Ratchaburi Province|Ratchaburi]] and [[Kanchanaburi Province]]s of western Thailand. A few of the ethnic Chinese families in that area had already emigrated from Burma in the 19th century.\n\nThe Chinese in Thailand also suffered discrimination between the 1930s to 1950s under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (in spite of having part-Chinese ancestry himself),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of South-East Asia|last=Leifer|first=Michael|year=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-13821-3|page=204}}</ref> which allied itself with the [[Empire of Japan]].

His college career for the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Cougars]] included three trips to the [[Final Four]]. Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the [[1984 NBA draft]], a draft that included [[Michael Jordan]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[John Stockton]]. He combined with the 7&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (2.24&nbsp;m) [[Ralph Sampson]] to form a duo dubbed the \"Twin Towers\". The two led the Rockets to the [[1986 NBA Finals]], where they lost in six games to the [[Boston Celtics]]. After Sampson was traded to the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets' undisputed leader. He led the league in [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] twice (1989, 1990) and [[Block (basketball)|blocks]] three times (1990, 1991, 1993).\n\nDespite very nearly being traded during a bitter contract dispute before the 1992\u201393 season, he remained in Houston where in 1993\u201394, he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], and [[NBA Finals MVP|Finals MVP]] awards in the same season. His Rockets won back-to-back championships against the [[New York Knicks]] (avenging his college championship loss to [[Patrick Ewing]]), and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s Orlando Magic. In 1996, Olajuwon was a member of the Olympic gold-medal-winning [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national team]], and was selected as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]]. He ended his career as [[List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders|the league's all-time leader]] in [[block (basketball)|blocks]] (3,830) and is one of four NBA players to record a [[quadruple-double]].\n\n==Early life==\nHakeem Olajuwon was born to Salim and Abike Olajuwon, working class [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] owners of a cement business in Lagos.<ref name=\"nbabio\">[http://www.nba.com/history/players/olajuwon_bio.html Hakeem Olajuwon], nba.com/history, accessed January 3, 2007.</ref><ref>Olajuwon and Knobler.

Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's [[1981\u201382 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], played games every off season with several NBA players at the [[Fonde|Fonde Recreation Center]]. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: \"The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best.\"<ref name=\"Kunta\"/>\n\nOlajuwon returned from that summer a different player. He and his teammates (including [[Clyde Drexler]]) formed what was dubbed \"Phi Slama Jama\", the first slam-dunking \"fraternity\", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive [[NCAA Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA championship games]], where they lost to [[1982\u201383 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|North Carolina State]] on a last second tip-in in 1983 and a [[Patrick Ewing]]-led [[1983\u201384 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] team in 1984.

Drexler departed for the NBA in 1983, leaving Olajuwon the lone star on the team.\n\nAfter the 1983\u201384 season, Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the [[NBA Draft Lottery]] was introduced in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: \"I really believed that Houston was going to win the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early).\"<ref name=\"nbatv\"/> His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars [[Michael Jordan]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[John Stockton]], and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the [[1984 NBA draft]].\n\nIn his autobiography, ''Living the Dream'', Olajuwon mentions an intriguing draft trade offered to the Rockets that would have sent Clyde Drexler and the number two pick in the 1984 NBA draft from Portland in exchange for [[Ralph Sampson]].<ref name=\"smith\">Smith, Sam.

Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don't have a [[pivot foot]]. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don't have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn't know which way I'm going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn't know where you're gonna turn and when.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=SLAM 147: Hall of Famer and low-post wizard Hakeem Olajuwon is happy to share his knowledge with today's stars.|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2011/03/masterpiece-theater/|publisher=SLAM Online|accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOlajuwon married his current wife, Dalia Asafi, on August 8, 1996, in Houston.<ref name=\"nba.com/rockets\">[http://www.nba.com/rockets/hakeem_tribute/hakeem_encyclopediaNO.html Hakeem Tribute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201082415/http://www.nba.com/rockets/hakeem_tribute/hakeem_encyclopediaNO.html |date=February 1, 2015 }}, nba.com/rockets, accessed January 3, 2007.</ref> They have two daughters, Rahmah and Aisha Olajuwon.

His college career for the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Cougars]] included three trips to the [[Final Four]]. Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the [[1984 NBA draft]], a draft that included [[Michael Jordan]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[John Stockton]]. He combined with the 7&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (2.24&nbsp;m) [[Ralph Sampson]] to form a duo dubbed the \"Twin Towers\". The two led the Rockets to the [[1986 NBA Finals]], where they lost in six games to the [[Boston Celtics]]. After Sampson was traded to the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets' undisputed leader.

His Rockets won back-to-back championships against the [[New York Knicks]] (avenging his college championship loss to [[Patrick Ewing]]), and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s Orlando Magic. In 1996, Olajuwon was a member of the Olympic gold-medal-winning [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national team]], and was selected as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]].

Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's [[1981\u201382 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], played games every off season with several NBA players at the [[Fonde|Fonde Recreation Center]]. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: \"The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best.\"<ref name=\"Kunta\"/>\n\nOlajuwon returned from that summer a different player. He and his teammates (including [[Clyde Drexler]]) formed what was dubbed \"Phi Slama Jama\", the first slam-dunking \"fraternity\", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive [[NCAA Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA championship games]], where they lost to [[1982\u201383 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|North Carolina State]] on a last second tip-in in 1983 and a [[Patrick Ewing]]-led [[1983\u201384 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] team in 1984.

Drexler departed for the NBA in 1983, leaving Olajuwon the lone star on the team.\n\nAfter the 1983\u201384 season, Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the [[NBA Draft Lottery]] was introduced in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: \"I really believed that Houston was going to win the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early).\"<ref name=\"nbatv\"/> His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the [[Portland Trail Blazers]].

But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I'm gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don't know that where I'm going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can't react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don't have a [[pivot foot]]. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don't have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn't know which way I'm going to go. That is the shake.

While Olajuwon never expressed an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, \"For a big man who is just big, maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, make it easier for the entire team.\" He runs the camp for free.<ref name= \"Blinebury\">Blinebury, Fran.

The domination and control of the [Afghan] empire began to loosen in 1762 when Ahmad Shah Durrani crossed Afghanistan to subdue the Sikhs, followers of an indigenous monotheistic religion of India found in the 16th century by Guru Nanak. (...) Ahmad Shah greatly desired to subdue the Sikhs, and his army attacked and gained control of the Sikh's holy city of Amritsar, where he brutally massacred thousands of Sikh followers. Not only did he viciously demolish the sacred temples and buildings, but he ordered these holy places to be covered with cow's blood as an insult and desecration of their religion (...)\"</ref>\n\nThe Golden Temple was the center of historic events in Sikh history:{{sfn|Pardeep Singh Arshi|1989|pp=22\u201325}}{{sfn|Trudy Ring|Noelle Watson|Paul Schellinger|2012|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n* In 1709, the governor of Lahore sent in his army to suppress and prevent the Sikhs from gathering for their festivals of [[Vaisakhi]] and Divali. But the Sikhs defied by gathering in the Golden Temple. In 1716, Banda Singh and numerous Sikhs were arrested and executed.\n* In 1737, the Mughal governor ordered the capture of the custodian of the Golden Temple named Mani Singh and executed him. He appointed Masse Khan as the police commissioner who then occupied the Temple and converted it into his entertainment center with dancing girls. He befouled the pool. Sikhs avenged the sacrilege of the Golden Temple by assassinating Masse Khan inside the Temple in August 1740.\n* In 1746, another Lahore official Diwan Lakhpat Rai working for Yahiya Khan, and seeking revenge for the death of his brother, filled the pool with sand. In 1749, Sikhs restored the pool when Muin ul-Mulk slackened Mughal operations against Sikhs and sought their help during his operations in Multan.\n* In 1757, the Afghan ruler [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], also known as Ahmad Shah Abdali, attacked Amritsar and desecrated the Golden Temple. He had waste poured into the pool along with entrails of slaughtered cows, before departing for Afghanistan. The Sikhs restored it again.\n* In 1762, Ahmad Shah Durrani returned and had the Golden Temple blown up with gunpowder. Sikhs returned and celebrated Divali in its premises. In 1764, Baba [[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]] collected donations to rebuild the Golden Temple. A new main gateway (Darshani Deorhi), causeway and sanctum were completed in 1776, while the floor around the pool was completed in 1784. The Sikhs also completed a canal to bring in fresh water from [[Ravi River]] for the pool.\n\n===Ranjit Singh era reconstruction===\n[[File:1880 photograph of the Golden Temple, Darbar Sahib, sacred pool and nearby buildings, Amritsar.jpg|thumb|An 1880 photograph of the Golden Temple, sacred pool and the nearby buildings.
