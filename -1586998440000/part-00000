This attempt, however, was met with limited success by the fact that the coalition's pro-[[LGBT]] rights platform failed to appeal to working class and economically left-leaning Poles, which tend to favour a more [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] policy (especially as both economically interventionist and social conservative positions were already being provided by the right-wing [[PiS]] party). At the same time, the more liberally-oriented city-dwelling population, which could favour the party's proposed [[Social Progressivism|socially progressive]] policies, found little appeal in the party's platform of [[economic interventionism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-parliament-polish-socialists-election-left-alliance-spring-razem-a9113881.html|title=Socialists set to make comeback in Polish elections next month|date=2019-09-21|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ips-journal.eu/regions/europe/article/show/lewica-a-united-polish-left-3741/|title=Lewica: a united Polish left|website=www.ips-journal.eu|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://krytykapolityczna.pl/file/sites/4/2017/10/Political-cynicism-Resume-in-English.pdf|title=POLITICAL CYNICISM: The Case of Poland|last=SADURA|first=Przemys\u0142aw|last2=SIERAKOWSKI|first2=S\u0142awomir|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nDespite this, some sociologists deem that the unification of the parties could lead to an overall mobilization of leftist voters,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-opposition-idUSKCN1UD2H6|title=Poland's fragmented opposition coalesces into left, center blocs|date=2019-07-18|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-10-16|language=en}}</ref> which could now feel that their vote for the coalition wouldn't be wasted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-parliament-polish-socialists-election-left-alliance-spring-razem-a9113881.html|title=Socialists set to make comeback in Polish elections next month|date=2019-09-21|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> In addition, the party's platform, which differs greatly from the platforms of the other major Polish political parties, has managed to find some support among disillusioned secular voters, which don't identify with any political force or even with the left, but instead desire \"something new\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/04/30/what-are-the-prospects-for-the-polish-left/|title=What are the prospects for the Polish left?|last=Szczerbiak|first=Aleks|last2=|first2=|date=2018-04-30|website=[[London School of Economics]] series on Evidence-based analysis and commentary on European politics|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18|last3=|last4=|last5=|first5=|last6=|first6=|last7=|first7=}}</ref> \n\nIronically, the party also received a considerable boost in support among older voters after the ruling [[PiS]] party passed a \"degradation law\", which cut retirement pensions and disability benefits for thousands of former bureaucrats during the PPR period, whose main income was now directly threatened by the new government policy.

As a [[comics anthology]] it serialises stories in each issue (known as \"progs\")<ref group=note>Prog: short for \"programme\" as issues are supposedly beamed directly to the printed page.</ref> and was first published by [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]] in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. IPC then shifted the title to its [[Fleetway]] comics subsidiary, which was sold to [[Robert Maxwell]] in 1987 and then to [[Egmont UK]] in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by [[Rebellion Developments]].\n\n''2000 AD'' is most noted for its ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Brian Bolland]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. Other characters in ''2000 AD'' include ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and the ''[[ABC Warriors]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====Pre-publication====\nIn December 1975, [[Kelvin Gosnell]], a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]], read an article in the [[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]] about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films, and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic. IPC asked [[Pat Mills]], a [[freelance]] writer and [[editing|editor]] who had created ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]'' and ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', to develop it. Mills brought fellow freelancer [[John Wagner]] on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters. The then-futuristic name ''2000 AD'' was chosen by the publisher, John Sanders,<ref name=\":0\">Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books).</ref>{{Rp|pp.25\u201326}} as no-one involved expected the comic to last that long. The original logo and overall look of the comic were designed by art assistant Doug Church.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|p.37}}\n\nMills' experiences with ''Battle'' and Action in particular had taught him that readers responded to his [[anti-authoritarian]] attitudes. Wagner, who had written a [[Dirty Harry]]-inspired tough cop called ''[[One-Eyed Jack (comics)|One-Eyed Jack]]'' for ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'', saw that readers also responded to authority figures, and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme, imagining an ultra-violent lawman patrolling a future [[New York City|New York]] with the power to arrest, sentence, and if required execute criminals on the spot. Meanwhile, Mills had developed a [[horror fiction|horror]] strip, inspired by the novels of [[Dennis Wheatley]], about a [[hanging judge]], called ''Judge Dread'' (after the [[reggae]] and [[ska]] artist of the [[Judge Dread|same name]]). The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic, but the name, with a little modification, was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman.\n\nThe task of visualising the newly named ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' was given to [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a Spanish artist who had previously worked with Mills on ''Battle'', on a strip called ''Major Eazy''. Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather, as a suggestion for what the character should look like. Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly, adding body-armour, zips and chains, which Wagner originally thought over the top. Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra, but when the art came back a rethink was necessary. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended, and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future. By this stage, however, Wagner and Ezquerra had both quit.\n\nMills was reluctant to lose ''Judge Dredd'', and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that ''Dredd'' would not be ready for the first issue. The story chosen was one written by freelancer Peter Harris, extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell,<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|pp.70\u201372}}<ref group=note>Harris also wrote two ''Future Shocks'' and one episode of ''M.A.C.H. One''. [http://2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=thrills&Comic=2000AD&Field=Writer&choice=peterha]</ref> and drawn by newcomer [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. The strip debuted in prog 2.\n\nIPC owned the rights to ''[[Dan Dare]]'', and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title. Paul DeSavery, who owned ''Dare'''s film rights, offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake. The deal fell through, however.\n\n====The opening line-up====\n\n''[[Dan Dare]]'' was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic. In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived several centuries in the future. Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist [[Massimo Belardinelli]], whose imaginative, hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens, although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself. The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work, but few ''Dan Dare'' fans remember this version of the character fondly. Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips, with Gibbons drawing ''Dan Dare'' and Belardinelli drawing the ''Harlem Heroes'' sequel ''Inferno''. When Gibbons took over ''Dan Dare'' in prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a \"''Star Trek''\" style space opera.\n\nMills had also created ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', about the future sport of aeroball, a futuristic, violent version of basketball with jet-packs. Similar future sport series had been a fixture of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', and the similarly-themed film [[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]] had been released the previous year. Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look, Mills wanted to use European artists, but the work turned in on ''Harlem Heroes'' by [[Trigo (comics)|Trigo]] was disappointing. Veteran British artists [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] and [[Barrie Mitchell]] were tried out, but the newcomer [[Dave Gibbons]] won the editor over with his dynamic, American-influenced drawings and got the job. Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' writer [[Tom Tully (comic writer)|Tom Tully]].\n\nThe other opening strips were ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', a super-powered secret agent inspired by ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''; ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', about a \"Volgan\" (thinly disguised and originally billed as Soviet, but changed before printing to a \"neutral\" antagonist) invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter Bill Savage; and ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]'', a strip about [[Time travel|time-travelling]] cowboys farming [[dinosaur]]s for their meat.\n\nAfter 16 issues, Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to [[Kelvin Gosnell]], whose idea the comic had been in the first place. Gosnell also appeared as the fall guy in the ''[[Tharg the Mighty]]'' comedy [[Fumetti|photostrips]] that were a feature of the comic in its early years.\n\n====Early years====\nWagner returned to write ''Judge Dredd'', starting in prog 9. His \"[[The Robot Wars|Robot Wars]]\" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists, including McMahon, Ezquerra, Turner and [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]], and marked the point where ''Dredd'' became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished.<ref>Jarman, Colin M. and Peter Acton (1995) ''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'', Lennard Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}, p. 58</ref> Dredd's city, which now covered most of the east coast of North America, became known as [[Mega-City One]]. Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli, but the decision was made to make out that Dredd's face had been scarred and the panel had a 'censored' banner slapped on it. After this, there were no further attempts to show Dredd's face again.\n\nA new story format was introduced in prog 25 \u2013 ''[[Tharg's Future Shocks]]'', one-off twist-in-the-tail stories devised by writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]]. ''2000 AD'' still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent.\n\nWagner introduced a new character, ''[[Robo-Hunter]]'', in 1978. The hero, Sam Slade, was a [[private detective]]-type character specialising in [[robot]]-related cases. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer was the original artist, but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson, who redrew parts of Ferrer's episodes before taking over himself. Gibson's imaginative, cartoony art helped drive the series' style from hard-boiled detective to surreal comedy. As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit-built robot assistant, Hoagy, and after a crack-down on smoking in IPC comics, a [[Cuba]]n robot [[cigar]], Stogie, designed to help him cut down on [[nicotine]].\n\nOther ongoing strips included ''The Visible Man'', detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart, a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste, and ''Shako'', (which followed the same formula as ''Hook Jaw'' from ''Action'' but with less success) the story of a [[polar bear]] pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule.\n\n''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'' was killed off in 1978 but a spin-off, ''M.A.C.H. Zero'', continued into the 1980s. ''Flesh'' had a sequel in 1978, set on the prehistoric oceans, and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel, ''Disaster 1990'', in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice-cap and flooded Britain.\n\nIn 1977 ''2000 AD'' launched the annual 48-page Summer Special, including a full length ''M.A.C.H. Zero'' story drawn by O'Neill. The yearly hardcover annual also started in 1977 and would continue till 1991.\n\nPat Mills took over writing ''Dredd'' for a six-month \"epic\" called \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\", inspired by [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Damnation Alley]]'', which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega-Cities. McMahon drew the bulk of the stories, with occasional episodes drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while ''Dan Dare'' was given the front page.\n\nIPC had launched a second science fiction comic, ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', which was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into ''2000 AD'' from prog 86.<ref>[https://michaelowencarroll.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/eaglution-of-british-comics-part-1/ ''The Eaglution of British Comics''] by Michael Carroll, 26 May 2018. (Retrieved 27 May 2018.)</ref> As Gosnell was editor of ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' at the same time, ''2000 AD'' sub-editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the latter comic himself during this time.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">\"A brief history of Starlord\" from \"Watch the stars!\" website {{cite web|url=http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Starlord |accessdate=10 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128232417/http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 }}</ref> Two ''Starlord'' strips strengthened ''2000 AD'''s line-up: ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[bounty hunter]] created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a robot disaster squad created by Mills. ''Ro-Busters'' gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. ''Strontium Dog'' and ''ABC Warriors'' continued to feature in ''2000 AD'' for the next 40 years. (A third ''Starlord'' series, ''Timequake'', only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) ''Dan Dare'' was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to ''Dredd'' following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane [[Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], based on the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caligula]].\n\nAnother cancelled title, ''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'', was merged with ''2000 AD'' a few months later from prog 127, contributing three stories to ''2000 AD'': ''[[Blackhawk (Tornado)|Blackhawk]]'', an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman Empire which took a science-fictional turn in ''2000 AD'' with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world; ''[[The Mind of Wolfie Smith]]'', a coming of age/psychic story of a runaway teenager, and ''Captain Klep'', a single-page superhero parody. These stories, unlike ''Starlord's'', did not continue for very long.\n\n''2000 AD'' featured an adaptation of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s novel ''[[The Stainless Steel Rat]]'', written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra. Adaptations of two of Harrison's sequels, ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' and ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'', would follow later.   The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on [[James Coburn]], evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for ''[[Major Eazy]]'', which Ezquerra drew in ''Battle,'' as well as ''Cursed Earth Koburn'', a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003. [[Gerry Finley-Day]] contributed ''[[The V.C.s]]'', a future war story inspired by the [[Vietnam War]], drawn by McMahon, [[Cam Kennedy]], [[Garry Leach]] and [[John Richardson (comics)|John Richardson]].\n\nA feature of the early years of ''2000 AD'' was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists: by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Mike McMahon and Kevin O'Neil were all established as regulars.\n\n[[Steve MacManus]] took over from Gosnell as editor in 1978.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980 ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' gained a new enemy. Writer [[John Wagner]] realised that Dredd's habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain. The solution was [[Judge Death]], an undead judge from another dimension where, since all crime was committed by the living, life itself was outlawed. The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world, and now he had come to Mega-City One to continue his work. Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three-parter drawn by [[Brian Bolland]] which also introduced [[Judge Anderson]] and [[Psi Division]], a squad of judges with psychic powers.\n\nDredd soon began another epic journey in \"[[Judge Child|The Judge Child]]\". A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to [[Texas City]], and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised, but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the [[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]], was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, [[Ron Smith (artist)|Ron Smith]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]. The pair would go on to write ''Strontium Dog'', ''Robo-Hunter'' and many other stories for ''2000 AD'', as well as for ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' and the relaunched ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.\n\nWith prog 178 all current stories, with the exception of ''Judge Dredd'', were wound up, and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously, consisting of ''[[Mean Arena]]'', set around a violent high-tech street football game, ''[[Meltdown Man]]'', whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion, the return of ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', featuring a mutant bounty hunter character inherited from the short-lived ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' title, and ''[[Dash Decent]]'', a  ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[parody]].\n\n[[Pat Mills]] introduced ''Comic Rock'', which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music. The first story, inspired by [[The Jam]]'s ''Going Underground'', was drawn by Kevin O'Neill and featured a complicated underground travel network on a planet called \"Termight\", in which a freedom fighter called [[Nemesis the Warlock|Nemesis]] battles the despotic [[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]], chief of the Tube Police. All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle, the Blitzspear. The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O'Neill had done in ''Ro-Busters'', which management objected to.\n\nThe only other ''Comic Rock'' story was a follow-up called \"Killer Watt\", in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a [[Teleportation|teleport]] system. This led to a series, ''Nemesis the Warlock'', in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future, Torquemada was a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens, and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance. Mills and O'Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas, but ultimately O'Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on ''2000 AD'' pay. He left to work for [[DC Comics]] in America, and was replaced on ''Nemesis'' by first [[Jesus Redondo]] and then [[Bryan Talbot]].\n\n''2000 AD'' would occasionally take a gamble on non-science fiction material. For example, ''[[Fiends of the Eastern Front]]'' was a World War II [[vampire]] story by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] which was probably originally intended for ''Battle''. Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his [[Romania]]n allies were vampires. Later in the war, when Romania changed sides, he was the only one who knew their secret.\n\nA readers' poll revealed that future war was a popular topic, so Gerry Finley-Day was asked to come up with a new war story. He, editor [[Steve MacManus]] and artists Dave Gibbons devised ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', a \"[[G.I. (comics)|Genetic Infantryman]]\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him. Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]], [[Brett Ewins]] and  [[Cam Kennedy]]. ''Rogue Trooper'' replaced ''Meltdown Man'', which had recently ended its run.\n\nAnother new strip in 1981, inspired by the brief [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] craze, was ''[[Ace Trucking Co.]]'', a comedy about pointy-headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner, Grant and Belardinelli.\n\nIn the ''Judge Dredd'' series, Mega-City One had grown too large and unwieldy: therefore authors Wagner and Grant they planned to cut it down to size.  \"[[Block Mania]]\", in which wars broke out between rival city-blocks, turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East-Meg One, and led directly to \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", another six-month epic and a hard-hitting satire on the concept of [[Mutually assured destruction]]. East-Meg One, protected by a warp-shield, softened up Mega-City One with nuclear warheads before invading. Dredd spearheaded the resistance, leading a small team to East-Meg territory, hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East-Meg One off the face of the earth. \"The Apocalypse War\" was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra, making a return to the character he created.\n\nA new writer, [[Alan Moore]], had started contributing ''[[Future Shocks]]'' in 1980. He wrote more than fifty one-off strips over the next three years, while also contributing to various [[Marvel UK]] titles and the independent magazine ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. In 1982 he gained his first series, ''[[Skizz]]'', a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', set in [[Birmingham]] and influenced by [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. The series was drawn by [[Jim Baikie]].\n\nMoore wrote another series, ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', spun off from a one-off ''Time Twister''. Drawn by [[Alan Davis]], the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction. He went on to create ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' with artist [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]. Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moore's demands for creator's rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.\n\nA new character, ''[[Sl\u00e1ine (comics)|Sl\u00e1ine]]'', debuted in 1983, but had been in development since 1981. Created by [[Pat Mills]] and his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]], ''Sl\u00e1ine'' was a barbarian [[fantasy]] strip based on [[Celtic mythology]]. Kincaid was a children's book illustrator who had never worked in comics before, and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied. Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon, but these could not see print until Kincaid's episode was ready.\n\nIn 1985, after appearing as a supporting character in ''Judge Dredd'', ''[[Judge Anderson]]'' finally appeared in her own series, written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins. New artist [[Glenn Fabry]] debuted on ''Sl\u00e1ine'', but due to his notorious slowness was rotated with [[David Pugh (comics)|David Pugh]]. In the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#\"Letter From a Democrat\": The martyrdom of Hester Hyman|Letter from a Democrat]]\", Wagner and Grant introduced a pro-democracy movement in Mega-City One, which is after all a [[police state]]. This would provide plotlines for years to come.\n\nIn 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue. A new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, ''Sl\u00e1ine the King'', began, entirely drawn by Fabry. [[Peter Milligan]], a writer who had been contributing ''Future Shocks'', began two series, the bleak future war story ''[[Bad Company (comics)|Bad Company]]'' and a strange, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] series called ''The Dead''. In 1986, ''2000 AD'' was selling  150,000 copies a week.\n\nIn 1987 IPC's comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate [[Robert Maxwell]] as Fleetway. ''2000 AD'' was revamped, with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages. [[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]] became editor. Kevin O'Neill returned for a short ''Nemesis'' series called \"Torquemada the God\". Not long after came the debut of ''[[Zenith (comic)|Zenith]]'', ''2000 AD'''s first serious superhero strip, by new writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Steve Yeowell]]. The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers, caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] elder gods.\n\nWagner and Grant began a new ''Dredd'' Epic, \"[[Oz (Judge Dredd story)|Oz]]\", featuring [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], a popular supporting character. Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously. A legal \"Supersurf\" race was being held in Oz, the future Australia, and Chopper escaped to compete. Dredd also went to Oz, partly to deal with Chopper, but mostly to investigate the [[Judda]], a clone army created by Mega-City One's former chief genetic engineer. The Judda were defeated, and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie. Dredd was waiting at the finish line, but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback. This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant, and was a contributing factor (it was ''[[The Last American]]'', a mini series for [[Epic Comics]] which would mark the end)  in ending their regular writing partnership. Wagner kept ''Dredd'', while Grant continued ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Anderson''. However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations.\n\nThe \"Oz\" storyline had some lasting implications. [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd, was captured by Justice Department, who had plans for him. Chopper also spun off into his own series, written by Wagner and drawn by [[Colin MacNeil]].\n\nThe ''ABC Warriors'' finally had their own series again in 1987 as a spin-off from ''Nemesis''. This was written, as ever, by Pat Mills, and drawn by two artists in rotation, newcomer [[Simon Bisley]] and science fiction artist [[SMS (comics)|S.M.S.]].\n\nIn 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new ''Strontium Dog'' story, \"The Final Solution\". It took nearly two years to complete, and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha, who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination. Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off, and refused to draw it.\n\nThe number of colour pages was increased, allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted. Initially the colour pages were reserved for ''Judge Dredd'', but were later given over to a new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, \"The Horned God\", fully painted by [[Simon Bisley]]. The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels, then as a single volume, and has remained in print ever since.\n\nIn 1989 the colour pages were increased again, allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue. One of the colour series was ''Rogue Trooper: the War Machine'', written by Dave Gibbons and painted by [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]]. The original ''Rogue Trooper'' series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with, though continued with Rogue's adventures on Horst and the 'Hit' series, so Gibbons revamped the concept, creating a different genetic infantryman, [[Friday (2000 AD)|Friday]], in a different war, albeit in the same universe.\n\nOne of the black and white stories, \"[[The Dead Man]]\", was a low-key beginning for a major event. In the Cursed Earth, villagers come across a man, burnt from head to toe, with no memory of who he is or what happened to him. As he tries to piece his memories back together, he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state. A creepy, atmospheric horror-western, it was drawn by [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and written by \"Keef Ripley\", a pseudonym for John Wagner. By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity: he was Judge Dredd.\n\n===1990s===\nAs \"The Dead Man\" ended, a new ''Judge Dredd'' story, \"[[The Dead Man#Tale of the Dead Man|Tale of the Dead Man]]\", explained how Dredd had ended up in that position. Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role, so Justice Department had groomed [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], the former Judda cloned from his bloodline, to replace him. Kraken was now ready for his final assessment, and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him. Although Kraken performed faultlessly, Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him, and failed him. He then resigned as a judge and took the '[[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]' into the Cursed Earth. There he met the Sisters of Death, and only barely survived the encounter. This could mean only one thing: Judge Death was back.\n\nThis set up the latest six-month epic, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\". After Dredd had left, Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test, and given him Dredd's badge. But the Sisters of Death, spirit beings from Judge Death's dimension, were able to use Kraken's inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to. The Sisters possessed all the city's judges and began to enforce Death's twisted law. Out in the Cursed Earth, Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges. He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city. The judges won, by a small margin on a desultory turnout, and Dredd was satisfied.\n\n''2000 AD'' gained an influx of talent from other comics. [[Garth Ennis]] and [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] had come to prominence writing for ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a ''2000 AD'' spin-off for older readers, while artists [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Philip Bond]] were the stars of ''[[Deadline magazine|Deadline]]'', an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by [[Steve Dillon]] and [[Brett Ewins]]. Smith created ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', a multi-dimensional organisation that polices reality, whose most memorable story was \"Killing Time\", a [[time travel]] story featuring [[Jack the Ripper]]. [[Garth Ennis]] and Philip Bond contributed ''Time Flies'', a time-travel comedy, and Hewlett was paired with writer [[Peter Milligan]] for the surreal ''[[Hewligan's Haircut]]''. Writer [[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] and artist [[Simon Jacob]] created ''[[Armoured Gideon]]'', an action-comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth.\n\nThe ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', a monthly title set in the world of Dredd, was launched in October 1990. With John Wagner focusing his attentions there, Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly.\n\nAmerican writer [[Michael Fleisher]], who had written ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'' and ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' in the 1970s, was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new ''Rogue Trooper'', along with several other strips, none of which went down very well. Another new writer who failed to set ''2000 AD'' on fire was [[Mark Millar]], whose revival of ''Robo-Hunter'' was particularly unpopular. Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American [[superhero]] comics such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]''.\n\n''2000 AD'' went all-colour about this time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in response to a short-lived new colour weekly, ''[[Toxic!]]'', launched by Pat Mills and many of the core ''2000 AD'' team of creators. ''Toxic!'' only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for ''2000 AD''. ''[[Button Man]]'', a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and [[Arthur Ranson]], was originally intended for ''Toxic!'' but ended up in ''2000 AD''.\n\nA new ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series, written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by [[Kev Walker]], began in 1991, in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his \"Khaos\" philosophy.\n\nRobert Maxwell died in late 1991, and Fleetway was merged with London Editions, a Danish-owned company which owned rights to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, to become Fleetway Editions.\n\nIn 1992, ''2000 AD'' and the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' ran their first crossover story, \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", in which [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]s overran Mega-City One. Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, [[Peter Doherty (comics)|Peter Doherty]], [[Dean Ormston]] and [[Chris Cunningham|Chris Halls]], the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel. John Smith and artist [[Paul Marshall (comics)|Paul Marshall]] created ''[[Firekind]]'', a slow-paced story about dragons and alien societies, which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order.\n\nThe ''Strontium Dog'' world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field, gaining the plural name ''Strontium Dogs'' \u2013 characters such as female vampire [[Durham Red]], the albino Feral Jackson, and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk \u2013 the latter, normally a timid creature with weak 'heartses', became a gung-ho action character upon learning of Alpha's death. However, in the 12-parter ''The Darkest Star'', it transpires that the one to ''actually'' kill him was the Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.\n\n{{anchor|Summer Offensive}}<!-- [[Summer Offensive (comics)]] links here -->\nThe \"Summer Offensive\" was an eight-week experiment in 1993, when new editor [[Alan McKenzie]] gave free rein to writers [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and John Smith, to a mixed reception. Morrison wrote a Dredd story, \"Inferno\", and a drug-influenced comedy adventure, ''[[Really & Truly]]''. Smith contributed ''[[Slaughterbowl]]'', in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport, with the survivor being paroled for a year and granted wealth \u2013 but being forced to enter the Slaughterbowl again the next year. Millar wrote ''[[Maniac 5]]'', an action-packed series about a remote controlled war-robot. During this run was a satire of British [[tabloid newspaper|tabloid]] attitudes titled ''[[Big Dave (comics)|Big Dave]]'', written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]].\n\n[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] became editor in 1994, and a second crossover between ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine'', \"[[Mechanismo|Wilderlands]]\", began. Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra, [[Mick Austin]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]], it followed on from \"Mechanismo\", a series of stories in the ''Megazine'' in which Justice Department, opposed by Dredd, tried to introduce robot judges. With Wagner writing, ''Judge Dredd'' was again the flagship strip.\n\nFormer ''Megazine'' editor [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became editor of the weekly in 1996 but sales continued to decline. Unsuccessful series were dropped, and a number of new series were tried out, some more successful than others. Writer [[Dan Abnett]] introduced ''[[Sinister Dexter]]'' in 1996, a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which became a regular feature. In 1997, writer [[Robbie Morrison]] and artist [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]], who had worked with Bishop on the ''Megazine'', created ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'', a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies' man who discovers he's the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty. There were also gimmicks, like the \"sex issue\", sold in a clear plastic wrapper, ''[[The Spacegirls]]'', a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the [[Spice Girls]], ''[[M.A.C.H. 1|B.L.A.I.R. 1]]'', a parody of [[Tony Blair]] based on ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', and an adaptation of the [[Danny Boyle]] film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]''.\n\nA new ''Dredd'' epic, \"[[The Doomsday Scenario|Doomsday]]\", appeared in 1999 and again ran in both ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine''. Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years, introducing the main villain, semi-robotic gang lord Nero Narcos, and supporting characters like [[Judge Edgar]] of the Public Surveillance Unit, and [[Galen DeMarco]], a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye.\n\n1999 also saw the return of another character, ''Nemesis the Warlock''. After a break of ten years, writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with \"The Final Conflict\". The series was drawn by [[Henry Flint]] in a style that recalled Kevin O'Neill's early work on the series, as well as Simon Bisley's ''ABC Warriors'' work.\n\nThe decade ended with a special 100-page issue called \"Prog 2000\". Behind a cover by Brian Bolland, ''Nemesis'' wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O'Neill. War broke out in ''Nikolai Dante'', and writer [[Gordon Rennie]] and artist [[Mark Harrison (artist)|Mark Harrison]] introduced future war story ''Glimmer Rats''. Another old favourite, ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra, telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death, with the conceit that previous stories had been \"folklore\" and the new stories were \"what really happened\", allowing Wagner to revise continuity.\n\n===2000s===\nThe publisher has been owned by [[Rebellion Developments]] since 2000, with editors [[Andy Diggle]] and [[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]] at the helm. Rebellion continues to develop stories (and computer games) based on classic characters such as ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'', and has also introduced a roster of new series including ''[[Shakara]]'', ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and ''[[Caballistics, Inc.]]''. It has also published a tie-in to the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' in a story written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nThe comic continues to uncover new British talents, including [[Boo Cook]], [[Dom Reardon]] and [[Al Ewing]]. It has also benefited from an improved dollar-pound [[exchange rate]] that has meant the comic can now afford to re-employ some of the talent thought lost to America.\n\nA number of shorter self-contained stories, partly created by the new wave of talent, have run including ''[[London Falling]]'', ''[[Stone Island (2000AD)|Stone Island]]'' and ''[[Zombo (comics)|Zombo]]''. Other developments include a revamping of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' which has included a section acting as a showcase for [[British small press comics]]. Starting in program 1500 was the Judge Dredd story \"The Connection\", a 'prelude' to a 23-part Judge Dredd epic \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd's past.\n\nIn prog 1526,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=prog&page=profiles&choice=1526 |title=Prog 1526 |publisher=2000ad.org |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> dated 28 February 2007, ''2000 AD'' celebrated their 30th anniversary.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6390731.stm 30 years of the future], [[BBC]], 26 February 2007</ref> The issue saw the start of two new storylines: ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'' (by [[Robbie Morrison]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]) and ''[[Invasion!

In the same year, former editor Steve MacManus published his memoirs.\n\nIn 2017, founding editor Pat Mills published his memoirs, ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History''. Later in that year, [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette Partworks]] began publishing ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'', an 80-volume fortnightly series of hardback books featuring classic stories from the first 40 years of the comic. This followed the success of ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', which had started in 2015 and later been extended to 90 volumes.\n\nIn June 2018 (July in the United States) a special issue was published, the ''2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018'', which contained stories written and illustrated entirely by women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/20/the-futures-female-2000ads-all-women-special \"The future's female? 2000AD's all-women special\"], by David Barnett, in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 June 2018.</ref>\n\n==Lists of stories==\n{{Main|List of 2000 AD stories}}\n*A complete index of stories published in ''2000 AD'' from February 1977 to December 2019 (#1 to #2162) is [[Media:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]] (WikiCommons).<ref>[[commons:File:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n*A more detailed list of all the ''Judge Dredd'' stories to appear in ''2000 AD'' (including specials and annuals) from March 1977 to December 2019 can be found [[Media:Dredd2AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]].<ref>[[commons:File:Dredd2AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n\n==Crossovers==\n{{main|2000 AD crossovers}}\nAlthough there is no overall [[shared universe]] containing all ''2000 AD'' stories, some stories [[2000 AD crossovers|spin-off or crossover]] into other stories. These include the numerous stories that occur in the [[Judge Dredd|Judge Dredd universe]]. Many stories by [[Pat Mills]], which are frequently interlinked, link into the Dredd universe as well, though have been partially [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by the writer. Many stories written by [[Ian Edginton]] feature shared themes and references.\n\n==Editors==\n{{Main|Tharg the Mighty}}\nA long-running theme is that the [[editing|editor]] of ''2000 AD'' is [[Tharg the Mighty]], a green [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from [[Betelgeuse]] who terms his readers \"Earthlets\". Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips. Readers sometimes play along with this; for example, in prog 201 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called \"Terrans\"; the resulting controversy ended in Tharg allowing readers to vote for the preferred term in prog 229.  In prog 240 Tharg announced that the result was a draw, and \"Terran\" became an accepted term for readers' letters in the Nerve Centre.  In similar vein, Tharg used to draw distinction between male and female letter-writers with \"Eathlet\" and \"Earthlette\" until a letter was printed in Prog 314 complaining about the use, and Tharg agreed to use \"Earthlet\" (or \"Terran\") regardless of gender.  From prog 531 the term \"Earthlette\" was reintroduced.<ref>Prog 531, 18 July 1987 \u2013 \"Earthlette H Maton\"</ref>\n\nAnother running theme is Tharg's use of [[robot]]s to draw and write the strips, which bear a marked resemblance to the actual writers and artists. A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots \"went on strike\" (reflecting real-life [[industrial action]] that occasionally halted IPC's comics production during the 1970s and 1980s). Tharg wrote and drew a whole issue himself, but when he ran it through the quality-control \"Thrill-meter\", the device melted down on extreme overload. The offending issue had to be taken away, by blindfolded security guards, to a lead-lined vault where there was no danger of anyone seeing it accidentally.\n<section begin=tharg />\nThe role of Tharg has been performed by the following editors:\n\n#[[Pat Mills]], #1\u201316 (1977)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=patm Pat Mills] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Kelvin Gosnell]], #17\u201385 (1977\u20131978)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=KELVING Kelvin Gosnell] at 2000ad.org</ref><br/>Assistant editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the comic himself in 1978 while Gosnell was occupied with editing new sister title ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]''.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\"/>\n#[[Steve MacManus]], #86\u2013519 (1978\u20131987)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=STEVEM Steve MacManus] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]], #520\u2013872 (1987\u20131994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=RICHARDB Richard Burton] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Alan McKenzie]], #873\u2013914 (1994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ALANMC Alan McKenzie] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]], #915\u2013977 (1994\u20131996)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=JOHNT John Tomlinson] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]], #978\u20131199 (1996\u20132000)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=DAVEB David Bishop (writer)|] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Andy Diggle]], #1200\u20131273 (2000\u20132002)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ANDYD Andy Diggle] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]], #1274\u2013present (2002\u2013present)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=MATTS Matt Smith] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n<section end=tharg />\n\n==Contributors==\n[[File:Drandquinch.jpg|thumb|200px|''D.R and Quinch'', art by [[Alan Davis]].]]\nWell known contributors to ''2000 AD'' include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[Nick Abadzis]]\n* [[Dan Abnett]]\n* [[Massimo Belardinelli]]\n* [[Simon Bisley]]\n* [[Brian Bolland]]\n* [[Philip Bond]]\n* [[Chris Cunningham]]\n* [[Alan Davis]]\n* [[Steve Dillon]]\n* [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]]\n* [[Ian Edginton]]\n* [[Garth Ennis]]\n* [[Al Ewing]]\n* [[Carlos Ezquerra]]\n* [[Gerry Finley-Day]]\n* [[Michael Fleisher]]\n* [[Henry Flint]]\n* [[Tom Frame (letterer)|Tom Frame]]\n* [[Neil Gaiman]]\n* [[Dave Gibbons]]\n* [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]\n* [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]\n* [[Trevor Hairsine]]\n* [[Jamie Hewlett]]\n* [[John Hicklenton]]\n* [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]\n* [[David Hine]]\n* [[Frazer Irving]]\n* [[Jock (comics)|Jock]]\n* [[Cam Kennedy]]\n* [[Brendan McCarthy]]\n* [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]\n* [[Mark Millar]]\n* [[Peter Milligan]]\n* [[Pat Mills]]\n* [[Alan Moore]]\n* [[Grant Morrison]]\n* [[Robbie Morrison]]\n* [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]\n* [[Arthur Ranson]]\n* [[Gordon Rennie]]\n* [[John Ridgway (comics)|John Ridgway]]\n* [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]]\n* [[Ron Smith (comics)|Ron Smith]]\n* [[Simon Spurrier]]\n* [[Richard Starkings]]\n* [[Bryan Talbot]]\n* [[John Wagner]]\n* [[Kev Walker]]\n* [[Chris Weston]]\n{{colend}}\nMany of these have since moved on to work for American publishers such as [[DC Comics]] (especially the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] and [[Wildstorm]] imprints) and [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Film and TV adaptations==\n* ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Dredd]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Rogue Trooper#Film|Rogue Trooper]]'' (TBA)<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=McMillan|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/duncan-jones-teases-rogue-trooper-movie-1127099|title=Duncan Jones Teases 'Rogue Trooper' Movie|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=15 July 2018|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>\n*''[[Judge Dredd#Television|Judge Dredd: Mega-City One]] (TBA)\n\n==Video game adaptations==\n2000AD video games for 8-bit computers include games based on [[Strontium Dog]] by [[Quicksilva]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984, ''Nemesis the Warlock'' and ''Sl\u00e1ine'' by [[Martech]] in 1987, ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' written by [[Design Design]] / published by ''Piranha'' in 1986 and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in 1990, all released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] platforms.

to ''2000 AD'' is the monthly  ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', which originally focused exclusively on expanding the world of Judge Dredd, but in recent years has expanded its focus to include other stories set in other universes as well.\n* The bimonthly ''2000 AD Extreme Edition'' presented reprints of classic and hard-to-find 2000AD stories, but poor sales led to its cancellation in mid-2008. Since the cancellation, a smaller reprint supplement has been packaged with the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' instead.\n*''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' was a weekly title (originally intended to be monthly) launched in 1978 following much the same format as ''2000 AD'' and included ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' which introduced characters that would later reappear in ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. The two titles were merged later the same year and published as ''2000AD and Starlord''. A third ''Starlord'' series, ''TimeQuake'', also had a 4-week run in ''2000AD'' over a year later.\n*''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'' was a weekly title launched in 1979. There was less emphasis on Science Fiction series. It was merged with ''2000 AD'' after 22 issues, transferring the strips ''[[Blackhawk (UK comic)|Blackhawk]]'', ''The Mind of Wolfie Smith'' and ''Captain Klep''. For a while the publication was titled ''2000 AD and Tornado''.\n*''[[Diceman (comics)|Diceman]]'' was an early attempt at creating a [[role-playing]] comic featuring regular ''2000 AD'' characters such as Rogue Trooper and Slaine, as well as original characters, like Diceman. The magazine was not a success and only lasted five issues.\n*''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' (1988\u20131991) was a sister publication that did not follow the format of ''2000 AD'', but did share many editorial staff and creative teams. Early issues featured two SF-themed stories aimed at a slightly older age group than ''2000 AD'' with strong political themes. It became a magnet for British creators who wanted to create comics for the adult market. The ''2000 AD'' series ''Finn'', begun the year after ''Crisis'' was cancelled, continued the adventures of the character from ''Third World War'', though with more of a fantasy emphasis.\n*''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]'' (1990\u20131991) joined ''Crisis'' though it only lasted for seven issues. Dan Dare was in the original line-up, and this transferred to ''Crisis'' when ''Revolver'' finished.\n*''[[Toxic!]]'' was a short-lived rival publication, established by ''2000 AD'' talent, that was published during 1991.\n*A ''Best of 2000 AD'' title was published in the mid-1980s which featured reprint material from early issues of ''2000 AD''. In the early 1990s, ''The Complete Judge Dredd'' began publication in a similar format. Both titles were relaunched as ''Classic 2000AD'' and ''Classic Judge Dredd'' in the mid-1990s but were cancelled soon after.\n*A yearly hardcover annual was published from 1977 to 1990 (though the cover dates on the annuals were always the following year). From 1991 this was replaced by a softcover ''2000AD Yearbook''; the last of these was published in 1994. There were also annuals/yearbooks dedicated to ''2000 AD'' characters such as ''Dan Dare'' (1978\u20131979, cover dated 1979\u20131980), ''Judge Dredd'' (1980\u20131994) and ''Rogue Trooper'' (1990).\n* An annual summer special was published during the summer months between 1977 and 1996, entitled the ''2000AD Sci-Fi Special'' from 1978. This was revived in 2014.\n* Other specials include the ''2000AD Winter Special'' (1988\u20131995, 2005 and 2014), ''Judge Dredd Mega Special'' (1988\u20131996) and ''Rogue Trooper Action Special'' (1996). (1996's ''Judge Dredd Action Special'' was a tie-in to the defunct ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'' rather than ''2000AD'' proper).\n* In April 1992, a ''2000AD Action Special'' featured six strips reviving classic British comics characters such as the [[Steel Claw]]. Of these only ''Kelly's Eye'' also appeared in ''2000 AD'' proper.\n* In the mid-1990s a series of ''2000 AD Poster Progs'' were published, each featuring a new strip. There were five ''Judge Dredd'' poster magazines, plus one each for four other ''2000 AD'' series: ''Nemesis the Warlock'', ''Strontium Dogs'', ''Sl\u00e1ine'' and ''Rogue Trooper''.\n* A series of American comic format reprints started in 1983 by [[Eagle Comics]] with the first issue of an ongoing monthly ''Judge Dredd'' title. Eagle Comics also reprinted other ''2000 AD'' material in other titles. The license to reprint ''2000 AD'' material in the US was later taken over by [[Quality Communications|Quality Comics]]. These reprints ended in the early 1990s.\n\n===Fanzines===\n''2000 AD'' has an extremely lively and thriving [[Fan (aficionado)|fanbase]], which has produced a number of independent [[fanzine]]s.\n\nBetween 1994\u201396, \"Fear The Badge\" was an erstwhile but overly ambitious attempt at a ''2000 AD'' fanzine based around the Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Robo-hunter universes. With original artwork, stories and articles, the fanzine would act as a showcase for talent wanting to break into comics.\nIts editor/creator, Paul Dick, partially disabled himself, wanted to donate some of the zine's profits to a different disability charity each month. However, the fanzine's genesis was plagued by bad luck, not least of all Dick's health worsening. Despite the good intentions and hardwork of its creator (as well as the keen interest and support from both amateur and professional ''2000 AD'' contributors), the fanzine's full potential sadly never was realised. Only a dummy run of 50 copies of issue 1 were ever produced.\n\nIn 1998 W.R. Logan, frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic's publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents, decided to create an independent title using ''2000 AD'' copyrighted characters and situations. This was titled ''[[Class of '79]]'', named after the year of Dredd's graduation from the Academy of Law \u2013 2079. The first couple of issues contained work from now-professional comics creators [[Rufus Dayglo]], [[Boo Cook]], [[Henry Flint]] and [[PJ Holden]] and won the best Self Published/Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards.\n\nIn 2001, [[Andrew J. Lewis (comics)|Andrew J. Lewis]] created ''[[Zarjaz]]'' comic, with strips featuring characters from a variety of ''2000 AD'' stories. There were also interviews with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], [[Frazer Irving]] and [[Alan Moore]], as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer.\n\nAnother long-running fanzine, dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha, is ''[[Dogbreath]]'', originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing. In 2003, [[Arthur Wyatt (comics)|Arthur Wyatt]] created ''[[FutureQuake]]'', a fanzine devoted to the [[Future Shocks]] format. Although ''Class of '79'' now appears to be on hiatus, all three of the other titles are in continuous publication, ''Zarjaz'' having started up again with a new issue 1.\n\nIn addition, a number of [[British small press comics|small press]] comics have emerged from the ''2000 AD'' fanbase, including ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Omnivistascope'' and ''[[The End Is Nigh]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2000 AD stories]]\n*[[List of minor 2000 AD stories]]\n*''[[Action (comic)|Action]]''\n*[[British comics]]\n*[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]], which saw a number of ''2000 AD'' artists and writers working for the big American firms during the 1980s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] (2002\u20132003), ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]!''

As a [[comics anthology]] it serialises stories in each issue (known as \"progs\")<ref group=note>Prog: short for \"programme\" as issues are supposedly beamed directly to the printed page.</ref> and was first published by [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]] in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. IPC then shifted the title to its [[Fleetway]] comics subsidiary, which was sold to [[Robert Maxwell]] in 1987 and then to [[Egmont UK]] in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by [[Rebellion Developments]].\n\n''2000 AD'' is most noted for its ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Brian Bolland]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. Other characters in ''2000 AD'' include ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and the ''[[ABC Warriors]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====Pre-publication====\nIn December 1975, [[Kelvin Gosnell]], a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]], read an article in the [[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]] about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films, and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic. IPC asked [[Pat Mills]], a [[freelance]] writer and [[editing|editor]] who had created ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]'' and ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', to develop it. Mills brought fellow freelancer [[John Wagner]] on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters. The then-futuristic name ''2000 AD'' was chosen by the publisher, John Sanders,<ref name=\":0\">Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books).</ref>{{Rp|pp.25\u201326}} as no-one involved expected the comic to last that long. The original logo and overall look of the comic were designed by art assistant Doug Church.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|p.37}}\n\nMills' experiences with ''Battle'' and Action in particular had taught him that readers responded to his [[anti-authoritarian]] attitudes. Wagner, who had written a [[Dirty Harry]]-inspired tough cop called ''[[One-Eyed Jack (comics)|One-Eyed Jack]]'' for ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'', saw that readers also responded to authority figures, and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme, imagining an ultra-violent lawman patrolling a future [[New York City|New York]] with the power to arrest, sentence, and if required execute criminals on the spot. Meanwhile, Mills had developed a [[horror fiction|horror]] strip, inspired by the novels of [[Dennis Wheatley]], about a [[hanging judge]], called ''Judge Dread'' (after the [[reggae]] and [[ska]] artist of the [[Judge Dread|same name]]). The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic, but the name, with a little modification, was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman.\n\nThe task of visualising the newly named ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' was given to [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a Spanish artist who had previously worked with Mills on ''Battle'', on a strip called ''Major Eazy''. Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather, as a suggestion for what the character should look like. Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly, adding body-armour, zips and chains, which Wagner originally thought over the top. Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra, but when the art came back a rethink was necessary. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended, and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future. By this stage, however, Wagner and Ezquerra had both quit.\n\nMills was reluctant to lose ''Judge Dredd'', and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that ''Dredd'' would not be ready for the first issue. The story chosen was one written by freelancer Peter Harris, extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell,<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|pp.70\u201372}}<ref group=note>Harris also wrote two ''Future Shocks'' and one episode of ''M.A.C.H. One''. [http://2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=thrills&Comic=2000AD&Field=Writer&choice=peterha]</ref> and drawn by newcomer [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. The strip debuted in prog 2.\n\nIPC owned the rights to ''[[Dan Dare]]'', and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title. Paul DeSavery, who owned ''Dare'''s film rights, offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake. The deal fell through, however.\n\n====The opening line-up====\n\n''[[Dan Dare]]'' was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic. In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived several centuries in the future. Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist [[Massimo Belardinelli]], whose imaginative, hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens, although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself. The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work, but few ''Dan Dare'' fans remember this version of the character fondly. Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips, with Gibbons drawing ''Dan Dare'' and Belardinelli drawing the ''Harlem Heroes'' sequel ''Inferno''. When Gibbons took over ''Dan Dare'' in prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a \"''Star Trek''\" style space opera.\n\nMills had also created ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', about the future sport of aeroball, a futuristic, violent version of basketball with jet-packs. Similar future sport series had been a fixture of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', and the similarly-themed film [[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]] had been released the previous year. Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look, Mills wanted to use European artists, but the work turned in on ''Harlem Heroes'' by [[Trigo (comics)|Trigo]] was disappointing. Veteran British artists [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] and [[Barrie Mitchell]] were tried out, but the newcomer [[Dave Gibbons]] won the editor over with his dynamic, American-influenced drawings and got the job. Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' writer [[Tom Tully (comic writer)|Tom Tully]].\n\nThe other opening strips were ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', a super-powered secret agent inspired by ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''; ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', about a \"Volgan\" (thinly disguised and originally billed as Soviet, but changed before printing to a \"neutral\" antagonist) invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter Bill Savage; and ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]'', a strip about [[Time travel|time-travelling]] cowboys farming [[dinosaur]]s for their meat.\n\nAfter 16 issues, Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to [[Kelvin Gosnell]], whose idea the comic had been in the first place. Gosnell also appeared as the fall guy in the ''[[Tharg the Mighty]]'' comedy [[Fumetti|photostrips]] that were a feature of the comic in its early years.\n\n====Early years====\nWagner returned to write ''Judge Dredd'', starting in prog 9. His \"[[The Robot Wars|Robot Wars]]\" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists, including McMahon, Ezquerra, Turner and [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]], and marked the point where ''Dredd'' became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished.<ref>Jarman, Colin M. and Peter Acton (1995) ''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'', Lennard Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}, p. 58</ref> Dredd's city, which now covered most of the east coast of North America, became known as [[Mega-City One]]. Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli, but the decision was made to make out that Dredd's face had been scarred and the panel had a 'censored' banner slapped on it. After this, there were no further attempts to show Dredd's face again.\n\nA new story format was introduced in prog 25 \u2013 ''[[Tharg's Future Shocks]]'', one-off twist-in-the-tail stories devised by writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]]. ''2000 AD'' still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent.\n\nWagner introduced a new character, ''[[Robo-Hunter]]'', in 1978. The hero, Sam Slade, was a [[private detective]]-type character specialising in [[robot]]-related cases. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer was the original artist, but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson, who redrew parts of Ferrer's episodes before taking over himself. Gibson's imaginative, cartoony art helped drive the series' style from hard-boiled detective to surreal comedy. As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit-built robot assistant, Hoagy, and after a crack-down on smoking in IPC comics, a [[Cuba]]n robot [[cigar]], Stogie, designed to help him cut down on [[nicotine]].\n\nOther ongoing strips included ''The Visible Man'', detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart, a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste, and ''Shako'', (which followed the same formula as ''Hook Jaw'' from ''Action'' but with less success) the story of a [[polar bear]] pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule.\n\n''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'' was killed off in 1978 but a spin-off, ''M.A.C.H. Zero'', continued into the 1980s. ''Flesh'' had a sequel in 1978, set on the prehistoric oceans, and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel, ''Disaster 1990'', in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice-cap and flooded Britain.\n\nIn 1977 ''2000 AD'' launched the annual 48-page Summer Special, including a full length ''M.A.C.H. Zero'' story drawn by O'Neill. The yearly hardcover annual also started in 1977 and would continue till 1991.\n\nPat Mills took over writing ''Dredd'' for a six-month \"epic\" called \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\", inspired by [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Damnation Alley]]'', which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega-Cities. McMahon drew the bulk of the stories, with occasional episodes drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while ''Dan Dare'' was given the front page.\n\nIPC had launched a second science fiction comic, ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', which was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into ''2000 AD'' from prog 86.<ref>[https://michaelowencarroll.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/eaglution-of-british-comics-part-1/ ''The Eaglution of British Comics''] by Michael Carroll, 26 May 2018. (Retrieved 27 May 2018.)</ref> As Gosnell was editor of ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' at the same time, ''2000 AD'' sub-editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the latter comic himself during this time.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">\"A brief history of Starlord\" from \"Watch the stars!\" website {{cite web|url=http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Starlord |accessdate=10 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128232417/http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 }}</ref> Two ''Starlord'' strips strengthened ''2000 AD'''s line-up: ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[bounty hunter]] created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a robot disaster squad created by Mills. ''Ro-Busters'' gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. ''Strontium Dog'' and ''ABC Warriors'' continued to feature in ''2000 AD'' for the next 40 years. (A third ''Starlord'' series, ''Timequake'', only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) ''Dan Dare'' was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to ''Dredd'' following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane [[Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], based on the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caligula]].\n\nAnother cancelled title, ''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'', was merged with ''2000 AD'' a few months later from prog 127, contributing three stories to ''2000 AD'': ''[[Blackhawk (Tornado)|Blackhawk]]'', an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman Empire which took a science-fictional turn in ''2000 AD'' with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world; ''[[The Mind of Wolfie Smith]]'', a coming of age/psychic story of a runaway teenager, and ''Captain Klep'', a single-page superhero parody. These stories, unlike ''Starlord's'', did not continue for very long.\n\n''2000 AD'' featured an adaptation of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s novel ''[[The Stainless Steel Rat]]'', written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra. Adaptations of two of Harrison's sequels, ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' and ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'', would follow later.   The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on [[James Coburn]], evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for ''[[Major Eazy]]'', which Ezquerra drew in ''Battle,'' as well as ''Cursed Earth Koburn'', a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003. [[Gerry Finley-Day]] contributed ''[[The V.C.s]]'', a future war story inspired by the [[Vietnam War]], drawn by McMahon, [[Cam Kennedy]], [[Garry Leach]] and [[John Richardson (comics)|John Richardson]].\n\nA feature of the early years of ''2000 AD'' was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists: by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Mike McMahon and Kevin O'Neil were all established as regulars.\n\n[[Steve MacManus]] took over from Gosnell as editor in 1978.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980 ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' gained a new enemy. Writer [[John Wagner]] realised that Dredd's habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain. The solution was [[Judge Death]], an undead judge from another dimension where, since all crime was committed by the living, life itself was outlawed. The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world, and now he had come to Mega-City One to continue his work. Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three-parter drawn by [[Brian Bolland]] which also introduced [[Judge Anderson]] and [[Psi Division]], a squad of judges with psychic powers.\n\nDredd soon began another epic journey in \"[[Judge Child|The Judge Child]]\". A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to [[Texas City]], and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised, but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the [[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]], was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, [[Ron Smith (artist)|Ron Smith]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]. The pair would go on to write ''Strontium Dog'', ''Robo-Hunter'' and many other stories for ''2000 AD'', as well as for ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' and the relaunched ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.\n\nWith prog 178 all current stories, with the exception of ''Judge Dredd'', were wound up, and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously, consisting of ''[[Mean Arena]]'', set around a violent high-tech street football game, ''[[Meltdown Man]]'', whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion, the return of ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', featuring a mutant bounty hunter character inherited from the short-lived ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' title, and ''[[Dash Decent]]'', a  ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[parody]].\n\n[[Pat Mills]] introduced ''Comic Rock'', which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music. The first story, inspired by [[The Jam]]'s ''Going Underground'', was drawn by Kevin O'Neill and featured a complicated underground travel network on a planet called \"Termight\", in which a freedom fighter called [[Nemesis the Warlock|Nemesis]] battles the despotic [[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]], chief of the Tube Police. All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle, the Blitzspear. The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O'Neill had done in ''Ro-Busters'', which management objected to.\n\nThe only other ''Comic Rock'' story was a follow-up called \"Killer Watt\", in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a [[Teleportation|teleport]] system. This led to a series, ''Nemesis the Warlock'', in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future, Torquemada was a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens, and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance. Mills and O'Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas, but ultimately O'Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on ''2000 AD'' pay. He left to work for [[DC Comics]] in America, and was replaced on ''Nemesis'' by first [[Jesus Redondo]] and then [[Bryan Talbot]].\n\n''2000 AD'' would occasionally take a gamble on non-science fiction material. For example, ''[[Fiends of the Eastern Front]]'' was a World War II [[vampire]] story by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] which was probably originally intended for ''Battle''. Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his [[Romania]]n allies were vampires. Later in the war, when Romania changed sides, he was the only one who knew their secret.\n\nA readers' poll revealed that future war was a popular topic, so Gerry Finley-Day was asked to come up with a new war story. He, editor [[Steve MacManus]] and artists Dave Gibbons devised ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', a \"[[G.I. (comics)|Genetic Infantryman]]\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him. Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]], [[Brett Ewins]] and  [[Cam Kennedy]]. ''Rogue Trooper'' replaced ''Meltdown Man'', which had recently ended its run.\n\nAnother new strip in 1981, inspired by the brief [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] craze, was ''[[Ace Trucking Co.]]'', a comedy about pointy-headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner, Grant and Belardinelli.\n\nIn the ''Judge Dredd'' series, Mega-City One had grown too large and unwieldy: therefore authors Wagner and Grant they planned to cut it down to size.  \"[[Block Mania]]\", in which wars broke out between rival city-blocks, turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East-Meg One, and led directly to \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", another six-month epic and a hard-hitting satire on the concept of [[Mutually assured destruction]]. East-Meg One, protected by a warp-shield, softened up Mega-City One with nuclear warheads before invading. Dredd spearheaded the resistance, leading a small team to East-Meg territory, hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East-Meg One off the face of the earth. \"The Apocalypse War\" was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra, making a return to the character he created.\n\nA new writer, [[Alan Moore]], had started contributing ''[[Future Shocks]]'' in 1980. He wrote more than fifty one-off strips over the next three years, while also contributing to various [[Marvel UK]] titles and the independent magazine ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. In 1982 he gained his first series, ''[[Skizz]]'', a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', set in [[Birmingham]] and influenced by [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. The series was drawn by [[Jim Baikie]].\n\nMoore wrote another series, ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', spun off from a one-off ''Time Twister''. Drawn by [[Alan Davis]], the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction. He went on to create ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' with artist [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]. Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moore's demands for creator's rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.\n\nA new character, ''[[Sl\u00e1ine (comics)|Sl\u00e1ine]]'', debuted in 1983, but had been in development since 1981. Created by [[Pat Mills]] and his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]], ''Sl\u00e1ine'' was a barbarian [[fantasy]] strip based on [[Celtic mythology]]. Kincaid was a children's book illustrator who had never worked in comics before, and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied. Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon, but these could not see print until Kincaid's episode was ready.\n\nIn 1985, after appearing as a supporting character in ''Judge Dredd'', ''[[Judge Anderson]]'' finally appeared in her own series, written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins. New artist [[Glenn Fabry]] debuted on ''Sl\u00e1ine'', but due to his notorious slowness was rotated with [[David Pugh (comics)|David Pugh]]. In the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#\"Letter From a Democrat\": The martyrdom of Hester Hyman|Letter from a Democrat]]\", Wagner and Grant introduced a pro-democracy movement in Mega-City One, which is after all a [[police state]]. This would provide plotlines for years to come.\n\nIn 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue. A new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, ''Sl\u00e1ine the King'', began, entirely drawn by Fabry. [[Peter Milligan]], a writer who had been contributing ''Future Shocks'', began two series, the bleak future war story ''[[Bad Company (comics)|Bad Company]]'' and a strange, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] series called ''The Dead''. In 1986, ''2000 AD'' was selling  150,000 copies a week.\n\nIn 1987 IPC's comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate [[Robert Maxwell]] as Fleetway. ''2000 AD'' was revamped, with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages. [[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]] became editor. Kevin O'Neill returned for a short ''Nemesis'' series called \"Torquemada the God\". Not long after came the debut of ''[[Zenith (comic)|Zenith]]'', ''2000 AD'''s first serious superhero strip, by new writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Steve Yeowell]]. The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers, caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] elder gods.\n\nWagner and Grant began a new ''Dredd'' Epic, \"[[Oz (Judge Dredd story)|Oz]]\", featuring [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], a popular supporting character. Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously. A legal \"Supersurf\" race was being held in Oz, the future Australia, and Chopper escaped to compete. Dredd also went to Oz, partly to deal with Chopper, but mostly to investigate the [[Judda]], a clone army created by Mega-City One's former chief genetic engineer. The Judda were defeated, and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie. Dredd was waiting at the finish line, but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback. This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant, and was a contributing factor (it was ''[[The Last American]]'', a mini series for [[Epic Comics]] which would mark the end)  in ending their regular writing partnership. Wagner kept ''Dredd'', while Grant continued ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Anderson''. However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations.\n\nThe \"Oz\" storyline had some lasting implications. [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd, was captured by Justice Department, who had plans for him. Chopper also spun off into his own series, written by Wagner and drawn by [[Colin MacNeil]].\n\nThe ''ABC Warriors'' finally had their own series again in 1987 as a spin-off from ''Nemesis''. This was written, as ever, by Pat Mills, and drawn by two artists in rotation, newcomer [[Simon Bisley]] and science fiction artist [[SMS (comics)|S.M.S.]].\n\nIn 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new ''Strontium Dog'' story, \"The Final Solution\". It took nearly two years to complete, and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha, who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination. Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off, and refused to draw it.\n\nThe number of colour pages was increased, allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted. Initially the colour pages were reserved for ''Judge Dredd'', but were later given over to a new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, \"The Horned God\", fully painted by [[Simon Bisley]]. The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels, then as a single volume, and has remained in print ever since.\n\nIn 1989 the colour pages were increased again, allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue. One of the colour series was ''Rogue Trooper: the War Machine'', written by Dave Gibbons and painted by [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]]. The original ''Rogue Trooper'' series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with, though continued with Rogue's adventures on Horst and the 'Hit' series, so Gibbons revamped the concept, creating a different genetic infantryman, [[Friday (2000 AD)|Friday]], in a different war, albeit in the same universe.\n\nOne of the black and white stories, \"[[The Dead Man]]\", was a low-key beginning for a major event. In the Cursed Earth, villagers come across a man, burnt from head to toe, with no memory of who he is or what happened to him. As he tries to piece his memories back together, he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state. A creepy, atmospheric horror-western, it was drawn by [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and written by \"Keef Ripley\", a pseudonym for John Wagner. By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity: he was Judge Dredd.\n\n===1990s===\nAs \"The Dead Man\" ended, a new ''Judge Dredd'' story, \"[[The Dead Man#Tale of the Dead Man|Tale of the Dead Man]]\", explained how Dredd had ended up in that position. Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role, so Justice Department had groomed [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], the former Judda cloned from his bloodline, to replace him. Kraken was now ready for his final assessment, and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him. Although Kraken performed faultlessly, Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him, and failed him. He then resigned as a judge and took the '[[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]' into the Cursed Earth. There he met the Sisters of Death, and only barely survived the encounter. This could mean only one thing: Judge Death was back.\n\nThis set up the latest six-month epic, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\". After Dredd had left, Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test, and given him Dredd's badge. But the Sisters of Death, spirit beings from Judge Death's dimension, were able to use Kraken's inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to. The Sisters possessed all the city's judges and began to enforce Death's twisted law. Out in the Cursed Earth, Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges. He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city. The judges won, by a small margin on a desultory turnout, and Dredd was satisfied.\n\n''2000 AD'' gained an influx of talent from other comics. [[Garth Ennis]] and [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] had come to prominence writing for ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a ''2000 AD'' spin-off for older readers, while artists [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Philip Bond]] were the stars of ''[[Deadline magazine|Deadline]]'', an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by [[Steve Dillon]] and [[Brett Ewins]]. Smith created ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', a multi-dimensional organisation that polices reality, whose most memorable story was \"Killing Time\", a [[time travel]] story featuring [[Jack the Ripper]]. [[Garth Ennis]] and Philip Bond contributed ''Time Flies'', a time-travel comedy, and Hewlett was paired with writer [[Peter Milligan]] for the surreal ''[[Hewligan's Haircut]]''. Writer [[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] and artist [[Simon Jacob]] created ''[[Armoured Gideon]]'', an action-comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth.\n\nThe ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', a monthly title set in the world of Dredd, was launched in October 1990. With John Wagner focusing his attentions there, Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly.\n\nAmerican writer [[Michael Fleisher]], who had written ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'' and ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' in the 1970s, was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new ''Rogue Trooper'', along with several other strips, none of which went down very well. Another new writer who failed to set ''2000 AD'' on fire was [[Mark Millar]], whose revival of ''Robo-Hunter'' was particularly unpopular. Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American [[superhero]] comics such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]''.\n\n''2000 AD'' went all-colour about this time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in response to a short-lived new colour weekly, ''[[Toxic!]]'', launched by Pat Mills and many of the core ''2000 AD'' team of creators. ''Toxic!'' only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for ''2000 AD''. ''[[Button Man]]'', a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and [[Arthur Ranson]], was originally intended for ''Toxic!'' but ended up in ''2000 AD''.\n\nA new ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series, written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by [[Kev Walker]], began in 1991, in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his \"Khaos\" philosophy.\n\nRobert Maxwell died in late 1991, and Fleetway was merged with London Editions, a Danish-owned company which owned rights to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, to become Fleetway Editions.\n\nIn 1992, ''2000 AD'' and the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' ran their first crossover story, \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", in which [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]s overran Mega-City One. Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, [[Peter Doherty (comics)|Peter Doherty]], [[Dean Ormston]] and [[Chris Cunningham|Chris Halls]], the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel. John Smith and artist [[Paul Marshall (comics)|Paul Marshall]] created ''[[Firekind]]'', a slow-paced story about dragons and alien societies, which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order.\n\nThe ''Strontium Dog'' world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field, gaining the plural name ''Strontium Dogs'' \u2013 characters such as female vampire [[Durham Red]], the albino Feral Jackson, and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk \u2013 the latter, normally a timid creature with weak 'heartses', became a gung-ho action character upon learning of Alpha's death. However, in the 12-parter ''The Darkest Star'', it transpires that the one to ''actually'' kill him was the Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.\n\n{{anchor|Summer Offensive}}<!-- [[Summer Offensive (comics)]] links here -->\nThe \"Summer Offensive\" was an eight-week experiment in 1993, when new editor [[Alan McKenzie]] gave free rein to writers [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and John Smith, to a mixed reception. Morrison wrote a Dredd story, \"Inferno\", and a drug-influenced comedy adventure, ''[[Really & Truly]]''. Smith contributed ''[[Slaughterbowl]]'', in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport, with the survivor being paroled for a year and granted wealth \u2013 but being forced to enter the Slaughterbowl again the next year. Millar wrote ''[[Maniac 5]]'', an action-packed series about a remote controlled war-robot. During this run was a satire of British [[tabloid newspaper|tabloid]] attitudes titled ''[[Big Dave (comics)|Big Dave]]'', written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]].\n\n[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] became editor in 1994, and a second crossover between ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine'', \"[[Mechanismo|Wilderlands]]\", began. Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra, [[Mick Austin]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]], it followed on from \"Mechanismo\", a series of stories in the ''Megazine'' in which Justice Department, opposed by Dredd, tried to introduce robot judges. With Wagner writing, ''Judge Dredd'' was again the flagship strip.\n\nFormer ''Megazine'' editor [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became editor of the weekly in 1996 but sales continued to decline. Unsuccessful series were dropped, and a number of new series were tried out, some more successful than others. Writer [[Dan Abnett]] introduced ''[[Sinister Dexter]]'' in 1996, a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which became a regular feature. In 1997, writer [[Robbie Morrison]] and artist [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]], who had worked with Bishop on the ''Megazine'', created ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'', a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies' man who discovers he's the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty. There were also gimmicks, like the \"sex issue\", sold in a clear plastic wrapper, ''[[The Spacegirls]]'', a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the [[Spice Girls]], ''[[M.A.C.H. 1|B.L.A.I.R. 1]]'', a parody of [[Tony Blair]] based on ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', and an adaptation of the [[Danny Boyle]] film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]''.\n\nA new ''Dredd'' epic, \"[[The Doomsday Scenario|Doomsday]]\", appeared in 1999 and again ran in both ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine''. Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years, introducing the main villain, semi-robotic gang lord Nero Narcos, and supporting characters like [[Judge Edgar]] of the Public Surveillance Unit, and [[Galen DeMarco]], a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye.\n\n1999 also saw the return of another character, ''Nemesis the Warlock''. After a break of ten years, writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with \"The Final Conflict\". The series was drawn by [[Henry Flint]] in a style that recalled Kevin O'Neill's early work on the series, as well as Simon Bisley's ''ABC Warriors'' work.\n\nThe decade ended with a special 100-page issue called \"Prog 2000\". Behind a cover by Brian Bolland, ''Nemesis'' wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O'Neill. War broke out in ''Nikolai Dante'', and writer [[Gordon Rennie]] and artist [[Mark Harrison (artist)|Mark Harrison]] introduced future war story ''Glimmer Rats''. Another old favourite, ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra, telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death, with the conceit that previous stories had been \"folklore\" and the new stories were \"what really happened\", allowing Wagner to revise continuity.\n\n===2000s===\nThe publisher has been owned by [[Rebellion Developments]] since 2000, with editors [[Andy Diggle]] and [[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]] at the helm. Rebellion continues to develop stories (and computer games) based on classic characters such as ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'', and has also introduced a roster of new series including ''[[Shakara]]'', ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and ''[[Caballistics, Inc.]]''. It has also published a tie-in to the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' in a story written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nThe comic continues to uncover new British talents, including [[Boo Cook]], [[Dom Reardon]] and [[Al Ewing]]. It has also benefited from an improved dollar-pound [[exchange rate]] that has meant the comic can now afford to re-employ some of the talent thought lost to America.\n\nA number of shorter self-contained stories, partly created by the new wave of talent, have run including ''[[London Falling]]'', ''[[Stone Island (2000AD)|Stone Island]]'' and ''[[Zombo (comics)|Zombo]]''. Other developments include a revamping of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' which has included a section acting as a showcase for [[British small press comics]]. Starting in program 1500 was the Judge Dredd story \"The Connection\", a 'prelude' to a 23-part Judge Dredd epic \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd's past.\n\nIn prog 1526,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=prog&page=profiles&choice=1526 |title=Prog 1526 |publisher=2000ad.org |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> dated 28 February 2007, ''2000 AD'' celebrated their 30th anniversary.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6390731.stm 30 years of the future], [[BBC]], 26 February 2007</ref> The issue saw the start of two new storylines: ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'' (by [[Robbie Morrison]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]) and ''[[Invasion!

In the same year, former editor Steve MacManus published his memoirs.\n\nIn 2017, founding editor Pat Mills published his memoirs, ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History''. Later in that year, [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette Partworks]] began publishing ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'', an 80-volume fortnightly series of hardback books featuring classic stories from the first 40 years of the comic. This followed the success of ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', which had started in 2015 and later been extended to 90 volumes.\n\nIn June 2018 (July in the United States) a special issue was published, the ''2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018'', which contained stories written and illustrated entirely by women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/20/the-futures-female-2000ads-all-women-special \"The future's female? 2000AD's all-women special\"], by David Barnett, in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 June 2018.</ref>\n\n==Lists of stories==\n{{Main|List of 2000 AD stories}}\n*A complete index of stories published in ''2000 AD'' from February 1977 to December 2019 (#1 to #2162) is [[Media:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]] (WikiCommons).<ref>[[commons:File:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n*A more detailed list of all the ''Judge Dredd'' stories to appear in ''2000 AD'' (including specials and annuals) from March 1977 to December 2019 can be found [[Media:Dredd2AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]].<ref>[[commons:File:Dredd2AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n\n==Crossovers==\n{{main|2000 AD crossovers}}\nAlthough there is no overall [[shared universe]] containing all ''2000 AD'' stories, some stories [[2000 AD crossovers|spin-off or crossover]] into other stories. These include the numerous stories that occur in the [[Judge Dredd|Judge Dredd universe]]. Many stories by [[Pat Mills]], which are frequently interlinked, link into the Dredd universe as well, though have been partially [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by the writer. Many stories written by [[Ian Edginton]] feature shared themes and references.\n\n==Editors==\n{{Main|Tharg the Mighty}}\nA long-running theme is that the [[editing|editor]] of ''2000 AD'' is [[Tharg the Mighty]], a green [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from [[Betelgeuse]] who terms his readers \"Earthlets\". Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips. Readers sometimes play along with this; for example, in prog 201 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called \"Terrans\"; the resulting controversy ended in Tharg allowing readers to vote for the preferred term in prog 229.  In prog 240 Tharg announced that the result was a draw, and \"Terran\" became an accepted term for readers' letters in the Nerve Centre.  In similar vein, Tharg used to draw distinction between male and female letter-writers with \"Eathlet\" and \"Earthlette\" until a letter was printed in Prog 314 complaining about the use, and Tharg agreed to use \"Earthlet\" (or \"Terran\") regardless of gender.  From prog 531 the term \"Earthlette\" was reintroduced.<ref>Prog 531, 18 July 1987 \u2013 \"Earthlette H Maton\"</ref>\n\nAnother running theme is Tharg's use of [[robot]]s to draw and write the strips, which bear a marked resemblance to the actual writers and artists. A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots \"went on strike\" (reflecting real-life [[industrial action]] that occasionally halted IPC's comics production during the 1970s and 1980s). Tharg wrote and drew a whole issue himself, but when he ran it through the quality-control \"Thrill-meter\", the device melted down on extreme overload. The offending issue had to be taken away, by blindfolded security guards, to a lead-lined vault where there was no danger of anyone seeing it accidentally.\n<section begin=tharg />\nThe role of Tharg has been performed by the following editors:\n\n#[[Pat Mills]], #1\u201316 (1977)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=patm Pat Mills] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Kelvin Gosnell]], #17\u201385 (1977\u20131978)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=KELVING Kelvin Gosnell] at 2000ad.org</ref><br/>Assistant editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the comic himself in 1978 while Gosnell was occupied with editing new sister title ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]''.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\"/>\n#[[Steve MacManus]], #86\u2013519 (1978\u20131987)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=STEVEM Steve MacManus] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]], #520\u2013872 (1987\u20131994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=RICHARDB Richard Burton] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Alan McKenzie]], #873\u2013914 (1994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ALANMC Alan McKenzie] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]], #915\u2013977 (1994\u20131996)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=JOHNT John Tomlinson] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]], #978\u20131199 (1996\u20132000)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=DAVEB David Bishop (writer)|] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Andy Diggle]], #1200\u20131273 (2000\u20132002)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ANDYD Andy Diggle] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]], #1274\u2013present (2002\u2013present)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=MATTS Matt Smith] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n<section end=tharg />\n\n==Contributors==\n[[File:Drandquinch.jpg|thumb|200px|''D.R and Quinch'', art by [[Alan Davis]].]]\nWell known contributors to ''2000 AD'' include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[Nick Abadzis]]\n* [[Dan Abnett]]\n* [[Massimo Belardinelli]]\n* [[Simon Bisley]]\n* [[Brian Bolland]]\n* [[Philip Bond]]\n* [[Chris Cunningham]]\n* [[Alan Davis]]\n* [[Steve Dillon]]\n* [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]]\n* [[Ian Edginton]]\n* [[Garth Ennis]]\n* [[Al Ewing]]\n* [[Carlos Ezquerra]]\n* [[Gerry Finley-Day]]\n* [[Michael Fleisher]]\n* [[Henry Flint]]\n* [[Tom Frame (letterer)|Tom Frame]]\n* [[Neil Gaiman]]\n* [[Dave Gibbons]]\n* [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]\n* [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]\n* [[Trevor Hairsine]]\n* [[Jamie Hewlett]]\n* [[John Hicklenton]]\n* [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]\n* [[David Hine]]\n* [[Frazer Irving]]\n* [[Jock (comics)|Jock]]\n* [[Cam Kennedy]]\n* [[Brendan McCarthy]]\n* [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]\n* [[Mark Millar]]\n* [[Peter Milligan]]\n* [[Pat Mills]]\n* [[Alan Moore]]\n* [[Grant Morrison]]\n* [[Robbie Morrison]]\n* [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]\n* [[Arthur Ranson]]\n* [[Gordon Rennie]]\n* [[John Ridgway (comics)|John Ridgway]]\n* [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]]\n* [[Ron Smith (comics)|Ron Smith]]\n* [[Simon Spurrier]]\n* [[Richard Starkings]]\n* [[Bryan Talbot]]\n* [[John Wagner]]\n* [[Kev Walker]]\n* [[Chris Weston]]\n{{colend}}\nMany of these have since moved on to work for American publishers such as [[DC Comics]] (especially the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] and [[Wildstorm]] imprints) and [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Film and TV adaptations==\n* ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Dredd]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Rogue Trooper#Film|Rogue Trooper]]'' (TBA)<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=McMillan|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/duncan-jones-teases-rogue-trooper-movie-1127099|title=Duncan Jones Teases 'Rogue Trooper' Movie|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=15 July 2018|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>\n*''[[Judge Dredd#Television|Judge Dredd: Mega-City One]] (TBA)\n\n==Video game adaptations==\n2000AD video games for 8-bit computers include games based on [[Strontium Dog]] by [[Quicksilva]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984, ''Nemesis the Warlock'' and ''Sl\u00e1ine'' by [[Martech]] in 1987, [[Rogue Trooper]] written by [[Design Design]] / published by ''Piranha'' in 1986 and [[Judge Dredd]] by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in 1990, all released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] platforms.

to ''2000 AD'' is the monthly  ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', which originally focused exclusively on expanding the world of Judge Dredd, but in recent years has expanded its focus to include other stories set in other universes as well.\n* The bimonthly ''2000 AD Extreme Edition'' presented reprints of classic and hard-to-find 2000AD stories, but poor sales led to its cancellation in mid-2008. Since the cancellation, a smaller reprint supplement has been packaged with the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' instead.\n*''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' was a weekly title (originally intended to be monthly) launched in 1978 following much the same format as ''2000 AD'' and included ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' which introduced characters that would later reappear in ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. The two titles were merged later the same year and published as ''2000AD and Starlord''. A third ''Starlord'' series, ''TimeQuake'', also had a 4-week run in ''2000AD'' over a year later.\n*''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'' was a weekly title launched in 1979. There was less emphasis on Science Fiction series. It was merged with ''2000 AD'' after 22 issues, transferring the strips ''[[Blackhawk (UK comic)|Blackhawk]]'', ''The Mind of Wolfie Smith'' and ''Captain Klep''. For a while the publication was titled ''2000 AD and Tornado''.\n*''[[Diceman (comics)|Diceman]]'' was an early attempt at creating a [[role-playing]] comic featuring regular ''2000 AD'' characters such as Rogue Trooper and Slaine, as well as original characters, like Diceman. The magazine was not a success and only lasted five issues.\n*''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' (1988\u20131991) was a sister publication that did not follow the format of ''2000 AD'', but did share many editorial staff and creative teams. Early issues featured two SF-themed stories aimed at a slightly older age group than ''2000 AD'' with strong political themes. It became a magnet for British creators who wanted to create comics for the adult market. The ''2000 AD'' series ''Finn'', begun the year after ''Crisis'' was cancelled, continued the adventures of the character from ''Third World War'', though with more of a fantasy emphasis.\n*''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]'' (1990\u20131991) joined ''Crisis'' though it only lasted for seven issues. Dan Dare was in the original line-up, and this transferred to ''Crisis'' when ''Revolver'' finished.\n*''[[Toxic!]]'' was a short-lived rival publication, established by ''2000 AD'' talent, that was published during 1991.\n*A ''Best of 2000 AD'' title was published in the mid-1980s which featured reprint material from early issues of ''2000 AD''. In the early 1990s, ''The Complete Judge Dredd'' began publication in a similar format. Both titles were relaunched as ''Classic 2000AD'' and ''Classic Judge Dredd'' in the mid-1990s but were cancelled soon after.\n*A yearly hardcover annual was published from 1977 to 1990 (though the cover dates on the annuals were always the following year). From 1991 this was replaced by a softcover ''2000AD Yearbook''; the last of these was published in 1994. There were also annuals/yearbooks dedicated to ''2000 AD'' characters such as ''Dan Dare'' (1978\u20131979, cover dated 1979\u20131980), ''Judge Dredd'' (1980\u20131994) and ''Rogue Trooper'' (1990).\n* An annual summer special was published during the summer months between 1977 and 1996, entitled the ''2000AD Sci-Fi Special'' from 1978. This was revived in 2014.\n* Other specials include the ''2000AD Winter Special'' (1988\u20131995, 2005 and 2014), ''Judge Dredd Mega Special'' (1988\u20131996) and ''Rogue Trooper Action Special'' (1996). (1996's ''Judge Dredd Action Special'' was a tie-in to the defunct ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'' rather than ''2000AD'' proper).\n* In April 1992, a ''2000AD Action Special'' featured six strips reviving classic British comics characters such as the [[Steel Claw]]. Of these only ''Kelly's Eye'' also appeared in ''2000 AD'' proper.\n* In the mid-1990s a series of ''2000 AD Poster Progs'' were published, each featuring a new strip. There were five ''Judge Dredd'' poster magazines, plus one each for four other ''2000 AD'' series: ''Nemesis the Warlock'', ''Strontium Dogs'', ''Sl\u00e1ine'' and ''Rogue Trooper''.\n* A series of American comic format reprints started in 1983 by [[Eagle Comics]] with the first issue of an ongoing monthly ''Judge Dredd'' title. Eagle Comics also reprinted other ''2000 AD'' material in other titles. The license to reprint ''2000 AD'' material in the US was later taken over by [[Quality Communications|Quality Comics]]. These reprints ended in the early 1990s.\n\n===Fanzines===\n''2000 AD'' has an extremely lively and thriving [[Fan (aficionado)|fanbase]], which has produced a number of independent [[fanzine]]s.\n\nBetween 1994\u201396, \"Fear The Badge\" was an erstwhile but overly ambitious attempt at a ''2000 AD'' fanzine based around the Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Robo-hunter universes. With original artwork, stories and articles, the fanzine would act as a showcase for talent wanting to break into comics.\nIts editor/creator, Paul Dick, partially disabled himself, wanted to donate some of the zine's profits to a different disability charity each month. However, the fanzine's genesis was plagued by bad luck, not least of all Dick's health worsening. Despite the good intentions and hardwork of its creator (as well as the keen interest and support from both amateur and professional ''2000 AD'' contributors), the fanzine's full potential sadly never was realised. Only a dummy run of 50 copies of issue 1 were ever produced.\n\nIn 1998 W.R. Logan, frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic's publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents, decided to create an independent title using ''2000 AD'' copyrighted characters and situations. This was titled ''[[Class of '79]]'', named after the year of Dredd's graduation from the Academy of Law \u2013 2079. The first couple of issues contained work from now-professional comics creators [[Rufus Dayglo]], [[Boo Cook]], [[Henry Flint]] and [[PJ Holden]] and won the best Self Published/Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards.\n\nIn 2001, [[Andrew J. Lewis (comics)|Andrew J. Lewis]] created ''[[Zarjaz]]'' comic, with strips featuring characters from a variety of ''2000 AD'' stories. There were also interviews with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], [[Frazer Irving]] and [[Alan Moore]], as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer.\n\nAnother long-running fanzine, dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha, is ''[[Dogbreath]]'', originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing. In 2003, [[Arthur Wyatt (comics)|Arthur Wyatt]] created ''[[FutureQuake]]'', a fanzine devoted to the [[Future Shocks]] format. Although ''Class of '79'' now appears to be on hiatus, all three of the other titles are in continuous publication, ''Zarjaz'' having started up again with a new issue 1.\n\nIn addition, a number of [[British small press comics|small press]] comics have emerged from the ''2000 AD'' fanbase, including ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Omnivistascope'' and ''[[The End Is Nigh]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2000 AD stories]]\n*[[List of minor 2000 AD stories]]\n*''[[Action (comic)|Action]]''\n*[[British comics]]\n*[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]], which saw a number of ''2000 AD'' artists and writers working for the big American firms during the 1980s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] (2002\u20132003), ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]!''

''The House of Mirth'' traces Lily's slow two-year social descent from privilege to a tragically lonely existence on the margins of society.

She also had license to criticize the ways New York high society of the 1890s had changed without being vulnerable to accusations of envy motivated by coming from a lower social caste.{{efn|name=misfortune of fortune| Ironically, critics in the '20s and '30s criticized Wharton precisely because of her wealth and pedigree as a member of \"old money\"  Manhattan. They reasoned that \"such a woman could not understand the average working person. . . .\" and that \"[Wharton's]  upper-class characters. . .constituted too narrow a subject matter. . . .\" to be of any importance to the real world.

But that did not deter her as she thought something of value could be mined there. If only the writer could dig deeply enough below the surface, some \" 'stuff o' the conscience' \" could be found. She went on to declare unabashedly that: \n\n{{Quote|[I]n spite of the fact I wrote about totally insignificant people, and 'dated' them by an elaborate stage-setting of manners, furniture and costume, the book still lives and has now attained the honour of figuring on the list of the Oxford University Press. . . .

''The House of Mirth'' continues to attract readers over a century after its first publication, possibly due to its timeless theme.  That the life and death of Lily Bart matters to modern readers suggests that Wharton succeeded in her purpose: to critique \"a society so relentlessly materialistic and self-serving that it casually destroys what is most beautiful and blameless within it.\" <ref name=\"Wharton's Casebook\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[File:Scribner's for March, now ready. Everybody is talking of the house of mirth, by Edith Wharton in Scribner's. Are you reading it? LCCN2014649554.jpg|thumb|Poster for the serialized debut of ''The House of Mirth'' in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' (1905)]]\nLily Bart, a beautiful but impoverished socialite, is on her way to a house party at Bellomont, the country home of her best friend, Judy Trenor. Her pressing task is to find a husband with the requisite wealth and status to maintain her place in New York society.  Judy has arranged for her to spend more time in the company of Percy Gryce, a potential suitor who is wealthy but whom Lily finds boring. Lily grew up surrounded by elegance and luxury\u2014an atmosphere she believes she cannot live without, as she has learnt to abhor \"dinginess.\" The loss of her father's wealth and the death of her parents left her an orphan at about the age of twenty. Lacking an inheritance or a caring protector, she adapts to life as ward of her strait-laced aunt Julia Peniston from whom she receives an erratic allowance, a fashionable address, and good food, but little direction or parenting. Lily despises her aunt Julia and avoids her whenever possible while simultaneously relying on her for both necessities and luxuries.\n\nAdditional challenges to her success in the \"marriage market\" are her advancing age\u2014at age twenty-nine she has been on the \"marriage market\" for more than ten years\u2014her penchant for gambling at bridge leaving her with debts beyond her means to pay, her efforts to keep up with her wealthy friends, her innermost desire to marry for love as well as money and status, and her longing to be free of the claustrophobic constrictions and routines of upper-crust society.\n\nThreats to Lily's reputation exist because of her tendency to push the limits of polite and acceptable behavior. For example, on the way to visit Bellomont, she impulsively visits the Manhattan flat of her unmarried friend Lawrence Selden during the two-hour wait for the train. While leaving the building, she encounters Mr. Rosedale, a Jewish businessman known to her set. Attempting to cover the appearance of an indiscretion, she makes her gaffe worse by telling an obvious lie: she pretends to have been consulting her dress-maker.{{efn|name=\"Benedick\"|Rosedale tells her that he knows of no dress-makers in the Benedick and adds,\"Yes. [ Benedick ] that's the name [of the building]; I believe it's an old word for bachelor, isn't it\"(35)?<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}} This, it turns out, is not the only time Lily is caught in an obvious lie: she has the habit of misrepresenting herself and being caught.\n\nLily's week at Bellomont ends up in a series of failures beginning with losing a large sum at bridge. She fails to become engaged to Percy Gryce despite his initial interest in her. This is because although she presents herself as a conservative, innocent person to snare a conservative husband, her actions reveal that she is not the person she is pretending to be. Although she exaggerates the extent of her relationship with Percy until everyone at Bellomont thinks an engagement between them is imminent, her true character is revealed through her actions and through revelations of events from Lily's past that shock and scandalize Percy.\n\nNear the week's end, the tall, handsome and engaging Lawrence Selden unexpectedly shows up at Bellomont. Having already failed to meet Percy for morning church services, and fully aware that Lawrence has just ended an illicit relationship with the married but vindictive Bertha Dorset, Lily chooses to go for a long walk with Lawrence and to spend the afternoon with him instead of with Percy or the rest of the party. Even though Lily has already made it clear to Selden during their ''[[:wikt:t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate|t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate]]'' in his flat that she looked at him as that friend who won't be afraid to say disagreeable things to her,{{efn|name=\"friend\"| In an attempt to free herself from the socially prescribed narrative of marriage she seeks Selden's cooperation to create a new social narrative<ref name=\"drama of femininity\">Wolff, Cynthia Griffin, Lily Bart and the drama of femininity in Carol J.

Succumbing to her agreeable femininity, Selden begins to fall in love with Lily. He feels safe in nurturing an emotional attachment to her because she clearly states that she cannot and will not marry a man of his modest means. Fresh out of a four-year-long affair with a married woman, Lawrence begins to slide into another emotional attachment with the equally unavailable Lily. But Bertha, who still has feelings for Lawrence even though he just broke up with her, notices his fondness for Lily and decides to sabotage Lily's budding romance with Percy by filling him in on the most salacious and scandalous rumors about Lily's card playing and past romantic life. This effectively frightens Percy away, however Lily manages to cast the blame on Judy for having been the one to set the match up.\n\nOn her last day at Bellomont, Lily creates threats to her social standing. Gus Trenor, a very skilled stockbroker, is married to Lily's best friend Judy. Judy is not particularly jealous of Gus's occasional conversations or flirtations with other women, unless he becomes so emotionally attached to them as to spend money on them or to give them money, which Judy rightly recognizes as a sign that the relationship has become a threat to their marriage. Lily is fully aware of Judy's jealousy on the money issue, and she is aware that Judy does not approve when other women, such as the financially embarrassed Carry Fisher, persuade Gus to speculate on their behalf in the stock market. Yet Lily persuades Gus to do just that. Lacking the financial knowledge to understand the difference between a legitimate loan or speculation, Lily flirts with Gus and allows him to hold her hand and lean against her. She convinces herself that Gus is making investments on her behalf and accepts several large checks from him. On several occasions, however, Gus makes it clear that he expects romantic attention from Lily in exchange for his financial expertise. Instead of discussing the issue openly, Lily begins to play [[cat and mouse]] with him. To avoid being with him in private, she appears in public with him at the opera and for late afternoon walks in Central Park with him. This attracts other people's attention.\n\nGradually, Lily begins to suffer the consequences of her indiscreet behavior. Percy, having been scared away by Lily's behavior and Bertha Dorset's malicious gossip, proposes to a young woman named Evie Van Osburgh, who is much better suited to him than Lily and who was introduced to him by Bertha Dorset herself. Mrs. Dorset's public pride in her match-making victory results in social ridicule for Lily from the people whom she directly and indirectly misled into thinking she and Percy were all but engaged. Finally, in retribution for a social snub, Lily's cousin Grace Stepney informs their aunt Julia about rumors that Lily has gambling debts which she may be trying to cover through an inappropriate relationship with Gus Trenor.  This sows seeds of doubt and discomfort in Aunt Julia who though shocked, does not discuss the situation with her niece so as to avoid a scene.[[Image:House of Mirth 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The tragic heroine of ''The House of Mirth'' (1905), Lily Bart, lingers at the broad staircase, observing the high-society people gathered in the hall below.]] Furthermore, Lily has destroyed her relationship with Gus and Judy Trenor. Judy's attitude toward Lily has cooled, partly due to Lily's financial relationship with Gus and partly because Lily now avoids Bellomont because she does not wish to hold up her end on what everybody else believes to be a pay-for-play relationship.\n\nTo avoid having to spend time alone with her aunt, the Trenors, Simon Rosedale, or anyone else she considers a possible source of embarrassment or boredom, Lily begins to accept invitations from people with whom she would not ordinarily socialize. These include the Wellington Brys, who are newcomers to the New York social scene whose social rise is being engineered by Carry Fisher. Carry, who earns money by acting as a social secretary to usher newly wealthy people into fashionable society, invites Lily to social events hosted by Louisa Bry. Lily also attends the opera with Carry, Simon Rosedale, and Gus Trenor. In the eyes of high society, Lily cheapens herself by voluntarily associating with her social inferiors. She returns briefly to Bellomont only to find that she is now being teased by her social peers for socializing with the upstart Brys and with Simon Rosedale.\n\nLily is not entirely without resources for social rehabilitation or at least blackmail. One of her aunt's temporary servants, who is also the charwoman at Selden's apartment, sells Lily a package of torn love letters. These were written by Bertha Dorset, and they represent an opportunity for Lily to blackmail her enemy. But instead of blackmailing Bertha into a positive relationship, Lily tries to neutralize the gossip by making herself useful to Bertha. Bertha, who has a new love interest in the form of a young man named Ned Silverton, relies on Lily to distract her husband George Dorset.\n \nThe extent to which Lily's reputation is damaged becomes obvious when Lily publicly appears in a way that comes across as advertising her availability for an illicit relationship. Following Mrs. Fisher's advice, the Wellington Brys throw a large \"general entertainment\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wharton|first1=Edith (1905).|title=''The House of Mirth,'' Book I, Chapt.

The portrait shows an attractive woman suggestively clad.{{efn|name=\"Mrs. Lloyd\"|the portrait shows \"a woman in profile with her hair piled high, carving her husband's name on a tree and dressed in an ivory robe that looks diaphanously loose and provocatively clinging at once.\"<ref name=\"Mrs. Llloyd's portrait\">{{cite web|last1=Gorra |first1=Michael(2015)|title=The portrait of Miss Bart|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/05/01/house-of-mirth-portrait-miss-bart/|website=NYbooks.com/daily|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>}} As the curtain opens on this last scene, the gasp of approval heard from the audience was not so much for Reynold's brilliant interpretation of Mrs. Lloyd as it was for the loveliness of Lily Bart herself\u2014marking the pinnacle of her social success but also the annihilation of whatever reputation is left to her. For better or for worse, she has transitioned from a marriageable \"girl\" to a not-quite-reputable woman similar to Carry Fisher. Yet she does not do as Carry Fisher does, and accept the loss of her respectability as the price she must pay to maintain a position in society.\n\nAs Selden observes her in this elegantly simple ''tableau'', he sees the real Lily Bart as if for the first time{{efn|name=\"real Lily Bart\"|Wharton describes the impression Lily's pose has on Selden as \"divested of the trivialities of her little world, and catching for a moment a note of that eternal harmony of which her beauty was a part.(139)\"<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}} and feels the desire to be with her. He finds her alone in the ballroom toward the end of the musical interlude, as the collective praise from her admirers is subsiding. He leads her to a garden where he tells her he loves her and they kiss. Lily sighs, \" 'Ah, love me, love me\u2014but don't tell me so!' \" <ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" (141)/> and takes her leave.{{efn|name=\"friendship not possible|\"Lily's artistic skill has been entirely focused on reading this theatrical effect\u2014a gorgeous, static, utterly silent rendition of self. Paradoxically, it is here Selden finally supposes that he has glimpsed the real Lily Bart and that he might love her. Yet, it is also here that Lily despairs of realizing true comradeship. The very terms of her success have revealed the impossibility of concocting a new narrative with Selden. She no longer even asks for friendship but instead sadly inquires, 'Why can't we be friends? You promised once to help me' \"(22).<ref name=\"drama of femininity\" />}}  As Selden gathers his coat to leave, he is disturbed by Ned Van Alstyne's remarks, \". . . .Gad, what a show of good-looking women; but not one of 'em could touch that little cousin of mine. . . . I never knew till tonight what an outline Lily has.\" <ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" (142)/>\n\nThe next day, Lily receives two notes\u2014one from Judy Trenor inviting her to dine that evening at her town house and the other from Selden\u2014asking to meet with her the following day. Though she had a dinner engagement, she agreed to a visit with Judy at ten o'clock. However, her late-evening encounter turns out to be with Gus alone. Gus vehemently demands the kind of attention he thought he had paid for. Pleading [[wiktionary:na\u00efvet\u00e9|''na\u00efvet\u00e9'']] about business matters and appealing to their friendship, she promises to pay back the almost $10,000 she owes him. With heightened anger and resentment, he accuses Lily of playing with him while entertaining other men. Lily gets him to back off and flees, getting into a hansom cab. Shaken and feeling very much alone, she is unaware that she has been seen by both Ned Van Alstyne and Lawrence Selden, both of whom were aware that Judy was out of town and that the Trenor house in New York is occupied by Gus alone. The unspoken conclusion, shared between the two men, is that the rumors of Lily's romantic involvement with Gus Trenor have a solid basis in fact. Ned, as a relative of the family, asks Lawrence to not tell anybody what they saw. But the damage is done. Lily calls on her friend Gerty Farish for succor and shelter for the rest of the night, and returns to her aunt in the morning.\n\nThe following day Lily pleads with her aunt to help her with her debts and confesses that she has lost money gambling at bridge even on Sundays. Aunt Julia refuses to help her, except to cover the $1,000 to $2,000 bill for clothes and accessories. Feeling trapped and disgraced, she turns to thoughts of Selden as her savior and has a change of heart towards him as she looks forward to his visit at four o'clock.\n\nInstead, her visitor turns out to be Simon Rosedale who, so smitten by her appearance in the ''tableau vivant,'' proposes a marriage that would be mutually beneficial. Considering what Rosedale knows about her, she skillfully pleads for time to consider his offer {{efn|name=\"Rosedale_proposal\"|Lily skillfully says, \"But I should be selfish and ungrateful if I made [carelessness about money and worry about bills] a reason for accepting all you offer, with no better return to make than the desire to be free of my anxieties. You must give me time\u2014time to think of your kindness\u2014and of what I can give you in return for it\u2014\" (176)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}}   Selden does not appear for his 4:00 appointment nor does he send word in explanation. Instead he has departed for Havana and then on to Europe on business. This comes as a shock to Lily.\n\nTo escape the rumors arising from the gossip caused by her financial dealings with Gus Trenor, and also disappointed by what she interprets as Selden's emotional withdrawal, Lily accepts Bertha Dorset's spur-of-the- moment invitation to join her and George on a Mediterranean cruise aboard their yacht, the ''Sabrina.'' Bertha intends for Lily to keep George distracted while Bertha carries on an affair with young Ned Silverton. Lily's decision to join the Dorsets on this cruise proves to be her social undoing.\n\nIn order to divert the attention and suspicion of their social circle away from her, Bertha insinuates that Lily is carrying on a romantic and sexual liaison with George by commanding that she not return to the yacht in front of their friends at the close of a dinner the Brys held for the Duchess in Monte Carlo. Selden helps by arranging a night's lodging with her cousin Jack Stepney, under the promise that she leave promptly in the morning. The ensuing social scandal ruins Lily's reputation and almost immediately causes her friends to abandon her and Aunt Julia to disinherit her.\n\nUndeterred by such misfortunes, Lily fights to regain her place in high society by befriending Mr. and Mrs. Gormer and becoming their social secretary, so as to introduce the Gormers to high society and groom them to take a better social position. However, her enemy, the malicious Bertha Dorset, gradually communicates to them the \"scandalous\" personal background of Lily Bart, and thus undermines the friendship which Lily had hoped would socially rehabilitate her. Only two friends remain for Lily: Gerty Farish (a cousin of Lawrence Selden) and Carry Fisher, who help her cope with the social ignominy of a degraded social status while continually advising Lily to marry as soon as reasonably possible.\n\nDespite the efforts and advice of Gerty and Carry to help her overcome notoriety, Lily descends through the [[social stratification|social strata]] of New York City's high society. She obtains a job as personal secretary of Mrs. Hatch, a disreputable woman who very nearly succeeds in marrying a wealthy young man in Lily's former social circle. It is during this occupation she is introduced to the use of chloral hydrate, sold in drugstores, as a remedy for malaise.  She resigns her position after Lawrence Selden returns to warn her of the danger, but not in time to avoid being blamed for the crisis. Lily then finds a job in a [[Hatmaking|milliner's]] shop; yet, unaccustomed to the rigors of working class manual labor, her rate of production is low and the quality of her workmanship is poor, exacerbated by her increased use of the drug. She is fired at the end of the New York social season, when the demand for fashionable hats has diminished.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon Rosedale, the Jewish suitor who previously had proposed marriage to Lily when she was higher on the social scale, reappears in her life and tries to rescue her, but Lily is unwilling to meet his terms. Simon wants Lily to use the love letters that she bought from Selden's servant to expose the love affair between Lawrence Selden and Bertha Dorset. For the sake of Selden's reputation, Lily does not act upon Rosedale's request and secretly burns the love letters when she visits Selden one last time.\n\nEventually, Lily Bart receives a ten-thousand-dollar inheritance from her Aunt Peniston, which she arranges to use to repay Gus Trenor. Distraught by her misfortunes, Lily has by this time begun regularly using a sleeping draught of [[chloral hydrate]] to escape the pain of poverty and social ostracism. Once she has repaid all her debts, Lily takes an overdose of the sleeping draught and dies; perhaps it is suicide, perhaps an accident.  That very morning, Lawrence Selden arrives to her quarters, to finally propose marriage, but finds Lily Bart dead.  Among her belongings are receipts for her payments toward the debt she owed to Gus Trenor, proving that her financial dealings with Trenor were honorable and not evidence of an improper relationship.  His realization allows him to feel sympathy and closeness for her, and he is clearly distraught at her death.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Lily Bart'''\u2014Wharton paints Lily, the heroine of her novel, as a complex personality with the purity that her Christian name implies, the defiance that her surname implies,{{efn|name= Bart| Jeffrey Myers tells us,  \"Lily Bart's surname means 'beard' in German; and in English 'to beard' means 'to defy' and 'to oppose boldly.' Though Lily defies social conventions, her first name is the Virgin Mary's symbol of purity and innocence . . . .\" (XXIII)<ref name=\"WorldEdithWhartonnotes\" />}} and the foolishness that the title of the novel implies.

Her extraordinary beauty should have served her well to find a wealthy husband with the requisite social status that would have secured her place in upper-class New York society. However, her inner longing to become free of her society's social conventions, her sense of what is right, and her desire for love as well as money and status have thwarted her success in spite of a number of eligible admirers over the ten years she has been on the marriage market.  Challenges to her success are her advancing age\u2014she is 29 as the novel begins\u2014the loss of her father's wealth, and the death of her parents which has left her orphaned without a caring protector, her constant efforts to \"keep up with the Joneses\"(4),{{efn|name=Jonses|Singley reports that Edith Wharton's mother, Lucretia Rhinelander Jones, had such high social aspirations, it gave rise to the expression \"keeping up with the Joneses.\"<ref name=\"Wharton's Casebook\" />}} the very modest but erratic \"allowance\" from her strait-laced Aunt Julia, and her gambling debts which make her the subject of vile gossip.  To protect Lawrence Selden's reputation, she refuses to use damning evidence against her nemesis, Bertha Dorset, which would have recouped her ruined social standing. This leads to a tragic yet heroic ending.\n\n'''Lawrence Selden'''\u2014A young lawyer who, although not wealthy himself, is able to move easily within and without Old New York's elite social circles through kinship with old-line New York families. He has known Lily since her \"coming out\" eleven years earlier. For all this time he has been in the background of her life. He views the comings and goings of New York's high society with the detachment and the objectivity of an outsider \u2014a characteristic that Lily not only admires but also that allows her to view those people in her surroundings in an objective, critical and a not-so-flattering way. She becomes fascinated and envies his independence from the \"tribe\" and the freedom that has given him.{{efn|name=gilded cage|Lily muses as she reflects on her social constraints compared to Selden's freedom, \"How alluring the world outside the [great gilt] cage appeared as she heard its door clang on her! In reality, as she knew, the door never clanged: it stood always open; but most of the captives were like flies in a bottle, and having once flown in, could never regain their freedom. It was Selden's distinction that he had never forgotten the way out.\" (70)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}} Her encounters with Selden underscore the conflict between her inner voice \u2014her self-hood at its core\u2014 and the outer voices of her reference group. It is from Selden's description, assessment and admiration of Lily's outward characteristics that we glean those attributes that contribute to New York high society's perception and misperceptions of who she is. He can be brutally honest about Lily's superficiality and artificiality and simultaneously appreciate the sparks of freedom and spontaneity that temper these negatives. These mutual admirable qualities give way to their romantic regard for one another. He is not, however, free from the social pressure of rumor. Though he has shown Lily consistent friendship, he abandons her when she becomes the victim of appearances that put her virtue, as an unmarried woman,in question.\n\n'''Simon Rosedale'''\u2014A successful and socially astute Jewish businessman\u2014the quintessential [[wiktionary:parvenu|''parvenu'']]\u2014who has the money but not the social standing to be accepted into the circle of New York's leisure class. Building his fortune in real estate, Rosedale makes his first appearance in the story when he observes Lily leaving his apartment building after what appears to be a [[:wikt:tryst|tryst]] with one of his tenants.  Rosedale is interested in Lily because not only is she beautiful, but what is more important, she is also a social asset in gaining him a place in high society. She reflects that she has put herself in his power by her clumsy dress-maker fib and her refusal to allow him to take her to the station which would have given him the prestige of being seen by members of the society with whom he was aspiring to gain acceptance.  As his social ascendency continues, he offers Lily marriage which would provide her a way out of her financial dilemma and her precarious social standing; she puts him off. His cleverness and business acumen serve him well to achieve a higher and higher rung on the social ladder. Lily, however, is on her way down to the point that Rosedale is no longer interested in marrying her. Despite the differences in their social standing , Rosedale by the end of the story shows compassion for Lily. He offers her a loan when he runs into her after she has lost her hat-making job\u2014an offer she refuses.\n\n'''Percy Gryce'''\u2014A conservative, rich, but shy and unimaginative young eligible bachelor on whom Lily, with the support of her friend Judy Trenor, sets her sights. Percy's less than titillating personality notwithstanding, Lily works out a strategy to catch him at week-long festivities at Bellomont.  Her fortuitous and successful encounter with Percy on the train to Bellomont further encourages her in pursuit of her goal. Her strategy gets interrupted, however, when Selden at week's end also appears on the scene unexpectedly. Lily then decides, on the spur of the moment, to set aside her well-thought-out tactics to pursue Percy in favor of spending some time with Selden. When, at a more rational moment, she returns to pursuing Percy, his mother-in law-to-be tells Lily at Jack Stepny's and Gwen Van Osburgh's wedding about his engagement to Evie Van Osburgh.\n\n'''Bertha Dorset (Mrs. George Dorset)'''\u2014A petite and pretty high-society matron whose husband George is extremely wealthy. She is first introduced catching the train to Bellomont where she boards with great fanfare and commotion. She demands that the porter find her a seat with her friends, Lily and Percy. Once at Bellomont Judy Trenor intimates to Lilly that Bertha is manipulative and also unscrupulous such that it is better to have her as a friend rather than an enemy. It is well known that Bertha is bored with her husband and seeks attention and love outside the confines of marriage. At Bellomont Bertha continues to pursue Selden in an attempt to rekindle the flame of an adulterous affair they have been carrying on but with which he has become disenamored. As Book I ends, she invites Lily to accompany her on a Mediterranean cruise to distract her husband so she can carry on an affair with Ned Silverton. Bertha understands, as a married woman, she must keep up appearances and ruthlessly impugns Lily's reputation to mask her own adultery. She spreads false rumors that besmirch Lily's virtue among their friends. Lily, as an unmarried woman without a protector, has little she can do in her own defense.\n\n'''Mrs. Peniston (Julia)'''\u2014Lily's wealthy, widowed Aunt \u2013sister to Lily's father.  Mrs. Peniston embodies \"old school\" morality and has a family pedigree that goes back to the industrious and successful Dutch families of early New York. Although she maintains an opulent residence on fashionable Fifth Avenue, she does not follow fashion or renovate constantly to maintain a chic appearance. In Lily's eyes, the Peniston home is therefore dingy. Mrs. Peniston's \"Old New York\" lifestyle requires keeping her drawing room neat, eating well and dressing expensively. She harbors a passive attitude and does not actively engage in life. Although she spends time in the country during the first part of the book, by the last half of the book she is a shut-in with significant heart problems. When Lily arrived in New York in financial distress after the death of her mother, Mrs. Peniston took pleasure in the public display of her generosity by agreeing to take Lily on for a year after her mother died\u2014much to the relief of the extended family. She found, to her surprise, that she liked the volatile Lily. She therefore continued to support Lily for over a decade during Lily's fruitless search for a wealthy, socially connected husband. She indulges and passively enables Lily's habit of gallivanting with her fashionable friends, and ignores the way Lily avoids and abandons her. Although Lily is clearly Julia's favorite, displacing her previous favorite Grace Stepney, Julia never makes any verbal or written promise to provide for Lily in the long term. Although Lily and her friends believe that is \"understood\" that she will inherit most if not all of Julia's fortune, Julia herself never made such a statement. Indeed, her forbearance is stretched to the limit when rumors reach her that Lily gambles for money and is encouraging attention from married men who compensate her for it. As upset as Julia is by evidence of Lily's immoral behavior, she does not immediately ask Lily for details because it is easier to discredit the messenger. When Lily comes to Julia asking for money to pay various debts, including what Lily passes off as gambling debts, Julia refuses. The relationship is permanently damaged, and when Lily sails away with the Dorsets instead of cleaning up the social and financial mess she has made, Julia does not write to Lily or attempt to repair the relationship. When word reaches her that Lily has been publicly accused of having an affair with George Dorset, and when Lily continues to gallivant in Europe instead of returning home, Julia disinherits Lily in favor of the more loyal Grace Stepney. By the time Lily returns to New York, Julia has died, and nobody knows about the disinheritance until her will is read.\n\n'''Judy Trenor (Mrs. Gus Trenor)'''\u2014Lily's best friend and confidante\u2014 is the stereotypical high-society matron, married to Gus Trenor, a successful business man. She frequently hosts large parties and social events at their country home, Bellomont. By engaging in gossip Mrs. Trenor keeps up on the social scene. She acts as matchmaker between Lily and Percy Gryce. She uses Lily as her surrogate private secretary and spends much of her day making sure that every detail of her events is done to perfection. This includes poring over lists to decide which guests are the most desirable to invite, which have been \"stolen\" by another conflicting event, and which unmarried men and women should be set up together. She invites Selden to Bellomont on anonymous advice to keep Mrs. George Dorset entertained. Judy suffers from frequent headaches and avoids noisy environments such as the opera. She must sometimes cancel minor engagements on short notice, and prefers to stay at Bellomont when her head hurts.\n\n'''Gus Trenor'''\u2014Judy Trenor's husband\u2014a massive man with a heavy carnivorous head and a very red complexion. He is a successful stock market speculator and an advocate of Simon Rosedale's acceptance in high society circles although he considers him a [[Rake (character)|bounder]]. He is also a notorious flirt and looks for attention in relationships with women outside of his marriage. Gus becomes enamored with Lily, a frequent guest at his wife's weekend social events. He uses his financial investment skills and a large sum of his own money in a risky investment for Lily which she agrees to. The proceeds from this speculation will help her pay her gambling debts and other expenses necessary to keep up appearances. The investment pays off for Lily financially, as Gus intends that it should, but the friendship turns sour when Lily is unwilling to exchange romantic attention for money the way Gus believes she tacitly agrees to do.\n\n'''Carry Fisher (Mrs. Fisher)'''\u2014A small, fiery and dramatic divorc\u00e9e. She is perceived as carrying \"a general air of embodying a 'spicy paragraph';\"(70)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\"/> and according to Mrs. Trenor, \". . .most of her alimony is paid by other people's husbands.\" (91)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" /> She sponges money from Gus Trenor to cover her bills much to his wife's chagrin. Although Gus accepts romantic favors from Mrs. Fisher in exchange for paying her bills and investing her money in the stock market, he considers her a \"battered wire-puller\"(94)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" /> in comparison to the fresh and unsullied Miss Bart. Carry is also known for bringing newcomers into high society such as Rosedale and the Wellington Brys, who had managed the miracle of making money in a falling market. After Lily has been expelled from the upper class by Bertha, Carry is one of the few people who still show compassion toward her, offering Lily support and job opportunities. Carry is an example of a woman who finds ways to earn money and to succeed in society despite being divorced and somewhat disreputable. Her presence in the story refutes the notion that Lily has no choice except to self-destruct.\n\n'''Ned Silverton'''\u2014A young man, whose first intention was to live on proofreading and write an epic, but ended up living off his friends. Ned's romantic relationship at the Bellomont house party is with Carry Fisher. Six months later, Ned accompanies Lily and the Dorsets on their Mediterranean cruise. He has an affair with Mrs Dorset, who manages to keep it concealed from most of society. Ned's increasing gambling addiction consumes not only his resources but that of his sisters, who live in poverty while he travels with Bertha Dorset. After the fling with Bertha ends, Ned participates in a scheme to help a purportedly wealthy but disreputable woman to marry the younger brother of Gwen and Evie Van Osburgh. This conspiracy, in which Lily is implicated, helps ensure Lily's downfall.\n\n'''Evie Van Osburgh'''\u2014A young, innocent, dull, and conservative, stay-at-home kind of a girl, heiress to a substantial fortune.  Judy Trenor paired her sister, Gwen, with Percy Gryce at the Sunday-night supper at Bellomont. Evie ends up getting engaged within six weeks of their stay at Bellomont to Percy Gryce due to Bertha Dorset's match-making skills.\n\n'''Gerty Farish'''\u2014Selden's cousin. She is a kind, generous woman who occupies herself with charity work, but Lily despises her because of her less than glamorous appearance. In Book Two, Gerty becomes one of Lily's only friends, giving her a place to stay and taking care of her when everyone else abandons her. Lily does not wish to continue living with Gerty or combining resources because she is unwilling to lower herself to the standard of living Gerty can afford.\n\n'''Jack Stepney and Gwen (Van Osburgh) Stepney'''\u2014A very wealthy couple\u2014guests at Bellomont just before celebrating their wedding at the Van Osburgh's estate six weeks later. They belong to Old New York's high society, although their money comes from Gwen's side. Prior to his marriage, the nearly bankrupt Jack has business dealings with Simon Rosedale and has tried to afford him entr\u00e9e into New York's high society. After marrying Gwen, Jack becomes plump, conservative, and complacent. Jack is Lily's cousin so he agrees to shelter her for the night after Bertha kicks her off her yacht for ostensibly carrying on romantically with Bertha's husband.\n\n'''Grace Stepney'''\u2014Lily's middle-aged cousin lives in a boarding house and has spent most of her life waiting on Julia Peniston. Until Lily arrived, Grace was Julia's favorite: she shares Julia's conservatism and sense of propriety, and she is willing to help out during the fall cleaning. Grace attracts and remembers all manner of gossip related to high society in general and to Lily in particular, but does not generally gossip herself. Lily treats Grace very poorly, regarding her as insignificant. When Lily prevails on her aunt Julia to exclude Grace from a family dinner party, Grace retaliates. She relays to Aunt Julia the talk about Lily's attention to Gus Trenor in exchange for money that Lily used to pay gambling debts, and stops protecting Lily from the otherwise predictable consequences of Lily's actions. When Lily comes to Grace after the reading of the will, Grace does not have the money to give Lily the loan she is asking for because the assets Grace inherited from Julia are still tied up in probate. When Lily asks Grace to borrow money against Aunt Julia's estate and lend or give it to Lily, Grace refuses.\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn the contemporary book review \"New York Society Held up to Scorn in three New Books\" (15 October 1905) ''The New York Times'' critic said that  ''The House of Mirth'' is \"a novel of remarkable power\" and that \"its varied elements are harmoniously blended, and [that] the discriminating reader who has completed the whole story in a protracted sitting, or two, must rise from it with the conviction that there are no parts of it which do not properly and essentially belong to the whole.

''The House of Mirth'' traces Lily's slow two-year social descent from privilege to a tragically lonely existence on the margins of society. In the words of one scholar, Wharton uses Lily as an attack on  \"an irresponsible, grasping and morally corrupt upper class.\"<ref name=\"A critical History\">[[Shari Benstock|Benstock, Shari]] (1994). \"A critical history of the '' House of Mirth.''\" In Ross C Murfin (series) & Shari Benstock (Eds.), ''Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism: Edith Wharton, The House of Mirth''. pp. 309-325.</ref>\n\nBefore publication as a book on October 14, 1905, ''The House of Mirth'' was serialized in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' beginning in January 1905.

At the time the novel takes place, Old New York high society was peopled by the extraordinarily wealthy who were conditioned by the economic and social changes the [[Gilded Age]] (1870\u20131900) wrought. Wharton's birth around the time of the Civil War predates that period by a little less than a decade. As a member of the privileged Old New York society,{{efn|name= Old New York| Carol Singley defines \"Old New York\" society this way:  \"Wharton's family represented a class of American aristocrats made comfortable from inherited wealth, steeped in traditional values, and well practiced in patterns of ritualized behavior.

She also had license to criticize the ways New York high society of the 1890s had changed without being vulnerable to accusations of envy motivated by coming from a lower social caste.{{efn|name=misfortune of fortune| Ironically, critics in the '20s and '30s criticized Wharton precisely because of her wealth and pedigree as a member of \"old money\"  Manhattan. They reasoned that \"such a woman could not understand the average working person. . . .\" and that \"[Wharton's]  upper-class characters. . .constituted too narrow a subject matter. . . .\" to be of any importance to the real world.

But that did not deter her as she thought something of value could be mined there. If only the writer could dig deeply enough below the surface, some \" 'stuff o' the conscience' \" could be found. She went on to declare unabashedly that: \n\n{{Quote|[I]n spite of the fact I wrote about totally insignificant people, and 'dated' them by an elaborate stage-setting of manners, furniture and costume, the book still lives and has now attained the honour of figuring on the list of the Oxford University Press. . . .

''The House of Mirth'' continues to attract readers over a century after its first publication, possibly due to its timeless theme.  That the life and death of Lily Bart matters to modern readers suggests that Wharton succeeded in her purpose: to critique \"a society so relentlessly materialistic and self-serving that it casually destroys what is most beautiful and blameless within it.\" <ref name=\"Wharton's Casebook\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[File:Scribner's for March, now ready. Everybody is talking of the house of mirth, by Edith Wharton in Scribner's. Are you reading it? LCCN2014649554.jpg|thumb|Poster for the serialized debut of ''The House of Mirth'' in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' (1905)]]\nLily Bart, a beautiful but impoverished socialite, is on her way to a house party at Bellomont, the country home of her best friend, Judy Trenor. Her pressing task is to find a husband with the requisite wealth and status to maintain her place in New York society.  Judy has arranged for her to spend more time in the company of Percy Gryce, a potential suitor who is wealthy but whom Lily finds boring. Lily grew up surrounded by elegance and luxury\u2014an atmosphere she believes she cannot live without, as she has learnt to abhor \"dinginess.\" The loss of her father's wealth and the death of her parents left her an orphan at about the age of twenty. Lacking an inheritance or a caring protector, she adapts to life as ward of her strait-laced aunt Julia Peniston from whom she receives an erratic allowance, a fashionable address, and good food, but little direction or parenting. Lily despises her aunt Julia and avoids her whenever possible while simultaneously relying on her for both necessities and luxuries.\n\nAdditional challenges to her success in the \"marriage market\" are her advancing age\u2014at age twenty-nine she has been on the \"marriage market\" for more than ten years\u2014her penchant for gambling at bridge leaving her with debts beyond her means to pay, her efforts to keep up with her wealthy friends, her innermost desire to marry for love as well as money and status, and her longing to be free of the claustrophobic constrictions and routines of upper-crust society.\n\nThreats to Lily's reputation exist because of her tendency to push the limits of polite and acceptable behavior. For example, on the way to visit Bellomont, she impulsively visits the Manhattan flat of her unmarried friend Lawrence Selden during the two-hour wait for the train. While leaving the building, she encounters Mr. Rosedale, a Jewish businessman known to her set. Attempting to cover the appearance of an indiscretion, she makes her gaffe worse by telling an obvious lie: she pretends to have been consulting her dress-maker.{{efn|name=\"Benedick\"|Rosedale tells her that he knows of no dress-makers in the Benedick and adds,\"Yes. [ Benedick ] that's the name [of the building]; I believe it's an old word for bachelor, isn't it\"(35)?<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}} This, it turns out, is not the only time Lily is caught in an obvious lie: she has the habit of misrepresenting herself and being caught.\n\nLily's week at Bellomont ends up in a series of failures beginning with losing a large sum at bridge. She fails to become engaged to Percy Gryce despite his initial interest in her. This is because although she presents herself as a conservative, innocent person to snare a conservative husband, her actions reveal that she is not the person she is pretending to be. Although she exaggerates the extent of her relationship with Percy until everyone at Bellomont thinks an engagement between them is imminent, her true character is revealed through her actions and through revelations of events from Lily's past that shock and scandalize Percy.\n\nNear the week's end, the tall, handsome and engaging Lawrence Selden unexpectedly shows up at Bellomont. Having already failed to meet Percy for morning church services, and fully aware that Lawrence has just ended an illicit relationship with the married but vindictive Bertha Dorset, Lily chooses to go for a long walk with Lawrence and to spend the afternoon with him instead of with Percy or the rest of the party. Even though Lily has already made it clear to Selden during their ''[[:wikt:t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate|t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate]]'' in his flat that she looked at him as that friend who won't be afraid to say disagreeable things to her,{{efn|name=\"friend\"| In an attempt to free herself from the socially prescribed narrative of marriage she seeks Selden's cooperation to create a new social narrative<ref name=\"drama of femininity\">Wolff, Cynthia Griffin, Lily Bart and the drama of femininity in Carol J.

Succumbing to her agreeable femininity, Selden begins to fall in love with Lily. He feels safe in nurturing an emotional attachment to her because she clearly states that she cannot and will not marry a man of his modest means. Fresh out of a four-year-long affair with a married woman, Lawrence begins to slide into another emotional attachment with the equally unavailable Lily. But Bertha, who still has feelings for Lawrence even though he just broke up with her, notices his fondness for Lily and decides to sabotage Lily's budding romance with Percy by filling him in on the most salacious and scandalous rumors about Lily's card playing and past romantic life. This effectively frightens Percy away, however Lily manages to cast the blame on Judy for having been the one to set the match up.\n\nOn her last day at Bellomont, Lily creates threats to her social standing. Gus Trenor, a very skilled stockbroker, is married to Lily's best friend Judy. Judy is not particularly jealous of Gus's occasional conversations or flirtations with other women, unless he becomes so emotionally attached to them as to spend money on them or to give them money, which Judy rightly recognizes as a sign that the relationship has become a threat to their marriage. Lily is fully aware of Judy's jealousy on the money issue, and she is aware that Judy does not approve when other women, such as the financially embarrassed Carry Fisher, persuade Gus to speculate on their behalf in the stock market. Yet Lily persuades Gus to do just that. Lacking the financial knowledge to understand the difference between a legitimate loan or speculation, Lily flirts with Gus and allows him to hold her hand and lean against her. She convinces herself that Gus is making investments on her behalf and accepts several large checks from him. On several occasions, however, Gus makes it clear that he expects romantic attention from Lily in exchange for his financial expertise. Instead of discussing the issue openly, Lily begins to play [[cat and mouse]] with him. To avoid being with him in private, she appears in public with him at the opera and for late afternoon walks in Central Park with him. This attracts other people's attention.\n\nGradually, Lily begins to suffer the consequences of her indiscreet behavior. Percy, having been scared away by Lily's behavior and Bertha Dorset's malicious gossip, proposes to a young woman named Evie Van Osburgh, who is much better suited to him than Lily and who was introduced to him by Bertha Dorset herself. Mrs. Dorset's public pride in her match-making victory results in social ridicule for Lily from the people whom she directly and indirectly misled into thinking she and Percy were all but engaged. Finally, in retribution for a social snub, Lily's cousin Grace Stepney informs their aunt Julia about rumors that Lily has gambling debts which she may be trying to cover through an inappropriate relationship with Gus Trenor.  This sows seeds of doubt and discomfort in Aunt Julia who though shocked, does not discuss the situation with her niece so as to avoid a scene.[[Image:House of Mirth 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The tragic heroine of ''The House of Mirth'' (1905), Lily Bart, lingers at the broad staircase, observing the high-society people gathered in the hall below.]] Furthermore, Lily has destroyed her relationship with Gus and Judy Trenor. Judy's attitude toward Lily has cooled, partly due to Lily's financial relationship with Gus and partly because Lily now avoids Bellomont because she does not wish to hold up her end on what everybody else believes to be a pay-for-play relationship.\n\nTo avoid having to spend time alone with her aunt, the Trenors, Simon Rosedale, or anyone else she considers a possible source of embarrassment or boredom, Lily begins to accept invitations from people with whom she would not ordinarily socialize. These include the Wellington Brys, who are newcomers to the New York social scene whose social rise is being engineered by Carry Fisher. Carry, who earns money by acting as a social secretary to usher newly wealthy people into fashionable society, invites Lily to social events hosted by Louisa Bry. Lily also attends the opera with Carry, Simon Rosedale, and Gus Trenor. In the eyes of high society, Lily cheapens herself by voluntarily associating with her social inferiors. She returns briefly to Bellomont only to find that she is now being teased by her social peers for socializing with the upstart Brys and with Simon Rosedale.\n\nLily is not entirely without resources for social rehabilitation or at least blackmail. One of her aunt's temporary servants, who is also the charwoman at Selden's apartment, sells Lily a package of torn love letters. These were written by Bertha Dorset, and they represent an opportunity for Lily to blackmail her enemy. But instead of blackmailing Bertha into a positive relationship, Lily tries to neutralize the gossip by making herself useful to Bertha. Bertha, who has a new love interest in the form of a young man named Ned Silverton, relies on Lily to distract her husband George Dorset.\n \nThe extent to which Lily's reputation is damaged becomes obvious when Lily publicly appears in a way that comes across as advertising her availability for an illicit relationship. Following Mrs. Fisher's advice, the Wellington Brys throw a large \"general entertainment\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wharton|first1=Edith (1905).|title=''The House of Mirth,'' Book I, Chapt.

The portrait shows an attractive woman suggestively clad.{{efn|name=\"Mrs. Lloyd\"|the portrait shows \"a woman in profile with her hair piled high, carving her husband's name on a tree and dressed in an ivory robe that looks diaphanously loose and provocatively clinging at once.\"<ref name=\"Mrs. Llloyd's portrait\">{{cite web|last1=Gorra |first1=Michael(2015)|title=The portrait of Miss Bart|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/05/01/house-of-mirth-portrait-miss-bart/|website=NYbooks.com/daily|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>}} As the curtain opens on this last scene, the gasp of approval heard from the audience was not so much for Reynold's brilliant interpretation of Mrs. Lloyd as it was for the loveliness of Lily Bart herself\u2014marking the pinnacle of her social success but also the annihilation of whatever reputation is left to her. For better or for worse, she has transitioned from a marriageable \"girl\" to a not-quite-reputable woman similar to Carry Fisher. Yet she does not do as Carry Fisher does, and accept the loss of her respectability as the price she must pay to maintain a position in society.\n\nAs Selden observes her in this elegantly simple ''tableau'', he sees the real Lily Bart as if for the first time{{efn|name=\"real Lily Bart\"|Wharton describes the impression Lily's pose has on Selden as \"divested of the trivialities of her little world, and catching for a moment a note of that eternal harmony of which her beauty was a part.(139)\"<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}} and feels the desire to be with her. He finds her alone in the ballroom toward the end of the musical interlude, as the collective praise from her admirers is subsiding. He leads her to a garden where he tells her he loves her and they kiss. Lily sighs, \" 'Ah, love me, love me\u2014but don't tell me so!' \" <ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" (141)/> and takes her leave.{{efn|name=\"friendship not possible|\"Lily's artistic skill has been entirely focused on reading this theatrical effect\u2014a gorgeous, static, utterly silent rendition of self. Paradoxically, it is here Selden finally supposes that he has glimpsed the real Lily Bart and that he might love her. Yet, it is also here that Lily despairs of realizing true comradeship. The very terms of her success have revealed the impossibility of concocting a new narrative with Selden. She no longer even asks for friendship but instead sadly inquires, 'Why can't we be friends? You promised once to help me' \"(22).<ref name=\"drama of femininity\" />}}  As Selden gathers his coat to leave, he is disturbed by Ned Van Alstyne's remarks, \". . . .Gad, what a show of good-looking women; but not one of 'em could touch that little cousin of mine. . . . I never knew till tonight what an outline Lily has.\" <ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" (142)/>\n\nThe next day, Lily receives two notes\u2014one from Judy Trenor inviting her to dine that evening at her town house and the other from Selden\u2014asking to meet with her the following day. Though she had a dinner engagement, she agreed to a visit with Judy at ten o'clock. However, her late-evening encounter turns out to be with Gus alone. Gus vehemently demands the kind of attention he thought he had paid for. Pleading [[wiktionary:na\u00efvet\u00e9|''na\u00efvet\u00e9'']] about business matters and appealing to their friendship, she promises to pay back the almost $10,000 she owes him. With heightened anger and resentment, he accuses Lily of playing with him while entertaining other men. Lily gets him to back off and flees, getting into a hansom cab. Shaken and feeling very much alone, she is unaware that she has been seen by both Ned Van Alstyne and Lawrence Selden, both of whom were aware that Judy was out of town and that the Trenor house in New York is occupied by Gus alone. The unspoken conclusion, shared between the two men, is that the rumors of Lily's romantic involvement with Gus Trenor have a solid basis in fact. Ned, as a relative of the family, asks Lawrence to not tell anybody what they saw. But the damage is done. Lily calls on her friend Gerty Farish for succor and shelter for the rest of the night, and returns to her aunt in the morning.\n\nThe following day Lily pleads with her aunt to help her with her debts and confesses that she has lost money gambling at bridge even on Sundays. Aunt Julia refuses to help her, except to cover the $1,000 to $2,000 bill for clothes and accessories. Feeling trapped and disgraced, she turns to thoughts of Selden as her savior and has a change of heart towards him as she looks forward to his visit at four o'clock.\n\nInstead, her visitor turns out to be Simon Rosedale who, so smitten by her appearance in the ''tableau vivant,'' proposes a marriage that would be mutually beneficial. Considering what Rosedale knows about her, she skillfully pleads for time to consider his offer {{efn|name=\"Rosedale_proposal\"|Lily skillfully says, \"But I should be selfish and ungrateful if I made [carelessness about money and worry about bills] a reason for accepting all you offer, with no better return to make than the desire to be free of my anxieties. You must give me time\u2014time to think of your kindness\u2014and of what I can give you in return for it\u2014\" (176)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}}   Selden does not appear for his 4:00 appointment nor does he send word in explanation. Instead he has departed for Havana and then on to Europe on business. This comes as a shock to Lily.\n\nTo escape the rumors arising from the gossip caused by her financial dealings with Gus Trenor, and also disappointed by what she interprets as Selden's emotional withdrawal, Lily accepts Bertha Dorset's spur-of-the- moment invitation to join her and George on a Mediterranean cruise aboard their yacht, the ''Sabrina.'' Bertha intends for Lily to keep George distracted while Bertha carries on an affair with young Ned Silverton. Lily's decision to join the Dorsets on this cruise proves to be her social undoing.\n\nIn order to divert the attention and suspicion of their social circle away from her, Bertha insinuates that Lily is carrying on a romantic and sexual liaison with George by commanding that she not return to the yacht in front of their friends at the close of a dinner the Brys held for the Duchess in Monte Carlo. Selden helps by arranging a night's lodging with her cousin Jack Stepney, under the promise that she leave promptly in the morning. The ensuing social scandal ruins Lily's reputation and almost immediately causes her friends to abandon her and Aunt Julia to disinherit her.\n\nUndeterred by such misfortunes, Lily fights to regain her place in high society by befriending Mr. and Mrs. Gormer and becoming their social secretary, so as to introduce the Gormers to high society and groom them to take a better social position. However, her enemy, the malicious Bertha Dorset, gradually communicates to them the \"scandalous\" personal background of Lily Bart, and thus undermines the friendship which Lily had hoped would socially rehabilitate her. Only two friends remain for Lily: Gerty Farish (a cousin of Lawrence Selden) and Carry Fisher, who help her cope with the social ignominy of a degraded social status while continually advising Lily to marry as soon as reasonably possible.\n\nDespite the efforts and advice of Gerty and Carry to help her overcome notoriety, Lily descends through the [[social stratification|social strata]] of New York City's high society. She obtains a job as personal secretary of Mrs. Hatch, a disreputable woman who very nearly succeeds in marrying a wealthy young man in Lily's former social circle. It is during this occupation she is introduced to the use of chloral hydrate, sold in drugstores, as a remedy for malaise.  She resigns her position after Lawrence Selden returns to warn her of the danger, but not in time to avoid being blamed for the crisis. Lily then finds a job in a [[Hatmaking|milliner's]] shop; yet, unaccustomed to the rigors of working class manual labor, her rate of production is low and the quality of her workmanship is poor, exacerbated by her increased use of the drug. She is fired at the end of the New York social season, when the demand for fashionable hats has diminished.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon Rosedale, the Jewish suitor who previously had proposed marriage to Lily when she was higher on the social scale, reappears in her life and tries to rescue her, but Lily is unwilling to meet his terms. Simon wants Lily to use the love letters that she bought from Selden's servant to expose the love affair between Lawrence Selden and Bertha Dorset. For the sake of Selden's reputation, Lily does not act upon Rosedale's request and secretly burns the love letters when she visits Selden one last time.\n\nEventually, Lily Bart receives a ten-thousand-dollar inheritance from her Aunt Peniston, which she arranges to use to repay Gus Trenor. Distraught by her misfortunes, Lily has by this time begun regularly using a sleeping draught of [[chloral hydrate]] to escape the pain of poverty and social ostracism. Once she has repaid all her debts, Lily takes an overdose of the sleeping draught and dies; perhaps it is suicide, perhaps an accident.  That very morning, Lawrence Selden arrives to her quarters, to finally propose marriage, but finds Lily Bart dead.  Among her belongings are receipts for her payments toward the debt she owed to Gus Trenor, proving that her financial dealings with Trenor were honorable and not evidence of an improper relationship.  His realization allows him to feel sympathy and closeness for her, and he is clearly distraught at her death.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Lily Bart'''\u2014Wharton paints Lily, the heroine of her novel, as a complex personality with the purity that her Christian name implies, the defiance that her surname implies,{{efn|name= Bart| Jeffrey Myers tells us,  \"Lily Bart's surname means 'beard' in German; and in English 'to beard' means 'to defy' and 'to oppose boldly.' Though Lily defies social conventions, her first name is the Virgin Mary's symbol of purity and innocence . . . .\" (XXIII)<ref name=\"WorldEdithWhartonnotes\" />}} and the foolishness that the title of the novel implies.

Her extraordinary beauty should have served her well to find a wealthy husband with the requisite social status that would have secured her place in upper-class New York society. However, her inner longing to become free of her society's social conventions, her sense of what is right, and her desire for love as well as money and status have thwarted her success in spite of a number of eligible admirers over the ten years she has been on the marriage market.  Challenges to her success are her advancing age\u2014she is 29 as the novel begins\u2014the loss of her father's wealth, and the death of her parents which has left her orphaned without a caring protector, her constant efforts to \"keep up with the Joneses\"(4),{{efn|name=Jonses|Singley reports that Edith Wharton's mother, Lucretia Rhinelander Jones, had such high social aspirations, it gave rise to the expression \"keeping up with the Joneses.\"<ref name=\"Wharton's Casebook\" />}} the very modest but erratic \"allowance\" from her strait-laced Aunt Julia, and her gambling debts which make her the subject of vile gossip.  To protect Lawrence Selden's reputation, she refuses to use damning evidence against her nemesis, Bertha Dorset, which would have recouped her ruined social standing. This leads to a tragic yet heroic ending.\n\n'''Lawrence Selden'''\u2014A young lawyer who, although not wealthy himself, is able to move easily within and without Old New York's elite social circles through kinship with old-line New York families. He has known Lily since her \"coming out\" eleven years earlier. For all this time he has been in the background of her life. He views the comings and goings of New York's high society with the detachment and the objectivity of an outsider \u2014a characteristic that Lily not only admires but also that allows her to view those people in her surroundings in an objective, critical and a not-so-flattering way. She becomes fascinated and envies his independence from the \"tribe\" and the freedom that has given him.{{efn|name=gilded cage|Lily muses as she reflects on her social constraints compared to Selden's freedom, \"How alluring the world outside the [great gilt] cage appeared as she heard its door clang on her! In reality, as she knew, the door never clanged: it stood always open; but most of the captives were like flies in a bottle, and having once flown in, could never regain their freedom. It was Selden's distinction that he had never forgotten the way out.\" (70)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" />}} Her encounters with Selden underscore the conflict between her inner voice \u2014her self-hood at its core\u2014 and the outer voices of her reference group. It is from Selden's description, assessment and admiration of Lily's outward characteristics that we glean those attributes that contribute to New York high society's perception and misperceptions of who she is. He can be brutally honest about Lily's superficiality and artificiality and simultaneously appreciate the sparks of freedom and spontaneity that temper these negatives. These mutual admirable qualities give way to their romantic regard for one another. He is not, however, free from the social pressure of rumor. Though he has shown Lily consistent friendship, he abandons her when she becomes the victim of appearances that put her virtue, as an unmarried woman,in question.\n\n'''Simon Rosedale'''\u2014A successful and socially astute Jewish businessman\u2014the quintessential [[wiktionary:parvenu|''parvenu'']]\u2014who has the money but not the social standing to be accepted into the circle of New York's leisure class. Building his fortune in real estate, Rosedale makes his first appearance in the story when he observes Lily leaving his apartment building after what appears to be a [[:wikt:tryst|tryst]] with one of his tenants.  Rosedale is interested in Lily because not only is she beautiful, but what is more important, she is also a social asset in gaining him a place in high society. She reflects that she has put herself in his power by her clumsy dress-maker fib and her refusal to allow him to take her to the station which would have given him the prestige of being seen by members of the society with whom he was aspiring to gain acceptance.  As his social ascendency continues, he offers Lily marriage which would provide her a way out of her financial dilemma and her precarious social standing; she puts him off. His cleverness and business acumen serve him well to achieve a higher and higher rung on the social ladder. Lily, however, is on her way down to the point that Rosedale is no longer interested in marrying her. Despite the differences in their social standing , Rosedale by the end of the story shows compassion for Lily. He offers her a loan when he runs into her after she has lost her hat-making job\u2014an offer she refuses.\n\n'''Percy Gryce'''\u2014A conservative, rich, but shy and unimaginative young eligible bachelor on whom Lily, with the support of her friend Judy Trenor, sets her sights. Percy's less than titillating personality notwithstanding, Lily works out a strategy to catch him at week-long festivities at Bellomont.  Her fortuitous and successful encounter with Percy on the train to Bellomont further encourages her in pursuit of her goal. Her strategy gets interrupted, however, when Selden at week's end also appears on the scene unexpectedly. Lily then decides, on the spur of the moment, to set aside her well-thought-out tactics to pursue Percy in favor of spending some time with Selden. When, at a more rational moment, she returns to pursuing Percy, his mother-in law-to-be tells Lily at Jack Stepny's and Gwen Van Osburgh's wedding about his engagement to Evie Van Osburgh.\n\n'''Bertha Dorset (Mrs. George Dorset)'''\u2014A petite and pretty high-society matron whose husband George is extremely wealthy. She is first introduced catching the train to Bellomont where she boards with great fanfare and commotion. She demands that the porter find her a seat with her friends, Lily and Percy. Once at Bellomont Judy Trenor intimates to Lilly that Bertha is manipulative and also unscrupulous such that it is better to have her as a friend rather than an enemy. It is well known that Bertha is bored with her husband and seeks attention and love outside the confines of marriage. At Bellomont Bertha continues to pursue Selden in an attempt to rekindle the flame of an adulterous affair they have been carrying on but with which he has become disenamored. As Book I ends, she invites Lily to accompany her on a Mediterranean cruise to distract her husband so she can carry on an affair with Ned Silverton. Bertha understands, as a married woman, she must keep up appearances and ruthlessly impugns Lily's reputation to mask her own adultery. She spreads false rumors that besmirch Lily's virtue among their friends. Lily, as an unmarried woman without a protector, has little she can do in her own defense.\n\n'''Mrs. Peniston (Julia)'''\u2014Lily's wealthy, widowed Aunt \u2013sister to Lily's father.  Mrs. Peniston embodies \"old school\" morality and has a family pedigree that goes back to the industrious and successful Dutch families of early New York. Although she maintains an opulent residence on fashionable Fifth Avenue, she does not follow fashion or renovate constantly to maintain a chic appearance. In Lily's eyes, the Peniston home is therefore dingy. Mrs. Peniston's \"Old New York\" lifestyle requires keeping her drawing room neat, eating well and dressing expensively. She harbors a passive attitude and does not actively engage in life. Although she spends time in the country during the first part of the book, by the last half of the book she is a shut-in with significant heart problems. When Lily arrived in New York in financial distress after the death of her mother, Mrs. Peniston took pleasure in the public display of her generosity by agreeing to take Lily on for a year after her mother died\u2014much to the relief of the extended family. She found, to her surprise, that she liked the volatile Lily. She therefore continued to support Lily for over a decade during Lily's fruitless search for a wealthy, socially connected husband. She indulges and passively enables Lily's habit of gallivanting with her fashionable friends, and ignores the way Lily avoids and abandons her. Although Lily is clearly Julia's favorite, displacing her previous favorite Grace Stepney, Julia never makes any verbal or written promise to provide for Lily in the long term. Although Lily and her friends believe that is \"understood\" that she will inherit most if not all of Julia's fortune, Julia herself never made such a statement. Indeed, her forbearance is stretched to the limit when rumors reach her that Lily gambles for money and is encouraging attention from married men who compensate her for it. As upset as Julia is by evidence of Lily's immoral behavior, she does not immediately ask Lily for details because it is easier to discredit the messenger. When Lily comes to Julia asking for money to pay various debts, including what Lily passes off as gambling debts, Julia refuses. The relationship is permanently damaged, and when Lily sails away with the Dorsets instead of cleaning up the social and financial mess she has made, Julia does not write to Lily or attempt to repair the relationship. When word reaches her that Lily has been publicly accused of having an affair with George Dorset, and when Lily continues to gallivant in Europe instead of returning home, Julia disinherits Lily in favor of the more loyal Grace Stepney. By the time Lily returns to New York, Julia has died, and nobody knows about the disinheritance until her will is read.\n\n'''Judy Trenor (Mrs. Gus Trenor)'''\u2014Lily's best friend and confidante\u2014 is the stereotypical high-society matron, married to Gus Trenor, a successful business man. She frequently hosts large parties and social events at their country home, Bellomont. By engaging in gossip Mrs. Trenor keeps up on the social scene. She acts as matchmaker between Lily and Percy Gryce. She uses Lily as her surrogate private secretary and spends much of her day making sure that every detail of her events is done to perfection. This includes poring over lists to decide which guests are the most desirable to invite, which have been \"stolen\" by another conflicting event, and which unmarried men and women should be set up together. She invites Selden to Bellomont on anonymous advice to keep Mrs. George Dorset entertained. Judy suffers from frequent headaches and avoids noisy environments such as the opera. She must sometimes cancel minor engagements on short notice, and prefers to stay at Bellomont when her head hurts.\n\n'''Gus Trenor'''\u2014Judy Trenor's husband\u2014a massive man with a heavy carnivorous head and a very red complexion. He is a successful stock market speculator and an advocate of Simon Rosedale's acceptance in high society circles although he considers him a [[Rake (character)|bounder]]. He is also a notorious flirt and looks for attention in relationships with women outside of his marriage. Gus becomes enamored with Lily, a frequent guest at his wife's weekend social events. He uses his financial investment skills and a large sum of his own money in a risky investment for Lily which she agrees to. The proceeds from this speculation will help her pay her gambling debts and other expenses necessary to keep up appearances. The investment pays off for Lily financially, as Gus intends that it should, but the friendship turns sour when Lily is unwilling to exchange romantic attention for money the way Gus believes she tacitly agrees to do.\n\n'''Carry Fisher (Mrs. Fisher)'''\u2014A small, fiery and dramatic divorc\u00e9e. She is perceived as carrying \"a general air of embodying a 'spicy paragraph';\"(70)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\"/> and according to Mrs. Trenor, \". . .most of her alimony is paid by other people's husbands.\" (91)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" /> She sponges money from Gus Trenor to cover her bills much to his wife's chagrin. Although Gus accepts romantic favors from Mrs. Fisher in exchange for paying her bills and investing her money in the stock market, he considers her a \"battered wire-puller\"(94)<ref name=\"The House of Mirth\" /> in comparison to the fresh and unsullied Miss Bart. Carry is also known for bringing newcomers into high society such as Rosedale and the Wellington Brys, who had managed the miracle of making money in a falling market. After Lily has been expelled from the upper class by Bertha, Carry is one of the few people who still show compassion toward her, offering Lily support and job opportunities. Carry is an example of a woman who finds ways to earn money and to succeed in society despite being divorced and somewhat disreputable. Her presence in the story refutes the notion that Lily has no choice except to self-destruct.\n\n'''Ned Silverton'''\u2014A young man, whose first intention was to live on proofreading and write an epic, but ended up living off his friends. Ned's romantic relationship at the Bellomont house party is with Carry Fisher. Six months later, Ned accompanies Lily and the Dorsets on their Mediterranean cruise. He has an affair with Mrs Dorset, who manages to keep it concealed from most of society. Ned's increasing gambling addiction consumes not only his resources but that of his sisters, who live in poverty while he travels with Bertha Dorset. After the fling with Bertha ends, Ned participates in a scheme to help a purportedly wealthy but disreputable woman to marry the younger brother of Gwen and Evie Van Osburgh. This conspiracy, in which Lily is implicated, helps ensure Lily's downfall.\n\n'''Evie Van Osburgh'''\u2014A young, innocent, dull, and conservative, stay-at-home kind of a girl, heiress to a substantial fortune.  Judy Trenor paired her sister, Gwen, with Percy Gryce at the Sunday-night supper at Bellomont. Evie ends up getting engaged within six weeks of their stay at Bellomont to Percy Gryce due to Bertha Dorset's match-making skills.\n\n'''Gerty Farish'''\u2014Selden's cousin. She is a kind, generous woman who occupies herself with charity work, but Lily despises her because of her less than glamorous appearance. In Book Two, Gerty becomes one of Lily's only friends, giving her a place to stay and taking care of her when everyone else abandons her. Lily does not wish to continue living with Gerty or combining resources because she is unwilling to lower herself to the standard of living Gerty can afford.\n\n'''Jack Stepney and Gwen (Van Osburgh) Stepney'''\u2014A very wealthy couple\u2014guests at Bellomont just before celebrating their wedding at the Van Osburgh's estate six weeks later. They belong to Old New York's high society, although their money comes from Gwen's side. Prior to his marriage, the nearly bankrupt Jack has business dealings with Simon Rosedale and has tried to afford him entr\u00e9e into New York's high society. After marrying Gwen, Jack becomes plump, conservative, and complacent. Jack is Lily's cousin so he agrees to shelter her for the night after Bertha kicks her off her yacht for ostensibly carrying on romantically with Bertha's husband.\n\n'''Grace Stepney'''\u2014Lily's middle-aged cousin lives in a boarding house and has spent most of her life waiting on Julia Peniston. Until Lily arrived, Grace was Julia's favorite: she shares Julia's conservatism and sense of propriety, and she is willing to help out during the fall cleaning. Grace attracts and remembers all manner of gossip related to high society in general and to Lily in particular, but does not generally gossip herself. Lily treats Grace very poorly, regarding her as insignificant. When Lily prevails on her aunt Julia to exclude Grace from a family dinner party, Grace retaliates. She relays to Aunt Julia the talk about Lily's attention to Gus Trenor in exchange for money that Lily used to pay gambling debts, and stops protecting Lily from the otherwise predictable consequences of Lily's actions. When Lily comes to Grace after the reading of the will, Grace does not have the money to give Lily the loan she is asking for because the assets Grace inherited from Julia are still tied up in probate. When Lily asks Grace to borrow money against Aunt Julia's estate and lend or give it to Lily, Grace refuses.\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn the contemporary book review \"New York Society Held up to Scorn in three New Books\" (15 October 1905) ''The New York Times'' critic said that  ''The House of Mirth'' is \"a novel of remarkable power\" and that \"its varied elements are harmoniously blended, and [that] the discriminating reader who has completed the whole story in a protracted sitting, or two, must rise from it with the conviction that there are no parts of it which do not properly and essentially belong to the whole. Its descriptive passages have verity and charm, it has the saving grace of humor, its multitude of personages, as we have said, all have the semblance of life.\"<ref>\"New York Society Held Up to Scorn in Three New Books,\" New York Times, October 15, 1905</ref>\n\nThe publication of the novel prompted letters to the editor of the \"New York Times Saturday Review of Books\" which argued the merits of the story, saying that the novel was a faithful and true portrait of the New York City gentry, while detractors said that it impugned the character of the city's social \u00e9lite as heartless and materialist [[Theory of the Leisure Class|leisure class]].<ref>Letter to the editor of the ''New York Times Saturday Review of Books'', 3 March 1906.</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe novel ''The House of Mirth'' (1905) has been adapted to radio, the stage and the cinema.\n\n* ''The Play of the novel The House of Mirth'' (1906), by Edith Wharton and [[Clyde Fitch]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2897041 | publisher = National Library | place = Australia | title = Catalogue | contribution = The House of Mirth: The Play of the Novel, Dramatized by Edith Wharton and Clyde Fitch, 1906; edited, with an introd., notes, and appendixes by Glenn Loney}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000223W/The_play_of_the_novel_The_house_of_mirth | publisher = Open library | title = The House of Mirth: The Play of the Novel, Dramatized by Edith Wharton and Clyde Fitch, 1906; edited, with an introd., notes, and appendixes by Glenn Loney}}.</ref>\n* ''[[The House of Mirth (1918 film)|La Maison du Brouillard]]'' (1918), directed by [[Albert Capellani]], featured [[Katherine Harris Barrymore]] as Lily Bart; a French silent film.\n* ''The House of Mirth'' was presented on radio's ''[[The United States Steel Hour#Theatre Guild on the Air|Theatre Guild on the Air]]'' December 14, 1952.

Both Australia and New Zealand claim Phar Lap. Gloaming, an Australian-bred horse, raced in Australia and in New Zealand.\n\n===Women jockeys===\nIn 1977 the New Zealand Racing Conference accepted female jockeys and they became eligible to ride on 15 July 1978. Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice\u2019s licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. \n\nThe first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru.<ref>https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2018/07/13/sue-historic-day-40-years-racing-milestone/</ref> Other female riders then included [[Jo Giles |Joanne Hale]], Vivienne Kaye, Joanne Lamond and Cherie Saxon.<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=3541362</ref> \n\nLinda Jones\u2019 first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby).  Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia (Doomben).<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12088993</ref>\n\nFemale riders have subsequently gone on to win the New Zealand premiership; Lisa Cropp (2005-2007), Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016 and 2019) and Samantha Collett (2018).\n\nIn late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh.<ref>https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/238767/jockey-lisa-allpress-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia</ref> She was competing in the inaugural International jockeys challenge in which she competed with 14 other jockeys including 7 women.

Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice\u2019s licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. \n\nThe first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru<ref>https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2018/07/13/sue-historic-day-40-years-racing-milestone/</ref>. Other female riders then included [[Jo Giles |Joanne Hale]], Vivienne Kaye, Joanne Lamond and Cherie Saxon<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=3541362</ref>. \n\nLinda Jones\u2019 first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby).  Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia (Doomben).<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12088993</ref>\n\nFemale riders have subsequently gone on to win the New Zealand premiership; Lisa Cropp (2005-2007), Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016 and 2019) and Samantha Collett (2018).\n\nIn late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh<ref>https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/238767/jockey-lisa-allpress-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia</ref>. She was competing in the inaugural International jockeys challenge in which she competed with 14 other jockeys including 7 women. The challenge was won by American Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith, Swiss-born Germany based Sibylle Vogt was second while Lisa was third equal with French jockey Mickaelle Michel<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/racing/119949865/lisa-allpress-becomes-first-female-jockey-to-ride-a-winner-in-saudi-arabia</ref>.\n\n===New Zealand horses in Australia===\n\nHorses frequently move between New Zealand and its neighbour [[Australia]], for races and for [[Horse breeding|breeding]] purposes. \n\nBetween 1882 and {{as of | 2019 | alt = 2019}} New Zealand-bred horses won Australia's [[Melbourne Cup]] 43 times.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!-- no byline --> |title=Melbourne Cup 2019 full guide: Kiwi connections, prizemoney, livestream |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/racing/117158773/melbourne-cup-2019-full-guide-kiwi-connections-prizemoney-livestream |accessdate=25 January 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=November 5, 2019 }}</ref> During the 2008-09 racing season 19 New Zealand-bred Thoroughbreds won 22 [[Group One]] races around the world.<ref>\nRacetrack Sires 2009, June/August, 2009, ''Record season for the New Zealand breed'', p.52\n</ref>\n\n==Race clubs and courses of New Zealand==\n\nThoroughbred racing is held throughout New Zealand, including courses in some of the smaller centres.\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"; style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:100%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"LightSteelBlue\" align=\"center\"\n! width=\"100px\" | '''Club'''<br />\n! width=\"170px\" | '''Course, Town/city/province'''  <br />\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Track'''\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Direction'''\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Straight'''\n! width=\"150px\" | '''Notes'''  <br />\n|-\n| Ashburton RC     || [[Ashburton, New Zealand]]  || 1876m ||left-handed || 382m ||\n|-\n| Auckland RC   || [[Ellerslie Racecourse]], Auckland  ||  1876m ||right-handed ||382m||\n|-\n| Avondale JC   || [[Avondale, Auckland]] ||  1800m ||right-handed|| 450m ||\n|-\n| Banks Peninsula RC|| Motukarara, Canterbury  ||  1800m ||left-handed  ||400m||\n|-\n| Beaumont RC    || Wingatui, Dunedin (since 1987) || 2000m|| left-handed ||350m || Part of Gallop South \n|-\n| Cambridge RC     || Te Rapa, Hamilton || 1800m || left-handed || 420m|| Owns training course/complex at Cambridge\n|-\n| Canterbury JC    || [[Riccarton Park Racecourse | Riccarton Park]], Christchurch  || 2400m || left-handed ||400m||\n|-\n| Central Otago RC    || Omakau  || 1600m ||left-handed|| 300m|| Part of Gallop South \n|-\n| Counties RC    || Pukekohe Park, Franklin  ||1900m ||right-handed ||520m ||\n|-\n| Dargaville RC    || Awakino Point   ||1600m ||left-handed || 350m|| 1 meeting per year, in November \n|-\n| Egmont RC    || Hawera || 1822m||left-handed ||350m ||\n|-\n| Feilding JC    || Awapuni, Palmerston North  ||  1700m ||left-handed || 350m || Part of RACE\n|-\n| Foxton RC    || Previously raced at Foxton, Horowhenua  ||1811m || left-handed||349m ||Trials only.
