Every episode ends with the family being ripped off, or either of the men getting a beating from his wife for flirting with other women. The storyline starts off with Nabeel and Mehmood living in an apartment as bachelors and progresses to both of them marrying and having children.\n\nThe show is known to break the [[fourth wall]] all the time.\n\n====Episode 1-25 (Pre-marriage)====\nNabeel's childhood friend Ahmad moves abroad and tells Nabeel to look after his apartment. Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. Nabeel tells him that the nikah is already read, and he gets really angry, later he is convinced to eat biryani which later calms down his mood.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (After marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Nabeel gets a call from Ahmad, who tells him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, and that they have two days to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel. Nabeel is forced to attend the job interview by his wife Khoobsurat. Nabeel later gets declined due to his demanding of a salary of 3-4 lakhs, saying he is made for much bigger things and will not work for anyone who does not see his true potential.\n\n====Episode 83-87 (Bubulay in Dubai)====\nThe Bulbulay family goes to [[Dubai]] but without telling each other. Nabeel and Khoobsurat win a trip to Dubai from a lucky draw. Mehmood and Mumtaz go to Dubai for their honeymoon, with their own money. They happen to be booked into the same hotel. While walking in the hall, Nabeel and Mehmood bump into each other; they pretend that they don't know each other and rush back to their rooms. When both families have plans to go to the Oasis Mall, and both Mehmood and Nabeel are taking showers in their rooms, Khoobsurat and Momo wait for them in the hotel lobby and see each other clearly. \n\nMomo goes out of the hotel to avoid Khoobsurat and rushes off in a taxi to the mall.  Khoobsurat, Nabeel, and Mehmood go out to find her. After they're reunited, they go to Ibn Battuta Mall the next day, where they meet FM radio producers and are offered jobs that don't work out. Nabeel later meets a woman and starts firting with her, and convincing her that he is rich, having many businesses. Mehmood sab finds out, and tries to stop Nabeel but backfires. Afterwards, the family headed towards the mall, Nabeel makes up excuses to go back to the hotel, so Mehmood sab drugs Nabeel's coffee cup to ruin his date. Nabeel then returns back to the hotel and invites the woman to stay in his hotel room, he kept going to the washroom repeatedly due to the effect of the drug. Khoobsurat returns back from the mall and discoveres the truth, which later on makes her angry at Nabeel.\n\nThe next day, Momo meets a man in the hotel lounge and mistakenly picks up his bag thinking it's hers. The man was ordered by his boss to follow Momo to get the bag back. Meanwhile the boss, who the bag had belonged to, finds out that Momo is the leader of the Bulbulay gang so he captures Nabeel, Mehmood and Khoobsurat then blackmails Momo to return the bag in exchange for her gang. The boss then orders the man to capture the bag from her possesion, Momo realising that the bag has cash inside; instead gives a small portion of the money to the man. The boss frees the family thinking the man had received the money. Momo still having possesion of the bag tells the family and they immediately rush towards the airport.\n\n====Episode 88-100 (pre-parenthood)====\nWhile returning home from Dubai, Momo loses her bag at the airport. Khoobsurat becomes ill and the others start avoiding her in the fear of catching her disease. Later, Khoobsurat is found to be pregnant, shortly after which Momo also becomes pregnant.

In 1935 Aeroput operated three times weekly the non-stop route Belgrade \u2013 Sarajevo, which was extended to [[Dubrovnik]] a year later. In 1937 Aeroput included regular flights linking Sarajevo to Zagreb, and 1938 was the year when first international flights were introduced when Aeroput extended the route Dubrovnik \u2013 Sarajevo \u2013 Zagreb to Vienna, Brno, and Prague.<ref name=\"aeroput\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/aeroput-first-airline-landed-sarajevo/|title=Aeroput, the First Airline that Landed in Sarajevo|date=21 April 2014|website=Sarajevotimes.com|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe airfield in Butmir remained in use all the way until 1969. The need for a new airport in Sarajevo, with an asphalt-concrete runway, was acknowledged in the mid-1960s when JAT, Yugoslav national carrier at that time, began acquiring jet planes. The construction of the airport began in 1966 at its present location, not far from the old one.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSarajevo Airport opened on 2 June 1969 for domestic traffic. In 1970 [[Frankfurt]] became the first international destination served. Most of the time the airport was a 'feeder' airport where passengers embarked for flights to [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]] on their way to international destinations. Over time the traffic volume steadily grew from 70,000 to 600,000 passengers a year. The first renovation came for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], when the runway was extended by 200 meters, the navigation system was improved, and a new terminal building was built, designed for 1 million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Bosnian War]] the airport was put under control of [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). When the regular flights were stopped the JNA evacuated some 30,000 people, mostly women and children, who were spouses and children of JNA officers fleeing the [[siege of Sarajevo]]; the first humanitarian aid from the US and France arrived in this period too.<ref name=\"Two Days Till Peace - A Sarajevo Airport Story\">{{Cite web |url=http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831162049/http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |archive-date=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After JNA left, the airport was for a while under control of Bosnian Serb forces and in June 1992 they handed over the airport to the UN to use it for humanitarian purposes (UN Security Council Resolution 757).

Current work is undergoing on expansion of arrival area, adding more passport control check stands and rearranging whole arrival area to make it more passenger friendly. Next to follow is expansion of check in area which will include three more check in counters making it total of 15 check in counters. By the end of the year the airport will begin with platform expansion and the construction of rapid exit taxiway with scheduled completion by mid of the next year. 2017 should be the year in which airport will enter into the reconstruction of the runway and the maneuvering areas. Expansion of the airport at the current level is financed by Sarajevo Airport own funds.

About 40% of flights were canceled which impacted passengers growth and financial loss to the airport. Airport handled only 28.167 passengers of 50.000 planned (last year in December 43.079 passengers were handled). For Sarajevo International Airport one of major restrictions is a mountain terrain that requires a high approach precision and a big inclination angle in a procedure of unsuccessful approach and landing. Mr Vlado Juri\u0107, Head of the Office for aviation safety at Bosnia and Herzegovina Air Navigation Services Agency (BHANSA), presented the information about problems caused by reduced minimums at Sarajevo Airport. For the implementation of ILS categories (CAT II or CAT III), the terrain in front of the runway start should be free of obstacles for at least 1000 meters. It means that the RWY 12 threshold should be moved for additional 200 meters which would reduce the runway length and as such is unacceptable. From the point of view of procedure design, the reduction of minimums is not an option and therefore it is necessary to find other solutions for improvement of landing conditions at Sarajevo Airport. The biggest problem at Sarajevo Airport is fog. The representative of Sarajevo Airport, Mr Nermin Zijadi\u0107 informed that there is a relevant plan regarding this problem. He also presented the information about future projects of Sarajevo Airport among which the most important one is a reconstruction of the runway including its lighting system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-airport.ba/vijest.php?id=426&lang=eng|title=Sarajevo-Airport.ba - Me\u0111unarodni aerodrom Sarajevo|website=Sarajevo-airport.ba}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Qatar Airways]] announced a new route from [[Doha]] to Sarajevo.

Nobody was injured in the accident, nor was there any damage. By next Monday afternoon, the aircraft had been recovered and was parked on the apron. The French Air Detachment (DETAIR) and local aeronautical authorities have opened an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. It was snowing on the afternoon of 23 Dec.. The airport snow plough had just cleared the runway, a 20-minute job, when an HB-IXH from Z\u00fcrich requested authorization to land.\" In those circumstances, the air traffic controller cannot give authorization. He only informs the pilot and the pilot is the one who has the responsibility to take the decision to land,\" said Maj. Olivier Mrowiki, air deputy commander. \"The pilot (captain) decided to land and began the IFR approach procedure. The maneuver was correct and the touch down (landing) was perfect.

In 1935 Aeroput operated three times weekly the non-stop route Belgrade \u2013 Sarajevo, which was extended to [[Dubrovnik]] a year later. In 1937 Aeroput included regular flights linking Sarajevo to Zagreb, and 1938 was the year when first international flights were introduced when Aeroput extended the route Dubrovnik \u2013 Sarajevo \u2013 Zagreb to Vienna, Brno, and Prague.<ref name=\"aeroput\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/aeroput-first-airline-landed-sarajevo/|title=Aeroput, the First Airline that Landed in Sarajevo|date=21 April 2014|website=Sarajevotimes.com|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe airfield in Butmir remained in use all the way until 1969. The need for a new airport in Sarajevo, with an asphalt-concrete runway, was acknowledged in the mid-1960s when JAT, Yugoslav national carrier at that time, began acquiring jet planes. The construction of the airport began in 1966 at its present location, not far from the old one.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSarajevo Airport opened on 2 June 1969 for domestic traffic. In 1970 [[Frankfurt]] became the first international destination served. Most of the time the airport was a 'feeder' airport where passengers embarked for flights to [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]] on their way to international destinations. Over time the traffic volume steadily grew from 70,000 to 600,000 passengers a year. The first renovation came for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], when the runway was extended by 200 meters, the navigation system was improved, and a new terminal building was built, designed for 1 million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Bosnian War]] the airport was put under control of [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). When the regular flights were stopped the JNA evacuated some 30,000 people, mostly women and children, who were spouses and children of JNA officers fleeing the [[siege of Sarajevo]]; the first humanitarian aid from the US and France arrived in this period too.<ref name=\"Two Days Till Peace - A Sarajevo Airport Story\">{{Cite web |url=http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831162049/http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |archive-date=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After JNA left, the airport was for a while under control of Bosnian Serb forces and in June 1992 they handed over the airport to the UN to use it for humanitarian purposes (UN Security Council Resolution 757). In the biggest humanitarian operation in history of the UN that followed, during the Bosnian war, some 13,000 flights were carried out and over 160,000 tons of international humanitarian aid was delivered to the besieged city of Sarajevo.<ref name=\"Two Days Till Peace - A Sarajevo Airport Story\"/>\n\nThe airport re-opened to civilian air traffic on 16 August 1996 and has since been renovated and slowly restored. Since the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1996, the airport has a commercial flight business which includes [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Air Serbia]], [[Croatia Airlines]], [[Turkish Airlines]], and others.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\n\nOn 18 October 2005, [[Paddy Ashdown]], the High Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, suspended a decision by Bosnian authorities to name the airport after [[Alija Izetbegovi\u0107]], the first President of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The High Representative stated that such a renaming might undermine the reconciliation process by alienating non-Bosniak citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pressr/default.asp?content_id=35695|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234242/http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pressr/default.asp?content_id=35695|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 September 2007|title=High Representative Suspends Decision Renaming Sarajevo International Airport|date=26 September 2007|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> In 2005, the European branch of the [[Airports Council International]] awarded Sarajevo the award of ''Best Airport Under 1 Million Passengers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aci-europe.org/upload/Excellence%20in%20airport%20operations%20-%201st%20ACI%20EUROPE%20Best%20Airport%20Awards.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923224953/http://www.aci-europe.org/upload/Excellence%20in%20airport%20operations%20-%201st%20ACI%20EUROPE%20Best%20Airport%20Awards.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 September 2006|title=Excellence in airport operations : 1st ACI EUROPE Best Airport Awards|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Sarajevo International Airport had 665,638 passengers which is more than all of the other airports in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] had together and a 14.7% increase from 2012, this is the highest number of passengers per year since the reopening of the airport.

Current work is undergoing on expansion of arrival area, adding more passport control check stands and rearranging whole arrival area to make it more passenger friendly. Next to follow is expansion of check in area which will include three more check in counters making it total of 15 check in counters. By the end of the year the airport will begin with platform expansion and the construction of rapid exit taxiway with scheduled completion by mid of the next year. 2017 should be the year in which airport will enter into the reconstruction of the runway and the maneuvering areas. Expansion of the airport at the current level is financed by Sarajevo Airport own funds. On 6 June 2015 Pope Francis visited Sarajevo arriving on an [[Alitalia]] [[Airbus A320 family#A320|Airbus A320-200]] from [[Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport|Rome]]. Welcome ceremony was held at Sarajevo International Airport.\n\nThe airport served as the home base for the country's [[flag carrier]], [[B&H Airlines]], until July 2015 when the airline ceased operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/38492-sarajevo-to-shut-down-bh-airlines-citing-mounting-debts|title=Sarajevo to shut down B&H Airlines citing mounting debts|website=Ch-aviation.com|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> During December 2015, Sarajevo Airport experienced very low visibility and fog. About 40% of flights were canceled which impacted passengers growth and financial loss to the airport. Airport handled only 28.167 passengers of 50.000 planned (last year in December 43.079 passengers were handled). For Sarajevo International Airport one of major restrictions is a mountain terrain that requires a high approach precision and a big inclination angle in a procedure of unsuccessful approach and landing. Mr Vlado Juri\u0107, Head of the Office for aviation safety at Bosnia and Herzegovina Air Navigation Services Agency (BHANSA), presented the information about problems caused by reduced minimums at Sarajevo Airport. For the implementation of ILS categories (CAT II or CAT III), the terrain in front of the runway start should be free of obstacles for at least 1000 meters. It means that the RWY 12 threshold should be moved for additional 200 meters which would reduce the runway length and as such is unacceptable. From the point of view of procedure design, the reduction of minimums is not an option and therefor it is necessary to find other solutions for improvement of landing conditions at Sarajevo Airport. The biggest problem at Sarajevo Airport is fog. The representative of Sarajevo Airport, Mr Nermin Zijadi\u0107 informed that there is a relevant plan regarding this problem. He also presented the information about future projects of Sarajevo Airport among which the most important one is a reconstruction of the runway including its lighting system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-airport.ba/vijest.php?id=426&lang=eng|title=Sarajevo-Airport.ba - Me\u0111unarodni aerodrom Sarajevo|website=Sarajevo-airport.ba}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Qatar Airways]] announced a new route from [[Doha]] to Sarajevo.

He was traded to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in 1989. He spent over three seasons (1989\u20131992) there and then part of the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]] season with the [[Orlando Magic]].\n\n===Chicago Bulls===\nIn 1993, he signed with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. The Bulls made the playoffs in the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] and [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]] seasons, but without [[Michael Jordan]]'s presence for all of 1994 and much of 1995, the team could not advance to the Finals. However, with Jordan back full-time for the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]], the Bulls set a then NBA-record of 72\u201310 and defeated the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the [[1996 NBA Finals]].\n\nKerr played a major part of the Bulls' championship victory in the [[1997 NBA Finals]] against the [[Utah Jazz]]. In the final seconds of Game 6 with the score tied at 86, he took a pass from Jordan and hit the title-winner. The Bulls won, earning the franchise's fifth title. Kerr also won the 3-Point Shootout at the 1997 All-Star Game.\n\nIn the last minute of Game 2 of the [[1998 NBA Finals]] against Utah, Kerr missed a 3-pointer, grabbed his own rebound and made a pass to Jordan who made a crucial three-point play, putting them in the lead for good. The play helped Chicago win the game and tie the series at 1. The Bulls won the series in 6 games.\n\n===San Antonio Spurs===\nIn January 1999, Kerr was acquired by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in a sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls, whereby [[Chuck Person]] and a first-round pick in the [[2000 NBA draft]] was sent to Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Steve-Kerr/Summary/1303|title=Steve Kerr Player Profile|work=RealGM.com|access-date=November 19, 2017}}</ref> The Spurs reached [[1999 NBA Finals]] and won their first NBA Championship with a 4\u20131 series victory over the [[New York Knicks]].

In return, the Trail Blazers received [[Charles Smith (basketball, born 1975)|Charles Smith]], [[Amal McCaskill]], and [[Antonio Daniels]].

The Spurs eventually won the NBA championship by beating the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[2003 NBA Finals]], 4\u20132.\n\n===Retirement===\nKerr announced his retirement after the 2003 NBA Finals. During his NBA career, he played 910 regular-season games. He retired as the league's all-time leader in single-season three-point shooting percentage (.524 in 1994\u201395) and career three-point shooting percentage (.454). Kerr won a total of five NBA championships as a player.\n\n==Broadcaster and commentator==\n[[File:Steve Kerr 2013.jpg|thumb|Kerr in 2013]]\nIn 2003, Kerr became a broadcast analyst for [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT), offering commentary alongside renowned analyst [[Marv Albert]]. During his tenure, he performed a segment sponsored by [[Coors Light]] called ''Steve's Refreshing Thoughts'' in which he brought up interesting facts in NBA history. This segment continued through sponsorship, and became known as ''Steve Wonders'', sponsored by [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]]. In the same time period, Kerr also contributed to [[Yahoo!]] as an NBA commentator.\n\nHe has provided his voice for the in-game commentary of [[EA Sports]] [[video game]]s ''[[NBA Live series|NBA Live 06]], [[NBA Live series|NBA Live 07]], [[NBA Live series|NBA Live 08]], [[NBA Live series|NBA Live 09]]'' and ''[[NBA Live series|NBA Live 10]]'' with Albert.

coach and former player who is the head coach of the [[Golden State Warriors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).<ref>{{cite

He is an eight-time [[NBA champion]], having won five titles as a player (three with the [[Chicago Bulls]] and two with the [[San Antonio Spurs]]) as well as three with the Warriors as a head coach. Kerr has the highest career three-point percentage (45.4%) in NBA history for any player with at least 250 three-pointers made. He also held the NBA record for highest three-point percentage in a season at 52.4% until the record was broken by [[Kyle Korver]] in 2010.\n\nOn June 2, 2007, the [[Phoenix Suns]] named Kerr the team's president of basketball operations and general manager. Kerr helped managing partner [[Robert Sarver]] buy the Suns in 2004 and became one of Sarver's trusted basketball advisors. Kerr announced his retirement from the Suns in June 2010. Afterwards, Kerr returned as a color commentator for ''[[NBA on TNT]]'' until 2014, when he pursued a career in coaching.\n\nOn May 14, 2014, the [[Golden State Warriors]] named Kerr the team's head coach. On April 4, 2015, with a win over the [[Dallas Mavericks]], Kerr broke the NBA record for the most regular-season wins for a rookie coach. The Warriors went on to win the [[2015 NBA Finals]], making Kerr the first rookie coach to win a championship since [[Pat Riley]] in the [[1982 NBA Finals]]. On April 13, 2016, the Warriors broke the record for the [[List of NBA teams by single season win percentage|most wins in an NBA season]], breaking a record previously held by Kerr's [[1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls season|1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls]]. The Warriors returned to the Finals for four straight years, losing in [[2016 NBA Finals|2016]], winning again in [[2017 NBA Finals|2017]] and [[2018 NBA Finals|2018]], and losing in [[2019 NBA Finals|2019]].\n\n==Early life==\nKerr was born in Beirut, Lebanon to [[Malcolm H.

The team was the last American Men's Senior Team composed strictly of [[amateur]] players to capture a gold medal. He blew out his knee in the tournament, usually a career-ending injury, forcing him to miss an entire season (1986\u201387) at Arizona.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-07-25-sp-119-story.html|title=Healing Process Is Mental for Kerr, Too : He's Haunted by Knee Injury Suffered in World Basketball Championships|date=1986-07-25|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> He helped the Wildcats reach the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]] of the NCAA Division I basketball tournament in 1988 along with fellow [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|All-American]] teammate [[Sean Elliott]]. Kerr also set an NCAA record for 3-point percentage in a season (114\u2013199, 57.3%).\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Career beginnings===\nKerr was selected by the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the second round of the [[1988 NBA draft]]. He was traded to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in 1989. He spent over three seasons (1989\u20131992) there and then part of the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]] season with the [[Orlando Magic]].\n\n===Chicago Bulls===\nIn 1993, he signed with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. The Bulls made the playoffs in the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] and [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]] seasons, but without [[Michael Jordan]]'s presence for all of 1994 and much of 1995, the team could not advance to the Finals. However, with Jordan back full-time for the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]], the Bulls set a then NBA-record of 72\u201310 and defeated the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the [[1996 NBA Finals]].\n\nKerr played a major part of the Bulls' championship victory in the [[1997 NBA Finals]] against the [[Utah Jazz]]. In the final seconds of Game 6 with the score tied at 86, he took a pass from Jordan and hit the title-winner. The Bulls won, earning the franchise's fifth title. Kerr also won the 3-Point Shootout at the 1997 All-Star Game.\n\nIn the last minute of Game 2 of the [[1998 NBA Finals]] against Utah, Kerr missed a 3-pointer, grabbed his own rebound and made a pass to Jordan who made a crucial three-point play, putting them in the lead for good.

It was the first time the Warriors had ever won as many as 60 games in a season; their previous high was 59 in the 1975\u201376 season. The Warriors also ended with a 39\u20132 home record, which is tied for the second best home record in NBA history.

Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare. Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country [[Siamese revolution of 1932|abolished absolute monarchy in 1932]].\n\n[[File:View of the city of Bangkok 1822.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the city from British diplomat [[John Crawfurd]]'s embassy in 1822]]\nAs Thailand allied with Japan [[Thailand in World War II|in World War II]], Bangkok was subjected to [[Bombing of Bangkok in World War II|Allied bombing]], but rapidly grew in the post-war period as a result of US aid and government-sponsored investment. Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. By then, many public and social issues had emerged, among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city's notorious traffic jams. Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in [[14 October 1973 uprising|1973]] and [[Thammasat University massacre|1976]], anti-military demonstrations [[Black May (1992)|in 1992]], and successive anti-government demonstrations by opposing groups from 2008 on.\n\nAdministration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1906, with the establishment of [[Monthon]] Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon ({{lang|th|\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23}}) as a national subdivision. In 1915 the ''monthon'' was split into several provinces, the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed. The city in its current form was created in 1972 with the formation of the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA), following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\n==Name==\nThe origin of the name ''Bangkok'' ({{lang|th|\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01}}, pronounced in Thai as {{IPA-th|b\u0101\u02d0\u014b k\u0254\u0300\u02d0k||Th-Bangkok.ogg}}), is unclear.

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station.

Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

Although family planning and birth control were introduced in the 1960s, the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated.

Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's [[sex tourism]] scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals or the government.\n\n[[File:Khao San Road at night by kevinpoh.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Night scene on a pedestrian street, with many people and street vendors; shops along the street bearing brightly lit signs with names like &quot;99Fashion&quot;, &quot;Brick Bar&quot;, &quot;Mulligans Irish Bar&quot;, and Pepsi and McDonald&#39;s logos|[[Khao San Road]] is lined by budget accommodation, shops and bars catering to tourists.]]\nAmong Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples, including [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Wat Pho]], and [[Wat Arun]]. The [[Giant Swing]] and [[Erawan Shrine]] demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. [[Vimanmek Mansion]] in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the [[Jim Thompson House]] provides an example of traditional [[Thai architecture]]. Other major museums include the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Royal Barge National Museum]]. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, pp.&nbsp;63\u201369.</ref>\n\nShopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and Ratchaprasong to the sprawling [[Chatuchak Weekend Market]]. [[Taling Chan Floating Market]] is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. [[Khao San Road]] has long been famous as a destination for [[backpacker tourism]], with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world.\n\nBangkok has a reputation overseas as a major destination in the sex industry. Although [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution is technically illegal]] and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname \"Sin City of Asia\" for its level of sex tourism.<ref name=\"EmmonsEveland2011\">{{cite book|last1=Emmons|first1=Ron|last2=Eveland|first2=Jennifer|last3=White|first3=Daniel|title=Frommer's Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OnMMOZhn54C&pg=PA79|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=28 June 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00979-6|page=79}}</ref>\n\nIssues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]].

During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

All six national terrestrial channels, Channels [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|3]], [[Channel 5 (Thailand)|5]] and [[Channel 7 (Thailand)|7]], [[Modernine TV|Modernine]], [[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand Television|NBT]] and [[Thai PBS]], have headquarters and main studios in the capital. With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays.

If someone could rework the paragraph please do so.\nThe arts in Bangkok have developed almost exclusively and anonymously in the services of Theravada Buddhism since the Ayutthaya period and continuing to the present day by incorporating Western elements which is called the [[Rattanakosin style|Rattanakosin]] or Bangkok style. Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare.

Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes. Land use in the city consists of 23 percent residential use, 24 percent agriculture, and 30 percent used for commerce, industry, and government.<ref name=\"BMA geo\"/> The BMA's City Planning Department (CPD) is responsible for planning and shaping further development.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station. From the monument, [[Phahonyothin Road|Phahonyothin]] and [[Ratchawithi Road|Ratchawithi]]&nbsp;/ Din Daeng Roads respectively run north and east linking to major residential areas. Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

Although [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution is technically illegal]] and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname \"Sin City of Asia\" for its level of sex tourism.<ref name=\"EmmonsEveland2011\">{{cite book|last1=Emmons|first1=Ron|last2=Eveland|first2=Jennifer|last3=White|first3=Daniel|title=Frommer's Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OnMMOZhn54C&pg=PA79|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=28 June 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00979-6|page=79}}</ref>\n\nIssues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]].

During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

All six national terrestrial channels, Channels [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|3]], [[Channel 5 (Thailand)|5]] and [[Channel 7 (Thailand)|7]], [[Modernine TV|Modernine]], [[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand Television|NBT]] and [[Thai PBS]], have headquarters and main studios in the capital. With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays.

Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. [[Ramkhamhaeng University]] emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of 10- to 19-year-olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Sukanya|last=Nitungkorn |title=The problems of secondary education expansion in Thailand |journal=Southeast Asian Studies|volume=26|issue=1|date=June 1988 |url=http://kyoto-seas.org/pdf/26/1/260102.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools.
