Per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XI|Article 252]], approval of state legislative council, if existing, is also required to permit the parliament in making laws which are exclusively reserved to state legislative assembly.\n\n==Difference between a Bill and an Act==\nLegislative proposals are brought before either house of the [[Parliament of India]] in the form of a bill. A bill is the draft of a legislative proposal, which, when passed by both houses of Parliament and assented to by the [[President of India|President]], becomes an [[Act of Parliament]]. As soon as the bill has been framed, it has to be published in the news papers and the general public is asked to comment in a democratic manner. The bill may then be amended to incorporate the public opinion in a constructive manner and then may be introduced in the Parliament by [[Political minister|ministers]] or private members. The former are called government bills and the latter, [[Private Member's Bill|private members' bills]]. Bills may also be classified as [[public bill]]s and [[private bill]]s. A public bill is one referring to a matter applying to the public in general, whereas a private bill relates to a particular person or corporation or institution. The ''Orphanages and Charitable Homes Bill'' or the ''Muslim Waqfs Bills'' are examples of private bills.  A bill introduced in Lok Sabha pending for its approval, lapses when the Lok Sabha is dissolved.\n\n==How a Bill becomes an Act in Parliaments==\nA Bill is the draft of a legislative proposal. It has to pass through various stages before it becomes an [[Act of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary procedure |url=http://164.100.47.192/loksabha/ParliamentProcedure.aspx |accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rules of procedure and conduct of business in Rajya Sabha |url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/rules_pro.pdf |accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> There are three stages through which a bill has to pass in one House of [[Parliament of India|Parliament]]. The procedure is similar for the Legislative Assemblies of States.\n\n===First Reading===\nThe legislative process begins with the introduction of a Bill in either House of Parliament, i.e. the [[Lok Sabha]] or the [[Rajya Sabha]]. A Bill can be introduced either by a Minister or by a private member. In the former case it is known as a Government Bill and in the latter case it is known as a Private Member's Bill. It is necessary for a member-in-charge of the Bill to ask for the leave of the House to introduce the Bill. If leave is granted by the House, the Bill is introduced. This stage is known as the First Reading of the Bill. If the motion for leave to introduce a Bill is opposed, the Speaker may, in his discretion, allow a brief explanatory statement to be made by the member who opposes the motion and the member-in-charge who moved the motion. Where a motion for leave to introduce a Bill is opposed on the ground that the Bill initiates legislation outside the legislative competence of the House, the Speaker may permit a full discussion thereon. Thereafter, the question is put to the vote of the House. However, the motion for leave to introduce a Finance Bill or an Appropriation Bill is forthwith put to the vote of the House.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia>{{cite web |title=How a bill becomes an Act |url=http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516023151/http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.html |archive-date=16 May 2015 |url-status=dead }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Money/Appropriation Bills and financial bills can be introduced only in Lok Sabha per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Articles 109, 110 and 117]]. Speaker of Lok Sabha decides whether a bill is a Money Bill or not. The Vice-President of India, who is ''ex-officio'' [[Vice-President of India|Chairman of the Rajya Sabha]], decides whether a bill is a Money Bill or not when the bill is introduced in the Rajya Sabha.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andhra Pradesh Bill A Financial Bill, Says Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman |url=http://www.ndtv.com/andhra-pradesh-news/andhra-pradesh-bill-a-financial-bill-says-rajya-sabha-deputy-chairman-1627350 |accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Publication in the official Gazette====\nAfter a Bill has been introduced, it is published in ''[[The Gazette of India]]''. Even before introduction, a Bill might, with the permission of the Speaker, be published in the ''Gazette''. In such cases, leave to introduce the Bill in the House is not asked for and the Bill is straight away introduced.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n====Reference of Bill to the Standing Committee====\nAfter a Bill has been introduced, the Presiding Officer of the concerned House (Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or anyone acting on their behalf) can refer the Bill to the concerned [[Standing committee (India)|Standing Committee]] for examination and to prepare a report thereon. If a Bill is referred to a Standing Committee, the Committee shall consider the general principles and clauses of the Bill referred to them and make a report thereon. The Committee can also seek expert opinion or the public opinion of those interested in the measure. After the Bill has thus been considered, the Committee submits its report to the House. The report of the Committee, being of persuasive value, shall be treated as considered advice.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n===Second Reading===\nThe Second Reading consists of consideration of the Bill which occurs in two stages.\n\n;First stage\nThe first stage consists of general discussion on the Bill as a whole when the principle underlying the Bill is discussed. At this stage it is open to the House to refer the Bill to a Select Committee of the House or a Joint Committee of the two Houses or to circulate it for the purpose of eliciting opinion thereon or to straight away take it into consideration.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\nIf a Bill is referred to a Select/Joint Committee, the Committee considers the Bill clause-by-clause just as the House does. Amendments can be moved to the various clauses by members of the Committee. The Committee can also take evidence of associations, public bodies or experts who are interested in the measure. After the Bill has thus been considered, the Committee submits its report to the House which considers the Bill again as reported by the Committee. If a Bill is circulated for the purpose of eliciting public opinion thereon, such opinions are obtained through the Governments of the States and Union Territories. Opinions so received are laid on the Table of the House and the next motion in regard to the Bill must be for its reference to a Select/Joint Committee. It is not ordinarily permissible at this stage to move the motion for consideration of the Bill.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n;Second Stage\nThe second stage of the Second Reading consists of clause-by-clause consideration of the Bill as introduced or as reported by Select/Joint Committee. Discussion takes place on each clause of the Bill and amendments to clauses can be moved at this stage. Amendments to a clause have been moved but not withdrawn are put to the vote of the House before the relevant clause is disposed of by the House. The amendments become part of the Bill if they are accepted by a majority of members present and voting. After the clauses, the Schedules if any, clause 1, the Enacting Formula and the Long Title of the Bill have been adopted by the House, the Second Reading is deemed to be over.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n===Third and the last Reading===\nThereafter, the member-in-charge can move that the Bill be passed. This stage is known as the Third Reading of the Bill. At this stage the debate is confined to arguments either in support or rejection of the Bill without referring to the details thereof further than that are absolutely necessary. Only formal, verbal or consequential amendments are allowed to be moved at this stage. In passing an ordinary Bill, a simple majority of members present and voting is necessary. But in the case of a Bill to amend the Constitution, a majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting is required in each House of Parliament.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/> If the number of votes in favour and against the bill are tied, then the Presiding officer of the concerned House can cast his/her vote, referred to as a Casting Vote Right.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n===Passing a bill===\nIf at any time during a meeting of a House there is no [[quorum]] which is minimum one-tenth of the total members of a House, it shall be the duty of the Chairman or Speaker, or person acting as such, either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until there is a quorum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rajya sabha handbook|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/handbook/chapter1-1.asp|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> The bills taken up under legislative power of parliament are treated as passed provided majority of members present at that time approved the bill either by voting or [[voice vote]]. It is also right of a member to demand [[Division of the assembly|voting]] instead of voice vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voting and division in Lok Sabha |url=http://164.100.47.192/loksabha/writereaddata/Abstract/voting_and_division.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> In case of passing a constitutional amendment bill, two-third of the total members present and voted in favour of the bill with more than half(50%) of the total membership of a house, is required per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368]].\n\n===Bill in the other House===\nAfter the Bill is passed by one House of the parliament, it is sent to the other House for concurrence with a message to that effect, and there also it goes through the stages described above, except the introduction stage.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/> If a Bill  passed by one House is amended by the other House, it is sent back to the originating House for approval. If the originating House does not agree with the amendments, it shall be that the two houses have disagreed. The other House may keep a money bill for 14 days and an ordinary Bill for three (3) months without passing (or rejecting) it. If it fails to return the Bill within the fixed time, the Bill is deemed to be passed by both the houses and is sent for the approval of the President.\n\nAt state level, it is not mandatory that a bill shall be passed by the [[legislative council]] (if existing) per [[s:Constitution of India/Part VI|Articles 196 to 199]]. There is no provision of conducting joint session of both Houses to pass a bill.\n\n===Joint session of both Houses===\n{{main|Joint session#India|l1=Joint session}}\nIn case of a deadlock between the two houses or in a case where more than six months lapse in the other house, the [[President of India|President]] may summon, though is not bound to, a joint session of the two houses which is presided over by the [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha]] and the deadlock is resolved by simple majority. Until now, only three bills: the ''[[Dowry Prohibition Act]]'' (1961), the ''[[Banking Service Commission Repeal Bill]]'' (1978) and the ''[[Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act]]'' (2002) have been passed at joint sessions.<ref name=deadlock>{{cite web|title=Is any deadlock between the two Houses possible? |url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/faq/freaq1.asp |work=rajyasabha.nic.in |publisher=rajyasabha |accessdate=24 July 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130724045633/http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/faq/freaq1.asp |archivedate=24 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===President's approval===\nWhen a bill has been passed, it is sent to the [[President of India|President]] for his approval per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 111]]. The President can assent or withhold his assent to a bill or he can return a bill, other than a [[money bill]] which is recommended by president himself to the houses. However [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 255]] says that prior recommendation of president or governor of a state wherever stipulated is not compulsory for an Act of parliament or of the legislature of a State but the final consent of president or governor of a state is mandatory. President may be of view that a particular bill passed under the legislative powers of parliament is violating the  constitution, he can send back the bill with his recommendation to pass the bill under the constituent powers of parliament following the Article 368 procedure. President shall not withhold constitutional amendment bill duly passed by parliament per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368]]. If the President gives his assent, the bill is published in [[The Gazette of India]]<ref name=\"Amendments to Sebi Act gets Presidential assent\">{{cite news|title=Amendments to Sebi Act gets Presidential assent|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/regulation/amendments-to-sebi-act-gets-presidential-assent/articleshow/22718696.cms|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=18 Sep 2013|agency=PTI|quote=It has now been published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part-II, Section-1, dated the 13th September 2013 as Act No. 22 of 2013}}</ref>  and becomes an Act from the date of his assent. If he withholds his assent, the bill is dropped, which is known as absolute veto. The [[President of India|President]] can exercise absolute veto on aid and advice of council of ministers per Article 111 and [[Article 74 (Constitution of India)|Article 74]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://guyanachronicle.com/presidents-power-to-withhold-assent/ | title=The president\u2019s power of withholding assent |accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref> The president may also effectively withhold his assent as per his own discretion, which is known as [[pocket veto]]. The pocket veto has only been exercised once by President [[Zail Singh]] in 1986, over the postal act where the government wanted to open postal letters without warrant  by amending the [[Post Office Act#India|Indian Post Office Act, 1898]]. If the president returns it for reconsideration, the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] must do so, but if it is passed again and returned to him, he must give his assent to it. If parliament is not happy with the president for not assenting a bill passed by it under its legislative powers, the bill can be modified as a constitutional amendment bill and passed under its constituent powers for compelling the president to give assent. In case a constitutional amendment act is violating the [[Basic structure doctrine|basic structure of the constitution]], constitutional bench of Supreme Court would quash the act. When parliament is of the view that the actions of the president are violating the constitution, impeachment proceedings against president could be taken up to remove him under [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 61]] where at least two - thirds of total membership of each house of parliament should vote in favour of the impeachment when charges against the president are found valid in an investigation.\n\nIn case of a bill passed by the legislative assembly of a state, the consent of that state's [[Governors of states of India|Governor]] has to be obtained.<ref name=\"india times\">{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-08-26/education/27323497_1_powers-impeachment-resolution | title=The President\u2019s role | work=Times of India | date=26 Aug 2002 | accessdate=4 January 2012 | author=Gupta, V.

In case the cabinet decisions are not in the purview of the established law, president shall not give assent to the cabinet decisions. He may indicate union cabinet to pass the necessary legislation by the parliament to clear the cabinet decision.  A minister is not supposed to take any decision without being considered by the [[council of ministers]] per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 78(c)]].\n\nThe purpose of framing the Indian constitution is to serve with honesty, efficiency and impartiality for the betterment of its citizens by the people who are heading or representing the independent institutions created by the constitution such as judiciary, legislature, executive, etc. When one or more institutions are failing in their duty, the remaining shall normally take the lead in correcting the situation by using [[checks and balances]] as per the provisions available in the constitution.\n\n===Coming into force===\nGenerally most Acts will [[Coming into force|come into force]], or become legally enforceable in a manner as prescribed in the Act itself. Either it would come into effect from the date of assent by the President (mostly in case of Ordinances which is later approved by the Parliament), or a specific date is mentioned in the Act itself (mostly in case of Finance Bills) or on a date as per the wish of the Central or the State Government as the case may be. In case the commencement of the Act is as made as per the wish of the government, a separate Gazette notification is made, which is mostly accompanied by the Rules or [[subordinate legislation]] in another gazette notification.\n\n==Money Bill==\nBills which exclusively contain provisions for imposition and abolition of taxes, for appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund, etc., are certified as Money Bills by the [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha]]. Money Bills can be introduced only in Lok Sabha on the recommendation of the President per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Articles 109, 110 and 117]]. For every [[fiscal year]], the annual budget or annual financial statement with demand for grants on the recommendation of the President per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Articles 112 to 116]]  shall be passed by the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha cannot make amendments to a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha and sent to it. It can, however, recommend amendments in a Money Bill, but must return all Money Bills to Lok Sabha within fourteen days from the date of their receipt. The Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject any or all of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha with regard to a Money Bill. If Lok Sabha accepts any of the recommendations of Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses with amendments recommended by Rajya Sabha and accepted by Lok Sabha. If Lok Sabha does not accept any of the recommendations of Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses in the form in which it was passed by Lok Sabha without any of the amendments recommended by Rajya Sabha. If a Money Bill passed by Lok Sabha and transmitted to Rajya Sabha for its recommendations is not returned to Lok Sabha within the said period of fourteen days, it is deemed to have been passed by both Houses at the expiration of the said period in the form in which it was passed by Lok Sabha.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/> When a money bill introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]] by the government fails to get its approval, the ruling party is treated as not commanding the majority support in the Lok Sabha or shall be dismissed by the president to pave way for new government / fresh elections or opposition would move [[no confidence motion]].\n\nAt state level also money bills shall be introduced in the legislative assembly only per [[s:Constitution of India/Part VI|Articles 198, 199 and 207]] on the recommendation of the governor. When a money bill introduced in the legislative assembly by the state government fails to get its approval, the ruling party is treated as not commanding the majority support in the legislative assembly or shall be dismissed by the governor to pave way for new government / fresh elections or opposition would move [[no confidence motion]].\n\n==Ordinances==\n{{Main|Ordinance (India)}}\nWhen both houses of parliament are not in session, extant provisions of law are felt inadequate, under compelling circumstances  and the president is satisfied for the need of immediate action, he/she may promulgate such required ordinances under [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 123]] of the constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/re-promulgation-of-ordinances-fraud-on-constitution-sc-4456354/|title=Re-promulgation of ordinances fraud on Constitution: SC|accessdate=3 January 2017}}</ref>  An ordinance has same force and effect as an 'act of parliament'.

[[Part I of the Constitution of India#Article 4|Deemed amendments to the constitution]] which could be passed under legislative powers of Parliament, are no more valid after the addition of [[Amendment of the Constitution of India|Article 368 (1)]] by [[Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|24th amendment]].<ref name=cpower/>\n\n=== Union List ===\n[[Union list]] consists of 100 items (previously 97 items) on which the parliament has exclusive power to legislate.\n\n===State list===\n[[State list]] consists of 61 items (previously 66 items) where state legislative assembly can make laws applicable in that state.

Per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XI|Article 252]], approval of state legislative council, if existing, is also required to permit the parliament in making laws which are exclusively reserved to state legislative assembly.\n\n==Difference between a Bill and an Act==\nLegislative proposals are brought before either house of the [[Parliament of India]] in the form of a bill. A bill is the draft of a legislative proposal, which, when passed by both houses of Parliament and assented to by the [[President of India|President]], becomes an [[Act of Parliament]]. As soon as the bill has been framed, it has to be published in the news papers and the general public is asked to comment in a democratic manner. The bill may then be amended to incorporate the public opinion in a constructive manner and then may be introduced in the Parliament by [[Political minister|ministers]] or private members. The former are called government bills and the latter, [[Private Member's Bill|private members' bills]]. Bills may also be classified as [[public bill]]s and [[private bill]]s. A public bill is one referring to a matter applying to the public in general, whereas a private bill relates to a particular person or corporation or institution. The ''Orphanages and Charitable Homes Bill'' or the ''Muslim Waqfs Bills'' are examples of private bills.  A bill introduced in Lok Sabha pending for its approval, lapses when the Lok Sabha is dissolved.\n\n==How a Bill becomes an Act in Parliaments==\nA Bill is the draft of a legislative proposal. It has to pass through various stages before it becomes an [[Act of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary procedure |url=http://164.100.47.192/loksabha/ParliamentProcedure.aspx |accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rules of procedure and conduct of business in Rajya Sabha |url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/rules_pro.pdf |accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> There are three stages through which a bill has to pass in one House of [[Parliament of India|Parliament]]. The procedure is similar for the Legislative Assemblies of States.\n\n===First Reading===\nThe legislative process begins with the introduction of a Bill in either House of Parliament, i.e. the [[Lok Sabha]] or the [[Rajya Sabha]]. A Bill can be introduced either by a Minister or by a private member. In the former case it is known as a Government Bill and in the latter case it is known as a Private Member's Bill. It is necessary for a member-in-charge of the Bill to ask for the leave of the House to introduce the Bill. If leave is granted by the House, the Bill is introduced. This stage is known as the First Reading of the Bill. If the motion for leave to introduce a Bill is opposed, the Speaker may, in his discretion, allow a brief explanatory statement to be made by the member who opposes the motion and the member-in-charge who moved the motion. Where a motion for leave to introduce a Bill is opposed on the ground that the Bill initiates legislation outside the legislative competence of the House, the Speaker may permit a full discussion thereon. Thereafter, the question is put to the vote of the House. However, the motion for leave to introduce a Finance Bill or an Appropriation Bill is forthwith put to the vote of the House.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia>{{cite web |title=How a bill becomes an Act |url=http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516023151/http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.html |archive-date=16 May 2015 |url-status=dead }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Money/Appropriation Bills and financial bills can be introduced only in Lok Sabha per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Articles 109, 110 and 117]]. Speaker of Lok Sabha decides whether a bill is Money Bill or not. [[Vice-President of India|Chairman of Rajya Sabha]] decides whether a bill is finance bill or not when the bill is introduced in the Rajya Sabha.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andhra Pradesh Bill A Financial Bill, Says Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman |url=http://www.ndtv.com/andhra-pradesh-news/andhra-pradesh-bill-a-financial-bill-says-rajya-sabha-deputy-chairman-1627350 |accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Publication in the official Gazette====\nAfter a Bill has been introduced, it is published in ''[[The Gazette of India]]''. Even before introduction, a Bill might, with the permission of the Speaker, be published in the ''Gazette''. In such cases, leave to introduce the Bill in the House is not asked for and the Bill is straight away introduced.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n====Reference of Bill to the Standing Committee====\nAfter a Bill has been introduced, the Presiding Officer of the concerned House (Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or anyone acting on their behalf) can refer the Bill to the concerned [[Standing committee (India)|Standing Committee]] for examination and to prepare a report thereon. If a Bill is referred to a Standing Committee, the Committee shall consider the general principles and clauses of the Bill referred to them and make a report thereon. The Committee can also seek expert opinion or the public opinion of those interested in the measure. After the Bill has thus been considered, the Committee submits its report to the House. The report of the Committee, being of persuasive value, shall be treated as considered advice.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n===Second Reading===\nThe Second Reading consists of consideration of the Bill which occurs in two stages.\n\n;First stage\nThe first stage consists of general discussion on the Bill as a whole when the principle underlying the Bill is discussed. At this stage it is open to the House to refer the Bill to a Select Committee of the House or a Joint Committee of the two Houses or to circulate it for the purpose of eliciting opinion thereon or to straight away take it into consideration.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\nIf a Bill is referred to a Select/Joint Committee, the Committee considers the Bill clause-by-clause just as the House does. Amendments can be moved to the various clauses by members of the Committee. The Committee can also take evidence of associations, public bodies or experts who are interested in the measure. After the Bill has thus been considered, the Committee submits its report to the House which considers the Bill again as reported by the Committee. If a Bill is circulated for the purpose of eliciting public opinion thereon, such opinions are obtained through the Governments of the States and Union Territories. Opinions so received are laid on the Table of the House and the next motion in regard to the Bill must be for its reference to a Select/Joint Committee. It is not ordinarily permissible at this stage to move the motion for consideration of the Bill.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n;Second Stage\nThe second stage of the Second Reading consists of clause-by-clause consideration of the Bill as introduced or as reported by Select/Joint Committee. Discussion takes place on each clause of the Bill and amendments to clauses can be moved at this stage. Amendments to a clause have been moved but not withdrawn are put to the vote of the House before the relevant clause is disposed of by the House. The amendments become part of the Bill if they are accepted by a majority of members present and voting. After the clauses, the Schedules if any, clause 1, the Enacting Formula and the Long Title of the Bill have been adopted by the House, the Second Reading is deemed to be over.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n===Third and the last Reading===\nThereafter, the member-in-charge can move that the Bill be passed. This stage is known as the Third Reading of the Bill. At this stage the debate is confined to arguments either in support or rejection of the Bill without referring to the details thereof further than that are absolutely necessary. Only formal, verbal or consequential amendments are allowed to be moved at this stage. In passing an ordinary Bill, a simple majority of members present and voting is necessary. But in the case of a Bill to amend the Constitution, a majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting is required in each House of Parliament.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/> If the number of votes in favour and against the bill are tied, then the Presiding officer of the concerned House can cast his/her vote, referred to as a Casting Vote Right.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/>\n\n===Passing a bill===\nIf at any time during a meeting of a House there is no [[quorum]] which is minimum one-tenth of the total members of a House, it shall be the duty of the Chairman or Speaker, or person acting as such, either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until there is a quorum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rajya sabha handbook|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/handbook/chapter1-1.asp|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> The bills taken up under legislative power of parliament are treated as passed provided majority of members present at that time approved the bill either by voting or [[voice vote]]. It is also right of a member to demand [[Division of the assembly|voting]] instead of voice vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voting and division in Lok Sabha |url=http://164.100.47.192/loksabha/writereaddata/Abstract/voting_and_division.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> In case of passing a constitutional amendment bill, two-third of the total members present and voted in favour of the bill with more than half(50%) of the total membership of a house, is required per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368]].\n\n===Bill in the other House===\nAfter the Bill is passed by one House of the parliament, it is sent to the other House for concurrence with a message to that effect, and there also it goes through the stages described above, except the introduction stage.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/> If a Bill  passed by one House is amended by the other House, it is sent back to the originating House for approval. If the originating House does not agree with the amendments, it shall be that the two houses have disagreed. The other House may keep a money bill for 14 days and an ordinary Bill for three (3) months without passing (or rejecting) it. If it fails to return the Bill within the fixed time, the Bill is deemed to be passed by both the houses and is sent for the approval of the President.\n\nAt state level, it is not mandatory that a bill shall be passed by the [[legislative council]] (if existing) per [[s:Constitution of India/Part VI|Articles 196 to 199]]. There is no provision of conducting joint session of both Houses to pass a bill.\n\n===Joint session of both Houses===\n{{main|Joint session#India|l1=Joint session}}\nIn case of a deadlock between the two houses or in a case where more than six months lapse in the other house, the [[President of India|President]] may summon, though is not bound to, a joint session of the two houses which is presided over by the [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha]] and the deadlock is resolved by simple majority. Until now, only three bills: the ''[[Dowry Prohibition Act]]'' (1961), the ''[[Banking Service Commission Repeal Bill]]'' (1978) and the ''[[Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act]]'' (2002) have been passed at joint sessions.<ref name=deadlock>{{cite web|title=Is any deadlock between the two Houses possible? |url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/faq/freaq1.asp |work=rajyasabha.nic.in |publisher=rajyasabha |accessdate=24 July 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130724045633/http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/faq/freaq1.asp |archivedate=24 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===President's approval===\nWhen a bill has been passed, it is sent to the [[President of India|President]] for his approval per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 111]]. The President can assent or withhold his assent to a bill or he can return a bill, other than a [[money bill]] which is recommended by president himself to the houses. However [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 255]] says that prior recommendation of president or governor of a state wherever stipulated is not compulsory for an Act of parliament or of the legislature of a State but the final consent of president or governor of a state is mandatory. President may be of view that a particular bill passed under the legislative powers of parliament is violating the  constitution, he can send back the bill with his recommendation to pass the bill under the constituent powers of parliament following the Article 368 procedure. President shall not withhold constitutional amendment bill duly passed by parliament per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368]]. If the President gives his assent, the bill is published in [[The Gazette of India]]<ref name=\"Amendments to Sebi Act gets Presidential assent\">{{cite news|title=Amendments to Sebi Act gets Presidential assent|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/regulation/amendments-to-sebi-act-gets-presidential-assent/articleshow/22718696.cms|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=18 Sep 2013|agency=PTI|quote=It has now been published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part-II, Section-1, dated the 13th September 2013 as Act No. 22 of 2013}}</ref>  and becomes an Act from the date of his assent. If he withholds his assent, the bill is dropped, which is known as absolute veto. The [[President of India|President]] can exercise absolute veto on aid and advice of council of ministers per Article 111 and [[Article 74 (Constitution of India)|Article 74]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://guyanachronicle.com/presidents-power-to-withhold-assent/ | title=The president\u2019s power of withholding assent |accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref> The president may also effectively withhold his assent as per his own discretion, which is known as [[pocket veto]]. The pocket veto has only been exercised once by President [[Zail Singh]] in 1986, over the postal act where the government wanted to open postal letters without warrant  by amending the [[Post Office Act#India|Indian Post Office Act, 1898]]. If the president returns it for reconsideration, the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] must do so, but if it is passed again and returned to him, he must give his assent to it. If parliament is not happy with the president for not assenting a bill passed by it under its legislative powers, the bill can be modified as a constitutional amendment bill and passed under its constituent powers for compelling the president to give assent. In case a constitutional amendment act is violating the [[Basic structure doctrine|basic structure of the constitution]], constitutional bench of Supreme Court would quash the act. When parliament is of the view that the actions of the president are violating the constitution, impeachment proceedings against president could be taken up to remove him under [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 61]] where at least two - thirds of total membership of each house of parliament should vote in favour of the impeachment when charges against the president are found valid in an investigation.\n\nIn case of a bill passed by the legislative assembly of a state, the consent of that state's [[Governors of states of India|Governor]] has to be obtained.<ref name=\"india times\">{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-08-26/education/27323497_1_powers-impeachment-resolution | title=The President\u2019s role | work=Times of India | date=26 Aug 2002 | accessdate=4 January 2012 | author=Gupta, V. P.}}</ref> Some times the governor may refer the bill to the president anticipating clash between other central laws or constitution and decision of the president is final per [[s:Constitution of India/Part VI|Articles 200 and 201]].\n\nAll decisions of the [[council of ministers|union cabinet]] are to be assented by the president for issuing gazette order (GO). In case the cabinet decisions are not in the purview of the established law, president shall not give assent to the cabinet decisions. He may indicate union cabinet to pass the necessary legislation by the parliament to clear the cabinet decision.  A minister is not supposed to take any decision without being considered by the [[council of ministers]] per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 78(c)]].\n\nThe purpose of framing the Indian constitution is to serve with honesty, efficiency and impartiality for the betterment of its citizens by the people who are heading or representing the independent institutions created by the constitution such as judiciary, legislature, executive, etc. When one or more institutions are failing in their duty, the remaining shall normally take the lead in correcting the situation by using [[checks and balances]] as per the provisions available in the constitution.\n\n===Coming into force===\nGenerally most Acts will [[Coming into force|come into force]], or become legally enforceable in a manner as prescribed in the Act itself. Either it would come into effect from the date of assent by the President (mostly in case of Ordinances which is later approved by the Parliament), or a specific date is mentioned in the Act itself (mostly in case of Finance Bills) or on a date as per the wish of the Central or the State Government as the case may be. In case the commencement of the Act is as made as per the wish of the government, a separate Gazette notification is made, which is mostly accompanied by the Rules or [[subordinate legislation]] in another gazette notification.\n\n==Money Bill==\nBills which exclusively contain provisions for imposition and abolition of taxes, for appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund, etc., are certified as Money Bills by the [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha]]. Money Bills can be introduced only in Lok Sabha on the recommendation of the President per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Articles 109, 110 and 117]]. For every [[fiscal year]], the annual budget or annual financial statement with demand for grants on the recommendation of the President per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Articles 112 to 116]]  shall be passed by the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha cannot make amendments to a Money Bill passed by the Lok Sabha and sent to it. It can, however, recommend amendments in a Money Bill, but must return all Money Bills to Lok Sabha within fourteen days from the date of their receipt. The Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject any or all of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha with regard to a Money Bill. If Lok Sabha accepts any of the recommendations of Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses with amendments recommended by Rajya Sabha and accepted by Lok Sabha. If Lok Sabha does not accept any of the recommendations of Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses in the form in which it was passed by Lok Sabha without any of the amendments recommended by Rajya Sabha. If a Money Bill passed by Lok Sabha and transmitted to Rajya Sabha for its recommendations is not returned to Lok Sabha within the said period of fourteen days, it is deemed to have been passed by both Houses at the expiration of the said period in the form in which it was passed by Lok Sabha.<ref name=ParliamentofIndia/> When a money bill introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]] by the government fails to get its approval, the ruling party is treated as not commanding the majority support in the Lok Sabha or shall be dismissed by the president to pave way for new government / fresh elections or opposition would move [[no confidence motion]].\n\nAt state level also money bills shall be introduced in the legislative assembly only per [[s:Constitution of India/Part VI|Articles 198, 199 and 207]] on the recommendation of the governor. When a money bill introduced in the legislative assembly by the state government fails to get its approval, the ruling party is treated as not commanding the majority support in the legislative assembly or shall be dismissed by the governor to pave way for new government / fresh elections or opposition would move [[no confidence motion]].\n\n==Ordinances==\n{{Main|Ordinance (India)}}\nWhen both houses of parliament are not in session, extant provisions of law are felt inadequate, under compelling circumstances  and the president is satisfied for the need of immediate action, he/she may promulgate such required ordinances under [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 123]] of the constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/re-promulgation-of-ordinances-fraud-on-constitution-sc-4456354/|title=Re-promulgation of ordinances fraud on Constitution: SC|accessdate=3 January 2017}}</ref>  An ordinance has same force and effect as an 'act of parliament'.

Despite his boisterous attitude, he approached his members as an older brother-like figure in contrast to Akiyama's fatherly figure. He had a great intuition towards a monster's movements, such as being able to predict Gamiba's presence on Maroi Island after knowing such place had no record of earthquake by natural means but is also fearful of supernatural existence (such as the rumored sightings of Yuki-onna).

In episode 44, the Ultria was shown capable of splitting into two different components, Alpha and Beta respectively.\n\n==Ultra People==\nIn ''The Ultraman'', the {{nihongo4|Ultra People|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u4eba|Urutora-jin}} are human-like residents of {{nihongo4|Planet Ultra U40|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u306e\u661f{{ruby|U40|\u30e6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc}}|Urutora no Hoshi Y\u016b F\u014dt\u012b}}, demonstrating a similar culture to [[Ancient Greece]], wearing garments such as the [[Himation]] and [[Toga]].

Earth was one of the stars they visited and established the very first human civilization with [[Neanderthal]]s. To combat against the evil forces in space, they created the {{nihongo4|Ultra Mind|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9|Urutora Maindo}} and became {{nihongo4|Ultra Humanoids|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9|Urutora Hy\u016bmanoido}}. They would soon discard the Ultra Mind within a black hole to prevent any misuse from outside forces.\n\nWhen the Earth was plagued by mysterious phenomenon, the Ultras sent their message and strongest warrior Joneus to guard the planet from monster attacks. One of these nefarious forces, named Badel Tribe invaded U40 as their Spirit Parasites were acting on Earth. With Joneus still in recuperation, Elek, Loto and the other five warriors would fight the invading forces while Hikari and Amia tried to invade the Badel Star. A fully healed Joneus participated in the battle again to save his kind while the other seven warriors contain the stolen Ultra Mind. However, not long after that, the Heller Army, a renegade faction of the Ultra People, invaded the U40 in retaliation of their banishment in the past. The surviving Ultra People were led by Elek and Loto as {{nihongo4|U Fleet|U\u8266\u968a|Y\u016b Kantai}} the Science Guard joined them in a campaign to reclaim U40.<ref name=\"DVD10\"/> With the Heller Army defeated and Heller killed, U40 citizens that previously scattered in outer space returned to their home world and celebrated Joneus' victory.\n\nAlthough still in human size, 8 chosen warriors of U40 have {{nihongo4|Star Symbols|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30dc\u30eb|Sut\u0101 Shinboru}} on their chest allowing them to change their sizes into giants and travel to any planets in short distances and measure their energy levels. As the Earth's atmosphere quickly drains their energies, they can only sustain their giant forms for 4 minutes as the Star Symbol changes color from blue to yellow, and finally to red after 30 seconds.

He saved Mutsumi after accidentally crashed a nearby ship, the latter try to warn him of Royger's trap. When Joneus was trapped by the ship, the Heller Fleet try to kill both Hatari and the former until Mutsumi saved them as they escaped with a smaller jet. After the army was killed by Joneus, Hatari bid farewell to the ESDS as he returned to space. He was voiced by Tar\u014d Sagami II.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book|date = 1982-12-31|title = \u4e0d\u6ec5\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u767d\u66f8|series = \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb|publisher = [[Asahi Sonorama]]|edition = \u521d\u7248|id = \u96d1\u8a8c\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a67897-80|ref = {{SfnRef|\u767d\u66f8|1982}}}}\n* \u3066\u308c\u3073\u304f\u3093\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u611b\u8535\u7248\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\uff08[[Shogakukan]]\uff09\n** {{cite book| date = 1984-09-10 | title = \u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u602a\u7363\u5927\u5168\u96c6 | publisher = Shogakukan | series = \u3066\u308c\u3073\u304f\u3093\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u611b\u8535\u7248 | isbn = 4-09-101411-9 | ref={{SfnRef|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u602a\u7363\u5927\u5168\u96c6|1984}} }}\n** {{cite book| date = 1990-09-10 | title = \u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u6226\u58eb\u8d85\u6280\u5168\u66f8 | publisher = Shogakukan | series = \u3066\u308c\u3073\u304f\u3093\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u611b\u8535\u7248 | isbn = 4-09-101423-2 | ref={{SfnRef|\u8d85\u6280\u5168\u66f8|1990}} }}\n* {{cite book | date = 2001-12-21 |others=\u76e3\u4fee \u5186\u8c37\u30d7\u30ed\u30c0\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 | title = \u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 | publisher = \u4e2d\u7d4c\u51fa\u7248 | isbn = 4-8061-1556-8 | ref={{SfnRef|\u5927\u8f9e\u5178|2001}} }}\n* {{Cite book|editor=\u7af9\u66f8\u623f/\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30ca\u30d3\u7de8 | title = \u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u753b\u5831 <small>\u5149\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u4e09\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u306e\u6b69\u307f</small> | publisher = [[Takeshobo]] | volume = \u4e0b\u5dfb | date = 2003-05-09 | isbn = 4-8124-0999-3 | ref = {{SfnRef|\u753b\u5831 \u4e0b\u5dfb|2003}} }}\n* {{Cite book|author = \u5927\u77f3\u771f\u53f8\u30fb\u6c5f\u53e3\u6c34\u57fa\u30fb\u5cf6\u5d0e\u6df3\u30fb\u9593\u5bae\u5c1a\u5f66|year = 2013|title = \u5186\u8c37\u30d7\u30ed\u5168\u602a\u7363\u56f3\u9451|publisher = Shogakukan|isbn = 9784096820742|ref= {{SfnRef|\u5186\u8c37\u30d7\u30ed\u5168\u602a\u7363\u56f3\u9451|2013}} }}\n\n{{Ultra Series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ultraman characters, List of The}}\n[[Category:Lists of fictional Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1979|*, Ultraman]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Ultraman, The]]\n[[Category:Ultra Series characters]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: be send \u2192 be sent, enought \u2192 enough, would sent \u2192 would send, would took \u2192 would take", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Ultraman_characters"}
