He plays jazz, improvisational music and non-Western music. For his work as a musician, orchestral and workshop leader, and driver of the jazz scene in [[Groningen]], Laurillard received the [[VPRO/Boy Edgar Award|Boy Edgar Prize]] in 1982, the most important jazz award in The Netherlands, and four years later received the Henri de Wolf Jazz Prize.\n\n== Youth, education and early career in Canada ==\nFrom 1955 to 1963 Laurillard was a member of the North Vancouver School Orchestra, which won the Canadian championship for school orchestras in 1960. During this period, he studied music theory and composition with Gordon Webster.\n\nBesides the tenor saxophone Laurillard also studied the piano and percussion. Between 1959 and 1972 he worked as a semi-professional saxophonist and arranger for various rock and roll and rhythm and blues groups and big bands in Vancouver. The soul group the Accents (1962\u20131967) was the most prominent of them. At the [[University of British Columbia]], he completed his studies in mechanical engineering, but did not pursue a career in that field.\n\n== 1970s ==\nIn 1972 he settled in Amsterdam, where he found a job as a carpenter and studio manager at the Oktopus cultural center. There he organized his first workshops. He founded his Elastiek Band and worked with organist Herbert Noord, with whom he debuted on an album in 1976.\n\nA year earlier, Laurillard had moved to the Dutch village of [[Eenrum]]. In the nearby city of [[Groningen]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Cultural Politics of Jazz Collectives: This Is Our Music|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1xbwBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22Alan+Laurillard%22+-wikipedia&source=bl&ots=aJ0i44hTGw&sig=ACfU3U2nq_2YiDaQKTLgHTgWnIxm9Urh2g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1puHvlbnoAhWiqHEKHa7ODqg4ChDoATADegQIChAB#v=onepage&q=%22Alan%20Laurillard%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|pages=47}}</ref> during sessions at a bar, he met local free improvising musicians like pianist Ko de Regt, bassist Gwan Kwee and multi-instrumentalist and performer Harry de Wit.\n\nHe took courses with Herman Schoonderwalt, [[Misha Mengelberg]] and [[Han Bennink]], and formed in 1978 with pianist Robert Rettich the Super Jazz Quartet, which occurred frequently in local establishments. In the same period, he began to organize diverse workshop orchestras.\n\nWith saxophonist Frans Vermeerssen he founded the Vertical Saxophone Quartet and also his own quartet, with which he recorded in 1981 his first album, ''New Blues'', under his own name.\n\n== 1980s, the Noodband ==\nInspired by the performances of upcoming free funk bands from the United States at the Groninger Jazzmarathon, Laurillard founded in 1981 the Noodband, a double trio with two saxophonists, two bassists and two drummers. That ensemble gained international fame when voice artist [[Greetje Bijma]] joined the sextet. They performed at festivals throughout Europe. The Noodband produced two albums and can be considered as Laurillard's most successful project.\n\n== 1990s ==\nThe Noodband was followed by La Vida Super Nova, the Greetje Bijma Quartet, the Tam Tam Fanfare, Baritone Madness, shouting choir the Blasters, the Holes (including [[Tony Buck (musician)|Tony Buck]]) and the Up There Trio, an ensemble with improvising musicians accompanied by a church organ.\n\nAfter returning to Amsterdam in 1995, he began groups and projects such as [[Jerkstation]], [[In Da Da Pocket]] and the [[Zuiderzee Orkest]].

He plays jazz, improvisational music and non-Western music. For his work as a musician, orchestral and workshop leader, and driver of the jazz scene in [[Groningen]], Laurillard received the [[VPRO/Boy Edgar Award|Boy Edgar Prize]] in 1982, the most important jazz award in The Netherlands, and four years later received the Henri de Wolf Jazz Prize.\n\n== Youth, education and early career in Canada ==\nFrom 1955 to 1963 Laurillard was a member of the North Vancouver School Orchestra, which won the Canadian championship for school orchestras in 1960. During this period, he studied music theory and composition with Gordon Webster.\n\nBesides the tenor saxophone Laurillard also studied the piano and percussion. Between 1959 and 1972 he worked as a semi-professional saxophonist and arranger for various rock and roll and rhythm and blues groups and big bands in Vancouver. The soul group the Accents (1962\u20131967) was the most prominent of them. At the [[University of British Columbia]], he completed his studies in mechanical engineering, but did not pursue a career in that field.\n\n== 1970s ==\nIn 1972 he settled in Amsterdam, where he found a job as a carpenter and studio manager at the Oktopus cultural center. There he organized his first workshops. He founded his Elastiek Band and worked with organist Herbert Noord, with whom he debuted on an album in 1976.\n\nA year earlier, Laurillard had moved to the Dutch village of [[Eenrum]]. In the nearby city of [[Groningen]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Cultural Politics of Jazz Collectives: This Is Our Music|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1xbwBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22Alan+Laurillard%22+-wikipedia&source=bl&ots=aJ0i44hTGw&sig=ACfU3U2nq_2YiDaQKTLgHTgWnIxm9Urh2g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1puHvlbnoAhWiqHEKHa7ODqg4ChDoATADegQIChAB#v=onepage&q=%22Alan%20Laurillard%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|pages=47}}</ref>, during sessions at a bar, he met local free improvising musicians like pianist Ko de Regt, bassist Gwan Kwee and multi-instrumentalist and performer Harry de Wit.\n\nHe took courses with Herman Schoonderwalt, [[Misha Mengelberg]] and [[Han Bennink]], and formed in 1978 with pianist Robert Rettich the Super Jazz Quartet, which occurred frequently in local establishments. In the same period, he began to organize diverse workshop orchestras.\n\nWith saxophonist Frans Vermeerssen he founded the Vertical Saxophone Quartet and also his own quartet, with which he recorded in 1981 his first album, ''New Blues'', under his own name.\n\n== 1980s, the Noodband ==\nInspired by the performances of upcoming free funk bands from the United States at the Groninger Jazzmarathon, Laurillard founded in 1981 the Noodband, a double trio with two saxophonists, two bassists and two drummers. That ensemble gained international fame when voice artist [[Greetje Bijma]] joined the sextet. They performed at festivals throughout Europe. The Noodband produced two albums and can be considered as Laurillard's most successful project.\n\n== 1990s ==\nThe Noodband was followed by La Vida Super Nova, the Greetje Bijma Quartet, the Tam Tam Fanfare, Baritone Madness, shouting choir the Blasters, the Holes (including [[Tony Buck (musician)|Tony Buck]]) and the Up There Trio, an ensemble with improvising musicians accompanied by a church organ.\n\nAfter returning to Amsterdam in 1995, he began groups and projects such as [[Jerkstation]], [[In Da Da Pocket]] and the [[Zuiderzee Orkest]]. He lived and worked in Utrecht from 1999.\n\n== 2000s ==\nLaurillard was artistic director of Luchtkastelen, an international festival of contemporary organ music. After a period in Rotterdam (2004\u20132006), he has since divided his time between the Netherlands (Amsterdam, since 2011) and Bulgaria. In Bulgaria he plays with Javelin, the End Blues Band, the Dobrich Arts Ensemble and the Dobrich Poets Collective.\n\n== 2010s ==\nBesides eight solo albums with sequenced music of his solo act Jerkstation, Laurillard re-established three old bands: the Holes (2012), which plays jazzy dubstep, the Greetje Bijma Quintet, and Up There with organist Hayo Boerema.\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n* [[VPRO/Boy Edgar Award|Boy Edgar Prize]] (1982)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.draaiomjeoren.com/interviews/laurillard.html|title=Draai om je oren - Interview Alan Laurillard|website=www.draaiomjeoren.com|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n* Henri de Wolf Prize (1986)\n* Golden Valve (1986)\n\n== Bands ==\n* An informal rock & roll band (1957)\n* North Vancouver School Band (1960)\n* The Accents (1962)\n* Elastiek Band (1973)\n* Groninger Workshop Orchestra (1974)\n* Super Jazz Quartet (1978)\n* Vertical Saxophone Quartet (1980)\n* Alan Laurillard Quartet (1980)\n* Noodband (1981)\n* La Vida Super Nova (1984)\n* Greetje Bijma Quintet (1985)\n* Tam Tam Fanfare (1987)\n* Baritone Madness (1987)\n* Improvised Music Ensemble (1988)\n* Lion Tamer of Perpetuum (1989)\n* Noord Pool Composers Orchestra (1990)\n* Continental Contrast (1991)\n* Up There Trio (1997)\n* Seafood (1997)\n* Red Fog (2000)\n* Going Down (2002)\n* Fresh Crew (2004)\n* The Zuiderzee Orchestra (2005)\n* The Griot (2006)\n* Javelin (2007)\n* The Krishte Blues Band (2008)\n* The Holes (2011) - ''anew''\n* The Greetje Bijma Kwintet (2015) - ''anew''\n* The Westside Slam Crew (2015)\n* Up There (2016) - ''anew''\n\n== Discography ==\n;LPs\n* ''5 x 6'' - Herbert Noord 5 (1976)\n* ''New Blues'' - Alan Laurillard Quartet (1980)\n* ''Shiver'' - Noodband (1982)\n* ''Amycamus'' - Greetje Bijma Kwintet (1986)\n* ''Shopping Around'' - Noodband (1986)\n* ''Tam Tam Fanfare'' - Tam Tam Fanfare (1987)\n* ''Dark Moves'' - Greetje Bijma Quintet (1988)\n\n;CDs\n* ''Tales of a Voice'' - Greetje Bijma Kwintet (1991)\n* ''Push It'' - Up There Trio (1996)\n* ''Bait'' - Seafood (1997)\n* ''Ropewalk'' - with Tristan Laurillard and Toddler Thor (1997)\n* ''Race Till Death'' - Red Fog (2000)\n* ''Mental Dive'' - Krutzen & Jerk (2000)\n* ''Jerkstation'' - Jerkstation (solo) (2000)\n* ''Take a Deep Breath'' - Going Down (2002)\n* ''It Make You Healthy'' - Alivo (2003)\n* ''Fresh Crew'' - Fresh Crew (2004)\n* ''Gotta Crash on You'' - Going Down (2004)\n* ''Voice Over'' - Jerkstation  (2004)\n* ''Squeak City'' - Jerkstation  (2007)\n* ''It's Dark Up There'' - Up There (2008)\n* ''Sharp Points and Bubbles'' - Javelin (2009)\n* ''Squeak City'' - Jerkstation  (2009)\n* ''Solarized'' - Jerkstation  (2009)\n* ''Radio 100'' - Jerkstation (2010)\n* ''Beat City'' - Jerkstation (2011)\n* ''Around Ze World'' - Jerkstation (2012)\n* ''On the One'' - Jerkstation (2013)\n* ''Blue Squeaks'' - Jerkstation (2014)\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.alanlaurillard.nl Personal website]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laurillard, Alan}}\n[[Category:Canadian jazz saxophonists]]\n[[Category:Male saxophonists]]\n[[Category:Canadian jazz composers]]\n[[Category:Male jazz composers]]\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Vancouver]]\n[[Category:University of British Columbia alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century saxophonists]]\n[[Category:21st-century Canadian male musicians]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Laurillard"}

Alternative materials are available such as steel, copper, and tungsten, but alternatives are universally less effective and/or more expensive. However, the biggest impediment to using the vast majority of alternatives relates to current laws in the United States pertaining to armor-piercing rounds. Laws and regulations relating to armor-piercing ammunition expressly prohibit the use of brass, bronze, steel, tungsten, and nearly every metallic alternative in any bullet that can be shot by a handgun, which at this time is nearly every caliber smaller than 50BMG (including the popular .223 Remington, .308 Winchester and .30-06 to name just a few). Some lead-based bullets are resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with negligible risk of including lead fragments in prepared meat. Other bullets are prone to fragmentation and exacerbate the risk of lead ingestion from prepared meat. In practice, use of a non-fragmenting bullet and proper cleaning of the game animal's wound can eliminate the risk of lead ingestion from eating game;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> however, isolating such practice to experimentally determine its association with [[blood lead levels]] in study is difficult.

This was fully recognised by the ancients, and Vitruvius specifically warns against its use. Because it was nevertheless used in profusion for carrying drinking water, the conclusion has often been drawn that the Romans must therefore have suffered from lead poisoning; sometimes conclusions are carried even further and it is inferred that this caused infertility and other unwelcome conditions, and that lead plumbing was largely responsible for the decline and fall of Rome.\n\nTwo things make this otherwise attractive hypothesis impossible. First, the [[calcium carbonate]] deposit that formed so thickly inside the [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] channels also formed inside the pipes, effectively insulating the water from the lead, so that the two never touched. Second, because the Romans had so few [[faucet|taps]] and the water was constantly running, it was never inside the pipes for more than a few minutes, and certainly not long enough to become contaminated.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=308}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.\n{{quote|Thirty years ago, Jerome Nriagu argued in a milestone paper that Roman civilization collapsed as a result of lead poisoning. [[Clair Patterson]], the scientist who convinced governments to ban lead from gasoline, enthusiastically endorsed this idea, which nevertheless triggered a volley of publications aimed at refuting it.

Alternative materials are available such as steel, copper, and tungsten, but alternatives are universally less effective and/or more expensive. However, the biggest impediment to using the vast majority of alternatives relates to current laws in the United States pertaining to armor-piercing rounds. Laws and regulations relating to armor-piercing ammunition expressly prohibit the use of brass, bronze, steel, tungsten, and nearly every metallic alternative in any bullet that can be shot by a handgun, which at this time is nearly every caliber smaller than 50BMG (including the popular .223 Remington, .308 Winchester and .30-06 to name just a few). Some lead-based bullets are resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with negligible risk of including lead fragments in prepared meat. Other bullets are prone to fragmentation and exacerbate the risk of lead ingestion from prepared meat. In practice, use of a non-fragmenting bullet and proper cleaning of the game animal's wound can eliminate the risk of lead ingestion from eating game;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> however, isolating such practice to experimentally determine its association with [[blood lead levels]] in study is difficult.

This was fully recognised by the ancients, and Vitruvius specifically warns against its use. Because it was nevertheless used in profusion for carrying drinking water, the conclusion has often been drawn that the Romans must therefore have suffered from lead poisoning; sometimes conclusions are carried even further and it is inferred that this caused infertility and other unwelcome conditions, and that lead plumbing was largely responsible for the decline and fall of Rome.\n\nTwo things make this otherwise attractive hypothesis impossible. First, the [[calcium carbonate]] deposit that formed so thickly inside the [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] channels also formed inside the pipes, effectively insulating the water from the lead, so that the two never touched. Second, because the Romans had so few [[faucet|taps]] and the water was constantly running, it was never inside the pipes for more than a few minutes, and certainly not long enough to become contaminated.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=308}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.\n{{quote|Thirty years ago, Jerome Nriagu argued in a milestone paper that Roman civilization collapsed as a result of lead poisoning. [[Clair Patterson]], the scientist who convinced governments to ban lead from gasoline, enthusiastically endorsed this idea, which nevertheless triggered a volley of publications aimed at refuting it.

{"title_page": "Stretch Screamers", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Stretch Screamers''' was a series of electronic toys by [[Manley Toys Limited]] of [[Hong Kong]].\n\n==Design==\nStretch Screamers were a line of toy monsters from the early 2000s that could be stretched, causing them to scream. They also featured a \"balloon feature\" that when squeezed, balls of colored liquid would pop out. Older models featured plastic hands that were prone to popping off of the rubber arms and the balloon effect was filled with an iridescent colored fluid.  Newer models had soft rubber hands and gel and floating objects replacing the colored fluid inside the balloon effect. Stretch Screamers had several other toy lines including, [[Mini Stretch Screamers]], [[Blister Beasts]], [[Splat Bugz]], and [[Stretch Screamers Oozers]]. \n\nAt one point in the early 2000s, the toys were quite popular, so much so that they had their own [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]] toy line in 2003.<ref>http://www.millionaireplayboy.com/toys/mcstretch.php</ref> However, they have since fallen into obscurity and have been discontinued and have been known to fetch high prices online. The toys have since been redesigned and re-released in both 2010 and 2016 in the UK and several other countries.  n<ref>http://coolandcollected.com/yard-sale-finds-stretch-wolfman-dungeon-dice-and-pogs/</ref>\n\n==Toys==\n'''Series 1 and 2'''\n* \"[[Mummy]]\" Featured in the first TV ad, had an emaciated grey, semi-skeletal face with a red tongue and yellow eyes. it wore an Egyptian style cloth tunic which could be removed from the figure. When the head was squeezed its' left eye would bulge out in a ball of bright yellow iridescent liquid. this figure shares a sound chip with the other mummy figures that would appear in the [[Blister Beast]] line as well as the 2010 and 2016 UK editions. It also appeared as the sound chip for the mini dungeons from the mini Stretch Screamers line.\n\n* \"[[Wolfman]]\" Featured a wolf like face with yellow cat like eyes. It stood bipedal like the rest of the figures. It had yellow skin and a removable red open shirt. Its' hard plastic lower half featured torn denim shorts and highly detailed sculpted in fur. The wolfman stretch screamer also featured a unique sound chip which none of the other figures would share. When the head was squeezed the \"balloon effect\" would protrude from the figures' right cheek.\n\n* \"[[Ghoul]]\" Heavily resembled [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] from the film [[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]. The figure was covered in black bandages and a removable black cloak. When the head was squeezed a ball of red iridescent liquid would bulge out of the figure's mouth. This figure shares a sound chip with the [[Gross Gargoyle]] as well as the other ghoul figures that would appear in the [[Blister Beast]] line as well as the 2010 and 2016 UK editions.\n\n* \"[[Frankenstein]]\" Featured in the first TV ad alongside with the [[Mummy]]. The original Frankenstein figure strayed away from the traditional flat-top head Frankenstein design. The figure had long black sculpted in hair, pale green skin, yellow eyes and brown bolts in the temples. It featured a brown vest that tied together from the front. When the head was squeezed its' brain would emerge in a pink ball of iridescent fluid. Its' sound chip was the most reused. It is shared by [[Scary Cyclops]], [[Rage (Stretch Screamers)|Rage]] and [[Lava (Stretch Screamers)|Lava]] from the [[Blister Beast]] line as well as the 2010 and 2016 UK editions.\n\n* \"[[Scary Cyclops]]\" Featured a [[Ray Harryhausen]]-esque design with singular eye, light blue skin, gold teeth and earring. a slouched stature to emphasize its' balloon effect. It had a removable brown shirt that tied together. The figure along with the rest of the characters in series 2 featured detailed squishy hands as opposed to series 1's hard plastic hands. The cyclops had brown shackles around its' wrists and barefoot detailed hard plastic feet. It also featured a bellybutton which was unique to the figure. When the body was squeezed a ball of green gel would bulge out from the figures' left shoulder. It also contained a small rubber mans head that was featured on the box art as well. It shared a sound chip with the Frankenstein figure as well as the other ones featured under Frankensteins' description.\n\n* [[\"Gross Gargoyle\"]] Resembled less of a stone Gargoyle and more of a jaundiced skinned [[Demon]] or [[Goblin]]. It stood crouched with a hunched back to emphasize its' balloon feature. Its' face had a large nose and ears, a singular white horn jutting from its' head, a wide open mouth filled with sharp bright yellow teeth. Its' eyes had yellow whites and red irises. It wore tattered red shorts and a removable dark green cloak that when removed reveals the figures' scoliosis inflicted spine. Its' arms were particularly long and its' wrists wore silver shackles with remnants of chains still attached. It is similar in gait to the [[Scary Cyclops]] except the hands only have 4 fingers on each hand instead of 5. When the body was squeezed a yellow mass filled with gel and rubber bones would emerge from the figures' back hump. It shares a sound chip with the [[Ghoul]].\n\n* [[\"Angry Alien\"]] was a truly unique design. It was an alien with a light blue head with green compound eyes. It did not have a removable costume as its' body was a purple and yellow space suit complete with hard plastic helmet over the head which would contain the balloon effect. The spece suit had oxygen tanks on the back of the figure and tubes that would lead up to the helmet. It had squishy grey tri-fingered hands and hard almost claw like bisected feet. The figure also had a detachable ray gun that would attach to a hole on its' right thigh. When the body was squeezed it would cause the aliens' red brain to bulge up against the helmet. It had a unique sound chip that sounded shrill and other worldly that would not be shared by any of the other figures. \n\n* [[\"Creepy Creature\"]] was an aquatic fish like monster baring some resemblance to the [[Gill-man|Gill Man]]. Like the [[Angry Alien]], the figure did not have any removable clothing as its' skin was green and scaly; complete with fins, webbed hands, bright green eyes, very large gills and an open mouth filled with several rows of short white teeth. When the body was squeezed, the balloon effect would emerge from the figures chest in the form of a green mass with rubber organs. It had a unique sound chip that sounded of gurgling and belching. The [[McDonald's]] happy meal toy line also had creature figure that was very similar in design.\n\n* '''\"Blister Beast\"''' were a line of the [[Stretch Screamers]] series that featured 4 new characters that each had multiple balloon effects. 2 of which had larger heads where the balloon effects would come out while the other two had smaller heads and larger bodies to accommodate the balloon effects. \n*[[Mummy]] \n*[[Ghoul]]\n*[[Rage (Stretch Screamers)|Rage]]\n*[[Lava]]\n\n'''*[[Oozers]]''' \n*[[Drooler]]\n*[[Gunk (Stretch Screamers)|Gunk]]\n*[[Slobber]]\n*[[Sludge]]\n\n'''*[[Splat Bugz]]'''\n*[[Fright Termite]]\n*[[Gross Roach]]\n*[[Splat Ant]]\n*[[Squishy Scorpion]]\n*[[Splatter Fly]]\n*[[Mushy Dragonfly]]\n*[[Mighty Mantis]]\n*[[Tarantula]]\n\n'''*Mini Stretch Screamers''' were a line of hard plastic Stretch Screamers figures that were held together by elastic cords. When different parts of the characters were pulled \"gross surprises\" would be revealed. They were not electronic however, some models included a dungeon or alien lab that had a button that when pressed would play limited sound clips from the \"Mummy\" character. These figures were highly detailed with spattered paint jobs and unique sculpts. \n\n*[[Krackus]] was an aquatic fish like monster baring no resemblance to the [[Creepy Creature]]. It had a bright green chest and abdomen while the head, arms, and legs were a dark, almost black green. Its' hands and feet were webbed and had yellow eyes and two small insect like fangs. The figures' head, arms. and back were covered in fins as well. When the head was pulled, it would reveal Krackus' bug like eyes and when his secondary head was pulled, it would reveal a chasm of sharp teeth leading down his throat. Pulling on the torso reveals some greenish rib bones.\n\n*[[N-Fested]] resembles a stone gargoyle. On the box he appears to be a soft pink color but in actuality it is grey and resembles stone. It Stands in similar fashion to [[Gross Gargoyle]]. Its' face is similar to that of a Bulldog, with two fangs pointed upward. The character also features a cybernetic arm. It has a tribal style belt with an orange fur loincloth. The characters' arms and head are able to be pulled alongside with a back piece that when pulled or moved aside reveals many small versions of the creature living inside of it.\n\n*[[Xross-Check]] (pronounced \"Cross Check\") is a presumably deceased hockey player wearing a mask similar to that of [[Jason Voorhees]]. This character has grey skin, parted orange hair, and the arms and stomach are wrapped in grip tape. Pulling on the head reveals his skull and pulling the torso reveals his organs.\n\n*[[Uga-Bug]] is a bipedal roach monster.\n*[[The 1-ton Twins]]\n*[[Skull Alien]]\n\n\n'''* \"McDonald's Stretch Screamers\"'''\n*[[Mummy]]\n*[[Cyborg]]\n*[[Robot]]\n*[[Scientist]]\n*[[Skeleton]]\n*Creature\n*[[Ogre]] (recalled)\n*[[Ghost]] (recalled)\n\n'''*2010 Release'''\n*[[Ghoul]]\n*[[Mummy]]\n*[[Frankenstein]]\n*[[Dracula]]\n\n*2016 Release\n*[[Ghoul]]\n*[[Mummy]]\n*[[Frankenstein]]\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.millionaireplayboy.com/toys/mcstretch.php\n*http://www.strangekidsclub.com/2011/05/10/toychest-time-machine-stretch-screamers/\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Electronic toys]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves]]\n[[Category:Toy characters]]\n[[Category:2000s toys]]\n[[Category:Action figures]]\n[[Category:Entertainment robots]]\n[[Category:Doll brands]]\n[[Category:Toy animals]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Stretch Screamers''' was a series of electronic toys by [[Manley Toys Limited]] of [[Hong Kong]].\n\n==Design==\nStretch Screamers were a line of toy monsters from the early 2000\"s that could be stretched, causing them to scream.
