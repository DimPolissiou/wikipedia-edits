{"title_page": "Russian mafia", "text_new": "{{organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation.\"<ref name=\"Bauer\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Russian mafia can be traced back to Russia's [[Russian Empire|imperial period]], which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were [[peasants]], in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned [[Robin Hood]]-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming [[folk heroes]]. In time, the ''Vorovskoy Mir'' (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131991: Soviet era===\nDuring Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to ''[[gulag]]s'' (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become ''vorami v zakone'' (\"thieves-in-law\"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as ''suka'' (\"bitch\"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the \"hierarchy\". Outcast, the ''suki'' separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of [[Bitch Wars]] from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from ''gulags''. Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an \"every-man-for-himself\" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the [[Brezhnev era]], and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Then, in the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAlso during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], with most settling in a southern [[Brooklyn]] area known as [[Brighton Beach]] (sometimes nicknamed as \"Little [[Odessa]]\"). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\"/> The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the \"[[Potato Bag Gang]],\" a group of [[con artists]] disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold [[rubles]] for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was [[Evsei Agron]].<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nPauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization,<ref name=\"RICO Act\"/> and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated. [[Boris Nayfeld|Boris \"Biba\" Nayfeld]], his bodyguard, moved on to employ under [[Marat Balagula]], who was believed to have succeeded Agron's authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of [[Merrill Lynch]] customers, and was found in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]] in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nBalagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 [[credit card fraud]] in 1992.<ref name=\"influx of gangsters\"/> Nayfield took Balagula's place, partnering with the \"Polish Al Capone\", Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business.<ref name=\"Ricardo Fanchini\"/> In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\"/>\n\n===1992\u20132000: Growth and internationalization===\nWhen the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia's economy, with many ex-[[KGB]] agents and veterans of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghan war]] offering their skills to the crime bosses.<ref name=\"Freeh\" /> Gangster [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet's dissolution, so that top ''vory v zakone'' could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-Communist states. It was agreed that [[Vyacheslav Ivankov|Vyacheslav \"Yaponchik\" Ivankov]] would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America.<ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" /> Within a year, he built an international operation that included, but was not limited to, [[narcotics]], [[money laundering]], and [[prostitution]] and made ties with the [[American Mafia]] and Colombian [[drug cartels]], eventually extending to [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].<ref name=\"history channel\" /> Those who went against him were usually killed.\n\nPrior to Ivankov's arrival, Balagula's downfall left a void for America's next ''vory v zakone''. Monya Elson, leader of Monya's ''Brigada'' (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\" /> Ivankov's arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former's life.<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998)<ref name=\"Sierra Leone\" /> and in Italy in 1995, respectively.<ref name=\"ny daily news\" />\n\nIvankov's reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /><ref name=\"history channel\" /> Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the ''Solntsevskaya Bratva''), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri \"Globus\" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in [[Vienna]] rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business. Two months later, Ivankov got into  another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the [[Orekhovskaya gang|''Orekhovskaya'' gang]], Segei \"Sylvester\" Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.<ref name=\"Friedman\" />\n\nIn 1995, the [[Camorra]] cooperated with the Russian Mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US$1 bills and reprint them as $100s. These bills would then be transported to the Russian Mafia for distribution in 29 post-[[Eastern Bloc]] countries and former Soviet republics. In return, the Russian Mafia paid the Camorra with property (including a Russian bank) and firearms, smuggled into Eastern Europe and [[Italy]].<ref name=Richards>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=James R.|title=Transnational Criminal Organizations, Cybercrime, and Money Laundering|pages=7|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=9781420048728}}</ref>\n\nBack in Eastern Europe in May 1995, crime boss [[Semion Mogilevich]] held a different summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|And\u011bl]], a neighborhood of [[Prague]]. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]''. However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the ''Solntsevskaya'' were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and ''Solntsevskaya'' leader [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]] had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"prague daily\" />\n\nOne person who was not there was Mogilevich himself.

In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to [[Miami]] and opened up a strip club called Porky's, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an [[ambassador]] among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt [[Russian military]]. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a [[submarine]] for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami. Facing the possibility of life imprisonment, the latter agreed for his testimony against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence, which ended up being 33 months.<ref name=\"history channel\" /><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" />\n\n===2001\u2013present===\nAs the 21st century dawned, the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan.

They also provide an intelligence for the upcoming \"delo\" or on a certain target. They usually stay out of the main actions, although there might be exceptions, depending on circumstances. During a \"delo\" Shestyorkas perform security functions standing on the look out (Shukher \u2013 literally: danger). It is a temporary position and an individual either makes it into the Vor-world or is cast aside. As they are earning their respect and trust in Bratva they may be performing roles of the regular Boyeviks or Byki depending on the necessities and patronage of their Brigadier or Avtorityet. Etymology of 'shestyorka' word comes from the lowest rank of 36 playing card deck \u2013 sixes.\n\nIn the Russian Mafia, \"Vor\" (plural: Vory) (literally, \"Thief\") is an honorary title denoting a [[made man]]. The honor of becoming a Vor is only given when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title.

This is the highest group that controls both support group and security group.\n# Security group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to make sure the organization keeps running and also keeps the peace between the organizations and other criminal groups and also paying off the right people. This group works with the Elite group and is equal in power with the Support groups. Is in charge of security and in intelligence.\n# Support group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to watch over the working unit collecting the money while supervising their criminal activities. This group works with the elite group and is equal in power with the Security group. They plan a specific crime for a specialized group or choose who carries out the operation.\n# Working Unit \u2013 There are four Brigadiers running a criminal activity in the working unit. Each Brigade is controlled by a Brigadier. This is the lowest group working with only the Support group. The group is involved in burglars, thieves, prostitution, extortion, street gangs and other crimes.\n\n==Notable individual groups==\n'''Groups based in and around the [[Moscow|City of Moscow]]:'''\n\n* ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]'': Led by [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei \"Mikhas\" Mikhailov]], it is Russia's largest criminal group with about 5,000 members, and is named after the [[Solntsevo District]].<ref name=\"focus features\"/><ref name=\"BBC rise\"/>\n* Lyuberetskaya Bratva (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430) or Lyubery (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u044b): One of the largest criminal groups in late 1980s \u2013 early-mid-1990s in the USSR.

The acronym OPG is Organized Criminal (''Prestupnaya'' in Russian) Group, used to refer to any of the Russian mafia groups, sometimes modified with a specific name, e.g. Orekhovskaya OPG. Sometimes the initialism is translated and OCG is used.\n\nOrganized crime in Russia began in the imperial period of the [[tsar]]s, but it was not until the Soviet era that ''[[Thief in law|vory v zakone]]'' (\"thieves-in-law\") emerged as leaders of prison groups in [[Gulag|forced labor camps]], and their honor code became more defined. With the end of [[World War II]], the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Joseph Stalin]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], more gangs emerged in a flourishing [[black market]], exploiting the unstable governments of the former Republics, and at its highest point, even controlling as much as two-thirds of the Russian economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Louis Freeh]], former director of the [[FBI]], said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to [[National Security of the United States|U.S. national security]] in the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Freeh\" />\n\nIn modern times, there are as many as 6,000 different groups,<ref name=\"fas.org\" /> with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders.{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the Russian National Central Bureau of [[Interpol]], stated \"Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad\",<ref name=\"Lakhonin\" /> while in August 2010, [[Alain Bauer]], a French criminologist, said that it \"is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation.\"<ref name=\"Bauer\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Russian mafia can be traced back to Russia's [[Russian Empire|imperial period]], which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were [[peasants]], in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned [[Robin Hood]]-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming [[folk heroes]]. In time, the ''Vorovskoy Mir'' (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131991: Soviet era===\nDuring Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to ''[[gulag]]s'' (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become ''vorami v zakone'' (\"thieves-in-law\"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as ''suka'' (\"bitch\"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the \"hierarchy\". Outcast, the ''suki'' separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of [[Bitch Wars]] from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from ''gulags''. Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an \"every-man-for-himself\" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the [[Brezhnev era]], and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Then, in the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAlso during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], with most settling in a southern [[Brooklyn]] area known as [[Brighton Beach]] (sometimes nicknamed as \"Little [[Odessa]]\"). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\"/> The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the \"[[Potato Bag Gang]],\" a group of [[con artists]] disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold [[rubles]] for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was [[Evsei Agron]].<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nPauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization,<ref name=\"RICO Act\"/> and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated. [[Boris Nayfeld|Boris \"Biba\" Nayfeld]], his bodyguard, moved on to employ under [[Marat Balagula]], who was believed to have succeeded Agron's authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of [[Merrill Lynch]] customers, and was found in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]] in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nBalagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 [[credit card fraud]] in 1992.<ref name=\"influx of gangsters\"/> Nayfield took Balagula's place, partnering with the \"Polish Al Capone\", Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business.<ref name=\"Ricardo Fanchini\"/> In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\"/>\n\n===1992\u20132000: Growth and internationalization===\nWhen the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia's economy, with many ex-[[KGB]] agents and veterans of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghan war]] offering their skills to the crime bosses.<ref name=\"Freeh\" /> Gangster [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet's dissolution, so that top ''vory v zakone'' could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-Communist states. It was agreed that [[Vyacheslav Ivankov|Vyacheslav \"Yaponchik\" Ivankov]] would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America.<ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" /> Within a year, he built an international operation that included, but was not limited to, [[narcotics]], [[money laundering]], and [[prostitution]] and made ties with the [[American Mafia]] and Colombian [[drug cartels]], eventually extending to [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].<ref name=\"history channel\" /> Those who went against him were usually killed.\n\nPrior to Ivankov's arrival, Balagula's downfall left a void for America's next ''vory v zakone''. Monya Elson, leader of Monya's ''Brigada'' (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\" /> Ivankov's arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former's life.<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998)<ref name=\"Sierra Leone\" /> and in Italy in 1995, respectively.<ref name=\"ny daily news\" />\n\nIvankov's reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /><ref name=\"history channel\" /> Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the ''Solntsevskaya Bratva''), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri \"Globus\" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in [[Vienna]] rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business. Two months later, Ivankov got into  another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the [[Orekhovskaya gang|''Orekhovskaya'' gang]], Segei \"Sylvester\" Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.<ref name=\"Friedman\" />\n\nIn 1995, the [[Camorra]] cooperated with the Russian Mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US$1 bills and reprint them as $100s. These bills would then be transported to the Russian Mafia for distribution in 29 post-[[Eastern Bloc]] countries and former Soviet republics. In return, the Russian Mafia paid the Camorra with property (including a Russian bank) and firearms, smuggled into Eastern Europe and [[Italy]].<ref name=Richards>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=James R.|title=Transnational Criminal Organizations, Cybercrime, and Money Laundering|pages=7|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=9781420048728}}</ref>\n\nBack in Eastern Europe in May 1995, crime boss [[Semion Mogilevich]] held a different summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|And\u011bl]], a neighborhood of [[Prague]]. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]''. However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the ''Solntsevskaya'' were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and ''Solntsevskaya'' leader [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]] had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"prague daily\" />\n\nOne person who was not there was Mogilevich himself. He claimed that \"[b]y the time I arrived at U Holubu, everything was already in full swing, so I went into a neighboring hotel and sat in the bar there until about five or six in the morning.\"<ref name=\"Glenny\" /><ref name=\"BBC transcript\" /> Mikhailov would later be arrested in [[Switzerland]] in October 1996 on numerous charges,<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> including that he was the head of a powerful Russian mafia group, but was exonerated and released two years later after evidence was not enough to prove much.<ref name=\"ny times\" /><ref name=\"la times\" />\n\nThe global extent of Russian organized crime wasn't realized until [[Ludwig Fainberg|Ludwig \"Tarzan\" Fainberg]] was arrested in January 1997, primarily because of arms dealing. In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to [[Miami]] and opened up a strip club called Porky's, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an [[ambassador]] among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt [[Russian military]]. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a [[submarine]] for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami. Facing the possibility of life imprisonment, the latter agreed for his testimony against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence, which ended up being 33 months.<ref name=\"history channel\" /><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" />\n\n===2001\u2013present===\nAs the 21st century dawned, the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan. New Mafia bosses sprang up, while imprisoned ones were released. Among the released were Marat Balagula and [[Vyacheslav Ivankov]], both in 2004.<ref name=\"Balagula release\"/><ref name=\"Ivankov dead\"/> The latter was extradited to Russia, but was jailed once more for his alleged murders of two Turks in a Moscow restaurant in 1992; he was cleared of all charges and released in 2005.

This could be Brigadier, Pakhan, Authoritet.\n* '''Brigadier''' \u2013 also called ''Avtoritet'' (\"Authority\"), is like a ''captain'' in charge of a small group of men, similar to [[Caporegime]] in Italian-American Mafia crime families and Sicilian Mafia clans. He gives out jobs to Boyeviks (\"warriors\") and pays tribute to Pakhan. He runs a crew which is called a Brigade. A Brigade is made up of 5\u20136 Patsanov or Brodyag.\n* '''Bratok''' \u2013 also called '''Patsan''', or '''Brodyaga''' works for a Brigadier having a special criminal activity to run, similar to [[Soldato|soldiers]] in [[American Mafia|Italian-American Mafia]] [[Crime family|crime families]] and [[Sicilian Mafia]] clans. A Boyevik is in charge of finding new guys and paying tribute up to his Brigadier. Boyeviks also make up the main strike force of a brigade.\n* '''Shestyorka''' \u2013 is an \"associate\" to the organization also called the \"six\", similar to associates in Italian-American Mafia crime families and Sicilian Mafia clans. Is an errand boy for the organization and is the lowest rank in the Russian Mafia. The sixes are assigned to some Avtorityets for support. They also provide an intelligence for the upcoming \"delo\" or on a certain target. They usually stay out of the main actions, although there might be exceptions, depending on circumstances. During a \"delo\" Shestyorkas perform security functions standing on the look out (Shukher \u2013 literally: danger). It is a temporary position and an individual either makes it into the Vor-world or is cast aside. As they are earning their respect and trust in Bratva they may be performing roles of the regular Boyeviks or Byki depending on the necessities and patronage of their Brigadier or Avtorityet. Etymology of 'shestyorka' word comes from the lowest rank of 36 playing card deck \u2013 sixes.\n\nIn the Russian Mafia, \"Vor\" (plural: Vory) (literally, \"Thief\") is an honorary title denoting a [[made man]]. The honor of becoming a Vor is only given when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title. When you become a member of the Vor-world you have to accept the code of the Vor v Zakone (\"[[Thief in law]]\").<ref name=\"Finckenauer, Waring\">James O. Finckenauer and Elin Waring.

One such model (possibly outdated by now, as it is based on the old style of Soviet criminal enterprises) works out like this:\n\n# Elite group \u2013 led by a Pakhan who is involved in management, organization and ideology. This is the highest group that controls both support group and security group.\n# Security group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to make sure the organization keeps running and also keeps the peace between the organizations and other criminal groups and also paying off the right people. This group works with the Elite group and is equal in power with the Support groups. Is in charge of security and in intelligence.\n# Support group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to watch over the working unit collecting the money while supervising their criminal activities. This group works with the elite group and is equal in power with the Security group. They plan a specific crime for a specialized group or choose who carries out the operation.\n# Working Unit \u2013 There are four Brigadiers running a criminal activity in the working unit. Each Brigade is controlled by a Brigadier. This is the lowest group working with only the Support group. The group is involved in burglars, thieves, prostitution, extortion, street gangs and other crimes.\n\n==Notable individual groups==\n'''Groups based in and around the [[Moscow|City of Moscow]]:'''\n\n* ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]'': Led by [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei \"Mikhas\" Mikhailov]], it is Russia's largest criminal group with about 5,000 members, and is named after the [[Solntsevo District]].<ref name=\"focus features\"/><ref name=\"BBC rise\"/>\n* Lyuberetskaya Bratva (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430) or Lyubery (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u044b): One of the largest criminal groups in late 1980s \u2013 early-mid-1990s in the USSR.

At the time of design, the GSA did not mandate [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification, and the building was not evaluated for it until after construction; it failed. Mayne said \"I wasn't arrogant, but I was confident \u2014 I just assumed we had the platinum (the highest LEED) rating. All of a sudden we went through LEED and it wasn't working.\" Ultimately, the building received only silver LEED qualifications; two steps below platinum.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\">{{Cite web | author=Randy Shaw|title=San Francisco\u2019s Green Building Nightmare |url=http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/San_Francisco_s_Green_Building_Nightmare_5428.html| work=BeyondCron | date=3 March 2008| accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe building has been criticized as being dysfunctional for its employees. According to an employee interviewed by BeyondChron.com, \"Workers seek to relieve the heat by opening windows, which not only sends papers flying, but, depending on their proximity to the opening, makes creating a stable temperature for all workers near impossible ... some employees must use umbrellas to keep the sun out of their cubicles.\"<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n\nMayne believed that the federal government should be a model in the promotion of worker health and exercise. This led Morphosis to specify passenger elevators that stop only at every third floor, requiring many employees and visitors to then walk up or down one or two flights of stairs to reach their destinations.  There are also elevators for the disabled that stop at each floor, but it has become commonly used by the able-bodied as well, causing overcrowding.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n[[File:San Francisco Federal Building.jpg|left|thumb|View of the entire building, consisting of the tall structure at right and the lower annex structure in the left foreground, which frame a plaza|alt=]]\nUnlike most large government office buildings, the Federal Building does not have its own cafeteria inside the building.  The cafeteria function was instead placed just outside the building on the public plaza, and was again due to the architect's belief that this would encourage employees to walk, interact, and increase worker health; a situation that seems to not be appreciated by some of the 2400 employees who work in the building.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n\nIn 2010 the GSA commissioned a survey of employees in 22 federal buildings nationwide, to determine employee satisfaction with their workplaces. The San Francisco Federal Building was included in this study even though commissioning was still underway, and tenant improvements of some floors were not complete.{{Cn|date=February 2020}} The buildings included in the study scored between a low of 13 and a high of 98 percent employee satisfaction; seventeen of the 22 buildings scored above 50 percent employee satisfaction. While incorporating many green concepts more aggressively than other buildings, the lowest ranked building for employee satisfaction was the San Francisco Federal Building, with a rating of just 13 percent; the next-lowest was considered twice as satisfactory, at 26 percent.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had begun their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India. The IIT system is entirely planned designed and created by the  Chemist [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh|Sir Jnan Chandra Ghosh]] who also became the first director of the newly created IIT in 1951 ([[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur |url=http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/about-iitkgp-history |title=Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur |publisher=Iitkgp.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2020-01-28}}</ref> Sir J.C. Ghosh also was the second person to be associated with Sc. College (after Sir CV Raman) who became the director of IISc ([[Indian Institute of Science]]). Prof. A.P.C Ray founded the Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Work and he along with prof. Hemendra Kumar Sen established the department of Applied Chemistry in Sc. College in 1920. [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|Prof. S.K.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had began their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India. The IIT system is entirely planned designed and created by the  Chemist [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh|Sir Jnan Chandra Ghosh]] who also became the first director of the newly created IIT in 1951 ([[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur |url=http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/about-iitkgp-history |title=Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur |publisher=Iitkgp.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2020-01-28}}</ref> Sir J.C. Ghosh also was the second person to be associated with Sc. College (after Sir CV Raman) who became the director of IISc ([[Indian Institute of Science]]). Prof. A.P.C Ray founded the Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Work and he along with prof. Hemendra Kumar Sen established the department of Applied Chemistry in Sc. College in 1920. [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|Prof. S.K.

The same four returned for the second season.\n\n''La Voz'' is the second adaptation of the ''Voice'' format in the United States, after ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'', which began airing in 2011. There had also previously been a Spanish-language adaptation of the spinoff format ''[[The Voice Kids]]'' in the U.S., ''[[La Voz Kids (American TV series)|La Voz Kids]]'', which aired for four seasons from 2013 to 2016.\n\n==Overview==\n\n=== Format ===\nThroughout the competition, several stages are included, as:\n\n=== National casting ===\nIn the national casting, participants in 15 broadcasts are selected. The coaches do not attend this initial phase but members of the production team do. The casting procedure can be online or in person in any of the following cities:\n\n* '''First season''', 2018: Los Angeles, Puerto Rico, New York, Chicago, San Antonio, Miami, (6 cities)\n\nIn the first season, auditions began on June 23, 2018.\n\n* '''Second season''', 2019: Miami, New York, Puerto Rico, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston (6 cities)\n\nIn the second season, auditions began on July 6, 2019.\n\n=== Stage 1: The Blind Auditions ===\nThe four coaches' chairs will have their backs to the participants, allowing them to judge a contestant based only on their voice. If the coach likes the participant's voice, he/she will press the \"I WANT YOU\" button, turning the chair around. When the judge is facing the participant this indicated that they have been selected to advance. If more than one coach presses the button, the participant will have the option to decide who they want to work with in the competition. If a participant doesn't have any judges turn their chairs they are then eliminated.\n\n=== Stage 2: The Battles ===\nIn this stage; the coaches will reduce their team by half by putting two members (or three members, in some cases) of their team into battle against each other, singing the same song. At the end each coach will make the decision on who should move onto the next stage, the other will be eliminated. However, other coaches have the ability to steal an eliminated contestant by pressing the \"I WANT YOU\" button.

The same four returned for the second season.\n\n''La Voz'' is the second adaptation of the ''Voice'' format in the United States, after ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'', which began airing in 2011. There had also previously been a Spanish-language adaptation of the spinoff format ''[[The Voice Kids]]'' in the U.S., ''[[La Voz Kids (American TV series)|La Voz Kids]]'', which aired for four seasons from 2013 to 2016.\n\n==Overview==\n\n=== Format ===\nThroughout the competition, several stages are included, as:\n\n=== National casting ===\nIn the national casting, participants in 15 broadcasts are selected. The coaches do not attend this initial phase but members of the production team do. The casting procedure can be online or in person in any of the following cities:\n\n* '''First season''', 2018: Los Angeles, Puerto Rico, New York, Chicago, San Antonio, Miami, (6 cities)\n\nIn the first season, auditions began on June 23, 2018.\n\n* '''Second season''', 2019: Miami, New York, Puerto Rico, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston (6 cities)\n\nIn the second season, auditions began on July 6, 2019.\n\n=== Stage 1: The Blind Auditions ===\nThe four coaches' chairs will have their backs to the participants, allowing them to judge a contestant based only on their voice. If the coach likes the participant's voice, he/she will press the \"I WANT YOU\" button, turning the chair around. When the judge is facing the participant this indicated that they have been selected to advance. If more than one coach presses the button, the participant will have the option to decide who they want to work with in the competition. If a participant doesn't have any judges turn their chairs they are then eliminated.\n\n=== Stage 2: The Battles ===\nIn this stage; the coaches will reduce their team by half by putting two members (or three members, in some cases) of their team into battle against each other, singing the same song. At the end each coach will make the decision on who should move onto the next stage, the other will be eliminated. However, other coaches have the ability to steal an eliminated contestant by pressing the \"I WANT YOU\" button. If more than one coach presses the button, the participant will choose their new coach. During this point coaches also have the ability to bring in outside advisers to help them coach their contestants.\n\n=== Stage 3: Live Shows ===\nThis is the last stage. The participant named La Voz (U.S.) must have two important points: the approval of his/her coach and great public acceptance. Though different seasons apply different mechanics, the only thing that is the same is that each participant performs live for an audience to receive the public's vote.

The village is on the top of a hill surrounded by mountains, a lake, and brushland. Ameno contains numerous ancient homes and castles belonging to noble families from Turin and Milan who vacationed in Ameno during the summer.\n\nIn its territory the municipality has the [[Santuario della Madonna della Bocciola]].\n\n== History ==\nArchaeological research conducted in the town of Lortallo between 1915 and 1938 revealed one of the most important necropolises of the early Iron Age (called Ameno F).  The whole of the necropolises has tombs dating from the 9th to the 5th century BC and these findings are part of the Golasecca Culture, an culture common to various Celtic tribal groups who lived in the early Iron Age in western [[Lombardy]], Novara and Canton Ticino .  The territory of Ameno, however, has also returned other interesting testimonies of the ancient population of Cusio , ranging from the Middle Bronze Age (XVI - XIV century BC) to the Imperial Roman period.  The importance of the site of Ameno in prehistoric and protohistoric times is easily understood if one considers the conformation of the territory and its position.  The fertile and healthy terrace on which it extends as well as offering land suitable for crops and grazing allowed the control of an obligatory passage point, strategically placed between the lake and the Agogna valley .  The lake was an easy link with Ossola and the Alpine passes;  the Agogna valley was an active terrestrial itinerary from the most ancient prehistory, probably more suitable for the transhumance of the herds of animals from the Novara plain to the mountains rather than for the exchange of goods, which preferred instead the Ticino waterway.  In Roman times, the road was strengthened with the construction of a road from Novara to Ossola, as evidenced by the numerous Roman findings that punctuate the most probable route.  Finally, we cannot forget the paths that could easily lead from Cusio to Verbano, which in prehistoric times was the most important commercial route between the Adriatic and the Alps with Ticino and the Po .\n\n=== The oldest finds ===\nIn 1992, while a fence was being installed around the cemetery of Ameno, in Borgo del Magnanoa, a significant quantity of ceramic material from the Bronze Age was found and reported by a local, Walter Baronchelli,  which is now kept in the Municipality of Ameno.  A subsequent excavation test carried out in 1994 highlighted a layer of ceramic for domestic use coming from a nearby settlement, dating back to the Middle Bronze Age.\n\n=== The \"sepulchres\" of Lortallo ===\nAt the foot of the ridge on which the hamlet of Lortallo stands (467 m asl ) there is a small valley that separates it from the motto of the Garulo farmhouse and from Monte Mesma (576 m asl ).  It is easily accessed from the north and going up from the Rio Membra, a small tributary of the Agogna.  To the south the valley narrows and runs out at the foot of the Mesma.  In this place in 1915, when the modern road to Bolzano Novarese was built, the first tomb of the necropolis was discovered.  Since then and for more than thirty years Pietro Barocelli , one of the fathers of Italian palethnology, and the engineer Giulio Decio, honorary Inspector of the Superintendency, have conducted systematic research campaigns that led to the discovery of numerous burials attributable above all to the early Iron Age .\n\nThe archaeological areas of Lortallo, called \"burials\", were indicated by the discoverers with letters of the alphabet:\n\n* Ameno A burial ground, in Lortallino (tombs 1-2 and 139-143)\n* Ameno B burial ground, in Lortallo (tombs nos. 3-46)\n* Ameno C burial ground, in the locality of Lortallo, villa Broglio (findings from the Roman rooster era)\n* Sepulcreto Ameno D, in the locality of Lortallo, Decio factory (various fragments and objects from the Roman age)\n* Ameno E burial ground, in Mesma (tombs nos. 47 and 48-63)\n* Ameno F burial ground in Mesma (tombs nos. 64-126 and 127-138)\n\nThe tombs, according to the use of the Culture of Golasecca , were indirectly incinerated, with the deposition of the bones of the deceased, personal objects (bronze and iron fibulae, bronze pendants and bracelets) and the ashes of the funeral stake within a ceramic urn.  In the most ancient phases this was laid, sometimes covered by a bowl used as a lid, in a simple hole in the ground or in a small box made with thin stone slabs.  In the more recent phases, the funerary equipment is enriched with the deposition of accessory vases inside stone cysts made with large slabs.  There are also wells lined with pebbles to form a small vault.  Stone structures built above and around the tombs have also been identified, serving as markers for the tombs themselves.  As remains of offerings, some wells dug near the tombs and the numerous ceramic fragments found in the surrounding terrain must be interpreted.  The acidity of the soil, which does not allow the conservation of organic remains, destroyed the traces of offers of vegetable and animal food to the deceased.  Inside the cinerary urns, charred hazelnuts were sometimes preserved, which had been laid on the funeral pyre together with the deceased.  In many cases the presence of ceramic glasses with the function of beverage containers offered to the deceased was observed inside the cineraries.  Studies conducted on contemporary necropolises have made it possible to establish whether it is beer or wine.\n\n==== Ameno A ====\nOn 22 July 1915 , in Lortallino, during the excavation works of the road from Bolzano Novarese to Ameno, two burials were identified.  The research conducted by the Superintendency to verify whether it was isolated tombs or a necropolis was initially unsuccessful, but it was understood that other burials must have been present in the area.  In the summer of 1936, following the accidental discovery of a new tomb (A 140), the honorary Inspector of Monuments for the Riviera di San Giulio , engineer Giulio Decio, conducted new excavations, identifying three other burials (A 141-143) .  The materials identified can be dated from Golasecca IC to II A (690-550 BC).\n\n==== Ameno B ====\nIn 1916 two burials were accidentally discovered in Lortallino.  The systematic excavations conducted under the direction of Barocelli in 1917 and 1920 allowed the discovery of 42 other well-shaped burials defended by lithic slabs, surrounded and covered by structures, paved and dry stone walls.  In Ameno B, burials with over-roofs represent a high percentage of the depositions and cannot be connected to kits of particular importance, but have an interesting analogy with those of the necropolises of Minusio , Solduno and Mesocco in the Canton of Ticino , where the relationship between their shape and the sex of the deceased, with the use of circular paving for male and rectangular burials for female ones.  The Ameno B necropolis was used by Golasecca IC at II AB (690-525 BC).\n\n==== Ameno C ====\nIn the year 1899 in the area of Lortallo , building a factory owned by the same Decio, various objects of the Roman rooster age were unearthed in mixed soil of coals.  In September 1919 , other works carried out there brought to light clay fragments from the Roman age.\n\n==== Ameno D ====\nIn 1923 in the park of Villa Broglio, near the Pasquirolo farmhouse, some Roman clay fragments were found accidentally and, not far away, a cremation tomb containing a corroded imperial coin of medium bronze, from the Augustan age.  In 1926 , the remains of a wall with Roman rooster materials were discovered in the same locality.\n\n==== Ameno E ====\nThe first tomb (E 47) was already identified on 10 June 1915 at the western slopes of Mount Mesma during the excavation for the extension of the country road destined to become the carriage road from Bolzano Novarese to Ameno.  Barocelli, who went to the place for investigations, noticed the traces of tampering with other tombs, of which \"a very large quantity of clay fragments, mixed with burnt bones and very few traces of bronze objects\" was found.  New essays conducted by Pietro Barocelli and Decio in 1922-1923 north of the road in Mesma allowed the identification of other burials (E 48-63), with abundant ceramic equipment and with some stone superstructures.  The area seemed disturbed by Roman interventions (tiles and bricks interspersed with heaps of stones were found), while the necropolis seemed to run out on the edge of an ancient peat bog.  The tombs are framed mainly in the Golasecca IC phase (690 - 600 BC)\n\n==== Ameno F ====\nThe first excavations in the area of \u200b\u200bthe burial ground F, a short distance from Ameno E, were carried out at the beginning of 1928. In that year, in need of building stones, the Decio had excavations carried out in a field at the foot of Mesma, where the remains of a stone wall emerged, finding some tombs from the early Iron and Rooster Roman age.  The excavations continued on several occasions until 1936 bringing to light numerous burials (F 64-138).  The necropolis \"F\" of Ameno, the oldest among those identified in Ameno, is one of the most important for the study of the beginnings of the Iron Age in the context of the Culture of Golasecca.  Characteristics of this necropolis are the biconical or biconical ovoid cinerary urns with decoration made of a false string and pairs of small handles on the maximum expansion and the ovoid urns with decoration in metopal squares with geometric or figured motifs.  The latter, rare in the Golasecchian culture which prefers geometric decoration, are stylized quadrupedal figures, generally interpreted as equine.  The \"ponies\" of Ameno, chronologically limited to the ninth century BC, are perhaps to be related to the coeval spread of horse riding in northern Italy and the consequent decline of the oldest tradition of chariot fighting.  It does not seem accidental that this figurative motif is widespread mainly in the area between Ameno and Castelletto Ticino , a territory which still today offers ideal characteristics for the breeding of horses.  The necropolis F was used for several centuries.  Although the most frequented phase is Golasecca I A1 (c. 935 - 800 BC), there are in fact more recent isolated tombs up to G. II B (525-480 BC) and the Roman rooster era.\n\n==== The burial ground G ====\nA new area of \u200b\u200bnecropolis was discovered accidentally, again by Walter Baronchelli, in 1976 .  During excavation works, about a hundred meters south of the burial ground F numerous fragments of clay referable to iron age tombs upset by the works were unearthed and two intact burials with relative well-preserved ceramic could be recovered. Olles, vases and bowls high foot datable to Golasecca II.  No further excavations were carried out in the area.  The finds were delivered to the municipality and then deposited by the Archaeological Superintendence in the Museum of Antiquities of Turin.\n\n=== Mount Mesma ===\nThe Franciscan convent on Monte Mesma\n\nParallel to the research in the necropolis areas, Giulio Decio also conducted excavation tests on the slopes of Mount Mesma, under the Franciscan monastery where brick fragments from the Roman era had been found.  The research led to the identification, in various points, of fragments of protohistoric domestic pottery in a secondary position, bronze fibulae and remains of clay fictile from the Roman period.  These discoveries led the Decio to hypothesize the presence of a built-up area on the well-stocked summit of Mount Mesma , from which the surrounding area is easily dominated.  An indirect confirmation of the strategic value of the place, centuries later, is given by the construction in the Middle Ages of a castle, probably in 1200 , by the Municipality of Novara .  The present Franciscan monastery was later built on the ruins of this.  The necropolises discovered in Lortallo were located along the main access road to the town, according to a use widely attested in the early Iron Age .  The village on Mesma was the most important, but probably not the only inhabited center.  According to the use of the golasecchiano world, smaller nuclei, linked to the main by clanic constraints, had to rise on the surrounding hills.  Coeval ceramic remains were in fact recovered in Lortallo and on the Buccione hill.\n\n=== The Roman age ===\nThe Roman period is less documented in Ameno than in protohistory.  At Lortallo and on the Mesma there is no lack of frequent visitors, but since the materials are isolated and accidentally found, it is not currently possible to reconstruct the general picture of the settlement.  The findings made on the rest of the territory have unfortunately gone missing, like the Roman vase found at about one meter deep in 1931 , inside the park of the Villa Calabi, in Vacciago.  In 1693 , as the historian Lazzaro Agostino Cotta writes, Giovanni Battista Bertochino had found some imperial Roman coins of the III and IV century in a fund of his in the \"castle\" locality.\n\n== Economy ==\nIn the past, the people of the region lived mainly on agriculture and livestock, which has now gone into decline. Currently, the area has artisan companies, and an articulated commercial network. Due to lack of jobs many Amenese have to find work in neighboring municipalities.  Through thanks to the region's valuable artistic heritage, the municipality has in recent years seen a boost in tourism.\n\n== Geography and territory ==\n[[File:Ameno Lortallo veduta.jpg|thumb|Photo of house in Lortallo]]\nThe municipal area is located on a large natural balcony overlooking the eastern shore of [[Lake Orta]].
