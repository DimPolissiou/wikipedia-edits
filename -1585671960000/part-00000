It was a gift from [[Queen Victoria]] to President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1880 and was built from the [[English oak]] timbers of the British Arctic exploration ship {{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}}. [[Franklin Roosevelt]] requested the addition of a door with the presidential seal to conceal his leg braces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resolute Desk|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm|website=White House Museum|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}</ref> Many presidents since Hayes have used the desk at various locations in the White House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm|title=Resolute Desk|publisher=The White House Museum|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe desk was removed from the White House after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|1963 assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], when President [[Lyndon Johnson]] allowed it to go on a traveling exhibition with other artifacts of the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|Kennedy Presidential Library]]. It was then put on display in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] brought the desk back to the Oval Office in 1977, where it has remained with every president since, excepting [[George H. W. Bush]], who used the [[C&O desk]] in the Oval Office, but kept the ''Resolute'' desk in the White House.\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Secretaire made from the timbers of the British Arctic ship \"Resolute,\" and presented by Queen Victoria to the President of the United States LCCN99471788.jpg|thumb|Secretaire made from the timbers of the British Arctic ship ''Resolute'']]\nThe original design plan and elevation for the \"President's Desk\" were created on September 9, 1879. They are now kept by the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich, England, and can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web|title=President's Desk|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/386371.html|website=National Maritime Museum|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe National Maritime Museum's September 9, 1879, design plans are drawings for two different gifts proposed by the Admiralty but never executed, a \"[[Secretaire]]\" and a \"Library Table\". The library table and the President's secretaire were never implemented and these proposed gifts were replaced with William Evenden's 1880 ''Resolute'' desk. The Evenden desk delivered to President Hayes does not accord with the plan held at Greenwich except for the order imperative that it \"be made from the timbers of the late Arctic Ship ''Resolute''\".\n\nThe design plan for the desk provided for ornate features to be incorporated into the proposed Library Table were tabulated on the September 9, 1879, Design Plans under the caption \"References\" as follows:\n\n{{quote|Proposed Library Table having two Fronts, one for the Presidents use the other for his Secretary. If one Front only is required, then three panels containing Arctic subjects is proposed.\n\nA.  Front for Presidents use, fitted with six drawers in Pedestals & three drawers in Top.\n\nB.

Over Busts on the Ends representation of Arctic & Antarctic Circles on Top Frame.\n\nH.  Handles representative of Friendship, Male & Female, on the drawers.\n\nI.   Top to be covered in Morocco Leather & embossed to order.\n}}\n\nAn image of the desk purporting to be the gift delivered to President Hayes appeared as a steel engraving in the December 11, 1880, issue of ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'', New York, captioned: \"Secretaire Made From the Timbers of the British Arctic Ship ''Resolute'' and Presented by Queen Victoria to the President of the United States\". Beneath the half page image is a related article, which describes the desk inaccurately:\n\n{{quote|The design for the secretaire is the work of a working-joiner employed at the dockyard at Chatham. England, where the ''Resolute'' was broken up. The top is covered with morocco, bordered and embossed. The front panels contained carved medallion portraits of Her Majesty and the President of the United States; the side panels, Arctic subjects, also in relief; and the space at the back of the table, corresponding with the front panels, is furnished with a set of six drawers on either side, the handles of which are formed by two hands \u2013 male and female \u2013 grasping each other, symbolic of the goodwill existing between the heads of the two countries. The top cornices of the eight corner pedestals were appropriated to carved representations of the Arctic and Antarctic circles and the American and English flags crossed, while busts of celebrated arctic explorers support the cornices.}}\n\nThe image and the written description in the newspaper article are not of the Evenden President's Desk delivered on November 23, 1880, but depicts the desk in the Admiralty's September 9, 1879, design plan for the library table.\n\n=== Plaque ===\n[[File:Thatcher at Oval Office desk with Carter.jpg|thumb|[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] reads the inscription on the front of the desk in 1979, accompanied by President [[Jimmy Carter]].]]\n\nA plate on the front of the desk presented to President Hayes bears the following inscription:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/The+Presidents+Desk.htm |title= The President's Desk |accessdate= May 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|H.M.S.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered a hinged front panel for the knee hole opening in order to hide his leg braces. The panel features the [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]]\u2014one of only three of the ninety-seven in the White House that have the eagle's head turned towards the 13 [[arrow]]s in the eagle's left [[Talon (anatomy)|talon]], as opposed to the now-official arrangement with the eagle turned towards the [[olive branch]] in the right talon with the 13 leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm |title= Resolute Desk |publisher= WhiteHouseMuseum.org |accessdate= January 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe second modification was done to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a [[plinth]].  The first time a base was made for the ''Resolute'' desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. It was made of pine and did not match the desk well. It is very visible in a photo of [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] playing under the desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk be sent back to the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. Photos from January\u2013February 1977 show the ''Resolute'' desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs on the top of the knee hole. The White House's earliest image of the desk with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for the desk in 1986, and has remained with the desk since that time.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== HMS ''Resolute'' ===\n[[File:Jules Cambon signs Treaty of Paris, 1899.JPG|thumb|[[Jules Cambon]], the French Ambassador to the United States, signing the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|memorandum of ratification]] on behalf of Spain in 1899.]]\n[[File:William Simpson - George Zobel - England and America. The visit of her majesty Queen Victoria to the Arctic ship Resolute - December 16th, 1856.jpg|400px|thumb|Queen Victoria visits HMS ''Resolute'', December 16, 1856, the day before the ship was granted to her as a good will gesture.]]\n\n{{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}} was part of a five-ship squadron under [[Edward Belcher]] sent from Britain in April 1852 to search for the missing British explorer [[Sir John Franklin]], who had left Britain in 1845 in search of the fabled [[Northwest Passage]] through the Canadian Arctic. The Western Division of the squadron, consisting of HMS ''Resolute'' and HMS ''Intrepid'' under [[Henry Kellett|Captain Kellett]]'s command, sailed West and wintered at Deally Island off [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. The Eastern Division, consisting of [[HMS Assistance (1850)|HMS ''Assistance'']] and ''Pioneer'' under Sir Edward Belcher's command, sailed North up the [[Wellington Channel]] and wintered near Northumberland Sound. The men spent the autumn of 1852, and the spring and summer of 1853 sledging across the Arctic in search of the Franklin Expedition, as well as the men on [[HMS Investigator (1848)|HMS ''Investigator'']] (Captain [[Robert McClure]]), and [[HMS Enterprise (1848)|HMS ''Enterprise'']] (Captain [[Richard Collinson]]).  After finding and rescuing McClure and the crew of ''Investigator'', ''Resolute'' and ''Intrepid'' sailed east, but had to winter in the pack ice, gradually moving East all winter. Belcher's two ships moved south in the Wellington Channel before being frozen in again near Disaster Bay. In the spring of 1854 Belcher ordered the abandonment of four of his five ships, and the men gathered at [[Beechey Island]]. By the time they were ready to leave, both ''Assistance'' and ''Pioneer'' had broken free and had traveled 45 miles South in the Wellington Channel until they were only a few miles from Beechey Island. This made no difference to Belcher who was simply desperate to go home. Since he had made his two ships \"hells afloat\" as he always did, his men were also desperate to leave. However, Kellett only abandoned ''Resolute'' and ''Intrepid'' under protest. The officers and men returned home on HMS ''North Star'' and the relief ships [[HMS Phoenix (1832)|HMS ''Phoenix'']] and HMS ''Talbot''.\n\nAs a matter of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by [[courts-martial]]. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four seaworthy vessels, as were ''Resolute'''s captain, Henry Kellett; ''Intrepid'' 's commander, [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]; and ''Pioneer'' 's commander, [[Sherard Osborn]]. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his court-martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. ''Resolute'' continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from [[New London, Connecticut|New London, CT]] saw ''Resolute'' adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in [[Davis Strait]]. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, ''George Henry,'' had preceded ''Resolute'', and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.\n\nAt the time of the salvage in 1855, Britain and America had several areas of active dispute: Britain's territorial claims in [[History of Belize (1506\u20131862)|Belize]], which the United States claimed violated the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]]<ref name=\"FP3rdMsg\">{{cite web|title=Franklin Pierce: Third Annual Message|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29496|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref> and disputes over fishing rights and the border between [[British Columbia]] and [[Washington Territory]].<ref name=\"HistoryNetSanJuanDispute\">{{cite web|title=San Juan Boundary Dispute {{!}} HistoryNet|url=http://www.historynet.com/san-juan-boundary-dispute.htm|website=www.historynet.com|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref> In March 1855, an armed action by Washington Territory officials in the [[San Juan Islands]] had raised tensions between the countries.<ref name=\"HistoryNetSanJuanDispute\" /> After the ''Resolute'' was recovered, Senator [[James Murray Mason]], from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the federal government to buy ''Resolute'', refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President [[Franklin Pierce]] signed it into law.\n\n''Resolute'' was sent to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at [[Spithead]] on December 12, 1856. After ''Resolute'' was towed to [[Cowes]] so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good-will on December 17, 1856.\n\nSoon the talk of imminent war ceased, and the gift of ''Resolute'' was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. In 1856, the United States and Britain appointed boundary commissioners to resolve the [[San Juan Island dispute]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The International Boundary Commission first meets on June 27, 1857. - HistoryLink.org|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9328|website=www.historylink.org|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref> The disputes, however, would continue to flare until the 1860s, with conflict in the [[Pig War (1859)]] in the San Juan Islands, and the First Lord of the Admiralty warning that \"drifting into war\" was still possible in Central America<ref>{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Thomas M.|title=United States\u2013Latin American Relations, 1850\u20131903: Establishing a Relationship|date=2014|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817358235|pages=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjThBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA85&ots=ntjGBIArR6&dq=us%20britain%20central%20american%20treaties%201859%201860&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q=us%20britain%20central%20american%20treaties%201859%201860&f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|quote=Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty declared: 'We are fast drifting into war with the United States'}}</ref> until the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty#Treaties of 1859\u20131860|Central American treaties of 1859-1860]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The International Boundary Commission first meets on June 27, 1857. - HistoryLink.org|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9328|website=www.historylink.org|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Grinnell]], a New York merchant with an interest in the fate of [[Franklin's lost expedition]], had supported the gifting of ''Resolute'', and along with [[Jane Griffin|Lady Franklin]] had hoped the British would use the ship for a new search for those lost. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy doubted that any of Franklin's men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic, and declined to support a new search. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use ''Resolute'' for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing ''Resolute'' after the important role the ship had played in smoothing the relationship between her and America. ''Resolute'' stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at [[Chatham Dockyard]] in 1879.\n\n=== Presidential desk ===\n[[File:Earth-to-space call from the Oval Office (1).jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Donald Trump]], joined at the ''Resolute'' desk by NASA astronaut [[Kate Rubins]] (left) and First Daughter [[Ivanka Trump]], talks with NASA astronauts [[Peggy Whitson]] and [[Jack Fischer]] onboard the [[International Space Station]], April 24, 2017]]\nPresident [[John F.

Since then, presidents [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[Donald Trump]] have used it in the Oval Office. Some presidents, such as [[George H. W. Bush]], have used the desk in their private study rather than in the Oval Office.\n\nWhen president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took office in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwhitehouse.org/resolutedesk.html|title=The Resolute Desk|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/oval-office-history.htm|title=Oval Office History|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref> [[Richard Nixon]], who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the [[Wilson desk]], the desk from the [[The Vice President's Room|Vice President's Room]] at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and mistakenly believed to be that of former president [[Woodrow Wilson]]. [[Gerald Ford]], who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. [[Jimmy Carter]], Ford's successor, brought the ''Resolute'' desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until [[George H. W. Bush]] returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the [[C&O desk]] that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. [[Bill Clinton]] subsequently brought the ''Resolute'' desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since.\n\nIn 2009, British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] visited President Barack Obama and gave him the original framed commissioning papers for ''Resolute'' and an ornamental pen holder made from the timbers of [[HMS Gannet (1878)|HMS ''Gannet'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/deadlineusa/2009/mar/03/barack-obama-gordon-brown |title=Obama's presidential pen, holderless no more |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |date=4 March 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref> {{Citation needed span|date=November 2019|text=HMS ''Gannet'' was not a sister ship to the ''Resolute'', as has been widely reported.

''Gannet'' was launched in 1878 long after the cross Atlantic slave trade was made illegal, and also many years after the [[American Civil War]]. Therefore, she was not used in anti-slavery work in connection to these markets.

Four desks were designed and made by William Evenden. A large [[partners desk]] was presented to President [[Rutherford B.

It was a gift from [[Queen Victoria]] to President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1880 and was built from the [[English oak]] timbers of the British Arctic exploration ship {{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}}. [[Franklin Roosevelt]] requested the addition of a door with the presidential seal to conceal his leg braces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resolute Desk|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm|website=White House Museum|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}</ref> Many presidents since Hayes have used the desk at various locations in the White House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm|title=Resolute Desk|publisher=The White House Museum|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe desk was removed from the White House after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|1963 assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], when President [[Lyndon Johnson]] allowed it to go on a traveling exhibition with other artifacts of the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|Kennedy Presidential Library]]. It was then put on display in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] brought the desk back to the Oval Office in 1977, where it has remained with every president since, with the exception of [[George H. W. Bush]], who used the [[C&O desk]] in the Oval Office, but kept the ''Resolute'' desk in the White House.\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Secretaire made from the timbers of the British Arctic ship \"Resolute,\" and presented by Queen Victoria to the President of the United States LCCN99471788.jpg|thumb|Secretaire made from the timbers of the British Arctic ship ''Resolute'']]\nThe original design plan and elevation for the \"President's Desk\" were created on September 9, 1879. They are now kept by the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich, England, and can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web|title=President's Desk|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/386371.html|website=National Maritime Museum|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe National Maritime Museum's September 9, 1879, design plans are drawings for two different gifts proposed by the Admiralty but never executed, a \"[[Secretaire]]\" and a \"Library Table\". The library table and the President's secretaire were never implemented and these proposed gifts were replaced with William Evenden's 1880 ''Resolute'' desk. The Evenden desk delivered to President Hayes does not accord with the plan held at Greenwich except for the order imperative that it \"be made from the timbers of the late Arctic Ship ''Resolute''\".\n\nThe design plan for the desk provided for ornate features to be incorporated into the proposed Library Table were tabulated on the September 9, 1879, Design Plans under the caption \"References\" as follows:\n\n{{quote|Proposed Library Table having two Fronts, one for the Presidents use the other for his Secretary. If one Front only is required, then three panels containing Arctic subjects is proposed.\n\nA.  Front for Presidents use, fitted with six drawers in Pedestals & three drawers in Top.\n\nB.

Over Busts on the Ends representation of Arctic & Antarctic Circles on Top Frame.\n\nH.  Handles representative of Friendship, Male & Female, on the drawers.\n\nI.   Top to be covered in Morocco Leather & embossed to order.\n}}\n\nAn image of the desk purporting to be the gift delivered to President Hayes appeared as a steel engraving in the December 11, 1880, issue of ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'', New York, captioned: \"Secretaire Made From the Timbers of the British Arctic Ship ''Resolute'' and Presented by Queen Victoria to the President of the United States\". Beneath the half page image is a related article, which describes the desk inaccurately:\n\n{{quote|The design for the secretaire is the work of a working-joiner employed at the dockyard at Chatham. England, where the ''Resolute'' was broken up. The top is covered with morocco, bordered and embossed. The front panels contained carved medallion portraits of Her Majesty and the President of the United States; the side panels, Arctic subjects, also in relief; and the space at the back of the table, corresponding with the front panels, is furnished with a set of six drawers on either side, the handles of which are formed by two hands \u2013 male and female \u2013 grasping each other, symbolic of the goodwill existing between the heads of the two countries. The top cornices of the eight corner pedestals were appropriated to carved representations of the Arctic and Antarctic circles and the American and English flags crossed, while busts of celebrated arctic explorers support the cornices.}}\n\nThe image and the written description in the newspaper article are not of the Evenden President's Desk delivered on November 23, 1880, but depicts the desk in the Admiralty's September 9, 1879, design plan for the library table.\n\n=== Plaque ===\n[[File:Thatcher at Oval Office desk with Carter.jpg|thumb|[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] reads the inscription on the front of the desk in 1979, accompanied by President [[Jimmy Carter]].]]\n\nA plate on the front of the desk presented to President Hayes bears the following inscription:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/The+Presidents+Desk.htm |title= The President's Desk |accessdate= May 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|H.M.S.

This table was made from her timbers when she was broken up, and is presented by the QUEEN OF GREAT BRITAIN & IRELAND to the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES as a memorial of the courtesy and loving kindness which dictated the offer of the gift of the ''RESOLUTE''.}}\n\nPlaques with similar messages were fitted onto each desk made, the ''Resolute'' desk in the [[White House]], Queen Victoria's writing table, and the [[Henry Grinnell|Grinnell]] desk.\n\n=== Modifications ===\nThe desk has been modified twice. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered a hinged front panel for the knee hole opening in order to hide his leg braces. The panel features the [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]]\u2014one of only three of the ninety-seven in the White House that have the eagle's head turned towards the 13 [[arrow]]s in the eagle's left [[Talon (anatomy)|talon]], as opposed to the now-official arrangement with the eagle turned towards the [[olive branch]] in the right talon with the 13 leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm |title= Resolute Desk |publisher= WhiteHouseMuseum.org |accessdate= January 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe second modification was done to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a [[plinth]].  The first time a base was made for the ''Resolute'' desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. It was made of pine and did not match the desk well. It is very visible in a photo of [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] playing under the desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk be sent back to the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. Photos from January\u2013February 1977 show the ''Resolute'' desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs on the top of the knee hole. The White House's earliest image of the desk with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for the desk in 1986, and has remained with the desk since that time.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== HMS ''Resolute'' ===\n[[File:Jules Cambon signs Treaty of Paris, 1899.JPG|thumb|[[Jules Cambon]], the French Ambassador to the United States, signing the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|memorandum of ratification]] on behalf of Spain in 1899.]]\n[[File:William Simpson - George Zobel - England and America. The visit of her majesty Queen Victoria to the Arctic ship Resolute - December 16th, 1856.jpg|400px|thumb|Queen Victoria visits HMS ''Resolute'', December 16, 1856, the day before the ship was granted to her as a good will gesture.]]\n\n{{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}} was part of a five-ship squadron under [[Edward Belcher]] sent from Britain in April 1852 to search for the missing British explorer [[Sir John Franklin]], who had left Britain in 1845 in search of the fabled [[Northwest Passage]] through the Canadian Arctic. The Western Division of the squadron, consisting of HMS ''Resolute'' and HMS ''Intrepid'' under [[Henry Kellett|Captain Kellett]]'s command, sailed West and wintered at Deally Island off [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. The Eastern Division, consisting of [[HMS Assistance (1850)|HMS ''Assistance'']] and ''Pioneer'' under Sir Edward Belcher's command, sailed North up the [[Wellington Channel]] and wintered near Northumberland Sound. The men spent the autumn of 1852, and the spring and summer of 1853 sledging across the Arctic in search of the Franklin Expedition, as well as the men on [[HMS Investigator (1848)|HMS ''Investigator'']] (Captain [[Robert McClure]]), and [[HMS Enterprise (1848)|HMS ''Enterprise'']] (Captain [[Richard Collinson]]).  After finding and rescuing McClure and the crew of ''Investigator'', ''Resolute'' and ''Intrepid'' sailed east, but had to winter in the pack ice, gradually moving East all winter. Belcher's two ships moved south in the Wellington Channel before being frozen in again near Disaster Bay. In the spring of 1854 Belcher ordered the abandonment of four of his five ships, and the men gathered at [[Beechey Island]]. By the time they were ready to leave, both ''Assistance'' and ''Pioneer'' had broken free and had traveled 45 miles South in the Wellington Channel until they were only a few miles from Beechey Island. This made no difference to Belcher who was simply desperate to go home. Since he had made his two ships \"hells afloat\" as he always did, his men were also desperate to leave. However, Kellett only abandoned ''Resolute'' and ''Intrepid'' under protest. The officers and men returned home on HMS ''North Star'' and the relief ships [[HMS Phoenix (1832)|HMS ''Phoenix'']] and HMS ''Talbot''.\n\nAs a matter of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by [[courts-martial]]. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four seaworthy vessels, as were ''Resolute'''s captain, Henry Kellett; ''Intrepid'' 's commander, [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]; and ''Pioneer'' 's commander, [[Sherard Osborn]]. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his court-martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. ''Resolute'' continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from [[New London, Connecticut|New London, CT]] saw ''Resolute'' adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in [[Davis Strait]]. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, ''George Henry,'' had preceded ''Resolute'', and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.\n\nAt the time of the salvage in 1855, Britain and America had several areas of active dispute: Britain's territorial claims in [[History of Belize (1506\u20131862)|Belize]], which the United States claimed violated the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]]<ref name=\"FP3rdMsg\">{{cite web|title=Franklin Pierce: Third Annual Message|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29496|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref> and disputes over fishing rights and the border between [[British Columbia]] and [[Washington Territory]].<ref name=\"HistoryNetSanJuanDispute\">{{cite web|title=San Juan Boundary Dispute {{!}} HistoryNet|url=http://www.historynet.com/san-juan-boundary-dispute.htm|website=www.historynet.com|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref> In March 1855, an armed action by Washington Territory officials in the [[San Juan Islands]] had raised tensions between the countries.<ref name=\"HistoryNetSanJuanDispute\" /> After the ''Resolute'' was recovered, Senator [[James Murray Mason]], from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the federal government to buy ''Resolute'', refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President [[Franklin Pierce]] signed it into law.\n\n''Resolute'' was sent to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at [[Spithead]] on December 12, 1856. After ''Resolute'' was towed to [[Cowes]] so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good-will on December 17, 1856.\n\nSoon the talk of imminent war ceased, and the gift of ''Resolute'' was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. In 1856, the United States and Britain appointed boundary commissioners to resolve the [[San Juan Island dispute]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The International Boundary Commission first meets on June 27, 1857. - HistoryLink.org|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9328|website=www.historylink.org|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref> The disputes, however, would continue to flare until the 1860s, with conflict in the [[Pig War (1859)]] in the San Juan Islands, and the First Lord of the Admiralty warning that \"drifting into war\" was still possible in Central America<ref>{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Thomas M.|title=United States\u2013Latin American Relations, 1850\u20131903: Establishing a Relationship|date=2014|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817358235|pages=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjThBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA85&ots=ntjGBIArR6&dq=us%20britain%20central%20american%20treaties%201859%201860&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q=us%20britain%20central%20american%20treaties%201859%201860&f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|quote=Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty declared: 'We are fast drifting into war with the United States'}}</ref> until the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty#Treaties of 1859\u20131860|Central American treaties of 1859-1860]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The International Boundary Commission first meets on June 27, 1857. - HistoryLink.org|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9328|website=www.historylink.org|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Grinnell]], a New York merchant with an interest in the fate of [[Franklin's lost expedition]], had supported the gifting of ''Resolute'', and along with [[Jane Griffin|Lady Franklin]] had hoped the British would use the ship for a new search for those lost. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy doubted that any of Franklin's men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic, and declined to support a new search. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use ''Resolute'' for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing ''Resolute'' after the important role the ship had played in smoothing the relationship between her and America. ''Resolute'' stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at [[Chatham Dockyard]] in 1879.\n\n=== Presidential desk ===\n[[File:Earth-to-space call from the Oval Office (1).jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Donald Trump]], joined at the ''Resolute'' desk by NASA astronaut [[Kate Rubins]] (left) and First Daughter [[Ivanka Trump]], talks with NASA astronauts [[Peggy Whitson]] and [[Jack Fischer]] onboard the [[International Space Station]], April 24, 2017]]\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]] first placed the ''Resolute'' desk in the Oval Office in 1961. The desk left the White House from 1963 until President Carter brought it back to the Oval Office. Since then, presidents [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[Donald Trump]] have used it in the Oval Office. Some presidents, such as [[George H. W. Bush]], have used the desk in their private study rather than in the Oval Office.\n\nWhen president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took office in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwhitehouse.org/resolutedesk.html|title=The Resolute Desk|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/oval-office-history.htm|title=Oval Office History|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref> [[Richard Nixon]], who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the [[Wilson desk]], the desk from the [[The Vice President's Room|Vice President's Room]] at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and mistakenly believed to be that of former president [[Woodrow Wilson]]. [[Gerald Ford]], who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. [[Jimmy Carter]], Ford's successor, brought the ''Resolute'' desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until [[George H. W. Bush]] returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the [[C&O desk]] that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. [[Bill Clinton]] subsequently brought the ''Resolute'' desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since.\n\nIn 2009, British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] visited President Barack Obama and gave him the original framed commissioning papers for ''Resolute'' and an ornamental pen holder made from the timbers of [[HMS Gannet (1878)|HMS ''Gannet'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/deadlineusa/2009/mar/03/barack-obama-gordon-brown |title=Obama's presidential pen, holderless no more |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |date=4 March 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref> {{Citation needed span|date=November 2019|text=HMS ''Gannet'' was not a sister ship to the ''Resolute'', as has been widely reported.

''Gannet'' was launched in 1878 long after the cross Atlantic slave trade was made illegal, and also many years after the [[American Civil War]]. Therefore, she was not used in anti-slavery work in connection to these markets. She did, however, patrol the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and prevented slave trade there.}}\n\n== Other ''Resolute'' desks ==\nAfter ''Resolute'' was broken up, Queen Victoria asked for several desks to be built from her timbers. Four desks were designed and made by William Evenden. A large [[partners desk]] was presented to President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] on November 23, 1880, while a smaller lady's desk was presented to the widow of [[Henry Grinnell]]; this desk is now in the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]].

To the east of the village is the site of the former [[RAF Tempsford]] airfield.\n\n==Geography==\n\nTempsford is {{convert|2.3|mi|km|0}} north of [[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]], {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} west of [[Cambridge]] and {{convert|46|mi|km|0}} north of [[Central London]].\n\nTempsford has two main areas bisected by the A1 road: Church End to the west and Langford End (Station Road) to the east. Tempsford Hall and park lie between the two.\n\nThe rivers [[Great Ouse]] and [[River Ivel|Ivel]] form a large part of the parish's western boundary.\nThe [[East Coast Main Line]] railway passes through the parish.\n\n'''Area'''\n\nThe civil parish covers an area of {{convert|1170|ha|acre|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=2011 Census parish profile: Tempsford |url=https://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/migrated_images/tempsford_tcm3-13828.pdf |website=Central Bedfordshire |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Landscape'''\n\nThe village lies within the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands as designated by [[Natural England]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Character Areas |url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/category/587130 |website=Natural England |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref> Central Bedfordshire Council has classified the local landscape around the village as the Great Ouse Clay Valley; a shallow, fairly wide valley of the Great Ouse and Ivel. The surrounding area is mostly arable farmland. Pastures are found alongside the rivers. Grass parkland surrounds [[Tempsford Hall]] and there is an area of woodland at the eastern edge of the park.  Hedgerows are often gappy or lost but some hedgerow trees are present. Off the eastern bank of the Ivel at the southern most point of the parish is a lake formed from a disused sand and gravel pit. Outlying areas to the north and east form part of the predominantly flat, Biggin Wood Clay Vale.<ref>{{cite web |title=4A Great Ouse Clay Valley |url=https://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/migrated_images/type-4_tcm3-12990.pdf |website=Central Bedfordshire |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=5F Biggin Wood Clay Vale |url=https://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/migrated_images/type-5_tcm3-12991.pdf |website=Central Bedfordshire |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Elevation'''\n\nThe village centre is {{convert|24|m|ft|0}} above sea level.

[[Alluvium]] borders the Great Ouse and Ivel rivers. There are patches of [[boulder clay]], and the eastern and northern parts of the parish are on [[Oxford clay]] overlying [[Kellaways Formation|Kellaways beds]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sheet 204.

The [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]] (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted.

Also, Victorian  workers' cottages built by the Tempsford Estate in yellow brick with red brick facing, farm houses, barns, local authority and modern private houses.\n\nAt Church End the former White Hart public house dates from the 16th century and is timber framed with a [[jettying|jettied]] gable and clay tile roof.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gannocks - 15 Church Street Tempsford |url=http://bedsarchives.bedford.gov.uk/CommunityArchives/Tempsford/Gannocks-15-Church-Street-Tempsford.aspx |website=Bedfordshire Archives and Records Service |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Roads and bridges'''\n\nThe A1 northbound carriageway is carried over the Ouse by a sandstone bridge built in October 1820. Listing particulars state the bridge to be about {{convert|50|m|ft|0}} long and {{convert|10|m|ft|0}} wide. There are three broad, low arches built with blocks of Bramley Fall stone from a quarry near Leeds. A rounded towpath archway passes through the east abutment. A sandstone parapet rests on a projecting stone string course. Except where replaced by concrete, Bramley Fall stone copings run the length of the bridge. Inscriptions of masons can be seen on the inside face of the copings over the crown of the centre arch.

A slip road from the southbound carriageway joins the road from Little Barford, which was extended south through Tempsford Hall Park to a new roundabout. A bridge across the A1 and a second roundabout were built to access the northbound carriageway and the roads to Blunham and Church End. The road to Church End became a no through road.\n\n'''Public footpaths'''\n\nA public footpath on the eastern side of the Station Road level crossing runs south then east to [[Everton, Bedfordshire|Everton]]. A stretch of the Kingfisher Way runs from Mill Lane alongside the Ivel to [[Blunham]].\nIn 2001 an extensive metal footbridge over the A1 was constructed which links Station Road with the former Anchor Hotel, Memorial Hall and Church End.\n\n{{Adjacent communities\n | Centre = Tempsford\n | NW  = [[Roxton, Bedfordshire|Roxton]]\n | N   = [[Wyboston]]\n | NE  = [[Little Barford]]\n | W   = [[Great Barford]]\n | SW  = [[Blunham]]\n | SE  = [[Everton, Bedfordshire|Everton]]\n | S   = [[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]]\n }}\n\n==History==\n[[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] finds recovered from the Tempsford area include stone tools and other artefacts dating from the [[Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods.

To the east of the village is the site of the former [[RAF Tempsford]] airfield.\n\n==Geography==\n\nTempsford is {{convert|2.3|mi|km|0}} north of [[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]], {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} west of [[Cambridge]] and {{convert|46|mi|km|0}} north of [[Central London]].\n\nTempsford has two main areas bisected by the A1 road: Church End to the west and Langford End (Station Road) to the east. Tempsford Hall and park lie between the two.\n\nThe rivers [[Great Ouse]] and [[River Ivel|Ivel]] form a large part of the parish's western boundary.\nThe [[East Coast Main Line]] railway passes through the parish.\n\n'''Area'''\n\nThe civil parish covers an area of {{convert|1170|ha|acre|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=2011 Census parish profile: Tempsford |url=https://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/migrated_images/tempsford_tcm3-13828.pdf |website=Central Bedfordshire |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Landscape'''\n\nThe village lies within the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands as designated by [[Natural England]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Character Areas |url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/category/587130 |website=Natural England |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref> Central Bedfordshire Council has classified the local landscape around the village as the Great Ouse Clay Valley; a shallow, fairly wide valley of the Great Ouse and Ivel. The surrounding area is mostly arable farmland. Pastures are found alongside the rivers. Grass parkland surrounds [[Tempsford Hall]] and there is an area of woodland at the eastern edge of the park.  Hedgerows are often gappy or lost but some hedgerow trees are present. Off the eastern bank of the Ivel at the southern most point of the parish is a lake formed from a disused sand and gravel pit. Outlying areas to the north and east form part of the predominantly flat, Biggin Wood Clay Vale.<ref>{{cite web |title=4A Great Ouse Clay Valley |url=https://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/migrated_images/type-4_tcm3-12990.pdf |website=Central Bedfordshire |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=5F Biggin Wood Clay Vale |url=https://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/migrated_images/type-5_tcm3-12991.pdf |website=Central Bedfordshire |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Elevation'''\n\nThe village centre is {{convert|24|m|ft|0}} above sea level.

Also, Victorian  workers' cottages built by the Tempsford Estate in yellow brick with red brick facing, farm houses, barns, local authority and modern private houses.\n\nAt Church End the former White Hart public house dates from the 16th century and is timber framed with a [[jettying|jettied]] gable and clay tile roof.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gannocks - 15 Church Street Tempsford |url=http://bedsarchives.bedford.gov.uk/CommunityArchives/Tempsford/Gannocks-15-Church-Street-Tempsford.aspx |website=Bedfordshire Archives and Records Service |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Roads and bridges'''\n\nThe A1 northbound carriageway is carried over the Ouse by a sandstone bridge built in October 1820. Listing particulars state the bridge to be about {{convert|50|m|ft|0}} long and {{convert|10|m|ft|0}} wide. There are three broad, low arches built with blocks of Bramley Fall stone from a quarry near Leeds. A rounded towpath archway passes through the east abutment. A sandstone parapet rests on a projecting stone string course. Except where replaced by concrete, Bramley Fall stone copings run the length of the bridge. Inscriptions of masons can be seen on the inside face of the copings over the crown of the centre arch.

A slip road from the southbound carriageway joins the road from Little Barford, which was extended south through Tempsford Hall Park to a new roundabout. A bridge across the A1 and a second roundabout were built to access the northbound carriageway and the roads to Blunham and Church End. The road to Church End became a no through road.\n\n'''Public footpaths'''\n\nA public footpath on the eastern side of the Station Road level crossing runs south then east to [[Everton, Bedfordshire|Everton]]. A stretch of the Kingfisher Way runs from Mill Lane alongside the Ivel to [[Blunham]].\nIn 2001 an extensive metal footbridge over the A1 was constructed which links Station Road with the former Anchor Hotel, Memorial Hall and Church End.\n\n{{Adjacent communities\n | Centre = Tempsford\n | NW  = [[Roxton, Bedfordshire|Roxton]]\n | N   = [[Wyboston]]\n | NE  = [[Little Barford]]\n | W   = [[Great Barford]]\n | SW  = [[Blunham]]\n | SE  = [[Everton, Bedfordshire|Everton]]\n | S   = [[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]]\n }}\n\n==History==\n[[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] finds recovered from the Tempsford area include stone tools and other artefacts dating from the [[Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods.

To achieve this, the EPA had to increase the acceptable amount of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] (a toxic chemical substance) remaining in future wrecks from 2 ppm to 50 ppm. On 13 June 2001, ''Spiegel Grove'' was transferred to the State of Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Largo, Fla., by the [[Maritime Administration]], so that the ship could be sunk as an artificial reefing and to become a tourist attraction for divers.<ref name=\"navy\">{{cite web| title=USS Spiegel Grove (LSD 32)| url=http://navysite.de/ships/lsd32.htm| work=Navysite.de| accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n==Sinking for reef==\nRed tape and financial problems delayed the sinking of USS ''Spiegel Grove'' for several years, but the ship was finally moved from Virginia to Florida in May 2002.

She participated in \"[[Operation Steel Pike]]&nbsp;I\" off Spain in October 1964 and made a [[midshipman]] cruise to England and Denmark in 1970. On 22 July 1974, she participated in the evacuation of American citizens from Cyprus along with several other ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet.<ref>{{cite web|title=All Hands, October 1974|url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah197410.pdf}}</ref> She repeated this service in 1976, this time in Lebanon, during \"[[Operation Fluid Drive]]\".\n\nIn 1983, she won the [[Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award]] for the Atlantic Fleet.\n\nThe [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] participated in Eastern Wind in August 1987 in the area of Geesalay, [[Somalia]].<ref>United States Marine Corps, [http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Restoring%20Hope%20In%20Somalia%20with%20the%20Unified%20Task%20Force%201992-1993%20PCN%2019000413500_4.pdf Restoring Hope in Somalia with the Unified Task Force] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630033041/http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Restoring%20Hope%20In%20Somalia%20with%20the%20Unified%20Task%20Force%201992-1993%20PCN%2019000413500_4.pdf |date=30 June 2013 }}, 63.</ref> At sea, ''Spiegel Grove'', {{USS|Saginaw|LST-1188|6}}, and {{USS|La Moure County|LST-1194|6}} took part as [[Amphibious Squadron 32]]/Commander Task Unit 76.8.2 from 2-9 August 1987.<ref>[https://www.kevinflatley.com/lsd32-85-86-87-co-reports.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Post-commission career==\n''Spiegel Grove'' was decommissioned 2 October 1989 and her name struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] on 13 December 1989. The vessel was transferred to the [[Maritime Administration|United States Maritime Administration]] in the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] \"mothball\" fleet.\n\nIn 1998, title passed to the state of Florida, with the plan of sinking the hull to make an [[artificial reef]] off [[Key Largo, Florida|Key Largo]]. To achieve this, the EPA had to increase the acceptable amount of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] (a toxic chemical substance) remaining in future wrecks from 2 ppm to 50 ppm. On 13 June 2001, ''Spiegel Grove'' was transferred to the State of Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Largo, Fla., by the [[Maritime Administration]], so that the ship could be sunk as an artificial reefing and to become a tourist attraction for divers.<ref name=\"navy\">{{cite web| title=USS Spiegel Grove (LSD 32)| url=http://navysite.de/ships/lsd32.htm| work=Navysite.de| accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n==Sinking for reef==\nRed tape and financial problems delayed the sinking of USS ''Spiegel Grove'' for several years, but the ship was finally moved from Virginia to Florida in May 2002. The total preparation and reefing cost was $1 million.

But the ex-''Spiegel Grove'' settled too soon and suddenly started rolling to her starboard side, forcing workers to abandon ship - and their equipment. She sank several hours ahead of schedule, ending up upside-down on the sea bottom and leaving her bow protruding slightly out of the ocean and her stern resting on the ocean floor.\n\nOn 10\u201311 June 2002, at an additional cost of 250,000 dollars, the ship was rolled onto her starboard side by [[Resolve Marine Group]] which pumped air into the port side hull tanks to displace at least 2,000 tons of water, used air bags with 350-400 tons of buoyancy, and two tugboats.<ref name=\"roll over\">{{cite news| title=Spiegel Grove raised a foot higher, plans unveiled for turning the ship over |url=http://www.sfdi.com/spiegelgrovesinking4.html| work=[[Miami Herald]]| date=20 May 2002| accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref> On 26 June 2002 the wreck was finally opened to recreational divers.
