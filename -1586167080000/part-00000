He was one of the six Marines who raised the second  of two [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]s on the top of Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. \n\nThe second flag raising has generally been portrayed as the only flag raising on Mount Suribachi.<ref>https://www.pulitzer.org/article/joe-rosenthal-and-flag-raising-iwo-jima</ref> The first flag that was raised and flown over the mountain at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, so it was replaced on the same day by a larger one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on Mount Suribachi, there was no photograph taken of anyone raising the flag after the mountaintop was captured. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag raising after the photograph of it appeared worldwide in newspapers. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">You Tube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \"Shooting Iwo Jima\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOy6yRAB6BY] Retrieved March 14, 2020</ref> \n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], was modeled after the second flag raising photograph depicting six Marines, including Strank, raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\n== Early life ==\nMichael Strank was born in [[Jarabina|Oriabyna]], [[Pre\u0161ov Region|Presov Region]] of northeastern [[Czechoslovakia]] (now in [[Slovakia]]). His two brothers, Petro and John, and his sister Mary were born in the United States to Vasil Strank (later, in the U.S., known as Charles Strank) and Marta Gr\u00f3fikov\u00e1, [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-[[Lemko]] immigrants.<ref>{{cite news |last= Kuzych|first= Ingert|date= 20 April 2009|title= An Iwo Jima Ukrainian Connection|url= http://www.upns.org/article/86-two-jima-ukrainian-connection|publisher= Ukrainian Philatelic and Numismatic Society|location= |access-date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date= 2015|title= Ukraine in World War II|url= http://www.memory.gov.ua/sites/default/files/userupload/broshura-eng-sait.pdf|location= Kyiv|publisher= Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance|page= 4|isbn= |author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Nadolenko|first= Hennadii|date= May 9, 2015|title= We honor, We Prevail.

Strank attended the public schools of Franklin Borough and graduated from Franklin Borough High School in 1937. He joined the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], served for 18 months, and afterwards became a Pennsylvania state highway laborer.\n\n== U.S. Marine Corps ==\nStrank enlisted in the Marine Corps at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] for four years service on October 6, 1939. He was assigned to the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]] in [[South Carolina]]. He completed recruit training in December and was transferred to Headquarters Company, Post Troop and then to Provisional Company W at Parris Island, on January 17, 1941. Private First Class Strank sailed for [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], arriving on January 23, 1941. He was reassigned to Headquarters Company, [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]], 1st Marine Brigade (on February 1, the 1st Marine Brigade was redesignated the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]). On April 8, now assigned to Company K, he returned to the United States and was sent back to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. He was promoted to [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] on April 23, 1941. In September, Cpl. Strank moved with the 1st Marine Division to [[Marine Corps Air Station New River|New River, North Carolina]], which is where he was stationed when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred.\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn January 26, 1942, Cpl. Strank was promoted to [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]]. In early April, he was sent with the [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]] to [[San Diego, California]] and shipped out of there on April 12. On May 31, 1942, his battalion landed on the island of [[Wallis Island|Uvea]]. In September, after a short time with the [[22nd Marine Regiment (United States)|22nd Marine Regiment]], he was transferred to the [[Marine Raiders|3rd Marine Raider Battalion]] also on Uvea. As a member of the \"3rd Raiders\", he participated in the landing operations and occupation of [[Pavuvu]] in the [[Russell Islands]] from February 21 to March 18, 1943 and in the seizure and occupation of the [[Empress Augusta Bay]] during the [[Bougainville campaign (1944-45)|Battle of Bougainville]] from November 1 to January 12, 1944. On February 14, 1944, when his and the other Marine Raider units were in the process of being disbanded, he was sent to San Diego and allowed a leave to visit his family.\n\n==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====\nSgt. Strank returned to duty in San Diego and was assigned to Second Platoon, Company E, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]], as a squad leader. He was sent to [[Hawaii]] with his unit after extensive training, and began more training and preparation for the invasion of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]].\n\n==== First flag-raising ====\n[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]\nSgt. Strank took part in the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marines]] amphibious assault landing at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi on February 19, 1945. The 28th Marines mission was to capture Mount Suribachi. On the morning of February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler Johnson, commander of the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], to take a platoon size patrol up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion's American flag to signal the summit was secure. E Company's commander, Captain Dave Severance, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battlion.\n\nThe patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30 a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sgt.

The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Marine Staff Sergeant [[Louis R. Lowery]], a photographer with [[Leatherneck magazine|''Leatherneck'' magazine]] who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed in action on Iwo Jima on March 3 and Sgt.

Captain Severance ordered Sgt. Strank to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his rifle squad in Second Platoon and raise the replacement flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Corporal [[Harlon Block]], Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]], and Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up Mount Suribachi with communication wire (or supplies). Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]], the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for E Company, was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag.\n\nOnce Sgt. Strank's team was on top, Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley found a Japanese steel pipe to attach the flag to. After the two Marines took the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag, the flag was attached to the pipe. As the four Marines got into position to raise the flagstaff, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block called out to two nearby Marines to help them raise the heavy flagstaff. Then, under Lt. Schrier's orders, the second flag was raised at approximately 1 p.m. by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]], and Pfc. [[Harold Keller]],<ref name=\"marines.mil\">[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016</ref><ref> https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/warrior-iconic-iwo-jima-flag-raising-photo-was-misidentified-marines-n1064766</ref> as the original flag came down. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller were members of Lt. Schrier's patrol. In order to keep the second flagstaff in a vertical position in the high winds on the summit, rocks were immediately added to the base of the flagstaff by Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller, and another Marine. Three [[Guy-wire|guy-ropes]] were then tied to the flagstaff to stabilize it. The six Marine flag-raisers were photographed in action by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]] and by Marine motion picture cameraman Sergeant [[Bill Genaust|William (Bill) Genaust]] (later killed in action) in color. After the second flag-raising, Rosenthal photographed sixteen Marines including Sgt. Strank and two Navy corpsmen around the base of the flagstaff. Rosenthal's black-and-white flag-raising picture, which appeared in newspapers on February 25, 1945, was later titled [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]. It became the most copied photograph in Marine Corps history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html|title=Fifty Years Later, Iwo Jima Photographer Fights His Own Battle|first=Mitchell|last=Landsberg|year=1995|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905115709/http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html|archivedate=September 5, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lt. Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1, and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.\n[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|Diagram: Strank (green figure) is pictured third from left]]\n\nOn March 20, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] ordered all the men in Rosenthal's photograph be sent to Washington D.C. after the battle was over. Pfc. Gagnon arrived alone on April 7 and was questioned at Marine Headquarters by a public information officer about the identities of the six flag raisers. Pfc. Gagnon identified Navy [[Hospital corpsman|corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] and Pfc. Ira Hayes as flag raisers in the photograph and they were sent for and arrived on April 19 and, they were separately questioned that day (Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, and Pfc. Sousley were killed on Iwo Jima). All three said they were in the photograph and raised the flag; on April 8, they had been named publicly by the Marine Corps as the surviving flag raisers. Over time it was discovered that all of the second flag-raisers were Marines and that three of the six Marines in Rosenthal's photograph were not correctly identified: Cpl. Block was not recognized until January 1947, Pfc.

Schultz and Pfc. Keller did not ever claim publicly to be in Rosenthal's photograph or that they were flag-raisers.\n\n==== Death and burial ====\nOn February 28, Sgt. Strank and E Company moved northward. Fighting was heavy, and both the Japanese and the American forces were taking heavy casualties. On March 1, Sgt. Strank's rifle squad came under heavy fire and took cover. While forming a plan of attack, he was killed by [[Friendly fire|friendly artillery fire]]. The shell that killed him was almost certainly fired from offshore by an American ship. Cpl. Harlon Block, Sgt. Strank's assistant squad leader, took command of the squad. Cpl. Block was killed later on the same day by a Japanese mortar shell. However, former Marine Ralph Griffiths of Second Platoon, Easy Company, said that Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were on both sides of him on March 1 and were killed by the same shell which wounded him.<ref>[https://taishawalker.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/iwo-jima-survivor-recalls-the-bloody-war/]</ref><ref>[http://listen.sdpb.org/post/marine-veterans-recall-iwo-jima#stream/0]</ref><ref>[http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/nov/14/veteran-of-easy-company-recalls-rigors-of-iwo-jima/?print]</ref> Sgt. Strank and the other Marines killed in action of the 28th Regiment were buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on the island with the last rites of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Sgt. Strank (and possibly Cpl. Block) was the first person in Rosenthal's flag raising photograph to be killed. On January 13, 1949, his remains were reinterred in Grave 7179, Section 12, [[Arlington National Cemetery]].\n\nSgt.

The members of Strank's rifle squad idolized him (Cpl. Harlon Block for one followed his every instruction without question), and many men since who served with and alongside him have stated he had a way of setting them at ease, making them feel that ''he'' could help them survive the war. Of the men photographed raising the second flag on Mount Suribachi, Strank at age 25, was the oldest, and Harold Keller and him the most experienced in combat.\n\nIn interviews of former Marines conducted years later, many documented in the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' written by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of corpsman John Bradley), he is described by men who served with him as \"a Marine's Marine\", a true warrior and leader, who led his men by example. Strank often told his men, \"Follow me, and I'll try to bring you all safely home to your mothers.\" One former Marine who served with Strank stated, \"He was the kind of Marine you read about, the kind they make movies about.\" Former Paramarine Lowell B. Holly, who served in Strank's squad on Iwo Jima and who was with Strank when he died, stated, \"He was the best Marine I ever knew.\"\n\n== U.S. citizenship ==\nIn 2008, Gunnery Sergeant Matt Blais, who was a Marine security guard in the American Embassy in Slovakia, discovered that Strank was not a natural-born U.S. citizen.  Strank had become a U.S. citizen after his father's naturalization in 1935, but had never received official documentation.<ref name=MCNews_Carfrey_20080730>{{cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/units/hqmc/Pages/IwoJimaflagraiserposthumouslyreceivescitizenshipcertificate.aspx|title=Iwo Jima flag raiser posthumously receives citizenship certificate|first=Bryan G.|last=Carfrey|work=Official U.S. Marine Corps Web Site|date=July 30, 2008|accessdate=November 1, 2008|url-status=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813092941/http://www.marines.mil/units/hqmc/Pages/IwoJimaflagraiserposthumouslyreceivescitizenshipcertificate.aspx|archivedate=August 13, 2008}}</ref>\nGySgt.

He was one of the six Marines who raised the second  of two [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]s on the top of Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. \n\nThe second flag raising has generally been portrayed as the only flag raising on Mount Suribachi.<ref>https://www.pulitzer.org/article/joe-rosenthal-and-flag-raising-iwo-jima</ref> The first flag that was raised and flown over the mountain at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, so it was replaced on the same day by a larger one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on Mount Suribachi, there was no photograph taken of anyone raising the flag after the mountaintop was captured. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag raising after the photograph of it appeared worldwide in newspapers. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">You Tube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \"Shooting Iwo Jima\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOy6yRAB6BY] Retrieved March 14, 2020</ref> \n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], was modeled after the second flag raising photograph depicting six Marines, including Strank, raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\n== Early life ==\nMichael Strank was born in [[Jarabina|Oriabyna]], [[Pre\u0161ov Region|Presov Region]] of northeastern [[Czechoslovakia]] (now in [[Slovakia]]).

Strank attended the public schools of Franklin Borough and graduated from Franklin Borough High School in 1937. He joined the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], served for 18 months, and afterwards became a Pennsylvania state highway laborer.\n\n== U.S. Marine Corps ==\nStrank enlisted in the Marine Corps at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] for four years service on October 6, 1939. He was assigned to the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]] in [[South Carolina]]. He completed recruit training in December and was transferred to Headquarters Company, Post Troop and then to Provisional Company W at Parris Island, on January 17, 1941. Private First Class Strank sailed for [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], arriving on January 23, 1941. He was reassigned to Headquarters Company, [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]], 1st Marine Brigade (on February 1, the 1st Marine Brigade was redesignated the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]). On April 8, now assigned to Company K, he returned to the United States and was sent back to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. He was promoted to [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] on April 23, 1941. In September, Cpl. Strank moved with the 1st Marine Division to [[Marine Corps Air Station New River|New River, North Carolina]], which is where he was stationed when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred.\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn January 26, 1942, Cpl. Strank was promoted to [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]]. In early April, he was sent with the [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]] to [[San Diego, California]] and shipped out of there on April 12. On May 31, 1942, his battalion landed on the island of [[Wallis Island|Uvea]]. In September, after a short time with the [[22nd Marine Regiment (United States)|22nd Marine Regiment]], he was transferred to the [[Marine Raiders|3rd Marine Raider Battalion]] also on Uvea. As a member of the \"3rd Raiders\", he participated in the landing operations and occupation of [[Pavuvu]] in the [[Russell Islands]] from February 21 to March 18, 1943 and in the seizure and occupation of the [[Empress Augusta Bay]] during the [[Bougainville campaign (1944-45)|Battle of Bougainville]] from November 1 to January 12, 1944. On February 14, 1944, when his and the other Marine Raider units were in the process of being disbanded, he was sent to San Diego and allowed a leave to visit his family.\n\n==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====\nSgt. Strank returned to duty in San Diego and was assigned to Second Platoon, Company E, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]], as a squad leader. He was sent to [[Hawaii]] with his unit after extensive training, and began more training and preparation for the invasion of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]].\n\n==== First flag-raising ====\n[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]\nSgt. Strank took part in the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marines]] amphibious assault landing at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi on February 19, 1945. The 28th Marines mission was to capture Mount Suribachi. On the morning of February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler Johnson, commander of the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], to take a platoon size patrol up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion's American flag to signal the summit was secure. E Company's commander, Captain Dave Severance, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battlion.\n\nThe patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30 a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sgt.

Lowery]], a photographer with [[Leatherneck magazine|''Leatherneck'' magazine]] who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed in action on Iwo Jima on March 3 and Sgt.

Captain Severance ordered Sgt. Strank to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his rifle squad in Second Platoon and raise the replacement flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Corporal [[Harlon Block]], Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]], and Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up Mount Suribachi with communication wire (or supplies). Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]], the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for E Company, was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag.\n\nOnce Sgt. Strank's team was on top, Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley found a Japanese steel pipe to attach the flag to. After the two Marines took the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag, the flag was attached to the pipe. As the four Marines got into position to raise the flagstaff, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block called out to two nearby Marines to help them raise the heavy flagstaff. Then, under Lt. Schrier's orders, the second flag was raised at approximately 1 p.m. by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]], and Pfc. [[Harold Keller]],<ref name=\"marines.mil\">[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016</ref><ref> https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/warrior-iconic-iwo-jima-flag-raising-photo-was-misidentified-marines-n1064766</ref> as the original flag came down. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller were members of Lt. Schrier's patrol. In order to keep the second flagstaff in a vertical position in the high winds on the summit, rocks were immediately added to the base of the flagstaff by Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller, and another Marine. Three [[Guy-wire|guy-ropes]] were then tied to the flagstaff to stabilize it. The six Marine flag-raisers were photographed in action by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]] and by Marine motion picture cameraman Sergeant [[Bill Genaust|William (Bill) Genaust]] (later killed in action) in color. After the second flag-raising, Rosenthal photographed sixteen Marines including Sgt. Strank and two Navy corpsmen around the base of the flagstaff. Rosenthal's black-and-white flag-raising picture, which appeared in newspapers on February 25, 1945, was later titled [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]. It became the most copied photograph in Marine Corps history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html|title=Fifty Years Later, Iwo Jima Photographer Fights His Own Battle|first=Mitchell|last=Landsberg|year=1995|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905115709/http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html|archivedate=September 5, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lt. Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1, and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.\n[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|Diagram: Strank (green figure) is pictured third from left]]\n\nOn March 20, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] ordered all the men in Rosenthal's photograph be sent to Washington D.C. after the battle was over. Pfc. Gagnon arrived alone on April 7 and was questioned at Marine Headquarters by a public information officer about the identities of the six flag raisers. Pfc. Gagnon identified Navy [[Hospital corpsman|corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] and Pfc. Ira Hayes as flag raisers in the photograph and they were sent for and arrived on April 19 and, they were separately questioned that day (Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, and Pfc. Sousley were killed on Iwo Jima). All three said they were in the photograph and raised the flag; on April 8, they had been named publicaly by the Marine Corps as the surviving flag raisers. Over time it was discovered that all of the second flag-raisers were Marines and that three of the six Marines in Rosenthal's photograph were not correctly identified: Cpl. Block was not recognized until January 1947, Pfc. Schultz was not recognized until June 2016,<ref name=\"marines.mil\">[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016</ref> and Pfc.

Bradley in the photograph. Pfc. Keller was incorrectly identified as Pfc. Gagnon in the photograph. Rosenthal did not take the names of any of the flag raisers in his photograph. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller did not ever claim publicly to be in Rosenthal's photograph or that they were flag-raisers.\n\n==== Death and burial ====\nOn February 28, Sgt. Strank and E Company moved northward. Fighting was heavy, and both the Japanese and the American forces were taking heavy casualties. On March 1, Sgt. Strank's rifle squad came under heavy fire and took cover. While forming a plan of attack, he was killed by [[Friendly fire|friendly artillery fire]]. The shell that killed him was almost certainly fired from offshore by an American ship. Cpl. Harlon Block, Sgt. Strank's assistant squad leader, took command of the squad. Cpl. Block was killed later on the same day by a Japanese mortar shell. However, former Marine Ralph Griffiths of Second Platoon, Easy Company, said that Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were on both sides of him on March 1 and were killed by the same shell which wounded him.<ref>[https://taishawalker.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/iwo-jima-survivor-recalls-the-bloody-war/]</ref><ref>[http://listen.sdpb.org/post/marine-veterans-recall-iwo-jima#stream/0]</ref><ref>[http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/nov/14/veteran-of-easy-company-recalls-rigors-of-iwo-jima/?print]</ref> Sgt. Strank and the other Marines killed in action of the 28th Regiment were buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on the island with the last rites of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Sgt. Strank (and possibly Cpl. Block) was the first person in Rosenthal's flag raising photograph to be killed. On January 13, 1949, his remains were reinterred in Grave 7179, Section 12, [[Arlington National Cemetery]].\n\nSgt. Strank's brother, Peter Strank, was serving aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Franklin (CV-13)|''USS Franklin'']] in the [[South Pacific Area|South Pacific]] when Sgt. Strank was killed.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33148-2005Feb17.html] Wahingtonpost.com, February 18, 2005, ''The Shadow of Suribachi'', by Timothy Dwyer</ref>\n\n== Marine Corps War Memorial ==\n[[File:USMC War Memorial Night.jpg|thumb|right|The [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]]]\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in Arlington, Virginia, was dedicated on November 10, 1954.<ref>[http://www.barracks.marines.mil/History/MarineCorpsWarMemorial.aspx The Marine Corps War Memorial] Marine Barracks Washington, D.C.</ref> Sculptor [[Felix de Weldon]] was inspired to make the memorial after seeing Rosenthal's photograph of the second flag raising. De Weldon duplicated the flag raisers images and positions on the memorial from the photograph. Strank is depicted as the fourth bronze figure from the base of the flagstaff on the memorial with the 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze figures of the other five flag raisers depicted on the memorial. The Marine Corps announced on June 23, 2016, that [[Harold Schultz]] is now in back of Strank instead of [[Franklin Sousley]], who is now in front of Strank instead of [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], who is no longer in the photograph.<ref name=\"marines.mil\"/> The Memorial was turned over to the [[National Park Service]] in 1955.\n\nDuring the dedication, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D.

The members of Strank's rifle squad idolized him (Cpl. Harlon Block for one followed his every instruction without question), and many men since who served with and alongside him have stated he had a way of setting them at ease, making them feel that ''he'' could help them survive the war. Of the men photographed raising the second flag on Mount Suribachi, Strank at age 25, was the oldest, and Harold Keller and him the most experienced in combat.\n\nIn interviews of former Marines conducted years later, many documented in the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' written by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of corpsman John Bradley), he is described by men who served with him as \"a Marine's Marine\", a true warrior and leader, who led his men by example. Strank often told his men, \"Follow me, and I'll try to bring you all safely home to your mothers.\" One former Marine who served with Strank stated, \"He was the kind of Marine you read about, the kind they make movies about.\" Former Paramarine Lowell B. Holly, who served in Strank's squad on Iwo Jima and who was with Strank when he died, stated, \"He was the best Marine I ever knew.\"\n\n== U.S. citizenship ==\nIn 2008, Gunnery Sergeant Matt Blais, who was a Marine security guard in the American Embassy in Slovakia, discovered that Strank was not a natural-born U.S. citizen.  Strank had become a U.S. citizen after his father's naturalization in 1935, but had never received official documentation.<ref name=MCNews_Carfrey_20080730>{{cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/units/hqmc/Pages/IwoJimaflagraiserposthumouslyreceivescitizenshipcertificate.aspx|title=Iwo Jima flag raiser posthumously receives citizenship certificate|first=Bryan G.|last=Carfrey|work=Official U.S. Marine Corps Web Site|date=July 30, 2008|accessdate=November 1, 2008|url-status=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813092941/http://www.marines.mil/units/hqmc/Pages/IwoJimaflagraiserposthumouslyreceivescitizenshipcertificate.aspx|archivedate=August 13, 2008}}</ref>\nGySgt.

According to [[Anna Comnena]]'s chronicle the ''[[Alexiad]]'' Hugh sent an 'absurd' message to her father, [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Alexius I Comnenus]], demanding a proper welcome:\n\n'Know, Emperor, that I am the King of Kings, the greatest of all beneath the heavens. It is fitting that I should be met on my arrival and received with the pomp and ceremony appropriate to my noble birth.'<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 279.</ref>\n\nIn response to this message the emperor sent 'urgent instructions' to his nephew [[John Komnenos (governor of Dyrrhachium)|John Komnenos]], the ''Doux'' (governor) of [[Dyrrhachium]] and Nicholas Maurokatakalon, commander of the [[Byzantine fleet]], to look out for Hugh and to inform him immediately when he arrived.<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 279.</ref> \n\nMeanwhile Hugh had reached the coast of [[Longobardi, Calabria|Longobardi]] and dispatched twenty-four envoys to the ''Doux'' of Dyrrhachium with the following message: 'Be it known to you, ''Doux'', that our Lord Hugh is almost here. He brings with him from Rome the [[Gonfalone of the Church|golden standard of St Peter]]. Understand, moreover, that he is supreme commander of the Frankish army. See to it then that he is accorded a reception worthy of his rank and yourself prepare to meet him.'<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 280.</ref> Whilst sailing the [[Adriatic Sea]] from [[Bari]] towards Illyricum, Hugh's fleet was overtaken by a heavy storm and most ships were lost. His own ship was thrown upon the shore near [[Epirus]]. When Hugh was found and brought to Dyrrhachium John Komnenos treated him to a banquet and he was allowed to rest. By order of the emperor Hugh was closely escorted by [[Manuel Boutoumites]]. Eventually Hugh was given an [[Audience (meeting)|audience]] by the emperor, who persuaded him to become his [[liegeman]].<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds.

The call from the east'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts 2012), 124\u2013125.</ref>     \n\nThe [[Germany|German]] historian [[Hans Eberhard Mayer]] argued that Alexius was fortunate that the first contingent of the crusader army to arrive in [[Constantinople]], led by Hugh, was very small and easy to control. Alexius 'discreetly but unmistakably' restricted Hugh's freedom of movement 'until he was ready to swear that all territories which had belonged to Byzantium before the Turkish invasions would be restored. Moreover any conquests made to the east [...] would be held as [[fiefs]].'<ref>Hans Eberhard Mayer, ''The Crusades'', translated by John Gillingham (Oxford 1972), 48.</ref>    \n\nAnna Comnena recorded a conversation between Hugh and Godfrey of Bouillon, wherein Hugh tried to persuade Godfrey to pledge allegiance to Alexius. Godfrey however refused, saying: 'you left your own country as a ruler [...] with all that wealth and a strong army; now from the heights you've brought yourself to the level of a slave. And then, as if you had won some great success, have you come here to tell me to do the same?' Hugh replied: 'we ought to have stayed in our own countries and kept our hands off other people's [...] but since we've come thus far and need the emperor's protection, no good will come of it unless we obey his orders.'<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 288.</ref>     \n\nAfter the Crusaders had successfully made their way across [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] territory and, in 1098, [[siege of Antioch|captured Antioch]], Hugh was sent back to Constantinople to appeal for reinforcements from Alexius. The emperor was uninterested,<ref>In \"Urban's Crusade--Success or Failure\" (Key, 1948) it is argued, indeed to the contrary, that the emperor was disturbed by Hugh's report and the disquieting rumors emitting from Antioch (on Bohemond's intent and conduct) and promptly set out to prepare another expedition: \"...Alexius immediately began preparations for another expedition, and he furthermore sent envoys to the crusaders to announce its coming.\"</ref> however, and Hugh, instead of returning to Antioch to help plan the [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of Jerusalem]], went back to France. There he was scorned for not having fulfilled his vow as a Crusader to complete a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and [[Pope Paschal II]] threatened to excommunicate him. He joined the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], but was wounded in battle with the Turks led by [[Kilij Arslan I]] at the second battle of Heraclea in September, and died of his wounds in October in [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]].{{sfn|Brown|1984|p=161}}\n\n==Family and children==\nHe married [[Adelaide, Countess of Vermandois|Adelaide of Vermandois]],<ref name=\"Cusimano191-192\">Suger, ''The Deeds of Louis the Fat'', transl.

(London 2009), 279.</ref> \n\nMeanwhile Hugh had reached the coast of [[Longobardi, Calabria|Longobardi]] and dispatched twenty-four envoys to the ''Doux'' of Dyrrhachium with the following message: 'Be it known to you, ''Doux'', that our Lord Hugh is almost here. He brings with him from Rome the [[Gonfalone of the Church|golden standard of St Peter]]. Understand, moreover, that he is supreme commander of the Frankish army. See to it then that he is accorded a reception worthy of his rank and yourself prepare to meet him.'<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 280.</ref> Whilst sailing the [[Adriatic Sea]] from [[Bari]] towards Illyricum, Hugh's fleet was overtaken by a heavy storm and most ships were lost. His own ship was thrown upon the shore near [[Epirus]]. When Hugh was found and brought to Dyrrhachium John Komnenos treated him to a banquet and he was allowed to rest. By order of the emperor Hugh was closely escorted by [[Manuel Boutoumites]]. Eventually Hugh was given an [[Audience (meeting)|audience]] by the emperor, who persuaded him to become his [[liegeman]].<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 280\u2013281.</ref><ref>Peter Frankopan, ''The First Crusade. The call from the east'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts 2012), 124\u2013125.</ref>     \n\nThe [[Germany|German]] historian [[Hans Eberhard Mayer]] argued that Alexius was fortunate that the first contingent of the crusader army to arrive in [[Constantinople]], led by Hugh, was very small and easy to control. Alexius 'discreetly but unmistakably' restricted Hugh's freedom of movement 'until he was ready to swear that all territories which had belonged to Byzantium before the Turkish invasions would be restored. Moreover any conquests made to the east [...] would be held as [[fiefs]].'<ref>Hans Eberhard Mayer, ''The Crusades'', translated by John Gillingham (Oxford 1972), 48.</ref>    \n\nAnna Comnena recorded a conversation between Hugh and Godfrey of Bouillon, wherein Hugh tried to persuade Godfrey to pledge allegiance to Alexius. Godfrey however refused, saying: 'you left your own country as a ruler [...] with all that wealth and a strong army; now from the heights you've brought yourself to the level of a slave. And then, as if you had won some great success, have you come here to tell me to do the same?' Hugh replied: 'we ought to have stayed in our own countries and kept our hands off other people's [...] but since we've come thus far and need the emperor's protection, no good will come of it unless we obey his orders.'<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 288.</ref>     \n\nAfter the Crusaders had successfully made their way across [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] territory and, in 1098, [[siege of Antioch|captured Antioch]], Hugh was sent back to Constantinople to appeal for reinforcements from Alexius. The emperor was uninterested,<ref>In \"Urban's Crusade--Success or Failure\" (Key, 1948) it is argued, indeed to the contrary, that the emperor was disturbed by Hugh's report and the disquieting rumors emitting from Antioch (on Bohemond's intent and conduct) and promptly set out to prepare another expedition: \"...Alexius immediately began preparations for another expedition, and he furthermore sent envoys to the crusaders to announce its coming.\"</ref> however, and Hugh, instead of returning to Antioch to help plan the [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of Jerusalem]], went back to France. There he was scorned for not having fulfilled his vow as a Crusader to complete a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and [[Pope Paschal II]] threatened to excommunicate him. He joined the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], but was wounded in battle with the Turks led by [[Kilij Arslan I]] at the second battle of Heraclea in September, and died of his wounds in October in [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]].{{sfn|Brown|1984|p=161}}\n\n==Family and children==\nHe married [[Adelaide, Countess of Vermandois|Adelaide of Vermandois]],<ref name=\"Cusimano191-192\">Suger, ''The Deeds of Louis the Fat'', transl.

He was often invited to attend the Ijtima 'Am organized by Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, and some Indonesian Islamic movements such as the Prosperous Justice Party and the Star Moon Party.<p>\nHe was a speaker at the International Seminar on Islamic Unity in the face of Bosnia-Herzegovina problems and represented PAS at the 5th World Islamic Organization's Muktamar in Istanbul in 1996. He gave a speech titled \"Islamic Awakening: His Lack of Wisdom\" at the International Islamic Revival Conference in Tehran on September 24, 2011. The conference, attended by 700 delegates from all Muslim countries, discussed the latest conflicts in West Asia such as Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Syria and Palestine.<p>\nHe represented Malaysia's Islamic movement (PAS) to the 22nd International Muslim Community Congress in Istanbul, Turkey in May 2013. It was also attended by the leader of Tunisia's An-Nahdah, [[Rashid al-Ghannushi]]; from Palestinian HAMAS, [[Ismail Haniyeh]] and [[Khaled Meshal]]; from Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, [[Muhammad Badie]]; from Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, [[Syed Munawar Hassan]]; and from the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, Riyadh al-Sakfa. The congress also heard a keynote address by two Islamic State leaders, Dr. [[Mohamed Morsi]] (Egypt) and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] (Iran).<p>\n\nHadi was appointed as World Muslim Ulama Union deputy president, together with Dr. [[Ahmad Raysuni]] and Sheikh Al-Khalili headed by Dr. [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] in 2014.<p>\n\nHe delivered the prime lectures at [[S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies]](RSIS), Nanyang Technological University in Singapore on April 28, 2015.\n\n==Family==\nTuan Guru Abdul Hadi Awang established a household with 'Puan Seri Hajah Zainab binti Awang Ngah in 1976. His second marriage was in 1991 to Dr. Norzita Taat. The result of his marriage with his two wives was 14 children, 11 from his first wife; three from his second wife.\n\nHis eldest son, Ustaz Muhammad Khalil Abdul Hadi, is an alumnus of [[Al-Eman University]], Yemen and currently holds the post of PAS Dewan Pemuda's chief and chairman of the International Lajnah, the PAS Dewan Pemuda.\n\n==Controversy==\n===Amanat Hadi===\nAmanat Hadi refers to the dark period in the 1980s, when Hadi Awang was a PAS firebrand. It was the beginning of the era of \"''kafir mengkafir''\" (calling fellow Muslims infidels due to different political beliefs) which Hadi had popularized throughout the villages of Malaysia.\n\nHadi delivered this infamous Amanat Hadi sermon at Kampung Banggol, Peradong, [[Kuala Terengganu]] on April 7, 1981, and thereafter his image appeared on posters on the walls of PAS offices across the nation at the same time.\n\nHadi claimed that UMNO perpetuated the unIslamic rule of [[colonialism]], and therefore the struggle of PAS and its supporters against UMNO is jihad and that those who died in the struggle are [[Shahid|al-shahid]] (martyrs).\n\nLater in 1983, an Amanat Hadi poster was used in the Selising by-election in [[Kelantan]] and thereafter became a flagship battle clarion call for PAS in other elections.\n\nIn one bold stroke, Hadi drew a line that separates PAS and UMNO.\n\nIndeed, there were separate [[Imam]]s for daily prayers, separate \"''kenduris''\" (wedding feasts etc.), abattoirs, funeral rites, [[Friday prayers]], even separate burial sites.\n\nFamilies were separated, husbands and wives were separated through an acrimonious divorce, and children left in limbo that eventually led to a large scale division of the Muslim ummah.\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:90%\"\n|+ '''[[Dewan Rakyat|Parliament of

His father who is Tok Guru in Kampung Rusila is also a political activist of [[Hizbul Muslimin Terengganu]]. Similarly, his bonds are the place of reference and the focus of society, especially in religious matters.\nHizbul Muslimin was banned by the colonists, at the will of the ruling party. A few years after the ban, Haji Awang Mohammad emerged as one of the earliest to introduce the struggle of the Malay Se-Malaya (PAS) Society in Terengganu.

Later, he was educated formally at the Rusila National School before continuing his secondary education at Marang Religious School.

However, he managed to defeat his challenger with a majority of 695 votes.\n\n====Election====\nHe joined the election after returning home in 1978 where he was entrusted by PAS to contest the 1978 General Election in Dun Marang representing PAS. He lost by 64 votes to BN's Tengku Zahid Tengku Musa. In the 1982 General Election, he was nominated by PAS for the Marang State Legislative Assembly and won with a majority of 320 votes, but lost in the Dungun Parliament, which was also contested, to Haji Awang Jabar.\n\nIn the 1982 election, four other PAS leaders in Terengganu won their state seats\u2014Haji Mustafa Ali, Haji Harun Taliib, Haji Abu Bakar Chik, and Haji Wan Abdul Mutalib Embong.\n\nIn 1986, he won again at DUN [[Ru Rendang (state constituency)|Ru Rendang]] (the new name for Dun Marang after redelineation) defeating Abdul Latif Muda and has retained it until now. However, for Marang's parliamentary seat that year, he lost to Datuk Abdul Rahman Bakar.

It was the beginning of the era of \"''kafir mengkafir''\" (calling fellow Muslims infidels due to different political beliefs) which Hadi had popularized throughout the villages of Malaysia.\n\nHadi delivered this infamous Amanat Hadi sermon at Kampung Banggol, Peradong, [[Kuala Terengganu]] on April 7, 1981, and thereafter his image appeared on posters on the walls of PAS offices across the nation at the same time.\n\nHadi claimed that UMNO perpetuated the unIslamic rule of [[colonialism]], and therefore the struggle of PAS and its supporters against UMNO is jihad and that those who died in the struggle are [[Shahid|al-shahid]] (martyrs).\n\nLater in 1983, an Amanat Hadi poster was used in the Selising by-election in [[Kelantan]] and thereafter became a flagship battle clarion call for PAS in other elections.\n\nIn one bold stroke, Hadi drew a line that separates PAS and UMNO.\n\nIndeed, there were separate [[Imam]]s for daily prayers, separate \"''kenduris''\" (wedding feasts etc.), abattoirs, funeral rites, [[Friday prayers]], even separate burial sites.\n\nFamilies were separated, husbands and wives were separated through an acrimonious divorce, and children left in limbo that eventually led to a large scale division of the Muslim ummah.\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:90%\"\n|+ '''[[Dewan Rakyat|Parliament of
