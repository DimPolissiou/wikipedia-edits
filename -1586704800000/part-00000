Legal service providers can use the [[Software as a Service]] model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.\n* Software as a service is much more [[scalable]]. Traditional bespoke models require an attorney to spend more of a limited resource (their time) on each additional client. Using Software as a Service, a legal service provider can put in effort once to develop the product and then use a much less limited resource (cloud computing power) to provide service to each additional customer.\n* Software as a service can be used to complement traditional bespoke services by handling routine tasks, leaving an attorney free to concentrate on bespoke work.\n* Software as a service can be delivered more conveniently because it does not require the legal service provider to be available at the same time as the customer.\n\nSoftware as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for [[attorney-client privilege]].  The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be [[Privilege (evidence)|legally privileged]].<ref name=\"Johnsonarticle\">Chris Johnson, Leveraging Technology to Deliver Legal Services, 23 HARV.

A variety of formalisms have been used, including propositional and predicate calculi; deontic, temporal and non-monotonic logics; and state transition diagrams. Prakken and Sartor<ref>H. Prakken and G.Sartor, [http://www.cs.uu.nl/groups/IS/archive/henry/ReviewLogicAndLawRevised.pdf Law and logic: A review from an argumentation perspective], Artificial Intelligence. Available on-line June 2015.</ref> give a detailed and authoritative review of the use of logic and argumentation in AI and Law, together with a comprehensive set of references.\n\nAn important role of formal models is to remove ambiguity. In fact, legislation abounds with ambiguity: Because it is written in natural language there are no brackets and so the scope of connectives such as \"and\" and \"or\" can be unclear. \"Unless\" is also capable of several interpretations, and legal draftsman never write \"if and only if\", although this is often what they intend by \"if\". In perhaps the earliest use of logic to model law in AI and Law, Layman Allen advocated the use of propositional logic to resolve such syntactic ambiguities in a series of papers.<ref name=\"allen57\" />\n\nIn the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s a significant strand of work on AI and Law involved the production of executable models of legislation, originating with Thorne McCarty's TAXMAN <ref name=\"mccarty\" /> and Ronald Stamper's LEGOL <ref name=\"stamper77\" />. TAXMAN was used to model the majority and minority arguments in a US Tax law case ([[Eisner v Macomber]]), and was  implemented in the [[Planner (programming language)| micro-PLANNER]] programming language. LEGOL was used to provide a formal model of the rules and regulations that govern an organization, and was implemented in a condition-action rule language of the kind used for expert systems.\n\nThe TAXMAN and LEGOL languages were executable, rule-based languages, which did not have an explicit logical interpretation. However, the formalisation of a large portion of the British Nationality Act by Sergot et al. <ref name=\"sergot1986\" /> showed that the natural language of legal documents bears a close resemblance to the [[Horn clause]] subset of first order predicate calculus. Moreover, it identified the need to extend the use of Horn clauses by including negative conditions, to represent rules and exceptions. The resulting extended Horn clauses are executable as [[logic programming | logic programs]].\n\nLater work on larger applications, such as that on Supplementary Benefits,<ref>T.J.M. Bench-Capon, G.O. Robinson, T.W. Routen, M.J. Sergot, Logic programming for large scale applications in law: a formalisation of supplementary benefit legislation, in: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 1987, pp. 190\u2013198.</ref> showed that logic programs need further extensions, to deal with such complications as multiple cross references, counterfactuals, deeming provisions, amendments, and highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions). The use of hierarchical representations<ref>T. Routen, T.J.M. Bench-Capon, Hierarchical formalizations, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 35 (1991) 69\u201393.</ref>  was suggested to address the problem of cross reference; and so-called isomorphic<ref>T.J.M. Bench-Capon, F.P. Coenen, Isomorphism and legal knowledge based systems, Artificial Intelligence and Law 1 (1992) 65\u201386.</ref> representations were suggested to address the problems of verification and frequent amendment. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became partially absorbed into the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]]), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber.<ref>Thomas R. Gruber: \n\n[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0256/614d1dc55962708db9b791f70a29370f1d76.pdf The Role of Common Ontology in Achieving Sharable, Reusable Knowledge Bases].

M. Bench-Capon, [[H. Jaap van den Herik]]: A principled approach to developing legal knowledge systems. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. 51(6): 1127-1154 (1999)</ref> Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologies<ref>Rinke Hoekstra, Joost Breuker, Marcello Di Bello, Alexander Boer: [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-321/LOAIT07-Proceedings.pdf#page=43 The LKIF Core Ontology of Basic Legal Concepts].  Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Legal Ontologies and Artificial Intelligence Techniques. 2007: 43-63</ref> to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation.\n\nSince law comprises sets of norms, it is unsurprising that deontic logics have been tried as the formal basis for models of legislation. These, however, have not been widely adopted as the basis for expert systems, perhaps because expert systems are supposed to enforce the norms, whereas deontic logic becomes of real interest only when we need to consider violations of the norms.<ref>A.J. Jones, M.J. Sergot, On the characterisation of law and computer systems: the normative systems perspective, in: J.-J.Ch. Meyer, R.

There is also some interesting work combining deontic and action logics to explore normative positions.<ref>M.J. Sergot, A computational theory of normative positions, ACM Trans. Comput. Log. 2 (2001) 581\u2013622.</ref>\n\nIn the context of [[multi-agent system]]s, norms have been modelled using state transition diagrams. Often, especially in the context of electronic institutions,<ref>Marc Esteva, Juan A. Rodr\u00edguez-Aguilar, Josep Llu\u00eds Arcos, Carles Sierra, Pere Garcia: Institutionalizing Open Multi-Agent Systems. ICMAS 2000: 381\u2013382</ref> the norms so described are regimented (i.e., cannot be violated), but in other systems violations are also handled, giving a more faithful reflection of real norms. For a good example of this approach see Modgil et al.<ref>Sanjay Modgil, Nir Oren, Noura Faci, Felipe Meneguzzi, Simon Miles and Michael Luck, [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/6046/JournalMonitoring3.pdf?sequence=1 Monitoring Compliance with E-Contracts and Norms], Artificial Intelligence and Law 23(2) (2015).</ref>\n\nLaw often concerns issues about time, both relating to the content, such as time periods and deadlines, and those relating to the law itself, such as commencement. Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event Calculus<ref>R. Hernandez Marin, G. Sartor, [https://www.academia.edu/download/42420341/Time_and_norms_a_formalisation_in_the_ev20160208-3430-19hoaxl.pdf Time and norms: a formalisation in the event-calculus], in: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM, New York, 1999, pp. 90\u2013100.</ref> and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic.<ref>G.

APA 12:2, 2013</ref> Moreover, in the drafting of law exceptions abound, and, in the application of law, precedents are overturned as well as followed. In logic programming approaches, [[negation as failure]] is often used to handle non-monotonicity,<ref>Robert A. Kowalski: [http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rak/papers/negation%20legislation.pdf The Treatment of Negation in Logic Programs for Representing Legislation]. Proceedings of Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law. 1989: 11\u201315</ref> but specific non-monotonic logics such as defeasible logic<ref>Benjamin Johnston, Guido Governatori: Induction of Defeasible Logic Theories in the Legal Domain. Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2003:204\u2013213</ref> have also been used. Following the development of abstract argumentation,<ref>Phan Minh Dung: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029400041X On the Acceptability of Arguments and its Fundamental Role in Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Logic Programming and n-Person Games]. Artificial Intelligence 77(2): 321\u2013358 (1995)</ref> however, these concerns are increasingly being addressed through argumentation in monotonic logic rather than through the use of non-monotonic logics.\n\n====Quantitative legal prediction====\nBoth academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court.

Legal service providers can use the [[Software as a Service]] model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.\n* Software as a service is much more [[scalable]]. Traditional bespoke models require an attorney to spend more of a limited resource (their time) on each additional client. Using Software as a Service, a legal service provider can put in effort once to develop the product and then use a much less limited resource (cloud computing power) to provide service to each additional customer.\n* Software as a service can be used to complement traditional bespoke services by handling routine tasks, leaving an attorney free to concentrate on bespoke work.\n* Software as a service can be delivered more conveniently because it does not require the legal service provider to be available at the same time as the customer.\n\nSoftware as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for [[attorney-client privilege]].  The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be [[Privilege (evidence)|legally privileged]].<ref name=\"Johnsonarticle\">Chris Johnson, Leveraging Technology to Deliver Legal Services, 23 HARV.

A variety of formalisms have been used, including propositional and predicate calculi; deontic, temporal and non-monotonic logics; and state transition diagrams. Prakken and Sartor<ref>H. Prakken and G.Sartor, [http://www.cs.uu.nl/groups/IS/archive/henry/ReviewLogicAndLawRevised.pdf Law and logic: A review from an argumentation perspective], Artificial Intelligence. Available on-line June 2015.</ref> give a detailed and authoritative review of the use of logic and argumentation in AI and Law, together with a comprehensive set of references.\n\nAn important role of formal models is to remove ambiguity. In fact, legislation abounds with ambiguity: Because it is written in natural language there are no brackets and so the scope of connectives such as \"and\" and \"or\" can be unclear. \"Unless\" is also capable of several interpretations, and legal draftsman never write \"if and only if\", although this is often what they intend by \"if\". In perhaps the earliest use of logic to model law in AI and Law, Layman Allen advocated the use of propositional logic to resolve such syntactic ambiguities in a series of papers.<ref name=\"allen57\" />\n\nIn the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s a significant strand of work on AI and Law involved the production of executable models of legislation, originating with Thorne McCarty's TAXMAN <ref name=\"mccarty\" /> and Ronald Stamper's LEGOL <ref name=\"stamper77\" />. TAXMAN was used to model the majority and minority arguments in a US Tax law case ([[Eisner v Macomber]]), and was  implemented in the [[Planner (programming language)| micro-PLANNER]] programming language. LEGOL was used to provide a formal model of the rules and regulations that govern an organization, and was implemented in a condition-action rule language of the kind used for expert systems.\n\nThe TAXMAN and LEGOL languages were executable, rule-based languages, which did not have an explicit logical interpretation. However, the formalisation of a large portion of the British Nationality Act by Sergot et al. <ref name=\"sergot1986\" /> showed that the natural language of legal documents bears a close resemblance to the [[Horn clause]] subset of first order predicate calculus. Moreover, it identified the need to extend the use of Horn clauses by including negative conditions, to represent rules and exceptions. The resulting extended Horn clauses are executable as [[logic programming | logic programs]].\n\nLater work on larger applications, such as that on Supplementary Benefits,<ref>T.J.M. Bench-Capon, G.O. Robinson, T.W. Routen, M.J. Sergot, Logic programming for large scale applications in law: a formalisation of supplementary benefit legislation, in: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 1987, pp. 190\u2013198.</ref> showed that logic programs need further extensions, to deal with such complications as multiple cross references, counterfactuals, deeming provisions, amendments, and highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions). The use of hierarchical representations<ref>T. Routen, T.J.M. Bench-Capon, Hierarchical formalizations, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 35 (1991) 69\u201393.</ref>  was suggested to address the problem of cross reference; and so-called isomorphic<ref>T.J.M. Bench-Capon, F.P. Coenen, Isomorphism and legal knowledge based systems, Artificial Intelligence and Law 1 (1992) 65\u201386.</ref> representations were suggested to address the problems of verification and frequent amendment. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became partially absorbed into the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]]), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber.<ref>Thomas R. Gruber: \n\n[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0256/614d1dc55962708db9b791f70a29370f1d76.pdf The Role of Common Ontology in Achieving Sharable, Reusable Knowledge Bases].

M. Bench-Capon, [[H. Jaap van den Herik]]: A principled approach to developing legal knowledge systems. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. 51(6): 1127-1154 (1999)</ref> Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologies<ref>Rinke Hoekstra, Joost Breuker, Marcello Di Bello, Alexander Boer: [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-321/LOAIT07-Proceedings.pdf#page=43 The LKIF Core Ontology of Basic Legal Concepts].  Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Legal Ontologies and Artificial Intelligence Techniques. 2007: 43-63</ref> to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation.\n\nSince law comprises sets of norms, it is unsurprising that deontic logics have been tried as the formal basis for models of legislation. These, however, have not been widely adopted as the basis for expert systems, perhaps because expert systems are supposed to enforce the norms, whereas deontic logic becomes of real interest only when we need to consider violations of the norms.<ref>A.J. Jones, M.J. Sergot, On the characterisation of law and computer systems: the normative systems perspective, in: J.-J.Ch. Meyer, R.

There is also some interesting work combining deontic and action logics to explore normative positions.<ref>M.J. Sergot, A computational theory of normative positions, ACM Trans. Comput. Log. 2 (2001) 581\u2013622.</ref>\n\nIn the context of [[multi-agent system]]s, norms have been modelled using state transition diagrams. Often, especially in the context of electronic institutions,<ref>Marc Esteva, Juan A. Rodr\u00edguez-Aguilar, Josep Llu\u00eds Arcos, Carles Sierra, Pere Garcia: Institutionalizing Open Multi-Agent Systems. ICMAS 2000: 381\u2013382</ref> the norms so described are regimented (i.e., cannot be violated), but in other systems violations are also handled, giving a more faithful reflection of real norms. For a good example of this approach see Modgil et al.<ref>Sanjay Modgil, Nir Oren, Noura Faci, Felipe Meneguzzi, Simon Miles and Michael Luck, [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/6046/JournalMonitoring3.pdf?sequence=1 Monitoring Compliance with E-Contracts and Norms], Artificial Intelligence and Law 23(2) (2015).</ref>\n\nLaw often concerns issues about time, both relating to the content, such as time periods and deadlines, and those relating to the law itself, such as commencement. Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event Calculus<ref>R. Hernandez Marin, G. Sartor, [https://www.academia.edu/download/42420341/Time_and_norms_a_formalisation_in_the_ev20160208-3430-19hoaxl.pdf Time and norms: a formalisation in the event-calculus], in: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM, New York, 1999, pp. 90\u2013100.</ref> and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic.<ref>G.

APA 12:2, 2013</ref> Moreover, in the drafting of law exceptions abound, and, in the application of law, precedents are overturned as well as followed. In logic programming approaches, [[negation as failure]] is often used to handle non-monotonicity,<ref>Robert A. Kowalski: [http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rak/papers/negation%20legislation.pdf The Treatment of Negation in Logic Programs for Representing Legislation]. Proceedings of Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law. 1989: 11\u201315</ref> but specific non-monotonic logics such as defeasible logic<ref>Benjamin Johnston, Guido Governatori: Induction of Defeasible Logic Theories in the Legal Domain. Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2003:204\u2013213</ref> have also been used. Following the development of abstract argumentation,<ref>Phan Minh Dung: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029400041X On the Acceptability of Arguments and its Fundamental Role in Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Logic Programming and n-Person Games]. Artificial Intelligence 77(2): 321\u2013358 (1995)</ref> however, these concerns are increasingly being addressed through argumentation in monotonic logic rather than through the use of non-monotonic logics.\n\n====Quantitative legal prediction====\nBoth academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court.
