Sometime after returning home, he adopted the name '''Will Elder'''.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Career==\n{{moresources|section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the late 1940s, Elder and former classmate Kurtzman teamed with Charles Stern to form the Charles William Harvey Studio, creating comics between 1948 and 1951 for [[Prize Comics]] and other publishers. At [[EC Comics]], he inked Severin's pencils on stories for ''[[Weird Fantasy]]'', ''[[Two-Fisted Tales]]'', ''[[Frontline Combat]]'' and other titles.\n\nWhen Kurtzman created ''Mad'' in 1952, Elder's wacky panels, filled with background gags, immediately attracted attention, first with \"Ganefs!\" in ''Mad'' 's debut issue but especially in the second issue with \"Mole!\", satirizing the popular mid-1940s ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' villain named Mole. The ''Mad'' lampoon depicted the successive efforts of prisoner Melvin Mole to tunnel away from the prison, first with a spoon, then with a toothpick and finally with a nostril hair.\n\nThe wild exaggeration in this story left such a strong impression that the character was sometimes quoted (\"Dig! Dig!\") and even given a homage years later in a ''[[Psychology Today]]'' illustration; sixty-two years later, ''Mad'' 's 2014 parody of the television prison series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' included the image of Elder's Mole tunneling to freedom.\n\nAccording to Jaffee, Elder \"could have been the world's greatest forger.\" Elder had a chameleon-like talent for mimicking the precise styles of other cartoonists, which made the satiric effect stronger. This ability was showcased in such pieces as \"Mickey Rodent!\" (a takeoff on [[Mickey Mouse]] and Disney in general), \"Starchie!\" ([[Archie Comics]]), \"Bringing Back Father!\" ([[George McManus]]' ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'' strip), \"Gasoline Valley!\" ([[Frank King (cartoonist)|Frank King]]'s ''[[Gasoline Alley]]''), and others. Such was Elder's ability that some of these parodies featured specific observations about the source materials' art styles, with Elder switching illustrative gears in midpanel.\n\nElder had this to say about his mimicry:{{bquote|Through imitation, I found an avenue of expression... if you're going to make an imitation of something, a fascimile, it's got to be convincing.

As Elder told an interviewer, \"The term just came out of what we both [Kurtzman and Elder] knew were the parts of the strip that gave it more flavor but did very little to advance the storyline. That's what Chicken Fat does... it advances the flavor of the soup and, as we all know now, too much chicken fat will kill you!\"<ref>[http://www.madmumblings.com/Elder_Interview.html Will Elder Interview \u2013 Conversation with Willy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518132751/http://www.madmumblings.com/Elder_Interview.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}, madmumblings.com; accessed August 5, 2017.</ref>\n\nElder's rampant insertion of background gags set the tone for the comic book, quickly spreading into the panels of his fellow artists and ''Mad'''s imitators. Kurtzman described their collaborative process: \"I would write a story, and as if by magic, all the empty spaces would get filled in by sub-jokes... he was an inexhaustible source.\"   In 2004, Elder told an interviewer, \"In ''Mad'', Harvey never rejected any of my little extras in the story.

[[Monty Python]]'s [[Terry Gilliam]] said of Elder, \"I don't know if anybody's really worked at that level as intensely as Willy did. And it never seemed to distract from the center.\" 21st-century ''Mad'' cartoonist [[Evan Dorkin]] put it more simply: \"If God is in the details, Will Elder channeled God.\"<ref>[http://evandorkin.livejournal.com/159687.html evandorkin: Will Elder R.I.P] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518130722/http://evandorkin.livejournal.com/159687.html|date=May 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nElder also drew for EC's other humor comic, ''[[Panic (comic)|Panic]]''. His illustrated version of [[Clement Clarke Moore]]'s \"[[A Visit from St. Nicholas|T'was the Night Before Christmas]]\" included several irreverent images, including a \"Just Divorced!\" sign hanging on the back of [[Santa Claus]]' sleigh. As a result, sales of ''Panic'' were banned in the state of Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/elder-statesman-of-comics|title=Elder Statesman of Comics|website=Aiga.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}</ref>  Elder included a self-caricature, being spun around on Santa Claus' hip as Santa \"filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk\"-- the jerk, of course, is Elder.\n\n==Sense of humor==\nElder was known as an inveterate prankster. As a child, he once cut out paper silhouettes of a man carrying a knife and a woman. Attaching them to a rotating record turntable, he projected their image onto the windowshade, and began screaming. People on the outside of the building saw what they thought was an assailant chasing his victim around the room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pics.livejournal.com/scottedelman/pic/000350pw/g25|title=Photostream|website=Pics.livejournal.com|accessdate=2017-08-09}}</ref> EC colorist [[Marie Severin]] recalled, \"Will used to have this painting of a deer... I guess it was one of those 5-and-10-cent store things. It had a deer, a mountain, some trees, a path, flowers and the like, and he'd change it with the seasons! If it was winter he'd paint snow on the deer, and then he would paint over that and put the sun out for the springtime with flowers coming up.\" Kurtzman recounted the time Elder and his playmates found a stock of fresh meat as a child: \"These kids collected a bunch of clothes and they dressed the meat in clothes and spread the combination of meat and clothes along the right-of-way for about half a mile on the railroad tracks. Then Willy started shrieking at the top of his voice that Mikey had fallen down onto the railroad tracks. Naturally every woman for miles around who had a son named Mike went out of their mind, seeing this mess of clothes and meat along the tracks... This is the kind of kid that Willy was.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pics.livejournal.com/scottedelman/pic/00034e6k|title=Will Elder|website=Pics.livejournal.com|accessdate=2017-08-09}}</ref> Years later, Elder still had a gruesome side to his humor, sending his wife a heart from a slaughterhouse as a Valentine's Day gift.\n\nBy all accounts, Elder's humor was compulsive. Al Jaffee described a portrait Elder once painted of his son: \"It was a beautiful painting.  It was all in very somber blues and black tones, very dark and brooding. After he finished it, he couldn't resist putting two little red dots on the kid's neck, as if a vampire had been there. He was always driven by the notion that something should be funny.\"\n\n==Post-''Mad'' career==\nElder collaborated frequently throughout his career with Kurtzman. After leaving ''Mad'' in 1957, the two worked together on a string of short-lived humor magazines: ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'', ''Humbug'' and ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]''. For ''Help!'', Elder and Kurtzman created [[Goodman Beaver]], a well-meaning naif whose trust in human nature and goodness were forever being undercut.  One installment depicted the characters of ''[[Archie Comics]]'' as thoughtless hedonists, and was titled \"Goodman Beaver Goes Playboy!\".  This parody resulted in a lawsuit from Archie Comics. Kurtzman and Elder had previously irritated the Archie publisher with a parody in Mad (\"Starchie!\"). Archie Comics ended up with possession of the story's copyright. When the full Goodman Beaver series was reprinted by [[Kitchen Sink Press]], the story could not legally be included. However, after Archie Comics failed to renew its copyright, the original \"Goodman Beaver Goes Playboy!\" went into [[public domain]] and was published in [[Fantagraphics]]' ''[[Comics Journal]]''.\n\nPublisher and critic [[Gary Groth]] wrote that Elder's artwork in the Goodman Beaver stories \"clinched his reputation as the cartoon [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]] {{sic}} with his intricate portraits of a world cheerfully going mad\".{{sfn|Groth|1988|p=318}} Elder later talked to ''The Comics Journal'' about the Goodman Beaver series, saying, \"It was the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nWhile the owners of ''Archie'' had taken offense, the owner of ''Playboy'' did not. [[Hugh Hefner]], a fan of Kurtzman and \"Goodman Beaver\", commissioned Kurtzman and Elder to create a similar but more lavish strip for ''Playboy''. The result was ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]''. Like Goodman Beaver, Little Annie Fanny was a pure-of-heart innocent; unlike him, she was regularly divested of her clothing. The Annie Fanny series (107 stories in all) was irregularly published in the back of ''Playboy'' for more than a quarter of a century from October 1962 through September 1988. In 2001, [[Dark Horse Comics]] published the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections ''Playboy's Little Annie Fanny, Volume 1'' ({{ISBN|1-56971-519-X}}) and ''Playboy's Little Annie Fanny, Volume 2: 1970\u20131988'' ({{ISBN|1-56971-520-3}}).\n\nElder's advertising art, caricatures, cartoons, illustrations and stories were collected in the 392-page career retrospective, ''Will Elder: The Mad Playboy of Art'' ([[Fantagraphics]], 2003; {{ISBN|1-56097-603-9}}). The follow-up book, ''Chicken Fat'' (also by Fantagraphics), was published in 2006 and compiles drawings, sketches, cartoons and doodles by Elder, most of which had never been published. In 2009, Fantagraphics published a complete boxed collection of ''Humbug''.\n\nElder died on May 15, 2008 from complications due to [[Parkinson's disease]] in [[Rockleigh, New Jersey]].<ref name=NYT_obit>{{cite news |first=William |last=Grimes |title=Will Elder, Cartoonist of Satiric Gifts and Overpopulated Scenes, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/arts/design/18elder.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 18, 2008 |page=A31 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>[[Kenneth T.

People on the outside of the building saw what they thought was an assailant chasing his victim around the room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pics.livejournal.com/scottedelman/pic/000350pw/g25|title=Photostream|website=Pics.livejournal.com|accessdate=2017-08-09}}</ref> EC colorist [[Marie Severin]] recalled, \"Will used to have this painting of a deer... I guess it was one of those 5-and-10-cent store things. It had a deer, a mountain, some trees, a path, flowers and the like, and he'd change it with the seasons! If it was winter he'd paint snow on the deer, and then he would paint over that and put the sun out for the springtime with flowers coming up.\" Kurtzman recounted the time Elder and his playmates found a stock of fresh meat as a child: \"These kids collected a bunch of clothes and they dressed the meat in clothes and spread the combination of meat and clothes along the right-of-way for about half a mile on the railroad tracks. Then Willy started shrieking at the top of his voice that Mikey had fallen down onto the railroad tracks. Naturally every woman for miles around who had a son named Mike went out of their mind, seeing this mess of clothes and meat along the tracks... This is the kind of kid that Willy was.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pics.livejournal.com/scottedelman/pic/00034e6k|title=Will Elder|website=Pics.livejournal.com|accessdate=2017-08-09}}</ref> Years later, Elder still had a gruesome side to his humor, sending his wife a heart from a slaughterhouse as a Valentine's Day gift.\n\nBy all accounts, Elder's humor was compulsive. Al Jaffee described a portrait Elder once painted of his son: \"It was a beautiful painting.  It was all in very somber blues and black tones, very dark and brooding. After he finished it, he couldn't resist putting two little red dots on the kid's neck, as if a vampire had been there. He was always driven by the notion that something should be funny.\"\n\n==Post-''Mad'' career==\nElder collaborated frequently throughout his career with Kurtzman. After leaving ''Mad'' in 1957, the two worked together on a string of short-lived humor magazines: ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'', ''Humbug'' and ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]''. For ''Help!'', Elder and Kurtzman created [[Goodman Beaver]], a well-meaning naif whose trust in human nature and goodness were forever being undercut.  One installment depicted the characters of ''[[Archie Comics]]'' as thoughtless hedonists, and was titled \"Goodman Beaver Goes Playboy!\".  This parody resulted in a lawsuit from Archie Comics. Kurtzman and Elder had previously irritated the Archie publisher with a parody in Mad (\"Starchie!\"). Archie Comics ended up with possession of the story's copyright. When the full Goodman Beaver series was reprinted by [[Kitchen Sink Press]], the story could not legally be included. However, after Archie Comics failed to renew its copyright, the original \"Goodman Beaver Goes Playboy!\" went into [[public domain]] and was published in [[Fantagraphics]]' ''[[Comics Journal]]''.\n\nPublisher and critic [[Gary Groth]] wrote that Elder's artwork in the Goodman Beaver stories \"clinched his reputation as the cartoon [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]] {{sic}} with his intricate portraits of a world cheerfully going mad\".{{sfn|Groth|1988|p=318}} Elder later talked to ''The Comics Journal'' about the Goodman Beaver series, saying, \"It was the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nWhile the owners of ''Archie'' had taken offense, the owner of ''Playboy'' did not. [[Hugh Hefner]], a fan of Kurtzman and \"Goodman Beaver\", commissioned Kurtzman and Elder to create a similar but more lavish strip for ''Playboy''. The result was ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]''. Like Goodman Beaver, Little Annie Fanny was a pure-of-heart innocent; unlike him, she was regularly divested of her clothing. The Annie Fanny series (107 stories in all) was irregularly published in the back of ''Playboy'' for more than a quarter of a century from October 1962 through September 1988. In 2001, [[Dark Horse Comics]] published the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections ''Playboy's Little Annie Fanny, Volume 1'' ({{ISBN|1-56971-519-X}}) and ''Playboy's Little Annie Fanny, Volume 2: 1970\u20131988'' ({{ISBN|1-56971-520-3}}).\n\nElder's advertising art, caricatures, cartoons, illustrations and stories were collected in the 392-page career retrospective, ''Will Elder: The Mad Playboy of Art'' ([[Fantagraphics]], 2003; {{ISBN|1-56097-603-9}}). The follow-up book, ''Chicken Fat'' (also by Fantagraphics), was published in 2006 and compiles drawings, sketches, cartoons and doodles by Elder, most of which had never been published. In 2009, Fantagraphics published a complete boxed collection of ''Humbug''.\n\nElder died on May 15, 2008 from complications due to [[Parkinson's disease]] in [[Rockleigh, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news |author=William Grimes |title=Will Elder, Cartoonist of Satiric Gifts and Overpopulated Scenes, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/arts/design/18elder.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 18, 2008 |page=A31 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>[[Kenneth T.

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use).\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nEnglish ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''\u0121\u0113ar'' ({{IPA|/j\u025bar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''\u0121\u0113r'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*j\u01e3ran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#\u0113\u2081 and \u0113\u2082|\u0113\u2081]]<nowiki>ran</nowiki>'').\nCognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''j\u0101r'', [[Old Norse]] ''\u00e1r'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:\ud800\udf3e\ud800\udf34\ud800\udf42|jer]]'',<!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--> from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh\u2081-|*yeh\u2081r-om]]}}'' \"year, season\". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

United States Naval Observatory.</ref> the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons; because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons, the tropical year is the basis of most calendars. The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#y\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = M18 (Glossary)\n}}</ref> (= 365.24219 days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 5, 07:48 UT in 2020), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 11:35 UT in 2020). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is 365.259636 days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]] and the [[UK Hydrographic Office]]\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |pages = A1, C2\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Draconic year {{anchor|Draconitic year}} ===\n{{further|Draconic period}}\nThe draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).\n\n=== Besselian year === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] -->\nThe [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280\u00b0. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010\n |year=2008\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = B3\n|title-link=Astronomical Almanac\n }}</ref>\n: B = 1900.0 + (Julian date<sub>TT</sub> \u2212 {{val|2415020.31352}}) / {{val|365.242198781}}\n\nThe TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].<!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' -->\n\n=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nThe exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.\n* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.\n}}</ref> They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English \"[[:wikt:year|year]]\", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g).

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use).\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nEnglish ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''\u0121\u0113ar'' ({{IPA|/j\u025bar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''\u0121\u0113r'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*j\u01e3ran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#\u0113\u2081 and \u0113\u2082|\u0113\u2081]]<nowiki>ran</nowiki>'').\nCognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''j\u0101r'', [[Old Norse]] ''\u00e1r'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:\ud800\udf3e\ud800\udf34\ud800\udf42|jer]]'',<!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--> from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh\u2081-|*yeh\u2081r-om]]}}'' \"year, season\". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.

The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.

The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.

Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates).

They additionally contend that epigraphical, genetic, and osteological evidence supports their claims. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\nThe idea was first suggested by Jos\u00e9 Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862 and subsequently published two papers that attributed this head to a \"Negro race.\"<ref>Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar (1869) and Melgar (1871).</ref> The view was espoused in the early 20th century by [[Leo Wiener]] and others.<ref name=\"Ortizde\">Ort\u00edz de Montellano, Bernard & Gabriel Haslip Viera & Warren Barbour 1997</ref> Some modern proponents such as [[Ivan Van Sertima]] and Clyde Ahmad Winters have identified the Olmecs with the [[Mand\u00e9]] people of West Africa.<ref name=\"Ortizde\" />\n\n===Claims of epigraphic evidence===\nSome researchers claim that the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] are related to African scripts.

(September, 1988). \"Black kings of ancient America\", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122.  See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) \"An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'\", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174.</ref> He supports this claim with [[Human cranium|cranial]] evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: [[Tlatilco]] and [[Cerro de las Mesas]]. Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\"<ref>Wiercinski (1972b).</ref>  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.\n\nTo determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.\n\nAn interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.<ref>Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez-Jos\u00e9 et al.

They additionally contend that epigraphical, genetic, and osteological evidence supports their claims. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\nThe idea was first suggested by Jos\u00e9 Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862 and subsequently published two papers that attributed this head to a \"Negro race.\"<ref>Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar (1869) and Melgar (1871).</ref> The view was espoused in the early 20th century by [[Leo Wiener]] and others.<ref name=\"Ortizde\">Ort\u00edz de Montellano, Bernard & Gabriel Haslip Viera & Warren Barbour 1997</ref> Some modern proponents such as [[Ivan Van Sertima]] and Clyde Ahmad Winters have identified the Olmecs with the [[Mand\u00e9]] people of West Africa.<ref name=\"Ortizde\" />\n\n===Claims of epigraphic evidence===\nSome researchers claim that the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] are related to African scripts.

(September, 1988). \"Black kings of ancient America\", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122.  See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) \"An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'\", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174.</ref> He supports this claim with [[Human cranium|cranial]] evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: [[Tlatilco]] and [[Cerro de las Mesas]]. Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\"<ref>Wiercinski (1972b).</ref>  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.\n\nTo determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.\n\nAn interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.<ref>Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez-Jos\u00e9 et al.

[[Pope Pius XII]] performed a [[Marian consecration]], entrusting the world to the [[BVM(RC)|Virgin Mary]], as Queen of Peace, through her [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]]. This consecration was made in the context of the reported messages from Jesus and the Virgin Mary purportedly received by Blessed [[Alexandrina of Balazar]], and communicated to her spiritual director, Father Mariano Pinho.\n\n==Historical context==\n===Blessed Alexandrina of Balazar===\n[[File:Alexandrina de Balazar.jpg|thumb|right|215px|Blessed [[Alexandrina of Balazar]] was the great messenger of Jesus to the request of the consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary made by [[Pope Pius XII]].]]\nBlessed [[Alexandrina of Balazar|Alexandrina Maria da Costa]], from [[Balazar]], was a Portuguese mystic who reported many private apparitions, messages and prophecies received directly from Jesus and the Virgin Mary. In June 1938, based on the request of her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]], Father Mariano Pinho, several bishops from Portugal wrote to Pope Pius XI, asking him to consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nIn June 1938, Father Mariano Pinho conducted a retreat at [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal]], for the Portuguese bishops, at the end of which the bishops forwarded their own request to Pius XI for the consecration of the world to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]]. This request was renewed several times. \n\nAt that time, [[Eugenio Pacelli|Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli]] (later Pope Pius XII) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican.

{"title_page": "Saltwater aquaponics", "text_new": "'''Saltwater aquaponics''' (also known as '''marine aquaponics''') is a combination of plant cultivation and [[Fish farming|fish rearing]] (also called aquaculture), systems with similarities to standard [[aquaponics]], except that it uses saltwater instead of the more commonly used freshwater. In some instances, this may be diluted saltwater. The concept is being researched as a sustainable way to eliminate the stresses that are put on local environments by conventional fish farming practices who expel wastewater into the coastal zones, all while creating complementary crops. \n\nThe practice is a careful balance between the ideal salinity conditions for the aquatic species and the maximum allowable salinity levels for the crops that filter the water and create their own yields.\n\n=== History of the Practice and Current State of Direction ===\nCurrently, many conventional fish farming practices take place in the coastal zones with open circulation. This places an enormous load of urine and soluble nitrogen (that the feed and waste from fish release) at high concentrations into the ecological region. This can have many environmentally deleterious effects. In response to this, alternative aquaculture developments are quickly arising- Namely, recirculating aquaculture systems. By creating a closed system, fish farming has given locational freedom to the practice allowing for more inland developments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/w8120598|title=The Development of Sustainable Saltwater-Based Food Production Systems: A Review of Established and Novel Concepts|journal=Water|volume=8|issue=12|pages=598|year=2016|last1=Gunning|first1=Daryl|last2=Maguire|first2=Julie|last3=Burnell|first3=Gavin|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{pred}}\n\nIn countries like Japan, saltwater species are much more popular than freshwater fish which has spurred much of the desire for saltwater aquaponics systems.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\">Takeuchi, Toshio. Application of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems in Japan. Springer, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe mainstream system for fish cultivation has also been mono-aquaculture (only one kind of fish/organism). With this method, oxygen consumption by the cultured fish increases, and the load of carbon dioxide becomes heavier. In addition, nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphates from feces or remaining fish feed, dissolve in the seawater, making it [[eutrophic]]. This causes [[Red tide|red tides]], fish pathologies, and oxygen deficiency in seawater, resulting in the mass mortality of fish, auto-pollution, etc.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\nIn response poly-eco-aquaculture looks to create symbiosis by establishing seaweeds throughout the year to create an artificial sea forest around the cultured fish cages. The seaweed takes up nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphate from fish feces and remaining feed and gives off oxygen. The seaweed also inhibits pathogenic bacteria and red tide organisms. Grown seaweeds will then be fed to fish and urchins. \n\nOther organisms which can be produced in these systems include sea cucumber which can be grown in symbiosis with abalone in aquaculture net cages as well. Feces generated by the abalone are fed to sea cucumber. Scallops can also be cultured because they eat organic suspended substances, such as the remaining feed and fish feces. \n\nEnvironmentally sound poly-eco-aquaculture enables the preservation of aquatic environments to be compatible with that of sustainable aquaculture. With this method, healthy fish can be cultured in purified water while productively recycling seaweed to feed the fish.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Parts ==\n\n=== Plants ===\nEdible [[Halophyte|halophytes]] that can be grown in hydroponic systems include [[Tetragonia tetragonoides|New Zealand spinach]], [[Mesembryanthemum crystallinum|common ice plant]], common [[glasswort]], [[barley]], [[rice]], and [[Swiss Chard|swiss chard]]. [[algae]], [[seaweed]] and [[plankton]] may be grown as well, possibly in combination.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\nThe relationship between salinity and optimal growth of [[Halotolerance|halotolerant]] and [[Halophile|halophilic]] plants varies by species. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and optimize cultivation methods by adjusting the salt content of the seawater and diluting wastewater when necessary according to each specific combination of organisms.<ref name=\"Custodio 2017\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3354/aei00244|title=Unravelling the potential of halophytes for marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA)\u2014 a perspective on performance, opportunities and challenges|journal=Aquaculture Environment Interactions|volume=9|pages=445\u2013460|year=2017|last1=Cust\u00f3dio|first1=M.|last2=Villasante|first2=S.|last3=Cremades|first3=J.|last4=Calado|first4=R.|last5=Lilleb\u00f8|first5=AI|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==== Common Ice Plant (Suaeda japonica Makino) ====\nCommon ice plant can gradually acclimate to saltwater.

The shells can also be used for mother of pearl work.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Biofilters ==\n\n==== Phytoplankton, Zooplankton ====\nUtilization of aquatic organisms like phytoplankton, zooplankton assist in carbondioxide and oxygen circulation.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n==== Seaweed ====\nSeaweed species have the capacity to take in nitrogen and phosphate loads. They also fulfill the role of oxygen producers. However, it is difficult for seaweed to completely take in nitrogen and phosphate loads alone. Even the most efficient species of seaweed requires an area two and a half times that of the fish farm in order to take in the total loads. Just the same, it is considered important to cultivate effective seaweed for the [[eutrophication]] of each fish farm and improve the water quality.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Operation ==\n\n=== Feed Source ===\nUtilization of aquatic organisms (e.g., phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish) are an important part of constructing natural food chains within closed ecological systems.<ref name=\"eec 2017\"/>\n\nConstruction of a [[Spirulina (genus)|Spirulina]] to fish food chain opens up the possibility of recirculating aquaculture systems in areas where there may be scarcity or absence of suitable feed resources.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n=== Nutrients ===\nThere are large differences in the concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium between freshwater and saltwater aquaponics. Potassium and magnesium are major elements in saltwater. Phosphorus is excreted by fish. Its concentration is relatively low in freshwater conditions but high in saltwater.<ref name=\"eec 2017\"/>\n\n== Disease and pest management ==\nAlthough a closed environment has the ability to cultivate large disease outbreaks, it simultaneously reduces predation risks. Outbreaks are also easier to address in a closed environment.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n==== Black Spot Disease ====\nIf calcium, and to a certain extent, magnesium, are lacking, fish may fail to develop a healthy carapace after molting. This can especially lead to \u201c[[Black spot disease (fish)|black spot disease]],\u201d where the animal develops melanized lesions over all of its body, for example, after injury such as scraping against the sides of the rearing facilities.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Risks ==\nFish farmers' lack of experience with this system can result in massive deaths. Inappropriate disinfection, mistakes in oxygen supply, mismanagement of fish seed, and poor estimation of nitrifying capacity, can force the faculties to shut down. Other problems include the lack of backups (i.e. power and materials) in case of emergencies.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Current examples ==\n'''Azuma-cho Fisheries'''\n\nIn 2000, Azuma-cho Fisheries Co-operative Association employed seaweed breeding near marine aquaculture farms in an effort to create a safe and sustainable aquaculture recirculating system.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n\n'''IMT Engineering Inc'''\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, IMT Engineering Inc. conducted aquaponics experiments using the wastewater from shrimp cultures at a facility located in Tsukuba City, Japan. The crops that were tested were water spinach and watercress. The experimental facility was conducted with a 1200-ton grow-out pool.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n\n'''Mote Aquaculture Park'''\n\nA sustainable fish farming facility in Sarasota, Florida called Mote Aquaculture Park launched a commercial demonstration project in fall 2014 with the purpose of demonstrating marine aquaponics farming practices. The project raises the saltwater fish species [[red drum]] alongside salt-loving halophyte plants, [[sea purslane]] and  [[saltwort]]..

In some instances, this may be diluted saltwater. The concept is being researched as a sustainable way to eliminate the stresses that are put on local environments by conventional fish farming practices who expel wastewater into the coastal zones, all while creating complementary crops. \n\nThe practice is a careful balance between the ideal salinity conditions for the aquatic species and the maximum allowable salinity levels for the crops that filter the water and create their own yields.\n\n=== History of the Practice and Current State of Direction ===\nCurrently, many conventional fish farming practices take place in the coastal zones with open circulation. This places an enormous load of urine and soluble nitrogen (that the feed and waste from fish release) at high concentrations into the ecological region. This can have many environmentally deleterious effects. In response to this, alternative aquaculture developments are quickly arising- Namely, recirculating aquaculture systems. By creating a closed system, fish farming has given locational freedom to the practice allowing for more inland developments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/w8120598|title=The Development of Sustainable Saltwater-Based Food Production Systems: A Review of Established and Novel Concepts|journal=Water|volume=8|issue=12|pages=598|year=2016|last1=Gunning|first1=Daryl|last2=Maguire|first2=Julie|last3=Burnell|first3=Gavin|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{pred}}\n\nIn countries like Japan, saltwater species are much more popular than freshwater fish which has spurred much of the desire for saltwater aquaponics systems.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\">Takeuchi, Toshio. Application of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems in Japan. Springer, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe mainstream system for fish cultivation has also been mono-aquaculture (only one kind of fish/organism). With this method, oxygen consumption by the cultured fish increases, and the load of carbon dioxide becomes heavier. In addition, nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphates from feces or remaining fish feed, dissolve in the seawater, making it [[eutrophic]]. This causes [[Red tide|red tides]], fish pathologies, and oxygen deficiency in seawater, resulting in the mass mortality of fish, auto-pollution, etc.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\nIn response poly-eco-aquaculture looks to create symbiosis by establishing seaweeds throughout the year to create an artificial sea forest around the cultured fish cages. The seaweed takes up nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphate from fish feces and remaining feed and gives off oxygen. The seaweed also inhibits pathogenic bacteria and red tide organisms. Grown seaweeds will then be fed to fish and urchins. \n\nOther organisms which can be produced in these systems include sea cucumber which can be grown in symbiosis with abalone in aquaculture net cages as well. Feces generated by the abalone are fed to sea cucumber. Scallops can also be cultured because they eat organic suspended substances, such as the remaining feed and fish feces. \n\nEnvironmentally sound poly-eco-aquaculture enables the preservation of aquatic environments to be compatible with that of sustainable aquaculture. With this method, healthy fish can be cultured in purified water while productively recycling seaweed to feed the fish.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Parts ==\n\n=== Plants ===\nEdible [[Halophyte|halophytes]] that can be grown in hydroponic systems include [[Tetragonia tetragonoides|New Zealand spinach]], [[Mesembryanthemum crystallinum|common ice plant]], common [[glasswort]], [[barley]], [[rice]], and [[Swiss Chard|swiss chard]]. [[algae]], [[seaweed]] and [[plankton]] may be grown as well, possibly in combination.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\nThe relationship between salinity and optimal growth of [[Halotolerance|halotolerant]] and [[Halophile|halophilic]] plants varies by species. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and optimize cultivation methods by adjusting the salt content of the seawater and diluting wastewater when necessary according to each specific combination of organisms.<ref name=\"Custodio 2017\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3354/aei00244|title=Unravelling the potential of halophytes for marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA)\u2014 a perspective on performance, opportunities and challenges|journal=Aquaculture Environment Interactions|volume=9|pages=445\u2013460|year=2017|last1=Cust\u00f3dio|first1=M.|last2=Villasante|first2=S.|last3=Cremades|first3=J.|last4=Calado|first4=R.|last5=Lilleb\u00f8|first5=AI|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==== Common Ice Plant (Suaeda japonica Makino) ====\nCommon ice plant can gradually acclimate to saltwater. It is possible to farm it in 100% seawater and directly connect its cultivation system to an aquaculture system for a wide range of fish species.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\nCommon ice plant is known to accumulate high levels of heavy metals when grown in soil. This new system enables the farming of safe-to-eat organic ice plant by removing it from this environment.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n==== Barley (Hordeum spontaneum) ====\nAfter selecting the most salt tolerant strains, the University of California at Davis was able to grow barley irrigated with pure seawater and obtained half the normal yield per acre.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/aobpla/plq006|pmid=22476064|pmc=3000697|title=Effect of salinity on water relations of wild barley plants differing in salt tolerance|journal=AoB Plants|volume=2010|pages=plq006|year=2010|last1=Vysotskaya|first1=L.|last2=Hedley|first2=P.

They were able to achieve yields of 6.5 to 9.3 tons per hectare.<ref name=\"Kentish 2017\">{{cite news |title=Chinese scientists may have just found a new way to feed 200 million people |last=Kentish|first=Benjamin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/rice-seawater-chinese-scientists-food-200-million-a8017971.html |work=The Independent |date=24 October 2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Fish / other aquatic creatures ==\nCommon creatures in commercial saltwater aquaponics operations include [[Fin fish|sea fin fish]], [[Crustacean|crustaceans]], [[Mollusca|mollusks]], [[Echinoderm|echinoderms]]. [[shrimp]], [[Prawn|prawns]], [[Oyster|oysters]], [[clam]], [[abalone]], [[Flatfish|flatfishes]], [[Puffer Fish|puffer fish]], and [[Sea urchin|sea urchins]].

The shells can also be used for mother of pearl work.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Biofilters ==\n\n==== Phytoplankton, Zooplankton ====\nUtilization of aquatic organisms like phytoplankton, zooplankton assist in carbondioxide and oxygen circulation.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n==== Seaweed ====\nSeaweed species have the capacity to take in nitrogen and phosphate loads. They also fulfill the role of oxygen producers. However, it is difficult for seaweed to completely take in nitrogen and phosphate loads alone. Even the most efficient species of seaweed requires an area two and a half times that of the fish farm in order to take in the total loads. Just the same, it is considered important to cultivate effective seaweed for the [[eutrophication]] of each fish farm and improve the water quality.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Operation ==\n\n=== Feed Source ===\nUtilization of aquatic organisms (e.g., phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish) are an important part of constructing natural food chains within closed ecological systems.<ref name=\"eec 2017\"/>\n\nConstruction of a [[Spirulina (genus)|Spirulina]] to fish food chain opens up the possibility of recirculating aquaculture systems in areas where there may be scarcity or absence of suitable feed resources.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n=== Nutrients ===\nThere are large differences in the concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium between freshwater and saltwater aquaponics. Potassium and magnesium are major elements in saltwater. Phosphorus is excreted by fish. Its concentration is relatively low in freshwater conditions but high in saltwater.<ref name=\"eec 2017\"/>\n\n== Disease and pest management ==\nAlthough a closed environment has the ability to cultivate large disease outbreaks, it simultaneously reduces predation risks. Outbreaks are also easier to address in a closed environment.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n==== Black Spot Disease ====\nIf calcium, and to a certain extent, magnesium, are lacking, fish may fail to develop a healthy carapace after molting. This can especially lead to \u201c[[Black spot disease (fish)|black spot disease]],\u201d where the animal develops melanized lesions all of its body, for example, after injury such as scraping against the sides of the rearing facilities.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Risks ==\nFish farmers' lack of experience with this system can result in massive deaths. Inappropriate disinfection, mistakes in oxygen supply, mismanagement of fish seed, and poor estimation of nitrifying capacity, can force the faculties to shut down. Other problems include the lack of backups (i.e. power and materials) in case of emergencies.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Current examples ==\n'''Azuma-cho Fisheries'''\n\nIn 2000, Azuma-cho Fisheries Co-operative Association employed seaweed breeding near marine aquaculture farms in an effort to create a safe and sustainable aquaculture recirculating system.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n\n'''IMT Engineering Inc'''\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, IMT Engineering Inc. conducted aquaponics experiments using the wastewater from shrimp cultures at a facility located in Tsukuba City, Japan. The crops that were tested were water spinach and watercress. The experimental facility was conducted with a 1200-ton grow-out pool.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n\n'''Mote Aquaculture Park'''\n\nA sustainable fish farming facility in Sarasota, Florida called Mote Aquaculture Park launched a commercial demonstration project in fall 2014 with the purpose of demonstrating marine aquaponics farming practices. The project raises the saltwater fish species [[red drum]] alongside salt-loving halophyte plants, [[sea purslane]] and  [[saltwort]].. The plants are on a 2 month harvest cycle, and sold via local farmers\u2019 markets. The fish production is on a 9-12 months harvest cycle. They are distributed through Florida-based wholesalers. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Aquaponics]]\n* [[Crop tolerance to seawater]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* http://www.seaweedguy.com/2012/07/24/saltwater-aquaponics/\n* http://aquaponicsjournal.com/docs/articles/Seaweed-is-Common-Denominator.pdf\n* http://www.myfamilysurvivalplan.com/what-is-aquaponics/\n*{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/w8100423|title=Evaluation of Dicentrarchus labrax Meats and the Vegetable Quality of Beta vulgaris var.

In the episode, on Super Bowl Sunday of 1998, the Pearsons' house catches fire. The Pearson family manages to escape, but Jack ultimately dies. In present day, the children and Rebecca watch the Super Bowl game remembering Jack.\n\nThe episode originally aired immediately following the broadcast of [[Super Bowl LII]]. \"Super Bowl Sunday\" was seen by 26.97 million viewers, according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], making it the most watched episode of ''This Is Us'' so far. It became the highest-rated scripted entertainment telecast on television since the 2008 post-Super Bowl episode of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1998, late at night after the [[Super Bowl XXXII|Super Bowl]], noises wake Jack, who discovers the house is on fire. He wakes Rebecca and calls out to Randall and Kate; Kevin is at Sophie's house. Jack retrieves the children from their bedrooms, using Kate\u2019s mattress as a [[heat shield]]. Kate, Randall, and Rebecca descend to the ground via a bedsheet rope. Kate's dog, Louie, barks; seeing Kate's desperation, Jack re-enters and emerges with Louie and some family mementos. Leaving Kate and Randall at Miguel's house, Rebecca takes Jack to the hospital for [[smoke inhalation]]. While Rebecca is away from the hospital room to handle logistics, Jack suffers a sudden, fatal [[Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery#Widowmaker|\"widow maker\" heart attack]]. The doctor informs Rebecca, who goes into shock until seeing Jack's body. She tells Miguel, Kate, and Randall, then screams alone in the car; Kate finds and tells Kevin.\n\nIn 2018, on the 20th anniversary of Jack's death, Kate [[catharsis|cathartically]] watches the audition tape Jack recorded, which he saved from the fire; the [[VCR]] damages it, but Toby gets it repaired and uploaded to [[cloud computing|the cloud]]; Kate tells Toby he strengthens her, and Jack would have loved him. Kevin, who usually drinks away his pain on the anniversary, visits the tree where Jack's ashes were scattered; he acknowledges failing to fulfill Jack's legacy, but hopes to make him proud. Rebecca makes and eats Jack's favorite lasagna, and bonds with Kevin; she believes their reunion is a gift from Jack. Randall commemorates Jack with a Super Bowl party for his daughters and their friends. The family's new pet lizard dies suddenly; Randall's eulogy is overly intense and emotional. Tess tells Randall that she has deliberately left the phone off the hook to prevent social workers from calling, fearing Randall's interest in William, Deja, and his new job means he wants \"a new life.\" Randall tells Tess that her birth changed his life; he will always be devoted to her, and plans to have dinner with her every week, even when she's a working adult. Tess thinks the family's participation in fostering is \"cool.\" Deja calls from the house's front door; Randall and Beth bring her inside and comfort her, which Tess happily observes.\n\nJordan, the boy shown previously in an Essex County social worker's office, is placed with a couple. An older Randall arrives to have dinner with the social worker, who is the adult Tess.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by series creator [[Dan Fogelman]].

Kate, Randall, and Rebecca descend to the ground via a bedsheet rope. Kate's dog, Louie, barks; seeing Kate's desperation, Jack re-enters and emerges with Louie and some family mementos. Leaving Kate and Randall at Miguel's house, Rebecca takes Jack to the hospital for [[smoke inhalation]]. While Rebecca is away from the hospital room to handle logistics, Jack suffers a sudden, fatal [[Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery#Widowmaker|\"widow maker\" heart attack]]. The doctor informs Rebecca, who goes into shock until seeing Jack's body. She tells Miguel, Kate, and Randall, then screams alone in the car; Kate finds and tells Kevin.\n\nIn 2018, on the 20th anniversary of Jack's death, Kate [[catharsis|cathartically]] watches the audition tape Jack recorded, which he saved from the fire; the [[VCR]] damages it, but Toby gets it repaired and uploaded to [[cloud computing|the cloud]]; Kate tells Toby he strengthens her, and Jack would have loved him. Kevin, who usually drinks away his pain on the anniversary, visits the tree where Jack's ashes were scattered; he acknowledges failing to fulfill Jack's legacy, but hopes to make him proud. Rebecca makes and eats Jack's favorite lasagna, and bonds with Kevin; she believes their reunion is a gift from Jack. Randall commemorates Jack with a Super Bowl party for his daughters and their friends. The family's new pet lizard dies suddenly; Randall's eulogy is overly intense and emotional. Tess tells Randall that she has deliberately left the phone off the hook to prevent social workers from calling, fearing Randall's interest in William, Deja, and his new job means he wants \"a new life.\" Randall tells Tess that her birth changed his life; he will always be devoted to her, and plans to have dinner with her every week, even when she's a working adult. Tess thinks the family's participation in fostering is \"cool.\" Deja calls from the house's front door; Randall and Beth bring her inside and comfort her, which Tess happily observes.\n\nJordan, the boy shown previously in an Essex County social worker's office, is placed with a couple. An older Randall arrives to have dinner with the social worker, who is the adult Tess.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by series creator [[Dan Fogelman]].
