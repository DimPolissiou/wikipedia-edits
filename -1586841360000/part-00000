''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''. The name is also sometimes spelled \"Faeroe\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Faroe Islands|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faroe+islands|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Faeroe Islands|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Faeroe%20Islands|website=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Faroe Islands}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\n\nArchaeological evidence shows settlers living on the Faroe Islands in two successive periods before the Norse arrived, the first between 300 and 600 AD and the second between 600 and 800 AD.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = M.

Sigmundur introduced Christianity, forcing Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu to convert or face beheading and, although Sigmundur was subsequently murdered, Norwegian taxation was upheld. Norwegian control of the Faroes continued until 1814, although, when the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)]] entered the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark, it gradually resulted in Danish control of the islands. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] with [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Lutheranism|Evangelical Lutheranism]] and [[Reformed]] reached the Faroes in 1538. When the union between Denmark and Norway dissolved as a result of the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Denmark retained possession of the Faroe Islands; Norway itself was joined in a union with Sweden.\n\nFollowing the turmoil caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803-1815) in 1816, the Faroe Islands became a county in the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/publication_series/monographs/monographs/secession_and_counter_secession_an_international_relations_perspective|title=CIDOB - Secession and Counter-secession.

The trade monopoly in the Faroe Islands was abolished in 1856, after which the area developed as a modern fishing nation with its own [[fishing fleet]]. The national awakening from 1888 initially arose from a struggle to maintain the [[Faroese language]] and was thus [[culture|culturally]] oriented, but after 1906 it became more [[politics|political]] with the foundation of [[list of political parties in the Faroe Islands|political parties of the Faroe Islands]].\n\nIn the first year of [[World War II]], on 12 April 1940, [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands|British troops occupied the Faroe Islands]].

The overall character of the climate of the islands is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the [[North Atlantic Current]]. This, together with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0&nbsp;\u00b0C or 37 to 39&nbsp;\u00b0F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or 49 to 51&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe islands are windy, cloudy, and cool throughout the year with an average of 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. [[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

Until 2007, there were seven electoral districts, each comprising a ''s\u00fdsla'', while Streymoy was divided into a northern and southern part ([[T\u00f3rshavn]] region). However, on 25 October 2007, changes were made such that the entire country is one electoral district, giving each vote equal weight.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{main|Regions of the Faroe Islands|Municipalities of the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Map of the Faroe Islands en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Relief map of the Faroe Islands]]\n\nAdministratively, the islands are divided into 29 [[Municipalities of the Faroe Islands|municipalities]] (''kommunur'') within which there are 120 or so [[list of towns in the Faroe Islands|settlements]].\n\nTraditionally, there are also the [[Regions of the Faroe Islands|six ''s\u00fdslur'']] (similar to the British \"shire\": [[Nor\u00f0oyar]], [[Eysturoy]], [[Streymoy]], [[V\u00e1gar]], [[Sandoy]], and [[Su\u00f0uroy]]). Although today ''[[s\u00fdsla]]'' technically means \"police district\", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each ''s\u00fdsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''v\u00e1rting'' (\"spring assembly\").\n\n===Relationship with Denmark===\n{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}\nThe Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]].

Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with international organisations===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]].

The F\u00f3lkask\u00fali also provides optional preschool education as well as the tenth year of education that is a prerequisite to get admitted to upper secondary education. Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later. In the period 1930 to 1940 a writer from the village Sk\u00e1lav\u00edk on Sandoy island, [[He\u00f0in Br\u00fa]], published three novels: ''Lognbr\u00e1'' (1930), ''Fastat\u00f8kur'' (1935) and ''Fe\u00f0gar \u00e1 fer\u00f0'' (English title: ''The old man and his sons'') (1940).

Jacobsen]] (1937\u20132012), a schoolteacher from [[Sandv\u00edk]], wrote short stories, plays, children's books and even novels. Most Faroese writers write in Faroese; two exceptions are [[William Heinesen]] (1900\u201391) and [[J\u00f8rgen-Frantz Jacobsen]] (1900\u201338).\n\nWomen were not so visible in the early Faroese literature except for [[Helena Patursson]] (1864\u20131916), but in the last decades of the 20th century and in the beginning of the 21st century female writers like [[Ebba Hentze]] (born 1933) wrote children's books, short stories, etc. [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Helmsdal]] published the first modernistic collecticoon of poems, ''L\u00fdtt lot'', in 1963, which at the same time was the first collection of Faroese poems written by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ms.fo/?page_id=1099 |title=Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Helmsdal |publisher=Ms.fo |date= |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref> Her daughter, [[Rakel Helmsdal]] (born 1966), is also a writer, best known for her children's books, for which she has won several prizes and nominations.

Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it.

[[B\u00e1r\u00f0ur Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006). Though not born in the Faroe Islands, Matthew Landrum an American poet and editor for the Structo magazine, has written a collection of poems about the Islands.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Garments include sweaters, scarves, and gloves. Faroese jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations handed down from mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in Faroese knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This appears to be a reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''.

Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

Although today ''[[s\u00fdsla]]'' technically means \"police district\", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each ''s\u00fdsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''v\u00e1rting'' (\"spring assembly\").\n\n=== Relationship with Denmark ===\n{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}\nThe Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]]. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the [[War in Donbass]] in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh [[salmon]] to Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/faeroe-islands-boom-by-selling-salmon-to-russia-1424483776|title=Faeroe Islands Boom by Selling Salmon to Russia|first=Anton|last=Troianovski|date=21 February 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Moreover, a [[special member state territories and the European Union#Faroe Islands|protocol]] to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with international organisations ===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

It is difficult to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.\n\nFaroese belongs to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of [[Indo-European languages]]. Written Faroese (grammar and vocabulary) is most similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to their ancestor [[Old Norse]], though the spoken language is closer to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects of [[Western Norway]]. Faroese is the first official language of the island while [[Danish language|Danish]], the second, is taught in schools and can be used by the Faroese government in public relations.<ref name=\"folang\"/>\n\nFaroese language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in Faroese suitable for modern life.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{main|Religion in the Faroe Islands}}\nAccording to the ''[[F\u00e6reyinga saga]]'', [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] brought Christianity to the islands in 999.

According to official statistics from 2019, 79.7% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] (F\u00f3lkakirkjan), following a form of [[Lutheranism]].<ref>[https://statbank.hagstova.fo/pxweb/en/H2/H2__MM__MM03/atrud_prgj.px/ Parishes, 1st January (2000-2019)] Statistics Faroe Islands</ref> The F\u00f3lkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007; previously it had been a diocese within the [[Church of Denmark]]. Faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] (1819\u20131909), [[Fr\u00ed\u00f0rikur Petersen]] (1853\u20131917) and, perhaps most significantly, [[J\u00e1kup Dahl]] (1878\u20131944), who had a great influence in ensuring that the [[Faroese language]] was spoken in the church instead of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Participation in churches is more prevalent among the Faroese population than among most other Scandinavians.\n\nIn the late 1820s, the Christian [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] religious movement, the [[Plymouth Brethren]], was established in England. In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later.

Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it.

[[B\u00e1r\u00f0ur Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006). Though not born in the Faroe Islands, Matthew Landrum an American poet and editor for the Structo magazine, has written a collection of poems about the Islands.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

All of the parish ministers take turns giving the sermon. After the service, the procession returns to the parliament for the opening ceremony.\n\nOther celebrations are marked by different kinds of sports competitions, the rowing competition (in T\u00f3rshavn Harbour) being the most popular, art exhibitions, pop concerts, and the famous [[Faroese dance]] in Sj\u00f3nleikarh\u00fasi\u00f0 and on Vagli\u00f0 outdoor singing on 29 July (continuing after midnight on 30 July).

Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"[[reinforcement learning]]\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a \"[[reward function]]\".}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"[[fitness function]]\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.<ref>Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S., & Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125\u2013152.</ref>\n\nAI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n# If someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,\n# if a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,\n# take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,\n# if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,\n# take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,\n# take any empty square.\n\nMany AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = P.

A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial \"[[neurons]]\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}}<!-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one --><ref>{{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swan theory|black swans]] exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"[[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]]\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\n\n[[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]]\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Single pixel change fools AI programs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AI Has a Hallucination Problem That's Proving Tough to Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-has-a-hallucination-problem-thats-proving-tough-to-fix/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=WIRED|date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=1412.6572|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last2=Shlens|first2=Jonathon|last3=Szegedy|first3=Christian|title=Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples|class=stat.ML|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D\u00e9tection de personne - exemple 3.jpg|thumb|A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to match previous training images of pedestrians, and then model those areas as slow-moving but somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matti|first1=D.|last2=Ekenel|first2=H.

For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieto|first=Antonio|date=May 2018|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possible developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref>\n\nThe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\" />\n\n=== Reasoning, problem solving ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction --><!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/> In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/>\n\n=== Knowledge representation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |archivedate=29 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge<ref name=\"Ontology\"/> by acting as mediators between [[Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist-sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n;Breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/>\n;Subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n=== Planning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future\u2014a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it\u2014and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n=== Learning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,<ref>[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]], which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.<ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". [[Computational learning theory]] can assess learners by [[computational complexity]], by [[sample complexity]] (how much data is required), or by other notions of [[optimization theory|optimization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=M.

A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural-language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis \"Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125047/http://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis |date=1 February 2016 }}, Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119\u2013142, 2011\n</ref> and [[machine translation]].<ref name=\"Applications of natural language processing\"/> Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to [[sentiment analysis|assess the sentiment]] of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cambria|first1=Erik|last2=White|first2=Bebo|title=Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article]|journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=May 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48\u201357|doi=10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227}}</ref>\n\n=== Perception ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[File:\u00c4\u00e4retuvastuse n\u00e4ide.png|thumb|[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature detection]] (pictured: [[edge detection]]) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.]]\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include [[speech recognition]],<ref name=\"Speech recognition\"/> [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], and [[object recognition]].<ref name=\"Object recognition\"/> [[Computer vision]] is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.<ref name=\"Computer vision\"/>\n\n=== Motion and manipulation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Robotics}}\n\nAI is heavily used in [[robotics]].<ref name=\"Robotics\"/> Advanced [[robotic arm]]s and other [[industrial robot]]s, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and [[robotic mapping|map]] its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in [[endoscopy]]) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge.

For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like [[machine translation]], require that a machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like machine translation is considered \"[[AI-complete]]\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n\n== Approaches ==\nThere is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.<ref>[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about\" {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.</ref> A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]]? Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/>\nCan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\n\n=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===\n{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n=== Symbolic ===\n{{Main|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n==== Cognitive simulation ====\nEconomist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems.

A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/> Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\n\n==== Embodied intelligence ====\nThis includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]].

This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n====Computational intelligence and soft computing====\nInterest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]]\u2014they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[Grey system theory]], [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n=== Statistical learning ===\nMuch of traditional [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|GOFAI]] got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to [[symbolic computation]] that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a \"victory of the neats\" may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]]. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=[[Science Magazine|Science]]|date=16 February 2018|pages=725\u2013726|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.359.6377.725|bibcode=2018Sci...359..725H}}</ref> Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.{{sfn|Norvig|2012}} Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from [[explainable AI]]. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}}\n\n=== Integrating the approaches ===\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works\u2014some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s:Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agent]]s in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are [[hybrid intelligent system]]s that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laird|first1=John|title=Extending the Soar cognitive architecture|journal=Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications|date=2008|volume=171|page=224|citeseerx=10.1.1.77.2473}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Lebiere|first2=Christian|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possibile developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Bhatt|first2=Mehul|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|last4=Vernon|first4=David|title=The role of cognitive architectures in general artificial intelligence|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=1\u20133|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.08.003|hdl=2318/1665249}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nAI has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n=== Search and optimization ===\n\n{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/> Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Merkle|author2=Martin Middendorf|editor1-last=Burke|editor1-first=Edmund K.|editor2-last=Kendall|editor2-first=Graham|title=Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6940-7|language=en|chapter=Swarm Intelligence}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\n\n{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic]]<ref name=\"Propositional logic\"/> involves [[truth function]]s such as \"or\" and \"not\". [[First-order logic]]<ref name=\"First-order logic\"/> adds [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy set theory]] assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. [[Fuzzy logic]] is successfully used in [[control system]]s to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.{{efn|\"There exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance... [We] independently confirm the inadequacy of systems for reasoning about uncertainty that propagates numerical factors according to only to which connectives appear in assertions.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elkan|first1=Charles|title=The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic|journal=IEEE Expert|date=1994|volume=9|issue=4|pages=3\u201349|doi=10.1109/64.336150|citeseerx=10.1.1.100.8402}}</ref>}}<ref name=\"Fuzzy logic\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=What is 'fuzzy logic'?

AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),{{efn|Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown [[latent variables]]{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=210}}}}<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be [[conditionally independent]] of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]) can require a sophisticated method such as [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]], which spreads an ensemble of [[random walk]]ers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on [[Xbox Live]] to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. [[Google AdSense|AdSense]] uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\n\n{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The [[decision tree learning|decision tree]]<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/> is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=88}} Other widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],{{efn|The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}}}<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM),{{efn|SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}}}<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/> and the extremely popular [[naive Bayes classifier]].{{efn|Naive Bayes is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}}}<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/> Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}\n\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nNeural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" ''N'' accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 \"[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]\" required \"only a few human assists\".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].

A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test.

However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<ref>McFarland, Matt. \"Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more\".

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's\u2014one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\u2014it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|first=Nick|last=Bostrom|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|date=2015}}</ref>  In his book ''[[Human Compatible]]'', AI researcher [[Stuart J.

''Moral Machines'', Oxford University Press.</ref> For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\"<ref>Wallach, pp 37\u201354.</ref> and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".<ref>Wallach, pp 55\u201373.</ref> For Wallach, the question is not centered on the issue of ''whether'' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the ''constraints'' which society may place on the development of AMAs.<ref>Wallach, Introduction chapter.</ref>\n\n==== Machine ethics ====\n{{Main|Machine ethics}}\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.</ref> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Machine Ethics |work=aaai.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}</ref> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"Machine Ethics\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n==== Malevolent and friendly AI ====\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\nPolitical scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature|journal=The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88\u2013100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}</ref> He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]' and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]]\u2014will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\n[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume= 2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219}} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link]\n</ref> The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain.\n\nFor example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it's red\". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else\u2014they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain.\n\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\n{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nComputationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.<ref>[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ \"The Computational Theory of Mind\"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main|Chinese room}}\nThe philosophical position that [[John Searle]] has named [[strong AI hypothesis|\"strong AI\"]] states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle's strong AI\"/> Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main|Robot rights}}\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? This issue, now known as \"[[robot rights]]\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.<ref name=\"Robot rights\"/> Some critics of [[transhumanism]] argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights. <ref Name=\"Evans 2015\">{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | journal = Teknokultura | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | date = 2015 | df = dmy-all | doi = 10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 }}</ref> The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug & Pray]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug & Pray Film \u2013 Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Robots -|author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212040134/http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and many sci fi media such as [[Star Trek]] Next Generation, with the character of [[Commander Data]], who fought being disassembled for research, and wanted to \"become human\", and the robotic holograms in Voyager.\n\n=== Superintelligence ===\n{{Main|Superintelligence}}\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines\u2014or human-machine hybrids\u2014can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ''Superintelligence'' may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n==== Technological singularity ====\n{{Main|Technological singularity|Moore's law}}\nIf research into [[artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].<ref name=\"recurse\"/> The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario \"[[technological singularity|singularity]]\".<ref name=Singularity/> Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.<ref name=Singularity/><ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n[[Ray Kurzweil]] has used [[Moore's law]] (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that [[desktop computer]]s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.<ref name=Singularity/>\n\n==== Transhumanism ====\n{{Main|Transhumanism}}\n\nRobot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]] and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either.<ref name=\"Transhumanism\"/> This idea, called [[transhumanism]], has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]].\n\n[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s \"[[Darwin among the Machines]]\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.<ref name=\"AI as evolution\"/>\n\n== Economics ==\nThe long-term economic effects of AI are uncertain.

Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.\n\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer.

Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"[[reinforcement learning]]\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a \"[[reward function]]\".}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"[[fitness function]]\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.<ref>Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S., & Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125\u2013152.</ref>\n\nAI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n# If someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,\n# if a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,\n# take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,\n# if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,\n# take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,\n# take any empty square.\n\nMany AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = P.

A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial \"[[neurons]]\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}}<!-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one --><ref>{{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swan theory|black swans]] exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"[[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]]\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\n\n[[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]]\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Single pixel change fools AI programs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AI Has a Hallucination Problem That's Proving Tough to Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-has-a-hallucination-problem-thats-proving-tough-to-fix/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=WIRED|date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=1412.6572|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last2=Shlens|first2=Jonathon|last3=Szegedy|first3=Christian|title=Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples|class=stat.ML|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D\u00e9tection de personne - exemple 3.jpg|thumb|A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to match previous training images of pedestrians, and then model those areas as slow-moving but somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matti|first1=D.|last2=Ekenel|first2=H.

For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieto|first=Antonio|date=May 2018|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possible developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref>\n\nThe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\" />\n\n=== Reasoning, problem solving ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction --><!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/> In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/>\n\n=== Knowledge representation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |archivedate=29 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge<ref name=\"Ontology\"/> by acting as mediators between [[Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist-sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n;Breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/>\n;Subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n=== Planning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future\u2014a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it\u2014and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n=== Learning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,<ref>[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]], which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.<ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". [[Computational learning theory]] can assess learners by [[computational complexity]], by [[sample complexity]] (how much data is required), or by other notions of [[optimization theory|optimization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=M.

A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural-language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis \"Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125047/http://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis |date=1 February 2016 }}, Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119\u2013142, 2011\n</ref> and [[machine translation]].<ref name=\"Applications of natural language processing\"/> Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to [[sentiment analysis|assess the sentiment]] of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cambria|first1=Erik|last2=White|first2=Bebo|title=Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article]|journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=May 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48\u201357|doi=10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227}}</ref>\n\n=== Perception ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[File:\u00c4\u00e4retuvastuse n\u00e4ide.png|thumb|[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature detection]] (pictured: [[edge detection]]) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.]]\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include [[speech recognition]],<ref name=\"Speech recognition\"/> [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], and [[object recognition]].<ref name=\"Object recognition\"/> [[Computer vision]] is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.<ref name=\"Computer vision\"/>\n\n=== Motion and manipulation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Robotics}}\n\nAI is heavily used in [[robotics]].<ref name=\"Robotics\"/> Advanced [[robotic arm]]s and other [[industrial robot]]s, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and [[robotic mapping|map]] its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in [[endoscopy]]) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge.

For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like [[machine translation]], require that a machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like machine translation is considered \"[[AI-complete]]\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n\n== Approaches ==\nThere is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.<ref>[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about\" {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.</ref> A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]]? Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/>\nCan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\n\n=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===\n{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n=== Symbolic ===\n{{Main|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n==== Cognitive simulation ====\nEconomist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems.

A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/> Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\n\n==== Embodied intelligence ====\nThis includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]].

This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n====Computational intelligence and soft computing====\nInterest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]]\u2014they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[Grey system theory]], [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n=== Statistical learning ===\nMuch of traditional [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|GOFAI]] got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to [[symbolic computation]] that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a \"victory of the neats\" may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]]. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=[[Science Magazine|Science]]|date=16 February 2018|pages=725\u2013726|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.359.6377.725|bibcode=2018Sci...359..725H}}</ref> Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.{{sfn|Norvig|2012}} Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from [[explainable AI]]. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}}\n\n=== Integrating the approaches ===\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works\u2014some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s:Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agent]]s in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are [[hybrid intelligent system]]s that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laird|first1=John|title=Extending the Soar cognitive architecture|journal=Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications|date=2008|volume=171|page=224|citeseerx=10.1.1.77.2473}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Lebiere|first2=Christian|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possibile developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Bhatt|first2=Mehul|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|last4=Vernon|first4=David|title=The role of cognitive architectures in general artificial intelligence|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=1\u20133|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.08.003|hdl=2318/1665249}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nAI has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n=== Search and optimization ===\n\n{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/> Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Merkle|author2=Martin Middendorf|editor1-last=Burke|editor1-first=Edmund K.|editor2-last=Kendall|editor2-first=Graham|title=Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6940-7|language=en|chapter=Swarm Intelligence}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\n\n{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic]]<ref name=\"Propositional logic\"/> involves [[truth function]]s such as \"or\" and \"not\". [[First-order logic]]<ref name=\"First-order logic\"/> adds [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy set theory]] assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. [[Fuzzy logic]] is successfully used in [[control system]]s to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.{{efn|\"There exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance... [We] independently confirm the inadequacy of systems for reasoning about uncertainty that propagates numerical factors according to only to which connectives appear in assertions.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elkan|first1=Charles|title=The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic|journal=IEEE Expert|date=1994|volume=9|issue=4|pages=3\u201349|doi=10.1109/64.336150|citeseerx=10.1.1.100.8402}}</ref>}}<ref name=\"Fuzzy logic\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=What is 'fuzzy logic'?

AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),{{efn|Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown [[latent variables]]{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=210}}}}<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be [[conditionally independent]] of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]) can require a sophisticated method such as [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]], which spreads an ensemble of [[random walk]]ers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on [[Xbox Live]] to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. [[Google AdSense|AdSense]] uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\n\n{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The [[decision tree learning|decision tree]]<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/> is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=88}} Other widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],{{efn|The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}}}<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM),{{efn|SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}}}<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/> and the extremely popular [[naive Bayes classifier]].{{efn|Naive Bayes is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}}}<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/> Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}\n\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nNeural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" ''N'' accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 \"[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]\" required \"only a few human assists\".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].

A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test.

However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<ref>McFarland, Matt. \"Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more\".

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's\u2014one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\u2014it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|first=Nick|last=Bostrom|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|date=2015}}</ref>  In his book ''[[Human Compatible]]'', AI researcher [[Stuart J.

''Moral Machines'', Oxford University Press.</ref> For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\"<ref>Wallach, pp 37\u201354.</ref> and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".<ref>Wallach, pp 55\u201373.</ref> For Wallach, the question is not centered on the issue of ''whether'' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the ''constraints'' which society may place on the development of AMAs.<ref>Wallach, Introduction chapter.</ref>\n\n==== Machine ethics ====\n{{Main|Machine ethics}}\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.</ref> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Machine Ethics |work=aaai.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}</ref> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"Machine Ethics\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n==== Malevolent and friendly AI ====\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\nPolitical scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature|journal=The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88\u2013100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}</ref> He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]' and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]]\u2014will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\n[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume= 2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219}} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link]\n</ref> The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain.\n\nFor example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it's red\". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else\u2014they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain.\n\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\n{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nComputationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.<ref>[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ \"The Computational Theory of Mind\"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main|Chinese room}}\nThe philosophical position that [[John Searle]] has named [[strong AI hypothesis|\"strong AI\"]] states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle's strong AI\"/> Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main|Robot rights}}\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? This issue, now known as \"[[robot rights]]\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.<ref name=\"Robot rights\"/> Some critics of [[transhumanism]] argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights. <ref Name=\"Evans 2015\">{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | journal = Teknokultura | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | date = 2015 | df = dmy-all | doi = 10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 }}</ref> The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug & Pray]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug & Pray Film \u2013 Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Robots -|author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212040134/http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and many sci fi media such as [[Star Trek]] Next Generation, with the character of [[Commander Data]], who fought being disassembled for research, and wanted to \"become human\", and the robotic holograms in Voyager.\n\n=== Superintelligence ===\n{{Main|Superintelligence}}\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines\u2014or human-machine hybrids\u2014can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ''Superintelligence'' may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n==== Technological singularity ====\n{{Main|Technological singularity|Moore's law}}\nIf research into [[artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].<ref name=\"recurse\"/> The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario \"[[technological singularity|singularity]]\".<ref name=Singularity/> Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.<ref name=Singularity/><ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n[[Ray Kurzweil]] has used [[Moore's law]] (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that [[desktop computer]]s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.<ref name=Singularity/>\n\n==== Transhumanism ====\n{{Main|Transhumanism}}\n\nRobot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]] and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either.<ref name=\"Transhumanism\"/> This idea, called [[transhumanism]], has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]].\n\n[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s \"[[Darwin among the Machines]]\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.<ref name=\"AI as evolution\"/>\n\n== Economics ==\nThe long-term economic effects of AI are uncertain.

Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.\n\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer.

In addition, it reached a high of #12 in the UK Singles Chart, #24 in Italy and #25 in Germany.\n\nIn January 1987, ''[[She Was Only a Grocer's Daughter]]'', the band's third album was released; it reached #20 in the UK, thanks to its biggest hit, \"It Doesn't Have To Be This Way\", which reached #5 in the UK (and number 28 in Italy), although it never charted in the United States. However, it is featured in the movie ''[[Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol]]''. The song \"You Don't Own Me\" appears on the ''[[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|Dirty Dancing]]'' soundtrack. The record also featured harmony vocals by singer-songwriter [[Grayson Hugh]].\n\nOutside the group (though actually included on their fourth album, ''[[Whoops! There Goes the Neighbourhood]]''), a successful single release by Robert Howard was \"Wait\", that featured early [[Chicago House]] [[diva]], [[Kym Mazelle]], on female lead vocals. The record was an early British recording in the subgenre dubbed [[UK garage]]. The track reached number 7 in the UK chart. It would later re-appear on the Blow Monkeys' first greatest hits album, ''[[Choices \u2013 The Singles Collection]]'', their highest-charting record, reaching #5 in the UK Albums Chart in 1989.\n\nThe band split up in late 1990,<ref name=\"Blow\"/> shortly after the release of their fifth album, ''[[Springtime for the World]]'' (an EP of the same name also came out, collecting all three singles from the album).

Another notable collaborator was [[Beth Orton]].\n\nOn 18 November 2007, the original band members announced the reunion of the Blow Monkeys, as well as a new album ''Devil's Tavern'' and a tour in 2008. The album was funded by the pre-orders placed by fans. The release date for the album was 8 September 2008.

In addition, it reached a high of #12 in the UK Singles Chart, #24 in Italy and #25 in Germany.\n\nIn January 1987, ''[[She Was Only a Grocer's Daughter]]'', the band's third album was released; it reached #20 in the UK, thanks to its biggest hit, \"It Doesn't Have To Be This Way\", which reached #5 in the UK (and number 28 in Italy), although it never charted in the United States. However, it is featured in the movie ''[[Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol]]''. The song \"You Don't Own Me\" appears on the ''[[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|Dirty Dancing]]'' soundtrack. The record also featured harmony vocals by singer-songwriter [[Grayson Hugh]].\n\nOutside the group (though actually included on their fourth album, ''[[Whoops! There Goes the Neighbourhood]]''), a successful single release by Robert Howard was \"Wait\", that featured early [[Chicago House]] [[diva]], [[Kym Mazelle]], on female lead vocals. The record was an early British recording in the subgenre dubbed [[UK garage]]. The track reached number 7 in the UK chart. It would later re-appear on the Blow Monkeys' first greatest hits album, ''[[Choices \u2013 The Singles Collection]]'', their highest-charting record, reaching #5 in the UK Albums Chart in 1989.\n\nThe band split up in late 1990,<ref name=\"Blow\"/> shortly after the release of their fifth album, ''[[Springtime for the World]]'' (an EP of the same name also came out, collecting all three singles from the album). After briefly recording with [[Dee C. Lee]], as Slam Slam, Dr. Robert went solo. He contributed to [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]'s solo debut album, and co-wrote material with both Weller and Lee.  Another notable collaborator was [[Beth Orton]].\n\nOn 18 November 2007, the original band members announced the reunion of the Blow Monkeys, as well as a new album ''Devil's Tavern'' and a tour in 2008. The album was funded by the pre-orders placed by fans. The release date for the album was 8 September 2008. ''[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]]'' reviewed the album by saying, \"Their first album in 18 years still finds the frontman in fine voice; Robert continues to sound like he dresses only in velvet and smokes cigarillos\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theblowmonkeys.com/album-reviews/ |title=The Blow Monkeys and Dr Robert \u2013 Fencat Online |publisher=Theblowmonkeys.com |accessdate=4 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228231317/http://www.theblowmonkeys.com/album-reviews/ |archivedate=28 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, the band released a special edition double digipack CD and DVD of their performance at the [[100 Club]] in London.

{"title_page": "Affine space", "text_new": "{{short description|Geometric structure that generalizes the Euclidean space}}\n{{distinguish|affinity space}}\n\n[[File:Affine space R3.png|thumb|While the lower (green) plane <math>P_1</math> is a vector subspace of <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>, this is not true for the upper (blue) plane <math>P_2</math>: For any two vectors <math>\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\in P_2</math> we find <math>\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} \\notin P_2</math>. However, <math>P_2</math> is an example of an affine space. The difference <math>\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}</math> of two of its elements lies in <math>P_1</math> and constitutes a displacement vector.]]\n[[File:Gilbert tessellation.svg|thumb|right|Line segments on a two-[[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensional]] affine space.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''affine space''' is a geometric [[Structure (mathematics)|structure]] that generalizes some of the properties of [[Euclidean space]]s in such a way that these are independent of the concepts of distance and measure of angles, keeping only the properties related to [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]] and ratio of lengths for parallel [[line segment]]s.\n\nIn an affine space, there is no distinguished point that serves as an origin. Hence, no vector has a fixed origin and no vector can be uniquely associated to a point. In an affine space, there are instead ''[[displacement vector]]s'', also called ''[[translation (geometry)|translation]]'' vectors or simply ''translations'', between two points of the space.<ref>The word ''translation'' is generally preferred to ''displacement vector'', which may be confusing, as [[displacement (mathematics)|displacements]] include also [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]].</ref> Thus it makes sense to subtract two points of the space, giving a translation vector, but it does not make sense to add two points of the space. Likewise, it makes sense to add a displacement vector to a point of an affine space, resulting in a new point translated from the starting point by that vector.\n\nAny [[vector space]] may be considered as an affine space, and this amounts to forgetting the special role played by the [[zero vector]]. In this case, the elements of the vector space may be viewed either as ''points'' of the affine space or as ''displacement vectors'' or ''translations''. When considered as a point, the zero vector is called the ''origin''. Adding a fixed vector to the elements of a [[linear subspace]] of a [[vector space]] produces an ''affine subspace''. One commonly says that this affine subspace has been obtained by translating (away from the origin) the linear subspace by the translation vector. In finite dimensions, such an ''affine subspace'' is the solution set of an [[System of linear equations#Homogeneous systems|inhomogeneous]] linear system. The displacement vectors for that affine space are the solutions of the corresponding ''homogeneous'' linear system, which is a linear subspace. Linear subspaces, in contrast, always contain the origin of the vector space.\n\nThe ''dimension'' of an affine space is defined as the [[dimension of a vector space|dimension of the vector space]] of its translations. An affine space of dimension one is an '''affine line'''. An affine space of dimension 2 is an [[affine plane]]. An affine subspace of dimension {{math|''n'' \u2013 1}} in an affine space or a vector space of dimension ''n'' is an [[affine hyperplane]].\n\n== Informal description ==\nThe following [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] may be easier to understand than the usual formal definition: an affine space is what is left of a [[vector space]] after you've forgotten which point is the origin (or, in the words of the French mathematician [[Marcel Berger]], \"An affine space is nothing more than a vector space whose origin we try to forget about, by adding [[translation (geometry)|translations]] to the linear maps\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets | Berger | 1987 | p=32}}</ref>). Imagine that Alice knows that a certain point is the actual origin, but Bob believes that another point\u2014call it {{math|'''p'''}}\u2014is the origin. Two vectors, {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, are to be added. Bob draws an arrow from point {{math|'''p'''}} to point {{math|'''a'''}} and another arrow from point {{math|'''p'''}} to point {{math|'''b'''}}, and completes the parallelogram to find what Bob thinks is {{math|'''a''' + '''b'''}}, but Alice knows that he has actually computed\n: {{math|size=120%|'''p''' + ('''a''' \u2212 '''p''') + ('''b''' \u2212 '''p''')}}.\n\nSimilarly, [[Alice and Bob]] may evaluate any [[linear combination]] of {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, or of any finite set of vectors, and will generally get different answers. However, if the sum of the coefficients in a linear combination is 1, then Alice and Bob will arrive at the same answer.\n\nIf Alice travels to\n: {{math|size=120%|\u03bb'''a''' + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)'''b'''}}\nthen Bob can similarly travel to\n: {{math|size=120%|1='''p''' + \u03bb('''a''' \u2212 '''p''') + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)('''b''' \u2212 '''p''') = \u03bb'''a''' + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)'''b'''}}.\n\nUnder this condition, for all coefficients {{math|1=\u03bb + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) = 1}}, Alice and Bob describe the same point with the same linear combination, despite using different origins.\n\nWhile only Alice knows the \"linear structure\", both Alice and Bob know the \"affine structure\"\u2014i.e. the values of [[affine combination]]s, defined as linear combinations in which the sum of the coefficients is 1. A set with an affine structure is an offline space.\n\n== Definition ==\nAn ''affine space'' is a set {{math|''A''}} together with a [[vector space]] <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>, and a transitive and free [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the [[additive group]] of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> on the set {{math|''A''}}.<ref>{{Citation|author=Berger, Marcel|chapter=Affine spaces|year=1984|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXRppKJwpaAC&pg=PA11|title=Problems in Geometry|isbn=9780387909714}}</ref> The elements of the affine space {{math|''A''}} are called ''points'', and the elements of the associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> are called ''vectors'', ''translations'', or sometimes ''[[free vector]]s''. Explicitly, the definition above means that the action is a mapping, generally denoted as an addition,\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nA \\times \\overrightarrow{A} &\\to A \\\\\n (a,v)\\; &\\mapsto a + v,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nthat has the following properties.<ref name=\"Berger1987\">{{Harvard citation no brackets | Berger | 1987 | p=33}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last1=Snapper|first1=Ernst|last2=Troyer|first2=Robert J. |title = Metric Affine Geometry| year=1989|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author=Tarrida, Agusti R.|chapter=Affine spaces|year=2011|pages=1\u20132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZvxUBzraGAC&pg=PA1|title=Affine Maps, Euclidean Motions and Quadrics|isbn=9780857297105}}</ref>\n# Right identity:\n#: <math>\\forall a \\in A,\\; a+0 = a</math>, where {{math|0}} is the zero vector in <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>\n# Associativity:\n#: <math>\\forall v,w \\in \\overrightarrow{A}, \\forall a \\in A,\\; (a + v) + w = a + (v + w)</math> (here the last {{math|+}} is the addition in <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>)\n# Free and transitive action:\n#: For every <math>a \\in A</math>, the mapping <math>\\overrightarrow A \\to A \\colon v \\mapsto a + v</math> is a [[bijection]].\n\nThe first two properties are simply defining properties of a (right) group action. The third property characterizes free and transitive actions, the onto character coming from transitivity, and then the injective character follows from the action being free. There is a fourth property that follows from 1, 2 above:\n#<li value=\"4\">Existence of one-to-one [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s</li>\n#:For all <math>v \\in \\overrightarrow A</math>, the mapping <math>A \\to A \\colon a \\mapsto a + v</math> is a bijection.\n\nProperty 3 is often used in the following equivalent form.\n#<li value=\"5\">Subtraction:</li>\n#:For every {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{mvar|A}}, there exists a unique <math>v\\in\\overrightarrow A</math>, denoted {{math|''b'' \u2013 ''a''}}, such that <math>b = a + v</math>.\nAnother way to express the definition is that an affine space is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the action of the additive group of a vector space. Homogeneous spaces are by definition endowed with a transitive group action, and for a principal homogeneous space such a transitive action is by definition free.\n\n=== Subtraction and Weyl's axioms ===\nThe properties of the group action allows for the definition of subtraction for any given ordered pair {{math|(''b'', ''a'')}} of points in {{mvar|A}}, producing a vector of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>. This vector, denoted <math>b - a</math> or <math>\\overrightarrow{ab}</math>, is defined to be the unique vector in <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> such that\n: <math>a + (b - a) = b.</math>\nExistence follows from the transitivity of the action, and uniqueness follows because the action is free.\n\nThis subtraction has the two following properties, called [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]]'s axioms:<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets | Nomizu | Sasaki | 1994 | p=7}}</ref>\n# <math>\\forall a \\in A,\\; \\forall v\\in \\overrightarrow{A}</math>, there is a unique point <math>b \\in A</math> such that <math>b - a = v.</math>\n# <math>\\forall a,b,c \\in A,\\; (c - b) + (b - a)  = c - a.</math>\n\nIn [[Euclidean geometry]], the second Weyl's axiom is commonly called the ''parallelogram rule''.\n\nAffine spaces can be equivalently defined as a point set {{math|''A''}}, together with a vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>, and a subtraction satisfying Weyl's axioms. In this case, the addition of a vector to a point is defined from the first Weyl's axioms.\n\n== Affine subspaces and parallelism ==\nAn ''affine subspace'' (also called, in some contexts, a ''linear variety'', a [[flat (geometry)|flat]], or, over the [[real number]]s, a ''linear manifold'')  {{math|''B''}} of an affine space {{math|''A''}} is a subset of {{math|''A''}} such that, given a point <math>a \\in B</math>, the set of vectors <math>\\overrightarrow{B} = \\{b - a \\mid b \\in B\\}</math> is a [[linear subspace]] of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>. This property, which does not depend on the choice of {{math|''a''}}, implies that {{math|''B''}} is an affine space, which has <math>\\overrightarrow{B}</math> as its associated vector space.\n\nThe affine subspaces of {{math|''A''}} are the subsets of {{math|''A''}} of the form\n: <math>a + V = \\{a + w: w \\in V\\},</math>\nwhere {{math|''a''}} is a point of {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''V''}} a linear subspace of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>.\n\nThe linear subspace associated with an affine subspace is often called its ''{{visible anchor|direction}}'', and two subspaces that share the same direction are said to be ''parallel''.\n\nThis implies the following generalization of  [[Playfair's axiom]]: Given a direction {{math|''V''}}, for any point {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''A''}} there is one and only one affine subspace of direction {{math|''V''}}, which passes through {{math|''a''}}, namely the subspace {{math|''a'' + ''V''}}.\n\nEvery translation <math>A \\to A: a \\mapsto a + v</math> maps any affine subspace to a parallel subspace.\n\nThe term ''parallel'' is also used for two affine subspaces such that the direction of one is included in the direction of the other.\n\n== Affine map ==\nGiven two affine spaces {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} whose associated vector spaces are <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> and <math>\\overrightarrow{B}</math>, an ''affine map'' or ''affine homomorphism'' from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''B''}} is a map\n: <math>f: A \\to B</math>\nsuch that\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\overrightarrow{f}: \\overrightarrow{A} &\\to \\overrightarrow{B}\\\\\n                                   b - a &\\mapsto f(b) - f(a)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nis a well defined linear map. By <math>f</math> being well defined is meant that {{math|1=''b'' \u2013 ''a'' = ''d'' \u2013 ''c''}} implies  {{math|1=''f''(''b'') \u2013 ''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''d'') \u2013 ''f''(''c'')}}.\n\nThis implies that, for a point <math>a \\in A</math> and a vector <math>v \\in \\overrightarrow{A}</math>, one has\n: <math>f(a + v) = f(a) + \\overrightarrow{f}(v).</math>\n\nTherefore, since for any given {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|A}}, {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''v''}} for a unique {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''f''}} is completely defined by its value on a single point and the associated linear map <math>\\overrightarrow{f}</math>.\n\n== Vector spaces as affine spaces ==\nEvery vector space {{math|''V''}} may be considered as an affine space over itself. This means that every element of {{math|''V''}} may be considered either as a point or as a vector. This affine space is sometimes denoted {{math|(''V'', ''V'')}} for emphasizing the double role of the elements of {{math|''V''}}. When considered as a point, the [[zero vector]] is commonly denoted {{math|''o''}} (or {{math|''O''}}, when upper-case letters are used for points) and called the ''origin''.\n\nIf {{math|''A''}} is another affine space over the same vector space (that is <math>V = \\overrightarrow{A}</math>) the choice of any point {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''A''}} defines a unique affine isomorphism, which is the identity of {{math|''V''}} and maps {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''o''}}. In other words, the choice of an origin {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''A''}} allows us to identify {{math|''A''}} and {{math|(''V'', ''V'')}} [[up to]] a [[canonical isomorphism]]. The counterpart of this property is that the affine space {{math|''A''}} may be identified with the vector space {{math|''V''}} in which \"the place of the origin has been forgotten\".\n\n== Relation to Euclidean spaces ==\n=== Definition of Euclidean spaces ===\n[[Euclidean spaces]] (including the one-dimensional line, two-dimensional plane, and three-dimensional space commonly studied in elementary geometry, as well as higher-dimensional analogues) are affine spaces.\n\nIndeed, in most modern definitions, a Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space, such that the associated vector space is a real [[inner product space]] of finite dimension, that is a vector space over the reals with a [[positive-definite quadratic form]] {{math|''q''(''x'')}}. The inner product of two vectors {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is the value of the [[symmetric bilinear form]]\n: <math>x.y = \\frac 12 (q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y)).</math>\nThe usual [[Euclidean distance]] between two points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is \n: <math>d(A, B) = \\sqrt{q(B - A)}.</math>\n\nIn older definition of Euclidean spaces through [[synthetic geometry]], vectors are defined as [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair]]s of points under [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]] (the pairs {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}} and {{math|(''C'', ''D'')}} are ''equipollent'' if the points {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''D'', ''C''}} (in this order) form a [[parallelogram]]). It is straightforward to verify that the vectors form a vector space, the square of the [[Euclidean distance]] is a quadratic form on the space of vectors, and the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent.\n\n=== Affine properties ===\nIn [[Euclidean geometry]], the common phrase \"'''affine property'''\" refers to a property that can be proved in affine spaces, that is, it can be proved without using the quadratic form and its associated inner product. In other words, an affine property is a property that does not involve lengths and angles. Typical examples are [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]], and the definition of a [[tangent]]. A non-example is the definition of a [[normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\nEquivalently, an affine property is a property that is invariant under [[affine transformation]]s of the Euclidean space.\n\n== Affine combinations and barycenter ==\nLet {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} be a collection of {{math|''n''}} points in an affine space, and <math>\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n</math> be {{math|''n''}} elements of the ground field. \n\nSuppose that <math>\\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 0</math>. For any two points {{math|''o''}} and {{math|''o' ''}} one has\n: <math>\\lambda_1 \\overrightarrow{oa_1} + \\dots + \\lambda_n \\overrightarrow{oa_n} = \\lambda_1 \\overrightarrow{o'a_1} + \\dots + \\lambda_n \\overrightarrow{o'a_n}.</math>\nThus this sum is independent of the choice of the origin, and the resulting vector may be denoted\n: <math>\\lambda_1 a_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n a_n .</math>\n\nWhen <math>n = 2, \\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = -1</math>, one retrieves the definition of the subtraction of points.\n\nNow suppose instead that the field elements satisfy <math>\\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1</math>. For some choice of an origin {{math|''o''}}, denote by <math>g</math> the unique point such that\n: <math>\\lambda_1 \\overrightarrow{oa_1} + \\dots + \\lambda_n \\overrightarrow{oa_n} = \\overrightarrow{og}.</math>\nOne can show that <math>g</math> is independent from the choice of {{math|''o''}}. Therefore, if\n: <math>\\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1,</math>\none may write\n: <math>g = \\lambda_1 a_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n a_n.</math>\nThe point <math>g</math> is called the '''[[centroid|barycenter]]''' of the <math>a_i</math> for the weights <math>\\lambda_i</math>. One says also that <math>g</math> is an '''[[affine combination]]''' of the <math>a_i</math> with coefficients <math>\\lambda_i</math>.\n\n== Examples ==\n* When children find the answers to sums such as 4 + 3 or 4 &minus; 2 by counting right or left on a [[number line]], they are treating the number line as a one-dimensional affine space.\n* Any [[coset]] of a subspace {{mvar|V}} of a vector space is an affine space over that subspace.\n* If {{mvar|T}} is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{math|'''b'''}} lies in its [[column space]], the set of solutions of the equation {{math|1=''T''\u2009'''x''' = '''b'''}} is an affine space over the subspace of solutions of {{math|1=''T''\u2009'''x''' = 0}}.\n* The solutions of an inhomogeneous linear differential equation form an affine space over the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous linear equation.\n* Generalizing all of the above, if {{math|''T''\u2009: ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is a linear mapping and {{math|'''y'''}} lies in its image, the set of solutions {{math|'''x''' \u2208 ''V''}} to the equation {{math|1=''T''\u2009'''x''' = '''y'''}} is a coset of the kernel of {{mvar|T\u2009}}, and is therefore an affine space over {{math|Ker\u2009''T''\u2009}}.\n* The space of (linear) complementary subspaces of a vector subspace ''V'' in a vector space ''W'' is an affine space, over Hom(''W''/''V'',''V''). That is, if <math>0 \\to V \\to W \\to X \\to 0</math> is a [[short exact sequence]] of vector spaces, then the space of all [[split exact sequence|splittings]] of the exact sequence naturally carries the structure of an affine space over Hom(''X'',''V'').\n\n== Affine span and bases==\nFor any subset {{math|''X''}} of an affine space {{math|''A''}}, there is a smallest affine subspace that contains it, called the '''affine span''' of {{math|''X''}}. It is the intersection of all affine subspaces containing {{math|''X''}}, and its direction is the intersection of the directions of the affine subspaces that contain {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe affine span of {{math|''X''}} is the set of all (finite) affine combinations of points of {{math|''X''}}, and its direction is the [[linear span]] of the {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}} for {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''X''}}. If one chooses a particular point {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, the direction of the affine span of {{math|''X''}} is also the linear span of the {{math|''x'' \u2013 ''x''<sub>0</sub>}} for {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}}.\n\nOne says also that the affine span of {{math|''X''}} is '''generated''' by {{math|''X''}} and that {{math|''X''}} is a '''generating set''' of its affine span.\n\nA set {{math|''X''}} of points of an affine space is said to be '''affinely independent''' or, simply, '''independent''', if the affine span of any [[strict subset]] of {{math|''X''}} is a strict subset of the affine span of {{math|''X''}}. An '''{{visible anchor|affine basis}}''' or '''barycentric frame''' (see {{slink||Barycentric coordinates}}, below) of an affine space is a generating set that is also independent (that is a minimal generating set).\n\nRecall the ''dimension'' of an affine space is the dimension of its associated vector space. The bases of an affine space of finite dimension {{math|''n''}} are the independent subsets of {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements, or, equivalently, the generating subsets of {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. Equivalently, {{math|{''x''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}} is an affine basis of an affine space if and only if {{math|{''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}} is a [[linear basis]] of the associated vector space.\n\n== Coordinates==\nThere are two strongly related kinds of [[coordinate system]]s that may be defined on affine spaces.\n\n=== Barycentric coordinates ===\nLet {{math|''A''}} be an affine space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}} of dimension {{math|''n''}}, and <math>\\{x_0, \\dots, x_n\\}</math> be an affine basis of {{math|''A''}}. The properties of an affine basis imply that for every {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''A''}} there is a unique {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-[[tuple]] <math>(\\lambda_0, \\dots, \\lambda_n)</math> of elements of {{math|''k''}} such that\n: <math>\\lambda_0 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1</math>\nand\n: <math>x = \\lambda_0 x_0 + \\dots + \\lambda_n x_n.</math>\n\nThe <math>\\lambda_i</math> are called the '''barycentric coordinates''' of {{math|''x''}} over the affine basis <math>\\{x_0, \\dots, x_n\\}</math>. If the {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} are viewed as bodies that have weights  (or masses) <math>\\lambda_i</math>, the point {{math|''x''}} is thus the [[Centroid|barycenter]] of the {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}}, and this explains the origin of the term ''barycentric coordinates''.\n\nThe barycentric coordinates define an affine isomorphism between the affine space {{math|''A''}} and the affine subspace of {{math|''k''<sup>''n'' + 1</sup>}} defined by the equation <math>\\lambda_0 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1</math>.\n\nFor affine spaces of infinite dimension, the same definition applies, using only finite sums. This means that for each point, only a finite number of coordinates are non-zero.\n\n=== Affine coordinates ===\nAn '''affine frame''' of an affine space consists of a point, called the ''origin'', and a [[linear basis]] of the associated vector space. More precisely, for an affine space {{math|''A''}} with associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>, the origin {{math|''o''}} belongs to {{math|''A''}}, and the linear basis is a basis {{math|(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> (for simplicity of the notation, we consider only the case of finite dimension, the general case is similar).\n\nFor each point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''A''}}, there is a unique sequence <math>\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n</math> of elements of the ground field such that\n: <math>p = o + \\lambda_1 v_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n v_n,</math>\nor equivalently\n: <math>\\overrightarrow{op} = \\lambda_1 v_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n v_n.</math>\n\nThe <math>\\lambda_i</math> are called the '''affine coordinates''' of {{math|''p''}} over the affine frame {{math|(''o'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}.\n\n'''Example:''' In [[Euclidean geometry]], [[Cartesian coordinates]] are affine coordinates relative to an '''orthonormal frame''', that is an affine frame {{math|(''o'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} such that {{math|(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} is an [[orthonormal basis]].\n\n=== Relationship between barycentric and affine coordinates ===\nBarycentric coordinates and affine coordinates are strongly related, and may be considered as equivalent.\n\nIn fact, given a barycentric frame\n: <math>(x_0, \\dots, x_n),</math>\none deduces immediately the affine frame\n: <math>(x_0, \\overrightarrow{x_0 x_1}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{x_0 x_n}) = \\left(x_0, x_1 - x_0, \\dots, x_n - x_0\\right),</math>\nand, if\n: <math>\\left(\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right)</math>\nare the barycentric coordinates of a point over the barycentric frame, then the affine coordinates of the same point over the affine frame are\n: <math>\\left(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right).</math>\n\nConversely, if\n: <math>\\left(o, v_1, \\dots, v_n\\right)</math>\nis an affine frame, then\n: <math>\\left(o, o + v_1, \\dots, o + v_n\\right)</math>\nis a barycentric frame. If\n: <math>\\left(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right)</math>\nare the affine coordinates of a point over the affine frame, then its barycentric coordinates over the barycentric frame are\n: <math>\\left(1 - \\lambda_1 - \\dots - \\lambda_n, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right).</math>\n\nTherefore, barycentric and affine coordinates are almost equivalent. In most applications, affine coordinates are preferred, as involving less coordinates that are independent. However, in the situations where the important points of the studied problem are affinity independent, barycentric coordinates may lead to simpler computation, as in the following example.\n\n==== Example of the triangle ====\nThe vertices of a non-flat [[triangle]] form an affine basis of the [[Euclidean plane]]. The barycentric coordinates allows easy characterization of the elements of the triangle that do not involve angles or distance:\n\nThe vertices are the points of barycentric coordinates {{math|(1, 0, 0)}},  {{math|(0, 1, 0)}} and  {{math|(0, 0, 1)}}. The lines supporting the edges are the points that have a zero coordinate. The edges themselves are the points that have a zero coordinate and two nonnegative coordinates. The interior of the triangle are the points whose all coordinates are positive. The [[median (geometry)|medians]] are the points that have two equal coordinates, and the [[centroid]] is the point of coordinates {{math|({{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|1|3}})}}.\n\n=== Change of coordinates ===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\n\n==== Case of affine coordinates ====\n\n==== Case of barycentric coordinates ====\n\n== Properties of affine homomorphisms ==\n\n===Matrix representation===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Image and fibers===\nLet\n: <math>f \\colon E \\to F</math>\nbe an affine homomorphism, with\n: <math>\\overrightarrow {f} \\colon \\overrightarrow{E} \\to \\overrightarrow{F}</math>\nas associated linear map.\n\nThe '''image''' of {{math|''f''}} is the affine subspace {{math|''f''(E)}} of  {{mvar|F}}, which has <math>\\overrightarrow{f} \\left(\\overrightarrow{E}\\right)</math> as associated vector space. As an affine space does not have a [[zero element]], an affine homomorphism does not have a [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. However, for any point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''f''(''E'')}}, the [[inverse image]] {{math|''f''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''x'')}} of {{math|''x''}} is an affine subspace of {{math|''E''}}, of direction <math>\\overrightarrow{f}^{-1} \\left(\\overrightarrow{F}\\right)</math>. This affine subspace is called the '''fiber''' of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Projection===\n{{see also|Projection (mathematics)}}\nAn important example is the projection parallel to some direction onto an affine subspace. The importance of this example lies in the fact that [[Euclidean space]]s are affine spaces, and that this kind of projections is fundamental in [[Euclidean geometry]].\n\nMore precisely, given an affine space {{math|''E''}} with associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math>, let {{math|''F''}} be an affine subspace of direction <math>\\overrightarrow{F}</math>, and {{math|''D''}} be a [[complementary subspace]] of <math>\\overrightarrow{F}</math> in <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math> (this means that every vector of <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math> may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of an element of <math>\\overrightarrow{F}</math> and an element of {{math|''D''}}). For every point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''E''}}, its '''projection''' to {{math|''F''}} parallel to {{math|''D''}} is the unique point {{math|''p''(''x'')}} in {{math|''F''}} such that\n: <math>p(x) - x \\in D.</math>\n\nThis is an affine homomorphism whose associated linear map <math>\\overrightarrow{p}</math> is defined by\n: <math>\\overrightarrow{p}(x - y) = p(x) - p(y),</math>\nfor {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|E}}.\n\nThe image of this projection is  {{math|''F''}}, and its fibers are the subspaces of direction  {{math|''D''}}.\n\n=== Quotient space ===\nAlthough kernels are not defined for affine spaces, quotient spaces are defined. This results from the fact that \"belonging to the same fiber of an affine homomorphism\" is an equivalence relation.\n\nLet  {{math|''E''}} be an affine space, and  {{math|''D''}} be a [[linear subspace]] of the associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math>. The '''quotient'''  {{math|''E''/''D''}} of  {{math|''E''}} by  {{math|''D''}} is the [[quotient by an equivalence relation|quotient]] of  {{math|''E''}} by the [[equivalence relation]]\n: <math>x - y \\in D.</math>\n\nThis quotient is an affine space, which has <math>\\overrightarrow{E}/D</math> as associated vector space.\n\nFor every affine homomorphism <math>E \\to F</math>, the image is isomorphic to the quotient of  {{math|''E''}} by the kernel of the associated linear map. This is the [[first isomorphism theorem]] for affine spaces.\n\n== Affine transformation ==\n{{main|Affine transformation|Affine group}}\n{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Axioms ==\nAffine space is usually studied as [[analytic geometry]] using coordinates, or equivalently vector spaces. It can also be studied as [[synthetic geometry]] by writing down axioms, though this approach is much less common. There are several different systems of axioms for affine space.\n\n{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1969|p=192}} axiomatizes affine geometry (over the reals) as [[ordered geometry]] together with an affine form of [[Desargues's theorem]] and an axiom stating that in a plane there is at most one line through a given point not meeting a given line.\n\nAffine planes satisfy the following axioms {{harv|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 2}}:\n(in which two lines are called parallel if they are equal or\ndisjoint):\n* Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.\n* Given a point  and line  there is a unique line which contains the point and is parallel to the line\n* There exist three non-collinear points.\nAs well as affine planes over fields (or [[division ring]]s), there are also many [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s satisfying these axioms. {{harv|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 3}} gives axioms for higher-dimensional affine spaces.\n\n== Relation to projective spaces ==\n[[File:Affine space, projective space, vector space.svg|thumb|An affine space is a subspace of a projective space, which is in turn the quotient of a vector space by an equivalence relation (not by a linear subspace)]]\nAffine spaces are subspaces of [[projective space]]s: an affine plane can be obtained from any [[projective plane]] by removing a line and all the points on it, and conversely any affine plane can be used to construct a projective plane as a [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] by adding a [[line at infinity]] whose points correspond to equivalence classes of [[parallel lines]].\n\nFurther, transformations of projective space that preserve affine space (equivalently, that leave the [[hyperplane at infinity]] [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|invariant as a set]]) yield transformations of affine space. Conversely, any affine linear transformation extends uniquely to a projective linear transformation, so the [[affine group]] is a [[subgroup]] of the [[projective group]]. For instance, [[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s (transformations of the complex projective line, or [[Riemann sphere]]) are affine (transformations of the complex plane) if and only if they fix the [[point at infinity]].\n\n== Affine algebraic geometry ==\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], an [[affine variety]] (or, more generally, an [[affine algebraic set]]) is defined as the subset of an affine space that is the set of the common zeros of a set of so-called ''polynomial functions over the affine space''. For defining a ''polynomial function over the affine space'', one has to choose an [[affine frame]]. Then, a polynomial function is a function such that the image of any point is the value of some multivariate [[polynomial function]] of the coordinates of the point. As a change of affine coordinates may be expressed by [[linear function]]s (more precisely affine functions) of the coordinates, this definition is independent of a particular choice of coordinates.\n\nThe choice of a system of affine coordinates for an affine space <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> of dimension {{math|''n''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}} induces an affine [[isomorphism]] between <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> and the affine [[coordinate space]] {{math|''k''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. This explains why, for simplification, many textbooks write <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n = k^n</math>, and introduce affine algebraic varieties as the common zeros of polynomial functions over {{math|''k''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|loc=Ch. I, \u00a7 1.}}</ref>\n\nAs the whole affine space is the set of the common zeros of the [[zero polynomial]], affine spaces are affine algebraic varieties.\n\n=== Ring of polynomial functions ===\nBy the definition above, the choice of an affine frame of an affine space <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> allows one to identify the polynomial functions on <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> with polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables, the ''i''th variable representing the function that maps a point to its {{math|''i''}}th coordinate. It follows that the set of polynomial functions over <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> is a [[algebra over a field|{{math|''k''}}-algebra]], denoted <math>k\\left[\\mathbb{A}_k^n\\right]</math>, which is isomorphic to the [[polynomial ring]] <math>k\\left[X_1, \\dots, X_n\\right]</math>.\n\nWhen one changes coordinates, the isomorphism between <math>k\\left[\\mathbb{A}_k^n\\right]</math> and <math>k[X_1, \\dots, X_n]</math> changes accordingly, and this induces an automorphism of <math>k\\left[X_1, \\dots, X_n\\right]</math>, which maps each indeterminate to a polynomial of degree one. It follows that the [[total degree]] defines a [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] of <math>k\\left[\\mathbb A_k^n\\right]</math>, which is independent from the choice of coordinates. The total degree defines also a [[graded ring|graduation]], but it depends on the choice of coordinates, as a change of affine coordinates may map indeterminates on non-[[homogeneous polynomial]]s.\n\n=== Zariski topology ===\n{{see also|Zariski topology}}\nAffine spaces over [[topological field]]s, such as the real or the complex numbers, have a natural [[topology (structure)|topology]]. The Zariski topology, which is defined for affine spaces over any field, allows use of topological methods in any case. Zariski topology is the unique topology on an affine space whose [[closed sets]] are [[affine algebraic set]]s (that is sets of the common zeros of polynomials functions over the affine set). As, over a topological field, polynomial functions are continuous, every Zariski closed set is closed for the usual topology, if any. In other words, over a topological field, Zariski topology is [[coarser topology|coarser]] than the natural topology.\n\nThere is a natural injective function from an affine space into the set of [[prime ideal]]s (that is the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]]) of its ring of polynomial functions. When affine coordinates have been chosen, this function maps the point of coordinates <math>\\left(a_1, \\dots, a_n\\right)</math> to the [[maximal ideal]] <math>\\left\\langle X_1 - a_1, \\dots, X_n - a_n\\right\\rangle</math>. This function is a [[homeomorphism]] (for the Zariski topology of the affine space and of the spectrum of the ring of polynomial functions) of the affine space onto the image of the function.\n\nThe case of an [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed ground field]] is especially important in algebraic geometry, because, in this case, the homeomorphism above is a map between the affine space and the set of all maximal ideals of the ring of functions (this is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]).\n\nThis is the starting idea of [[scheme theory]] of [[Grothendieck]], which consists, for studying algebraic varieties, of considering as \"points\", not only the points of the affine space, but also all the prime ideals of the spectrum. This allows gluing together algebraic varieties in a similar way as, for [[manifold]]s, [[chart (topology)|charts]] are glued together for building a manifold.\n\n=== Cohomology ===\nLike all affine varieties, local data on an affine space can always be patched together globally: the [[cohomology]] of affine space is trivial. More precisely, <math>H^i\\left(\\mathbb{A}_k^n,\\mathbf{F}\\right) = 0</math> for all coherent sheaves '''F''', and integers <math>i > 0</math>. This property is also enjoyed by all other [[affine variety|affine varieties]]. But also all of the [[etale cohomology]] groups on affine space are trivial. In particular, every [[line bundle]] is trivial. More generally, the [[Quillen\u2013Suslin theorem]] implies that ''every'' algebraic [[vector bundle]] over an affine space is trivial.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Space (mathematics)]]\n* [[Affine geometry]]\n* [[Affine group]]\n* [[Affine transformation]]\n* [[Affine variety]]\n* [[Affine hull]]\n* [[Heap (mathematics)]]\n* [[Equipollence (geometry)]]\n* [[Interval measurement]], an affine observable in [[statistics]]\n* [[Exotic affine space]]\n* [[Complex affine space]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation|author=Berger, Marcel|chapter=Affine spaces|title=Problems in Geometry|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1984|isbn=978-0-387-90971-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXRppKJwpaAC&pg=PA11}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Berger | first1=Marcel | author1-link=Marcel Berger | title=Geometry I | publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | isbn= 3-540-11658-3 | year=1987}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Cameron | first1=Peter J. | authorlink=Peter Cameron (mathematician) | title=Projective and polar spaces | url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/pps/ | publisher=Queen Mary and Westfield College School of Mathematical Sciences | location=London | series=QMW Maths Notes | mr=1153019 | year=1991 | volume=13}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Coxeter | first1=Harold Scott MacDonald | author1-link=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | title=Introduction to Geometry | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-471-50458-0 | year=1969 | mr=123930}}\n* {{eom|id=A/a011100|authorlink= Dolgachev|first=I.V.|last= Dolgachev|first2=A.P. |last2=Shirokov}}\n* {{citation | last1=Snapper|first1=Ernst|last2=Troyer|first2=Robert J. | title = Metric Affine Geometry | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1989|edition=Dover edition, first published in 1989|isbn=0-486-66108-3}}\n* {{citation|last1=Nomizu|first1=K.|last2=Sasaki|first2=S.|title=Affine Differential Geometry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|edition=New|isbn=978-0-521-44177-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/affinedifferenti0000nomi}}\n* {{Citation|author=Tarrida, Agusti R.|chapter=Affine spaces|title=Affine Maps, Euclidean Motions and Quadrics|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-0-85729-709-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZvxUBzraGAC&pg=PA1}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Affine Space}}\n[[Category:Affine geometry]]\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Geometric structure that generalizes the Euclidean space}}\n{{distinguish|affinity space}}\n\n[[File:Affine space R3.png|thumb|While the lower (green) plane <math>P_1</math> is a vector subspace of <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>, this is not true for the upper (blue) plane <math>P_2</math>: For any two vectors <math>\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\in P_2</math> we find <math>\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} \\notin P_2</math>.

Hence, no vector has a fixed origin and no vector can be uniquely associated to a point. In an affine space, there are instead ''[[displacement vector]]s'', also called ''[[translation (geometry)|translation]]'' vectors or simply ''translations'', between two points of the space.<ref>The word ''translation'' is generally preferred to ''displacement vector'', which may be confusing, as [[displacement (mathematics)|displacements]] include also [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]].</ref> Thus it makes sense to subtract two points of the space, giving a translation vector, but it does not make sense to add two points of the space. Likewise, it makes sense to add a displacement vector to a point of an affine space, resulting in a new point translated from the starting point by that vector.\n\nAny [[vector space]] may be considered as an affine space, and this amounts to forgetting the special role played by the [[zero vector]]. In this case, the elements of the vector space may be viewed either as ''points'' of the affine space or as ''displacement vectors'' or ''translations''. When considered as a point, the zero vector is called the ''origin''. Adding a fixed vector to the elements of a [[linear subspace]] of a [[vector space]] produces an ''affine subspace''. One commonly says that this affine subspace has been obtained by translating (away from the origin) the linear subspace by the translation vector. In finite dimensions, such an ''affine subspace'' is the solution set of an [[System of linear equations#Homogeneous systems|inhomogeneous]] linear system. The displacement vectors for that affine space are the solutions of the corresponding ''homogeneous'' linear system, which is a linear subspace. Linear subspaces, in contrast, always contain the origin of the vector space.\n\nThe ''dimension'' of an affine space is defined as the [[dimension of a vector space|dimension of the vector space]] of its translations. An affine space of dimension one is an '''affine line'''. An affine space of dimension 2 is an [[affine plane]]. An affine subspace of dimension {{math|''n'' \u2013 1}} in an affine space or a vector space of dimension ''n'' is an [[affine hyperplane]].\n\n== Informal description ==\nThe following [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] may be easier to understand than the usual formal definition: an affine space is what is left of a [[vector space]] after you've forgotten which point is the origin (or, in the words of the French mathematician [[Marcel Berger]], \"An affine space is nothing more than a vector space whose origin we try to forget about, by adding [[translation (geometry)|translations]] to the linear maps\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets | Berger | 1987 | p=32}}</ref>). Imagine that Alice knows that a certain point is the actual origin, but Bob believes that another point\u2014call it {{math|'''p'''}}\u2014is the origin. Two vectors, {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, are to be added. Bob draws an arrow from point {{math|'''p'''}} to point {{math|'''a'''}} and another arrow from point {{math|'''p'''}} to point {{math|'''b'''}}, and completes the parallelogram to find what Bob thinks is {{math|'''a''' + '''b'''}}, but Alice knows that he has actually computed\n: {{math|size=120%|'''p''' + ('''a''' \u2212 '''p''') + ('''b''' \u2212 '''p''')}}.\n\nSimilarly, [[Alice and Bob]] may evaluate any [[linear combination]] of {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, or of any finite set of vectors, and will generally get different answers. However, if the sum of the coefficients in a linear combination is 1, then Alice and Bob will arrive at the same answer.\n\nIf Alice travels to\n: {{math|size=120%|\u03bb'''a''' + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)'''b'''}}\nthen Bob can similarly travel to\n: {{math|size=120%|1='''p''' + \u03bb('''a''' \u2212 '''p''') + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)('''b''' \u2212 '''p''') = \u03bb'''a''' + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)'''b'''}}.\n\nUnder this condition, for all coefficients {{math|1=\u03bb + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) = 1}}, Alice and Bob describe the same point with the same linear combination, despite using different origins.\n\nWhile only Alice knows the \"linear structure\", both Alice and Bob know the \"affine structure\"\u2014i.e. the values of [[affine combination]]s, defined as linear combinations in which the sum of the coefficients is 1. A set with an affine structure is an affine space.\n\n== Definition ==\nAn ''affine space'' is a set {{math|''A''}} together with a [[vector space]] <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>, and a transitive and free [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the [[additive group]] of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> on the set {{math|''A''}}.<ref>{{Citation|author=Berger, Marcel|chapter=Affine spaces|year=1984|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXRppKJwpaAC&pg=PA11|title=Problems in Geometry|isbn=9780387909714}}</ref> The elements of the affine space {{math|''A''}} are called ''points'', and the elements of the associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> are called ''vectors'', ''translations'', or sometimes ''[[free vector]]s''. Explicitly, the definition above means that the action is a mapping, generally denoted as an addition,\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nA \\times \\overrightarrow{A} &\\to A \\\\\n (a,v)\\; &\\mapsto a + v,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nthat has the following properties.<ref name=\"Berger1987\">{{Harvard citation no brackets | Berger | 1987 | p=33}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last1=Snapper|first1=Ernst|last2=Troyer|first2=Robert J. |title = Metric Affine Geometry| year=1989|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author=Tarrida, Agusti R.|chapter=Affine spaces|year=2011|pages=1\u20132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZvxUBzraGAC&pg=PA1|title=Affine Maps, Euclidean Motions and Quadrics|isbn=9780857297105}}</ref>\n# Right identity:\n#: <math>\\forall a \\in A,\\; a+0 = a</math>, where {{math|0}} is the zero vector in <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>\n# Associativity:\n#: <math>\\forall v,w \\in \\overrightarrow{A}, \\forall a \\in A,\\; (a + v) + w = a + (v + w)</math> (here the last {{math|+}} is the addition in <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>)\n# Free and transitive action:\n#: For every <math>a \\in A</math>, the mapping <math>\\overrightarrow A \\to A \\colon v \\mapsto a + v</math> is a [[bijection]].\n\nThe first two properties are simply defining properties of a (right) group action. The third property characterizes free and transitive actions, the onto character coming from transitivity, and then the injective character follows from the action being free. There is a fourth property that follows from 1, 2 above:\n#<li value=\"4\">Existence of one-to-one [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s</li>\n#:For all <math>v \\in \\overrightarrow A</math>, the mapping <math>A \\to A \\colon a \\mapsto a + v</math> is a bijection.\n\nProperty 3 is often used in the following equivalent form.\n#<li value=\"5\">Subtraction:</li>\n#:For every {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{mvar|A}}, there exists a unique <math>v\\in\\overrightarrow A</math>, denoted {{math|''b'' \u2013 ''a''}}, such that <math>b = a + v</math>.\nAnother way to express the definition is that an affine space is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the action of the additive group of a vector space. Homogeneous spaces are by definition endowed with a transitive group action, and for a principal homogeneous space such a transitive action is by definition free.\n\n=== Subtraction and Weyl's axioms ===\nThe properties of the group action allows for the definition of subtraction for any given ordered pair {{math|(''b'', ''a'')}} of points in {{mvar|A}}, producing a vector of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>. This vector, denoted <math>b - a</math> or <math>\\overrightarrow{ab}</math>, is defined to be the unique vector in <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> such that\n: <math>a + (b - a) = b.</math>\nExistence follows from the transitivity of the action, and uniqueness follows because the action is free.\n\nThis subtraction has the two following properties, called [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]]'s axioms:<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets | Nomizu | Sasaki | 1994 | p=7}}</ref>\n# <math>\\forall a \\in A,\\; \\forall v\\in \\overrightarrow{A}</math>, there is a unique point <math>b \\in A</math> such that <math>b - a = v.</math>\n# <math>\\forall a,b,c \\in A,\\; (c - b) + (b - a)  = c - a.</math>\n\nIn [[Euclidean geometry]], the second Weyl's axiom is commonly called the ''parallelogram rule''.\n\nAffine spaces can be equivalently defined as a point set {{math|''A''}}, together with a vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>, and a subtraction satisfying Weyl's axioms. In this case, the addition of a vector to a point is defined from the first Weyl's axioms.\n\n== Affine subspaces and parallelism ==\nAn ''affine subspace'' (also called, in some contexts, a ''linear variety'', a [[flat (geometry)|flat]], or, over the [[real number]]s, a ''linear manifold'')  {{math|''B''}} of an affine space {{math|''A''}} is a subset of {{math|''A''}} such that, given a point <math>a \\in B</math>, the set of vectors <math>\\overrightarrow{B} = \\{b - a \\mid b \\in B\\}</math> is a [[linear subspace]] of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>. This property, which does not depend on the choice of {{math|''a''}}, implies that {{math|''B''}} is an affine space, which has <math>\\overrightarrow{B}</math> as its associated vector space.\n\nThe affine subspaces of {{math|''A''}} are the subsets of {{math|''A''}} of the form\n: <math>a + V = \\{a + w: w \\in V\\},</math>\nwhere {{math|''a''}} is a point of {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''V''}} a linear subspace of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>.\n\nThe linear subspace associated with an affine subspace is often called its ''{{visible anchor|direction}}'', and two subspaces that share the same direction are said to be ''parallel''.\n\nThis implies the following generalization of  [[Playfair's axiom]]: Given a direction {{math|''V''}}, for any point {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''A''}} there is one and only one affine subspace of direction {{math|''V''}}, which passes through {{math|''a''}}, namely the subspace {{math|''a'' + ''V''}}.\n\nEvery translation <math>A \\to A: a \\mapsto a + v</math> maps any affine subspace to a parallel subspace.\n\nThe term ''parallel'' is also used for two affine subspaces such that the direction of one is included in the direction of the other.\n\n== Affine map ==\nGiven two affine spaces {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} whose associated vector spaces are <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> and <math>\\overrightarrow{B}</math>, an ''affine map'' or ''affine homomorphism'' from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''B''}} is a map\n: <math>f: A \\to B</math>\nsuch that\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\overrightarrow{f}: \\overrightarrow{A} &\\to \\overrightarrow{B}\\\\\n                                   b - a &\\mapsto f(b) - f(a)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nis a well defined linear map. By <math>f</math> being well defined is meant that {{math|1=''b'' \u2013 ''a'' = ''d'' \u2013 ''c''}} implies  {{math|1=''f''(''b'') \u2013 ''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''d'') \u2013 ''f''(''c'')}}.\n\nThis implies that, for a point <math>a \\in A</math> and a vector <math>v \\in \\overrightarrow{A}</math>, one has\n: <math>f(a + v) = f(a) + \\overrightarrow{f}(v).</math>\n\nTherefore, since for any given {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|A}}, {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''v''}} for a unique {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''f''}} is completely defined by its value on a single point and the associated linear map <math>\\overrightarrow{f}</math>.\n\n== Vector spaces as affine spaces ==\nEvery vector space {{math|''V''}} may be considered as an affine space over itself. This means that every element of {{math|''V''}} may be considered either as a point or as a vector. This affine space is sometimes denoted {{math|(''V'', ''V'')}} for emphasizing the double role of the elements of {{math|''V''}}. When considered as a point, the [[zero vector]] is commonly denoted {{math|''o''}} (or {{math|''O''}}, when upper-case letters are used for points) and called the ''origin''.\n\nIf {{math|''A''}} is another affine space over the same vector space (that is <math>V = \\overrightarrow{A}</math>) the choice of any point {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''A''}} defines a unique affine isomorphism, which is the identity of {{math|''V''}} and maps {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''o''}}. In other words, the choice of an origin {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''A''}} allows us to identify {{math|''A''}} and {{math|(''V'', ''V'')}} [[up to]] a [[canonical isomorphism]]. The counterpart of this property is that the affine space {{math|''A''}} may be identified with the vector space {{math|''V''}} in which \"the place of the origin has been forgotten\".\n\n== Relation to Euclidean spaces ==\n=== Definition of Euclidean spaces ===\n[[Euclidean spaces]] (including the one-dimensional line, two-dimensional plane, and three-dimensional space commonly studied in elementary geometry, as well as higher-dimensional analogues) are affine spaces.\n\nIndeed, in most modern definitions, a Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space, such that the associated vector space is a real [[inner product space]] of finite dimension, that is a vector space over the reals with a [[positive-definite quadratic form]] {{math|''q''(''x'')}}. The inner product of two vectors {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is the value of the [[symmetric bilinear form]]\n: <math>x.y = \\frac 12 (q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y)).</math>\nThe usual [[Euclidean distance]] between two points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is \n: <math>d(A, B) = \\sqrt{q(B - A)}.</math>\n\nIn older definition of Euclidean spaces through [[synthetic geometry]], vectors are defined as [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair]]s of points under [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]] (the pairs {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}} and {{math|(''C'', ''D'')}} are ''equipollent'' if the points {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''D'', ''C''}} (in this order) form a [[parallelogram]]). It is straightforward to verify that the vectors form a vector space, the square of the [[Euclidean distance]] is a quadratic form on the space of vectors, and the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent.\n\n=== Affine properties ===\nIn [[Euclidean geometry]], the common phrase \"'''affine property'''\" refers to a property that can be proved in affine spaces, that is, it can be proved without using the quadratic form and its associated inner product. In other words, an affine property is a property that does not involve lengths and angles. Typical examples are [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]], and the definition of a [[tangent]]. A non-example is the definition of a [[normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\nEquivalently, an affine property is a property that is invariant under [[affine transformation]]s of the Euclidean space.\n\n== Affine combinations and barycenter ==\nLet {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} be a collection of {{math|''n''}} points in an affine space, and <math>\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n</math> be {{math|''n''}} elements of the ground field. \n\nSuppose that <math>\\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 0</math>. For any two points {{math|''o''}} and {{math|''o' ''}} one has\n: <math>\\lambda_1 \\overrightarrow{oa_1} + \\dots + \\lambda_n \\overrightarrow{oa_n} = \\lambda_1 \\overrightarrow{o'a_1} + \\dots + \\lambda_n \\overrightarrow{o'a_n}.</math>\nThus this sum is independent of the choice of the origin, and the resulting vector may be denoted\n: <math>\\lambda_1 a_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n a_n .</math>\n\nWhen <math>n = 2, \\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = -1</math>, one retrieves the definition of the subtraction of points.\n\nNow suppose instead that the field elements satisfy <math>\\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1</math>. For some choice of an origin {{math|''o''}}, denote by <math>g</math> the unique point such that\n: <math>\\lambda_1 \\overrightarrow{oa_1} + \\dots + \\lambda_n \\overrightarrow{oa_n} = \\overrightarrow{og}.</math>\nOne can show that <math>g</math> is independent from the choice of {{math|''o''}}. Therefore, if\n: <math>\\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1,</math>\none may write\n: <math>g = \\lambda_1 a_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n a_n.</math>\nThe point <math>g</math> is called the '''[[centroid|barycenter]]''' of the <math>a_i</math> for the weights <math>\\lambda_i</math>. One says also that <math>g</math> is an '''[[affine combination]]''' of the <math>a_i</math> with coefficients <math>\\lambda_i</math>.\n\n== Examples ==\n* When children find the answers to sums such as 4 + 3 or 4 &minus; 2 by counting right or left on a [[number line]], they are treating the number line as a one-dimensional affine space.\n* Any [[coset]] of a subspace {{mvar|V}} of a vector space is an affine space over that subspace.\n* If {{mvar|T}} is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{math|'''b'''}} lies in its [[column space]], the set of solutions of the equation {{math|1=''T''\u2009'''x''' = '''b'''}} is an affine space over the subspace of solutions of {{math|1=''T''\u2009'''x''' = 0}}.\n* The solutions of an inhomogeneous linear differential equation form an affine space over the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous linear equation.\n* Generalizing all of the above, if {{math|''T''\u2009: ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is a linear mapping and {{math|'''y'''}} lies in its image, the set of solutions {{math|'''x''' \u2208 ''V''}} to the equation {{math|1=''T''\u2009'''x''' = '''y'''}} is a coset of the kernel of {{mvar|T\u2009}}, and is therefore an affine space over {{math|Ker\u2009''T''\u2009}}.\n* The space of (linear) complementary subspaces of a vector subspace ''V'' in a vector space ''W'' is an affine space, over Hom(''W''/''V'',''V''). That is, if <math>0 \\to V \\to W \\to X \\to 0</math> is a [[short exact sequence]] of vector spaces, then the space of all [[split exact sequence|splittings]] of the exact sequence naturally carries the structure of an affine space over Hom(''X'',''V'').\n\n== Affine span and bases==\nFor any subset {{math|''X''}} of an affine space {{math|''A''}}, there is a smallest affine subspace that contains it, called the '''affine span''' of {{math|''X''}}. It is the intersection of all affine subspaces containing {{math|''X''}}, and its direction is the intersection of the directions of the affine subspaces that contain {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe affine span of {{math|''X''}} is the set of all (finite) affine combinations of points of {{math|''X''}}, and its direction is the [[linear span]] of the {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}} for {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''X''}}. If one chooses a particular point {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, the direction of the affine span of {{math|''X''}} is also the linear span of the {{math|''x'' \u2013 ''x''<sub>0</sub>}} for {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}}.\n\nOne says also that the affine span of {{math|''X''}} is '''generated''' by {{math|''X''}} and that {{math|''X''}} is a '''generating set''' of its affine span.\n\nA set {{math|''X''}} of points of an affine space is said to be '''affinely independent''' or, simply, '''independent''', if the affine span of any [[strict subset]] of {{math|''X''}} is a strict subset of the affine span of {{math|''X''}}. An '''{{visible anchor|affine basis}}''' or '''barycentric frame''' (see {{slink||Barycentric coordinates}}, below) of an affine space is a generating set that is also independent (that is a minimal generating set).\n\nRecall the ''dimension'' of an affine space is the dimension of its associated vector space. The bases of an affine space of finite dimension {{math|''n''}} are the independent subsets of {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements, or, equivalently, the generating subsets of {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. Equivalently, {{math|{''x''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}} is an affine basis of an affine space if and only if {{math|{''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}} is a [[linear basis]] of the associated vector space.\n\n== Coordinates==\nThere are two strongly related kinds of [[coordinate system]]s that may be defined on affine spaces.\n\n=== Barycentric coordinates ===\nLet {{math|''A''}} be an affine space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}} of dimension {{math|''n''}}, and <math>\\{x_0, \\dots, x_n\\}</math> be an affine basis of {{math|''A''}}. The properties of an affine basis imply that for every {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''A''}} there is a unique {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-[[tuple]] <math>(\\lambda_0, \\dots, \\lambda_n)</math> of elements of {{math|''k''}} such that\n: <math>\\lambda_0 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1</math>\nand\n: <math>x = \\lambda_0 x_0 + \\dots + \\lambda_n x_n.</math>\n\nThe <math>\\lambda_i</math> are called the '''barycentric coordinates''' of {{math|''x''}} over the affine basis <math>\\{x_0, \\dots, x_n\\}</math>. If the {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} are viewed as bodies that have weights  (or masses) <math>\\lambda_i</math>, the point {{math|''x''}} is thus the [[Centroid|barycenter]] of the {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}}, and this explains the origin of the term ''barycentric coordinates''.\n\nThe barycentric coordinates define an affine isomorphism between the affine space {{math|''A''}} and the affine subspace of {{math|''k''<sup>''n'' + 1</sup>}} defined by the equation <math>\\lambda_0 + \\dots + \\lambda_n = 1</math>.\n\nFor affine spaces of infinite dimension, the same definition applies, using only finite sums. This means that for each point, only a finite number of coordinates are non-zero.\n\n=== Affine coordinates ===\nAn '''affine frame''' of an affine space consists of a point, called the ''origin'', and a [[linear basis]] of the associated vector space. More precisely, for an affine space {{math|''A''}} with associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math>, the origin {{math|''o''}} belongs to {{math|''A''}}, and the linear basis is a basis {{math|(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} of <math>\\overrightarrow{A}</math> (for simplicity of the notation, we consider only the case of finite dimension, the general case is similar).\n\nFor each point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''A''}}, there is a unique sequence <math>\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n</math> of elements of the ground field such that\n: <math>p = o + \\lambda_1 v_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n v_n,</math>\nor equivalently\n: <math>\\overrightarrow{op} = \\lambda_1 v_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n v_n.</math>\n\nThe <math>\\lambda_i</math> are called the '''affine coordinates''' of {{math|''p''}} over the affine frame {{math|(''o'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}.\n\n'''Example:''' In [[Euclidean geometry]], [[Cartesian coordinates]] are affine coordinates relative to an '''orthonormal frame''', that is an affine frame {{math|(''o'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} such that {{math|(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} is an [[orthonormal basis]].\n\n=== Relationship between barycentric and affine coordinates ===\nBarycentric coordinates and affine coordinates are strongly related, and may be considered as equivalent.\n\nIn fact, given a barycentric frame\n: <math>(x_0, \\dots, x_n),</math>\none deduces immediately the affine frame\n: <math>(x_0, \\overrightarrow{x_0 x_1}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{x_0 x_n}) = \\left(x_0, x_1 - x_0, \\dots, x_n - x_0\\right),</math>\nand, if\n: <math>\\left(\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right)</math>\nare the barycentric coordinates of a point over the barycentric frame, then the affine coordinates of the same point over the affine frame are\n: <math>\\left(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right).</math>\n\nConversely, if\n: <math>\\left(o, v_1, \\dots, v_n\\right)</math>\nis an affine frame, then\n: <math>\\left(o, o + v_1, \\dots, o + v_n\\right)</math>\nis a barycentric frame. If\n: <math>\\left(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right)</math>\nare the affine coordinates of a point over the affine frame, then its barycentric coordinates over the barycentric frame are\n: <math>\\left(1 - \\lambda_1 - \\dots - \\lambda_n, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\right).</math>\n\nTherefore, barycentric and affine coordinates are almost equivalent. In most applications, affine coordinates are preferred, as involving less coordinates that are independent. However, in the situations where the important points of the studied problem are affinity independent, barycentric coordinates may lead to simpler computation, as in the following example.\n\n==== Example of the triangle ====\nThe vertices of a non-flat [[triangle]] form an affine basis of the [[Euclidean plane]]. The barycentric coordinates allows easy characterization of the elements of the triangle that do not involve angles or distance:\n\nThe vertices are the points of barycentric coordinates {{math|(1, 0, 0)}},  {{math|(0, 1, 0)}} and  {{math|(0, 0, 1)}}. The lines supporting the edges are the points that have a zero coordinate. The edges themselves are the points that have a zero coordinate and two nonnegative coordinates. The interior of the triangle are the points whose all coordinates are positive. The [[median (geometry)|medians]] are the points that have two equal coordinates, and the [[centroid]] is the point of coordinates {{math|({{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|1|3}})}}.\n\n=== Change of coordinates ===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\n\n==== Case of affine coordinates ====\n\n==== Case of barycentric coordinates ====\n\n== Properties of affine homomorphisms ==\n\n===Matrix representation===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Image and fibers===\nLet\n: <math>f \\colon E \\to F</math>\nbe an affine homomorphism, with\n: <math>\\overrightarrow {f} \\colon \\overrightarrow{E} \\to \\overrightarrow{F}</math>\nas associated linear map.\n\nThe '''image''' of {{math|''f''}} is the affine subspace {{math|''f''(E)}} of  {{mvar|F}}, which has <math>\\overrightarrow{f} \\left(\\overrightarrow{E}\\right)</math> as associated vector space. As an affine space does not have a [[zero element]], an affine homomorphism does not have a [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. However, for any point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''f''(''E'')}}, the [[inverse image]] {{math|''f''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''x'')}} of {{math|''x''}} is an affine subspace of {{math|''E''}}, of direction <math>\\overrightarrow{f}^{-1} \\left(\\overrightarrow{F}\\right)</math>. This affine subspace is called the '''fiber''' of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Projection===\n{{see also|Projection (mathematics)}}\nAn important example is the projection parallel to some direction onto an affine subspace. The importance of this example lies in the fact that [[Euclidean space]]s are affine spaces, and that this kind of projections is fundamental in [[Euclidean geometry]].\n\nMore precisely, given an affine space {{math|''E''}} with associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math>, let {{math|''F''}} be an affine subspace of direction <math>\\overrightarrow{F}</math>, and {{math|''D''}} be a [[complementary subspace]] of <math>\\overrightarrow{F}</math> in <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math> (this means that every vector of <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math> may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of an element of <math>\\overrightarrow{F}</math> and an element of {{math|''D''}}). For every point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''E''}}, its '''projection''' to {{math|''F''}} parallel to {{math|''D''}} is the unique point {{math|''p''(''x'')}} in {{math|''F''}} such that\n: <math>p(x) - x \\in D.</math>\n\nThis is an affine homomorphism whose associated linear map <math>\\overrightarrow{p}</math> is defined by\n: <math>\\overrightarrow{p}(x - y) = p(x) - p(y),</math>\nfor {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|E}}.\n\nThe image of this projection is  {{math|''F''}}, and its fibers are the subspaces of direction  {{math|''D''}}.\n\n=== Quotient space ===\nAlthough kernels are not defined for affine spaces, quotient spaces are defined. This results from the fact that \"belonging to the same fiber of an affine homomorphism\" is an equivalence relation.\n\nLet  {{math|''E''}} be an affine space, and  {{math|''D''}} be a [[linear subspace]] of the associated vector space <math>\\overrightarrow{E}</math>. The '''quotient'''  {{math|''E''/''D''}} of  {{math|''E''}} by  {{math|''D''}} is the [[quotient by an equivalence relation|quotient]] of  {{math|''E''}} by the [[equivalence relation]]\n: <math>x - y \\in D.</math>\n\nThis quotient is an affine space, which has <math>\\overrightarrow{E}/D</math> as associated vector space.\n\nFor every affine homomorphism <math>E \\to F</math>, the image is isomorphic to the quotient of  {{math|''E''}} by the kernel of the associated linear map. This is the [[first isomorphism theorem]] for affine spaces.\n\n== Affine transformation ==\n{{main|Affine transformation|Affine group}}\n{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Axioms ==\nAffine space is usually studied as [[analytic geometry]] using coordinates, or equivalently vector spaces. It can also be studied as [[synthetic geometry]] by writing down axioms, though this approach is much less common. There are several different systems of axioms for affine space.\n\n{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1969|p=192}} axiomatizes affine geometry (over the reals) as [[ordered geometry]] together with an affine form of [[Desargues's theorem]] and an axiom stating that in a plane there is at most one line through a given point not meeting a given line.\n\nAffine planes satisfy the following axioms {{harv|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 2}}:\n(in which two lines are called parallel if they are equal or\ndisjoint):\n* Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.\n* Given a point  and line  there is a unique line which contains the point and is parallel to the line\n* There exist three non-collinear points.\nAs well as affine planes over fields (or [[division ring]]s), there are also many [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s satisfying these axioms. {{harv|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 3}} gives axioms for higher-dimensional affine spaces.\n\n== Relation to projective spaces ==\n[[File:Affine space, projective space, vector space.svg|thumb|An affine space is a subspace of a projective space, which is in turn the quotient of a vector space by an equivalence relation (not by a linear subspace)]]\nAffine spaces are subspaces of [[projective space]]s: an affine plane can be obtained from any [[projective plane]] by removing a line and all the points on it, and conversely any affine plane can be used to construct a projective plane as a [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] by adding a [[line at infinity]] whose points correspond to equivalence classes of [[parallel lines]].\n\nFurther, transformations of projective space that preserve affine space (equivalently, that leave the [[hyperplane at infinity]] [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|invariant as a set]]) yield transformations of affine space. Conversely, any affine linear transformation extends uniquely to a projective linear transformation, so the [[affine group]] is a [[subgroup]] of the [[projective group]]. For instance, [[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s (transformations of the complex projective line, or [[Riemann sphere]]) are affine (transformations of the complex plane) if and only if they fix the [[point at infinity]].\n\n== Affine algebraic geometry ==\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], an [[affine variety]] (or, more generally, an [[affine algebraic set]]) is defined as the subset of an affine space that is the set of the common zeros of a set of so-called ''polynomial functions over the affine space''. For defining a ''polynomial function over the affine space'', one has to choose an [[affine frame]]. Then, a polynomial function is a function such that the image of any point is the value of some multivariate [[polynomial function]] of the coordinates of the point. As a change of affine coordinates may be expressed by [[linear function]]s (more precisely affine functions) of the coordinates, this definition is independent of a particular choice of coordinates.\n\nThe choice of a system of affine coordinates for an affine space <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> of dimension {{math|''n''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}} induces an affine [[isomorphism]] between <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> and the affine [[coordinate space]] {{math|''k''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. This explains why, for simplification, many textbooks write <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n = k^n</math>, and introduce affine algebraic varieties as the common zeros of polynomial functions over {{math|''k''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|loc=Ch. I, \u00a7 1.}}</ref>\n\nAs the whole affine space is the set of the common zeros of the [[zero polynomial]], affine spaces are affine algebraic varieties.\n\n=== Ring of polynomial functions ===\nBy the definition above, the choice of an affine frame of an affine space <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> allows one to identify the polynomial functions on <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> with polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables, the ''i''th variable representing the function that maps a point to its {{math|''i''}}th coordinate. It follows that the set of polynomial functions over <math>\\mathbb{A}_k^n</math> is a [[algebra over a field|{{math|''k''}}-algebra]], denoted <math>k\\left[\\mathbb{A}_k^n\\right]</math>, which is isomorphic to the [[polynomial ring]] <math>k\\left[X_1, \\dots, X_n\\right]</math>.\n\nWhen one changes coordinates, the isomorphism between <math>k\\left[\\mathbb{A}_k^n\\right]</math> and <math>k[X_1, \\dots, X_n]</math> changes accordingly, and this induces an automorphism of <math>k\\left[X_1, \\dots, X_n\\right]</math>, which maps each indeterminate to a polynomial of degree one. It follows that the [[total degree]] defines a [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] of <math>k\\left[\\mathbb A_k^n\\right]</math>, which is independent from the choice of coordinates. The total degree defines also a [[graded ring|graduation]], but it depends on the choice of coordinates, as a change of affine coordinates may map indeterminates on non-[[homogeneous polynomial]]s.\n\n=== Zariski topology ===\n{{see also|Zariski topology}}\nAffine spaces over [[topological field]]s, such as the real or the complex numbers, have a natural [[topology (structure)|topology]]. The Zariski topology, which is defined for affine spaces over any field, allows use of topological methods in any case. Zariski topology is the unique topology on an affine space whose [[closed sets]] are [[affine algebraic set]]s (that is sets of the common zeros of polynomials functions over the affine set). As, over a topological field, polynomial functions are continuous, every Zariski closed set is closed for the usual topology, if any. In other words, over a topological field, Zariski topology is [[coarser topology|coarser]] than the natural topology.\n\nThere is a natural injective function from an affine space into the set of [[prime ideal]]s (that is the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]]) of its ring of polynomial functions. When affine coordinates have been chosen, this function maps the point of coordinates <math>\\left(a_1, \\dots, a_n\\right)</math> to the [[maximal ideal]] <math>\\left\\langle X_1 - a_1, \\dots, X_n - a_n\\right\\rangle</math>. This function is a [[homeomorphism]] (for the Zariski topology of the affine space and of the spectrum of the ring of polynomial functions) of the affine space onto the image of the function.\n\nThe case of an [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed ground field]] is especially important in algebraic geometry, because, in this case, the homeomorphism above is a map between the affine space and the set of all maximal ideals of the ring of functions (this is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]).\n\nThis is the starting idea of [[scheme theory]] of [[Grothendieck]], which consists, for studying algebraic varieties, of considering as \"points\", not only the points of the affine space, but also all the prime ideals of the spectrum. This allows gluing together algebraic varieties in a similar way as, for [[manifold]]s, [[chart (topology)|charts]] are glued together for building a manifold.\n\n=== Cohomology ===\nLike all affine varieties, local data on an affine space can always be patched together globally: the [[cohomology]] of affine space is trivial. More precisely, <math>H^i\\left(\\mathbb{A}_k^n,\\mathbf{F}\\right) = 0</math> for all coherent sheaves '''F''', and integers <math>i > 0</math>. This property is also enjoyed by all other [[affine variety|affine varieties]]. But also all of the [[etale cohomology]] groups on affine space are trivial. In particular, every [[line bundle]] is trivial. More generally, the [[Quillen\u2013Suslin theorem]] implies that ''every'' algebraic [[vector bundle]] over an affine space is trivial.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Space (mathematics)]]\n* [[Affine geometry]]\n* [[Affine group]]\n* [[Affine transformation]]\n* [[Affine variety]]\n* [[Affine hull]]\n* [[Heap (mathematics)]]\n* [[Equipollence (geometry)]]\n* [[Interval measurement]], an affine observable in [[statistics]]\n* [[Exotic affine space]]\n* [[Complex affine space]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation|author=Berger, Marcel|chapter=Affine spaces|title=Problems in Geometry|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1984|isbn=978-0-387-90971-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXRppKJwpaAC&pg=PA11}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Berger | first1=Marcel | author1-link=Marcel Berger | title=Geometry I | publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | isbn= 3-540-11658-3 | year=1987}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Cameron | first1=Peter J. | authorlink=Peter Cameron (mathematician) | title=Projective and polar spaces | url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/pps/ | publisher=Queen Mary and Westfield College School of Mathematical Sciences | location=London | series=QMW Maths Notes | mr=1153019 | year=1991 | volume=13}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Coxeter | first1=Harold Scott MacDonald | author1-link=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | title=Introduction to Geometry | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-471-50458-0 | year=1969 | mr=123930}}\n* {{eom|id=A/a011100|authorlink= Dolgachev|first=I.V.|last= Dolgachev|first2=A.P. |last2=Shirokov}}\n* {{citation | last1=Snapper|first1=Ernst|last2=Troyer|first2=Robert J. | title = Metric Affine Geometry | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1989|edition=Dover edition, first published in 1989|isbn=0-486-66108-3}}\n* {{citation|last1=Nomizu|first1=K.|last2=Sasaki|first2=S.|title=Affine Differential Geometry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|edition=New|isbn=978-0-521-44177-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/affinedifferenti0000nomi}}\n* {{Citation|author=Tarrida, Agusti R.|chapter=Affine spaces|title=Affine Maps, Euclidean Motions and Quadrics|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-0-85729-709-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZvxUBzraGAC&pg=PA1}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Affine Space}}\n[[Category:Affine geometry]]\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n", "name_user": "99.127.27.9", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eInformal description)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space"}
