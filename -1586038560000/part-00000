The twins suggest to Leah that they take it to Princess Ula, the Ruler of Rainbow Zahramay who is responsible for making Genie Gems. They travel to Ula's Palace. They encounter a mermaid who they discover is actually Ula in the form of a Mermaid. After showing her the Kalliope Crystal, Ula shows them her workshop where she makes Genie Gems. She demonstrates how a Kaliope Crystal is turned into a Genie Gem, by using one over her Kaliope Crystals breaking it apart to create a blank gem and then imbue it with the power of Music to create a Music Gem. She then offers to let the girls create their own gem using the crystal they found. Leah wants to create a Flight Gem, while Shine wants to create a Speedy Gem, and Shimmer wants to create a gem that makes things bright and shiny. Ula however explains that they can only add on magic power to the gem. Though the girls think they are in agreement they end up imbuing different powers into the gem which results in an unstable Chaos Gem, which randomly produces the magic it is imbued with causing havoc. However Ula explains she can turn it back into a blank gem, though they need to put it on her gem pedestal to remove the magic before it becomes a Chaos Gem permanently. They chase it through the palace, but it goes into the water and the girls reveal that they could get it if they had their Genie Gem, causing Ula to show them her Divina Gem which possesses the power of all the gems Ula created including the Mermaid Gem, allowing them to transform into Mermaids to chase after it. They follow it back to Ula's workshop, where it causes Leah and objects to levitate. Eventually Shine manages to catch the Chaos Gem and Ula uses her staff to remove its magic, turning it back into a blank gem. The girls try again and decide to create a Rainbow Gem which has all the powers they wanted as it allows them to create rainbows to ride on.  \n*'''Genie Gems:''' This episode introduces how Genie Gems are created from Kaliope Crystals which are crystals used to create Blank Gems which are then imbued with magic using Ula's staff and gem pedestal to create Genie Gems. Several different gems are introduced:  Blank Gems which are gems that have not yet been imbued with magic, Music Gem which is imbued with the power of music, Chaos Gems which are unstable gems created by imbuing a gem with separate powers (such as the Chaos Gem created by the girls which had the power of Flight, Speed, and Color Changing), the Divina Gem which is a gem created by Ula that contains the power of all the gems she has created and is implied to be the one of the most powerful genie gem that exists, and the Rainbow Gem created by the girls which has the power to create rainbows which the girls can ride on using rainbow boards. The Mermaid Gem is also mentioned to have been created by Ula as the Divina Gem possesses its power, allowing Ula to use it in the same manner as the Mermaid Gem and is implied to be how Ula transformed into her mermaid form that the girls first encounter her in.\n| LineColor       = 37B700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 50\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Dance Magic\n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = Carin-Anne Anderson & Enrico Vilbar Santana\n| WrittenBy       = Dustin Ferrer\n| Aux2            = Kate Brusk & Lee-Roy Lahey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n| AltDate         = February 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|title=2018-02-04 on Treehouse TV|work=treehousetv.com|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180202211448/http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|archive-date=February 2, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| ProdCode        = 308\n| Viewers         = 0.88<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-17-2017.html|title=UPDATED:  SHOWBUZZDAILY\u2019s Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 11.17.2017 - Showbuzz Daily|author=|date=|website=www.showbuzzdaily.com|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Princess Samira and the girls travel to Rainbow Zahramay so Samira can introduce them to the Dance Magic Instructor, Sarah so they can learn some Dance Magic.

After granting Zeta's final wish, Leah reverts back to a normal human losing her ability to grant wishes and fly.

They encounter a mermaid who they discover is actually Ula in the form of a Mermaid. After showing her the Kalliope Crystal, Ula shows them her workshop where she makes Genie Gems. She demonstrates how a Kaliope Crystal is turned into a Genie Gem, by using one over her Kaliope Crystals breaking it apart to create a blank gem and then imbue it with the power of Music to create a Music Gem. She then offers to let the girls create their own gem using the crystal they found.

The Mermaid Gem is also mentioned to have been created by Ula as the Divina Gem possesses its power, allowing Ula to use it in the same manner as the Mermaid Gem and is implied to be how Ula transformed into her mermaid form that the girls first encounter her in.\n| LineColor       = 37B700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 50\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Dance Magic\n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = Carin-Anne Anderson & Enrico Vilbar Santana\n| WrittenBy       = Dustin Ferrer\n| Aux2            = Kate Brusk & Lee-Roy Lahey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n| AltDate         = February 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|title=2018-02-04 on Treehouse TV|work=treehousetv.com|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180202211448/http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|archive-date=February 2, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| ProdCode        = 308\n| Viewers         = 0.88<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-17-2017.html|title=UPDATED:  SHOWBUZZDAILY\u2019s Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 11.17.2017 - Showbuzz Daily|author=|date=|website=www.showbuzzdaily.com|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Princess Samira and the girls travel to Rainbow Zahramay so Samira can introduce them to the Dance Magic Instructor, Sarah so they can learn some Dance Magic.

Samira then shows them the wish room which contains wish magic which Samira uses to create wish items for Leah and Zac's world. When a bunch of wish ladybugs, Samira leaves to chase after them with other genies in the room leaving Zac and the girls to explore the wish room, though she warns them not to make any wishes as the magic in the room will cause any wish to be granted over and over. The girls and Zac have fun in the room, until Zac remembers he is still hungry and accidentally wishes he had a Zazzle berry causing large Zazzle berries to start filling the room. Samira returns and attempts to stop the wish using her staff but it gets caught in one of the Zazzle berries. The girls suggest they use the Caliana Crystal to soak up the wish magic and return to the library, while Zac and Samira try to recover Samira's staff. However Shimmer opens one of the magic books which unleashes a powerful gust of wind that creates a huge mess. They manage to close the book but have to search for the crystal in the mess.

In his ''Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum'',<ref>LEIBNIZ, Gottfried Wilhelm: Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum. 1710. https://edoc.bbaw.de/files/956/Leibniz_Brevis.pdf</ref> written in 1710, he originates every human language from one common ancestor language. Over time, this ancestor language split into two families: the Japhetic and the Aramaic. The Japhetic family split even further, into Scythian and Celtic branches. The members of the [[Scythian]] family were: the Greek language, the family of Sarmato-Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, Dalmatian, Bulgar, Slovene, Avar and Khazar), the family of Turkic languages (Turkish, [[Cumans|Cuman]], Kalmyk and Mongolian), the family of Finnic languages (Finnish, Saami, Hungarian, Estonian, Liv and Samoyed). Although his theory and grouping were far from perfect, it had a tremendous effect on the development of linguistic research, especially in German speaking countries.\n\nPan-Turanianism has its roots in the Finnish nationalist Fennophile and [[Fennoman movement]], and in the works of linguist [[Matthias Castr\u00e9n|Matthias Alexander Castr\u00e9n]]. The concept spread from here{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} to the kindred peoples of the Finns.\n\n[[File:\u00c1zsia \u00e9s Eur\u00f3pa nyelvei nyelvtani alapeveik szerint elrendezve Friedrich Max M\u00fcller 1854-ben kiadott Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages c\u00edm\u0171 munk\u00e1j\u00e1ban.png|thumb|180px|The languages of Asia and Europe arranged according to their grammatical principles in Max M\u00fcller's ''Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages'', published in 1854]]\n[[Friedrich Max M\u00fcller]], the German Orientalist and philologist, published and proposed a new grouping of the non-Aryan and non-Semitic Asian languages in 1855.

Castr\u00e9n conducted more than seven years of fieldwork in western and southern Siberia between 1841 and 1849. His extensive field materials focus on Ob-Ugric, Samoyedic, Ketic, and Turkic languages. He collected valuable ethnographic information, especially on shamanism. Based on his research, he claimed that the Finnic, Ugric, Samoyed, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic languages were all of the same 'Altaic family'. He concluded that the [[Finns]] originated in [[Central Asia]] (in the [[Altai Mountains]]), and far from being a small, isolated people, they were part of a larger polity that included such peoples as the [[Hungarians|Magyars]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], and so on. Based on his researches, he championed the ideology of pan-Turanism, the belief in the racial unity and the future greatness of the Ural-Altaic peoples. The concept spread from here to the kindred peoples of the Finns. As Castr\u00e9n put it:\n\n{{cquote|I am determined to show the Finnish nation that we are not a solitary people from the bog, living in isolation from the world and from universal history, but are in fact related to at least one-sixth of mankind.

This tradition was preserved in medieval chronicles (such as [[Gesta Hungarorum]]<ref>Anonymus: Gesta Hungarorum. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02245/02245.htm</ref> and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]],<ref>K\u00e9zai Simon mester Magyar kr\u00f3nik\u00e1ja. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02249/02249.htm</ref> and the [[Chronicon Pictum]]) as early as the 13th century. This tradition served as the starting point for the scientific research about  the ethnogenesis of the [[Hungarians|Hungarian people]], which began in the 18th century, both in [[Hungary]] and abroad. [[S\u00e1ndor K\u0151r\u00f6si Csoma]] (the writer of the first Tibetan-English dictionary) traveled to Asia in the strong belief that he could find the kindred of the Magyars in [[Turkestan]], amongst the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]].<ref name=\"mek.oszk.hu\">Magyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikon. http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/index.html</ref> As a scientific movement, Turanism was concerned with the research about Asia and its culture in the context of Hungarian history and culture. Political Turanism was born in the 19th century, in response to the growing influence of [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]], which were seen by Hungarians as very dangerous to the state and nation of Hungary because the country had large ethnic German and Slavic populations.<ref name=\"Farkas\"/> Political Turanism was a romantic nationalist movement, which accentuated the importance of the common ancestry and the cultural affinity of the Hungarians with the peoples of the Caucasus, Inner and Central Asia, like the Turks, Mongols, Parsi and the like, and called for closer collaboration and political alliance with them, as a means to secure and further shared interests, and counter the imminent threats posed by the policies of Western powers like Germany, the British Empire, France and Russia.\n\nThe idea of a Hungarian Oriental Institute originated with Jen\u0151 Zichy.<ref>VINCZE Zolt\u00e1n: L\u00e9tay Bal\u00e1zs, a magyar asszirol\u00f3gia legszebb rem\u00e9nye\nhttp://www.muvelodes.ro/index.php/Cikk?id=155</ref> This idea did not come true. Instead, a kind of lyceum was formed in 1910, called ''Tur\u00e1ni T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g'' (Hungarian Turan Society, also called Hungarian Asiatic Society). The Turan society concentrated on Turan as geographic location where the ancestors of Hungarians might have lived.\n\nThe movement received impetus after Hungary's defeat in World War I. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (1920), the new Hungarian state constituted only 32.7% of the territory of historic, pre-treaty Hungary, and it lost 58.4% of its total population. More than 3.2 million ethnic Hungarians (one-third of all Hungarians) resided outside the new boundaries of Hungary in the successor states under oppressive conditions.<ref>PORTIK Erzs\u00e9bet-Edit: Erd\u00e9lyi magyar kisebbs\u00e9gi sorsk\u00e9rd\u00e9sek a k\u00e9t vil\u00e1gh\u00e1bor\u00fa k\u00f6z\u00f6tt.

Under these circumstances, no Hungarian government could survive without seeking justice for both the Magyars and Hungary. Reuniting the Magyars became a crucial point in public life and on the political agenda. Outrage led many to reject Europe and turn towards the East in search of new friends and allies in a bid to revise the unjust terms of the treaty and restore the integrity of Hungary.\n\n{{cquote|Disappointment towards Europe caused by 'the betrayal of the West in Trianon', and the pessimistic feeling of loneliness, led different strata in society towards Turanism.

All Turanist organisations were disbanded by the government, and the majority of Turanist publications was banned and confiscated. In 1948, Hungary was converted into a communist one-party state. Turanism was portrayed and vilified as an exclusively fascist ideology although Turanism's role in the interwar development of far-right ideologies was negligible.<ref>\"While Turanism was and remained little more than a fringe ideology of the Right, the second orientation of the national socialists, pan-Europaism, had a number of adherents, and was adopted as the platform of several national socialist groups.\" JANOS, Andrew C.: ''The Politics of Backwardness in Hungary'', 1825-1945. 1982. p.275.</ref> The official prohibition lasted until the collapse of the socialist regime in 1989.\n\n=== Turkey ===\nTraditional history cites its early origins amongst Ottoman officers and intelligentsia studying and residing in 1870s [[Imperial Germany]].

At the time, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[British Empire|British]] empires were antagonists in the so-called \"[[Great Game]]\" to cultivate influence in Persia and [[Central Asia]] (Turkestan).

Japanese Turanists claimed that Japanese have an Inner Asian descent, and the progenitors of the Japanese people migrated from Central Asia to conquer the Japanese islands. Kitagawa Shikaz\u014d (1886\u20131943) asserted that the Japanese had descended from the Tungusic branch of the Turanian family, just like the Koreans and Manchus, whose origin had been in north-east China, Manchuria. And, since Japanese, Koreans and Manchus derived from a Tungusic origin, they also had a bond with other Turanian sub-ethnicities like Turks, Mongols, Samoyeds and Finno-Ugrians in terms of blood, language and culture.<ref name=\"Sinan Levent\"/> The first-ever Japanese Turanist organization, the Turanian National Alliance \u2013 ''Tsuran Minzoku Domei'' (\u30c4\u30e9\u30f3\u6c11\u65cf\u540c\u76df), was established in Tokyo in 1921, by Juichiro Imaoka  (1888\u20131973) and the Hungarian Orientalist and ethnographer Benedek Bar\u00e1thosi Balogh (1870\u20131945).<ref name=\"Sinan Levent\"/> Other organisations like the Turanian Society of Japan \u2013 ''Nippon Tsuran Kyoukai'' (early 1930s) and the Japanese-Hungarian Cultural Association \u2013 ''Nikko Bunka Kyoukai'' (1938) were founded too. A pro-Finnish activity was carried in Japan in the interwar period by some Japanese nationalists influenced by Turanism. It found theoretical expression in, for example, a book entitled ''Hann tsuranizumu to keizai burokku'' (''Pan-Turanism and the Economic Bloc''), written by an economist. The writer insists that the Japanese should leave the tragically small Japanese islands and resettle to the northern and western parts of the Asian continent, where their forefathers had once dwelt.

In his ''Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum'',<ref>LEIBNIZ, Gottfried Wilhelm: Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum. 1710. https://edoc.bbaw.de/files/956/Leibniz_Brevis.pdf</ref> written in 1710, he originates every human language from one common ancestor language. Over time, this ancestor language split into two families: the Japhetic and the Aramaic. The Japhetic family split even further, into Scythian and Celtic branches. The members of the [[Scythian]] family were: the Greek language, the family of Sarmato-Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, Dalmatian, Bulgar, Slovene, Avar and Khazar), the family of Turkic languages (Turkish, [[Cumans|Cuman]], Kalmyk and Mongolian), the family of Finnic languages (Finnish, Saami, Hungarian, Estonian, Liv and Samoyed). Although his theory and grouping were far from perfect, it had a tremendous effect on the development of linguistic research, especially in German speaking countries.\n\nPan-Turanianism has its roots in the Finnish nationalist Fennophile and [[Fennoman movement]], and in the works of linguist [[Matthias Castr\u00e9n|Matthias Alexander Castr\u00e9n]]. The concept spread from here{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} to the kindred peoples of the Finns.\n\n[[File:\u00c1zsia \u00e9s Eur\u00f3pa nyelvei nyelvtani alapeveik szerint elrendezve Friedrich Max M\u00fcller 1854-ben kiadott Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages c\u00edm\u0171 munk\u00e1j\u00e1ban.png|thumb|180px|The languages of Asia and Europe arranged according to their grammatical principles in Max M\u00fcller's ''Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages'', published in 1854]]\n[[Friedrich Max M\u00fcller]], the German Orientalist and philologist, published and proposed a new grouping of the non-Aryan and non-Semitic Asian languages in 1855.

M\u00fcller divided this group into two subgroups, the Southern Division, and the Northern Division.<ref>M\u00dcLLER, Friedrich Max. ''The languages of the seat of war in the East.

Nonetheless, his terminology stuck, and the terms 'Turanian peoples' and 'Turanian languages' became parts of common parlance.\n\nLike the term [[Aryan]] is used for Indo-European, Turanian is used chiefly as a linguistic term, synonymous with Ural-Altaic.<ref>M.

Castr\u00e9n conducted more than seven years of fieldwork in western and southern Siberia between 1841 and 1849. His extensive field materials focus on Ob-Ugric, Samoyedic, Ketic, and Turkic languages. He collected valuable ethnographic information, especially on shamanism. Based on his research, he claimed that the Finnic, Ugric, Samoyed, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic languages were all of the same 'Altaic family'. He concluded that the [[Finns]] originated in [[Central Asia]] (in the [[Altai Mountains]]), and far from being a small, isolated people, they were part of a larger polity that included such peoples as the [[Hungarians|Magyars]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], and so on. Based on his researches, he championed the ideology of pan-Turanism, the belief in the racial unity and the future greatness of the Ural-Altaic peoples. The concept spread from here to the kindred peoples of the Finns. As Castr\u00e9n put it:\n\n{{cquote|I am determined to show the Finnish nation that we are not a solitary people from the bog, living in isolation from the world and from universal history, but are in fact related to at least one-sixth of mankind.

This tradition was preserved in medieval chronicles (such as [[Gesta Hungarorum]]<ref>Anonymus: Gesta Hungarorum. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02245/02245.htm</ref> and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]],<ref>K\u00e9zai Simon mester Magyar kr\u00f3nik\u00e1ja. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02249/02249.htm</ref> and the [[Chronicon Pictum]]) as early as the 13th century. This tradition served as the starting point for the scientific research about  the ethnogenesis of the [[Hungarians|Hungarian people]], which began in the 18th century, both in [[Hungary]] and abroad. [[S\u00e1ndor K\u0151r\u00f6si Csoma]] (the writer of the first Tibetan-English dictionary) traveled to Asia in the strong belief that he could find the kindred of the Magyars in [[Turkestan]], amongst the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]].<ref name=\"mek.oszk.hu\">Magyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikon. http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/index.html</ref> As a scientific movement, Turanism was concerned with the research about Asia and its culture in the context of Hungarian history and culture. Political Turanism was born in the 19th century, in response to the growing influence of [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]], which were seen by Hungarians as very dangerous to the state and nation of Hungary because the country had large ethnic German and Slavic populations.<ref name=\"Farkas\"/> Political Turanism was a romantic nationalist movement, which accentuated the importance of the common ancestry and the cultural affinity of the Hungarians with the peoples of the Caucasus, Inner and Central Asia, like the Turks, Mongols, Parsi and the like, and called for closer collaboration and political alliance with them, as a means to secure and further shared interests, and counter the imminent threats posed by the policies of Western powers like Germany, the British Empire, France and Russia.\n\nThe idea of a Hungarian Oriental Institute originated with Jen\u0151 Zichy.<ref>VINCZE Zolt\u00e1n: L\u00e9tay Bal\u00e1zs, a magyar asszirol\u00f3gia legszebb rem\u00e9nye\nhttp://www.muvelodes.ro/index.php/Cikk?id=155</ref> This idea did not come true. Instead, a kind of lyceum was formed in 1910, called ''Tur\u00e1ni T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g'' (Hungarian Turan Society, also called Hungarian Asiatic Society). The Turan society concentrated on Turan as geographic location where the ancestors of Hungarians might have lived.\n\nThe movement received impetus after Hungary's defeat in World War I. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (1920), the new Hungarian state constituted only 32.7% of the territory of historic, pre-treaty Hungary, and it lost 58.4% of its total population. More than 3.2 million ethnic Hungarians (one-third of all Hungarians) resided outside the new boundaries of Hungary in the successor states under oppressive conditions.<ref>PORTIK Erzs\u00e9bet-Edit: Erd\u00e9lyi magyar kisebbs\u00e9gi sorsk\u00e9rd\u00e9sek a k\u00e9t vil\u00e1gh\u00e1bor\u00fa k\u00f6z\u00f6tt.

Under these circumstances, no Hungarian government could survive without seeking justice for both the Magyars and Hungary. Reuniting the Magyars became a crucial point in public life and on the political agenda. Outrage led many to reject Europe and turn towards the East in search of new friends and allies in a bid to revise the unjust terms of the treaty and restore the integrity of Hungary.\n\n{{cquote|Disappointment towards Europe caused by 'the betrayal of the West in Trianon', and the pessimistic feeling of loneliness, led different strata in society towards Turanism.

The Hungarian government was placed under the direct control of the administration of the occupying forces. All Turanist organisations were disbanded by the government, and the majority of Turanist publications was banned and confiscated. In 1948, Hungary was converted into a communist one-party state. Turanism was portrayed and vilified as an exclusively fascist ideology although Turanism's role in the interwar development of far-right ideologies was negligible.<ref>\"While Turanism was and remained little more than a fringe ideology of the Right, the second orientation of the national socialists, pan-Europaism, had a number of adherents, and was adopted as the platform of several national socialist groups.\" JANOS, Andrew C.: ''The Politics of Backwardness in Hungary'', 1825-1945. 1982. p.275.</ref> The official prohibition lasted until the collapse of the socialist regime in 1989.\n\n=== Turkey ===\nTraditional history cites its early origins amongst Ottoman officers and intelligentsia studying and residing in 1870s [[Imperial Germany]]. The fact that many Ottoman Turkish officials were becoming aware of their sense of \"Turkishness\" is beyond doubt of course, and the role of subsequent nationalists, such as [[Ziya G\u00f6kalp]] is fully established historically. As the Turkish historian Hasan B\u00fclent Paksoy put it, an aspiration emerged that the [[Turkic peoples]] might \"form a political entity stretching from the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Eastern Asia]] to the [[Bosphorus]]\".<ref>Paksoy, H.B., \u2018Basmachi\u2019: TurkestanNational Liberation Movement 1916-1930s \u2013 Modern Encyclopedia of Religions in Russia and the Soviet Union,  Florida: Academic International Press, 1991, Vol. 4</ref> During the late 19th century, the works of renowned Hungarian [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] and linguist [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]] contributed to the spreading of [[Turkish nationalism]] and Turanism.

There were reform and modernization attempts as early as the 1830s ([[Tanzimat]]),  but the country was lowered to an almost semi-colonial state at the turn of the century (the state accumulated an enormous amount of debt and state finances were placed under [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|direct foreign control]]), and the great powers freely preyed on her, occupying or annexing parts of her territory at will (e.g. [[Cyprus]]). At the time, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[British Empire|British]] empires were antagonists in the so-called \"[[Great Game]]\" to cultivate influence in Persia and [[Central Asia]] (Turkestan). Russia and Britain systematically fanned the rivalling nationalisms of the multi-ethnic empire for their own ends,<ref>ERICKSON, Edward J.: Ottomans and Armenians. 2013.</ref><ref>GORECZKY Tam\u00e1s: Egy g\u00f6r\u00f6g-t\u00f6r\u00f6k konfliktus t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a 19. sz\u00e1zadb\u00f3l - az 1896-97-es kr\u00e9tai v\u00e1ls\u00e1g az osztr\u00e1k-magyar diplom\u00e1ciai iratok t\u00fckr\u00e9ben http://real.mtak.hu/19319/1/17-GoretzkyTamas.pdf</ref> and this led to the strengthening of Turkish nationalism as a result.

The most prominent amongst them was [[Enver Pasha]], the former Ottoman war minister.\n\nTuranism forms an important aspect of the [[ideology]] of the modern Turkish [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP), whose youth movement is informally known as the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]]. Grey Wolf (the mother wolf [[Asena]]) was the main symbol of the ancient [[Turkic peoples]].\n\n=== Japan ===\nJapanese Turanism was based upon the same footing as its European counterparts. The Austrian German philologist Johann Anton Boller (1811\u20131869) was the first who systematically tried to prove the Ural-Altaic affiliation of the Japanese language.<ref>BOLLER, Johann Anton: Nachweis, dass das Japanische zum ural-altaischen Stamme geh\u00f6rt. 1857. http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10572378_00001.html</ref> The Japanese linguist Fujioka Katsuji (1872\u20131935) put forward a set of mainly typological characteristics linking Japanese to the Ural-Altaic family.<ref>SHIBATANI Masayoshi: The languages of Japan. 1990. p.96</ref> The concept of Japanese as a Ural-Altaic language was  quite widely accepted prior to the second world war.

Japanese Turanists claimed that Japanese have an Inner Asian descent, and the progenitors of the Japanese people migrated from Central Asia to conquer the Japanese islands. Kitagawa Shikaz\u014d (1886\u20131943) asserted that the Japanese had descended from the Tungusic branch of the Turanian family, just like the Koreans and Manchus, whose origin had been in north-east China, Manchuria. And, since Japanese, Koreans and Manchus derived from a Tungusic origin, they also had a bond with other Turanian sub-ethnicities like Turks, Mongols, Samoyeds and Finno-Ugrians in terms of blood, language and culture.<ref name=\"Sinan Levent\"/> The first-ever Japanese Turanist organization, the Turanian National Alliance \u2013 ''Tsuran Minzoku Domei'' (\u30c4\u30e9\u30f3\u6c11\u65cf\u540c\u76df), was established in Tokyo in 1921, by Juichiro Imaoka  (1888\u20131973) and the Hungarian Orientalist and ethnographer Benedek Bar\u00e1thosi Balogh (1870\u20131945).<ref name=\"Sinan Levent\"/> Other organisations like the Turanian Society of Japan \u2013 ''Nippon Tsuran Kyoukai'' (early 1930s) and the Japanese-Hungarian Cultural Association \u2013 ''Nikko Bunka Kyoukai'' (1938) were founded too. A pro-Finnish activity was carried in Japan in the interwar period by some Japanese nationalists influenced by Turanism. It found theoretical expression in, for example, a book entitled ''Hann tsuranizumu to keizai burokku'' (''Pan-Turanism and the Economic Bloc''), written by an economist. The writer insists that the Japanese should leave the tragically small Japanese islands and resettle to the northern and western parts of the Asian continent, where their forefathers had once dwelt. For this purpose, they had to reconquer these ancestral lands from the Slavs by entering into alliance with the Turanian peoples. The Finns, one of those peoples, were to take a share of this great achievement.<ref>MOMOSE Hiroshi: Japan's Relations with Finland 1919\u20131944, as Reflected by Japanese Source Materials. http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/5026/1/KJ00000112960.pdf</ref> Turanian kinship along with an anti-communist stance were seen as justification for Japan\u2019s intervention in the [[Japanese intervention in Siberia|Russian]] and [[Chinese Civil War]], and for the creation of a Japanese sphere of interest, through the creation of new Japanese vassal states in North-East Asia. After the creation of  [[Manchukuo]] and [[Mengjiang]], Japan pushed for further expansion in the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], but after the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Nomonhan Incident]] gave up on those plans, and concluded the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact]] with the Soviet Union in 1941. \n\nAfter Khalkin Gol, the Japanese turned towards South-East Asia and the Pacific [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|under a pan-Asianist agenda]].<ref>\u201cMany Japanese thinkers expressed themselves in pan-Asian terms, in terms of hegemony in East Asia.

Located to the West of [[The Intracoastal Waterway|the Intracoastal Waterway]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], in an area planned by [[International Paper]] in the late 1990s. Regarded as the \"bedroom community\" of [[Myrtle Beach]], Carolina Forest is comprised of [[private community|private subdivisions]] and [[gated communities|gated community]], the majority of which are planned around a multitude of lakes and resort-style amenities. Several [[golf course communities|golf course community]] are also located here, most notably River Oaks Golf Plantation. \n\n== Geography ==\nCarolina Forest is situated West of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] in Myrtle Beach, and East of Gardner Lacy Road; between [[U.S. Route 501 in South Carolina|U.S. Route 501]] and International Drive. Located between 3.8 and 8 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, the average Carolina Forest home is roughly less than 7 miles from the beach.\n\nCarolina Forest was developed in and around existing [[Longleaf Pine]] forests, within the [[Waccamaw River]] watershed, part of the greater of the lower watershed of the [[Pee Dee River]]. The topography of the region between the Waccamaw River and the Intracoastal Waterway is spotted with [[Carolina Bays]], which are elliptical depressions, often filled with thick vegetation and rich in [[biodiversity]]. \n\n== Roads and Intersections ==\n[[Carolina Forest Boulevard]] serves as the main artery of Carolina Forest, other main roads include River Oaks Drive, International Drive, Postal Way, Renee Drive, and [[Carolina Bays Parkway|South Carolina Highway 31]]\n\n== History ==\nCarolina Forest was once part of a larger tract of land in eastern [[Horry County]] called the Buist Tract. Originally owned by Burroughs & Chapin, International Paper bought the {{convert|30000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} Buist Tract in 1937. It was used as part of the Conway Bombing and Gunnery Range during World War II. In 1960, the company donated part of the tract for what is now [[Coastal Carolina University]] (located several miles away from Carolina Forest). In 1989, approximately {{convert|9000|acre|km2|0}} north of Carolina Forest were donated to the state to form the [[Lewis Ocean Bay Heritage Preserve]]. The [[planned unit development]] was initially created to have 20,000 single and multi-family homesites when completed. Most of the development follows the Carolina Forest Master Plan, developed cooperatively between International Paper and the Horry County Government.\n\n\nIn June 1994, Kylee Mueller sold {{convert|125|acre|km2}} of the remaining {{convert|21000|acre|km2|0}} of the Buist Tract to Horry County Schools for development of Carolina Forest Elementary School, Carolina Forest Middle School, and [[Carolina Forest High School]]. In addition, {{convert|350|acre|km2}} were sold to form a golf course and residential property.\n\nBy the end of 1994, International Paper began to sell more of its land. Due to the lack of funding from other sources for road infrastructure, the first {{convert|1.25|mi|km|2}} of Carolina Forest Boulevard were completed by November 1995 by International Paper. Further expansions of both Carolina Forest Boulevard and River Oaks Drive (creating an {{convert|11|mi|km|0|adj=on}} loop) would open up {{convert|11000|acre|km2|0}} to development west of the Intracoastal Waterway.

His early education began in a ''pathshala'', then he studied in Martin Bowl's English School and Baboo Nityananda Sen's High School. \n\nIn 1809, at the age of seventeen he was married to Nagri Dassee, the daughter of Mohan Chand Dey from the Surtir Bagan neighbourhood in Kolkata.

His father, Chaitanya Charan Seal, a [[cloth merchant]], died when Seal was around five years old. His early education began in a ''pathshala'', then he studied in Martin Bowl's English School and Baboo Nityananda Sen's High School. \n\nIn 1809, at the age of seventeen he was married to Nagri Dassee, the daughter of Mohan Chand Dey from the Surtir Bagan neighbourhood in Kolkata. Seal accompanied his father-in-law on a pilgrimage of northern and western India, and the experience greatly enlightened him.

It was also known as '''The Dalton Brothers''' because three of its members were brothers. The gang specialized in [[bank robbery|bank]] and [[train robbery|train robberies]]. During an attempted bank robbery in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]] in 1892, two of the brothers and two other gang members were killed; Emmett survived and was captured, tried, and convicted. He was paroled after serving 14 years in prison.\n\nThe oldest brother [[Frank Dalton|Frank]] had been a [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]], but was killed in 1887. In 1890, [[Gratton Dalton|Gratton \"Grat\"]], [[Bob Dalton (outlaw)|Bob]], and [[Emmett Dalton|Emmett]] turned to crime after not being paid as lawmen. Their middle brother [[William M. Dalton|William M. \"Bill\" Dalton]] never joined any heists with his brothers, but served as their spy and informant. After their death he would form his own gang with [[Bill Doolin]], known as the [[Wild Bunch]], or the Dalton-Doolin Gang. The gangs were first cousins through their mother to the Younger brothers, who rode with [[Jesse James]]. The Daltons were active later than and independently of the [[James-Younger Gang]], who were much older.\n\nDue to the popularity and sensationalism that surrounded the Daltons, they were accused of several different robberies all over the country. This led to the writing of a variety of myths about the gang. However, the last remaining of the brothers, Lit, released the truth of his brothers activities after the death of his brother Emmett. He accused Emmett's book, ''When the Dalton's Rode'', of being largely fabrication, specifically how Emmett denied accompanying Bob to California. Emmett freely admitted on his death bed to [[Frank Forrest Latta]], that he had robbed a train in California, and had used the alias William McElhanie, but asked Latta not to publish the information until after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=1\u201344 |isbn=1892622149 }}</ref>\n\n== Beginnings ==\nTheir father was Lewis Dalton from [[Jackson County, Missouri]]. He was a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] keeper in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], when he married Adeline Younger. She became an aunt of [[Cole Younger|Cole]] and [[Jim Younger]].

As early as 1870, he would travel to California to enter in the circuits, sometimes being gone for months at a time. Starting with his oldest, he would eventually bring all his boys along with him. In 1877, while their father was running horses in [[Visalia, California]], the oldest boys were offered steady work but refused. After returning home from the races Ben, Frank, and Lit, decided to take up the offer and traveled back to California to work as muleskinners. Grat and Cole eventually followed in 1880. Grat would quickly make a reputation as a bar fighter in saloons up and down the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. That same year Frank was offered a job in the [[Indian Territory]], now the state of [[Oklahoma]], as a Deputy U.S. Marshall out of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], and decided the move would leave him closer to home. Bill joined his brothers in 1884, started a family, and leased a ranch in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]].\n\nLewis Dalton eventually gambled away the family home in [[Belton, Missouri]]. Adeline was able to obtain a piece of land near [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]] in 1890, when the [[Oklahoma Territory]] was opened for settlement. Lewis died shortly after, before any of his sons would become outlaws.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=1\u201344 |isbn=1-892622-14-9}}</ref>\n\n==Lawmen==\n[[File:DaltonFrank-edit.jpg|thumb|Frank Dalton]] \nOn Nov 27, 1887, [[Frank Dalton]] and another deputy marshal, Jim Cole, went across the river from Fort Smith to arrest three whiskey bootleggers. As they approached the camp the bootleggers began to fire on them. Frank shot and killed two, but his gun jammed and he was killed by the remaining bootlegger. His deputy abandoned him after being wounded. Frank is buried in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]].\n\nAfter Frank's death, brothers Grat and Bob took over his job as Deputy U.S. Marshal at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]]. Bob soon hired Emmett under him to guard prisoners. The trouble started when Bob killed a man in the line of duty, which he claimed was in self defense. He become restless and began to drink heavily. Afterwards Bob was given the job of organizing a police force in the Osage Nation, and took Emmett along as a deputy. Grat, meanwhile, stayed at Fort Smith. Emmett and Bob kept good reputations in the Osage Nation until July 1890, when they began stealing horses. Eventually, stockmen organized a posse to capture them, and forced Bob and Emmett to flee. They hid out on the bluffs of the [[Canadian River]] about seventy miles southwest of [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]], there they sent to Grat for help. Grat tried to send them food, horses, and ammunition but was caught and thrown in jail at Fort Smith, where he had formerly placed prisoners. After two weeks, Grat was released in the hopes he would lead the law to his brothers. Bob and Emmett, however, were able to take a train to California where they would begin to work at their brother Bill's ranch near [[San Miguel, San Luis Obispo County, California]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=25\u201350 |isbn=1892622149 }}</ref>\n\nDiscredited as lawmen, the Daltons would soon form their gang.\n\n==Outlaws==\n[[Grat Dalton]] returned to California to meet Emmett and Bob at Bill's ranch in January 1891. They worked there for about a month while they played poker and got in bar fights at saloons throughout San Luis Obispo County. Here they spent most of the money they had made from horse stealing. Around this time [[Bob Dalton (outlaw)|Bob Dalton]] began making plans to rob a train with the help of Emmett and Grat. Their brothers Cole, Lit, and Bill unsuccessfully tried to dissuade them. Emmett was initially against the idea, but agreed to follow Bob.\n\nOn the night of February 6, 1891, a [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] passenger train was held up by two masked men who carried only 44-calibre revolvers, near the town of Alila (present day [[Earlimart, California]]). No money was successfully taken, but during the crossfire with the outlaws the fireman had accidentally been killed by the expressman. The outlaws had worn masks during the Alila robbery, concealing their identities. It was asserted many years later by Lit Dalton, however, that Bob and Emmett had told him many times that they robbed the train. Grat was unable to join the heist after spending all his money on drinking and gambling in [[Tulare, California]], therefore unable to secure a horse. Sheriff Eugene Kay of [[Tulare County, California]] and his posse tracked the outlaws to a ranch in San Luis Obispo County, near Cholame. They decided to see if they could spend the night at the ranch and continue their search in the morning. The ranch was owned by [[William M. Dalton|Bill Dalton]]. Early the next morning, as Sheriff Kay prepared to leave, he found the remnants of a saddle in a haystack near Bill\u2019s barn. The saddle was missing a leather strap, the same strap that Kay had found at the scene of the hold up. Unknown to Kay, Bill had hid Bob and Emmett in his barn and they had barely escaped discovery. Sheriff Kay then spent the day in Paso Robles and learned what he could about Bill. He discovered that Bill's brothers had a reputation as horse thieves in Oklahoma, and had spent the past few months working at Bill\u2019s ranch. He then received a telegram from Tulare and learned that Bob, Emmett and Grat had spent the past few days heavily drinking, gambling and following the Southern Pacific pay car as it made its monthly journey down the [[San Joaquin Valley]].\n\nSheriff Kay was met in Paso Robles by Southern Pacific Railway detective Will Smith and San Luis Obispo County Sheriff O\u2019Neal, where he told them what he had learned. Unknown to Kay, Smith and O'Neal then made their own trip to Bill Dalton\u2019s ranch later that same day, expecting to surprise and arrest Bill, Bob, and Emmett. Sheriff Kay had been preparing his own posse to arrest the Daltons at Bill\u2019s ranch, but after learning that Smith and O\u2019Neal had already left, decided it was useless and waited for Smith to return with the Daltons. When Smith and O\u2019Neal arrived at Bill\u2019s, Bob and Emmett hid in a closet through a trapdoor that Bill had built in the attic. Bill invited the lawmen in but argued with Smith over his brother's guilt. He became angry with Smith but was calmed down by O\u2019Neal and reluctantly allowed the lawmen to stay the night. They left the next morning empty handed and Kay was furious with Smith.\n\n[[File:Photo of Robert \"Bob\" Dalton c. 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of Robert \"Bob\" Dalton c. 1889]]\n\nOn March 17, 1891, the Tulare County Grand Jury indicted brothers Bob, Emmett, Grat, and Bill Dalton for the Alila robbery. A few days later Grat and Bill were arrested and placed in the Tulare County jail. A $3000 bounty was placed for the capture of Bob and Emmett. Bill however had already helped them escape California before he was arrested, and Bob and Emmett were on their way back to Oklahoma territory. Bill was soon able to secure bondsmen and was released. He quickly hired attorneys to defend Grat. While Grat sat in jail in [[Visalia, California]], Bob and Emmett began making their way to Oklahoma. They borrowed money and supplies from their brothers, Cole and Lit, and made their way east across the Mojave Desert. After their horses were discovered at [[Ludlow, California]], Sheriff Kay decided to pursue them with his deputy, Jim Ford. He discovered that the brothers had actually made their way to Utah to throw him off, and tracked them to the town of [[Ogden, Utah]]. After some close encounters, Bob and Emmett escaped capture by train. Sheriff Kay continued to track them throughout the Southwest for several months, even at one point entering [[Mexico]], but with no success. Eventually they ended up at the Dalton home near [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]]. The Daltons had many friends in Oklahoma willing to hide them and Sheriff Kay was forced to give up the chase in order to return to California for Grat's trial. After they realized they were no longer being pursued, Bob and Emmett robbed a train at Whorton, now [[Perry, Oklahoma]], in May 1891. They then began to form what would be known as the Dalton Gang.\n\nEven though much of the evidence showed that Grat was in [[Fresno, California]] the night of the Alila robbery, including the testimony of several witnesses, the influence of the powerful [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] led him to receive an unfair trial. The lawyer the Dalton's had hired for Grat was corrupt and it was not mentioned by the defense, nor the prosecution, that the fireman had been accidentally killed by the expressman. This was unknown to Grat, since the Dalton brothers had all assumed that Emmett had killed the fireman. While Grat awaited his sentence, a train robbery occurred near [[Ceres, California]] on September 3, 1891, but was unsuccessful with no money being taken. Sheriff Kay suspected [[William M. Dalton|Bill Dalton]], and arrested him, as well a man joining Bill named Riley Dean. Kay found Bill and Dean at an abandoned overland stage station where they looked as if they were either planning a robbery, or to break Grat from jail. Both Bill and Dean established a clear alibi, but Bill was held in Tulare County Jail to await trial for his part in the Alila robbery.\n\n[[File:Daltonmountain.jpg|thumb|Dalton Mountain, Fresno County, California, Christmas Eve 2019, as viewed from the Wonder Valley Ranch Resort]]\n\nOn the night of September 20th, Grat and two other men escaped from the Tulare County Jail in Visalia while Sheriff Kay was busy in [[San Francisco, California]]. Grat and the other two men had been slipped a saw from someone on the outside and were able to saw a hole in the bars. Bill had remained in his cell, and was found in the morning playing a popular song on the guitar that he set his own words to and titled, \"You'll Never Miss My Brother Till He's Gone\", and joked about how the boys had left him. Bill was acquitted and released on October 15th. He then sold the lease to his ranch in San Luis Obispo County, moved his family to his wife's parents in [[Livingston, California]], and left for [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]]. After arresting the two other men who had escaped with Grat, Sheriff Kay learned that Grat was assisted by Riley Dean, and that they were both hiding on the summit of a steep mountain close to the Kings River, near [[Sanger, California]]. This would later be known as Dalton Mountain. On Christmas Eve, 1891, the posses of both Sheriff Kay of Tulare County, and Sheriff Hensley of Fresno County, ascended the mountain to Daltons camp. They ambushed the outlaws on their way back from a boar hunt. Riley Dean was captured, but Grat managed to escape, firing at the lawmen with his [[Winchester rifle]], and stealing a horse from the nearby Elwood ranch. Grat then rode to a friends near [[Livingston, California]], and stayed for several weeks before he escaped back to Oklahoma with the help of his brother Cole.\n\nBob and Emmett had meanwhile been busy in Oklahoma forming their gang. After their unsuccessful career in California they decided they could do much better in their home country and, unlike their first attempts, they began carefully planning their robberies. With Bob as the leader they recruited mostly men who had grown up with them in Oklahoma. First recruited were [[George Newcomb|George \"Bitter Creek\" Newcomb]] and [[\"Blackfaced\" Charlie Bryant]], Bryant received his nickname because of a gunpowder burn on one cheek. This resulted in the first robbery at Whorton, May 1891, where the gang stole $1200. Joined afterwards were [[Bill Doolin]], Dick Broadwell, Bill Powers, and [[Charley Pierce]]. The gang was also assisted by Bob's lover Eugenia Moore, known by her aliases \"Tom King\" and \"Miss Mundays\", who acted as their informant but was also a notorious horse thief and outlaw.\n\n[[File:Dalton Bill.png|thumb|Bill Dalton]]\n\nIn August 1891, Bryant was spotted in [[Hennessey, Oklahoma]], after leaving the gangs hideout to visit his mother. The locals who identified him notified a Deputy Marshal named Ed Short. He arrested Bryant and took him on a train to be committed to the jail at [[Wichita, Kansas]], without a guard or notifying Marshal Grimes at Fort Smith. After the train left Hennessey and was approaching the stop at [[Waukomis, Oklahoma]], Short noticed a group of mounted men that looked as if they were trying to beat the train, and feared it was the Dalton Gang coming to free Bryant. Short put the baggage man in charge of Bryant, giving him his revolver, while he went to the rear platform with his rifle. The baggageman carelessly stuck the revolver into a [[Pigeon-hole messagebox]] and went to work at the other end of the car. Bryant secured the revolver and ordered the baggageman to go back to work. He opened the door to the rear platform and, while Short had his attention to the mounted men, shot him in the back. Short then turned and they both shot each other to death.\n\nThe second train robbery by the Dalton Gang in Oklahoma was at a small station called Lelietta on September 15, 1891, about four miles north of [[Wagoner, Oklahoma]]. Here they secured $19,000, which Bob spent mostly on women and gambling. Many members of the gang, including Emmett, complained that the $3500 each was not enough to meet their needs. Bill Doolin complained that Bob was not dividing the money fairly, and quit the gang, along with Newcomb and Pierce. Grat returned to Oklahoma in the spring of 1892. Some time later, the three dissatisfied members also returned and new plans began to formulate. Bill had returned to Oklahoma several months earlier, living at his mothers near Kingsfisher. Even though he did not participate in any of the hold ups with his brothers, he acted as their spy and advisor.\n\nOn June 1, 1892, the gang robbed the Sante Fe train at [[Red Rock, Oklahoma]], securing about $50,000. Here the Santa Fe had found out about the Daltons plans and attempted to set up a trap for the gang, filling the train with heavily armed officers. However, they made the mistake of leaving the train dark which made Bob suspicious, and the gang allowed the train to go by. They then robbed the next train a few minutes later. The $50,000 however came out to only $1800 after draft and securities had been thrown out. After splitting the money amongst themselves it was soon necessary to rob another train.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=50\u2013209 |isbn=1892622149 }}</ref>\n\nThe next robbery was on July 14th, at [[Adair, Oklahoma]], near the [[Arkansas]] border. At the station the gang took what they could find in the express and baggage rooms. They sat to wait for the next train on a bench on the platform, talking and smoking, with their [[Winchester rifle]]s across their knees. When the train came in at 9:45&nbsp;p.m., they backed a wagon up to the express car and unloaded all the contents. The eight armed guards on the train all happened to be at the back of the train when it pulled in. They fired at the bandits through the car windows and from behind the train. In the gun fight, 200 shots were fired. None of the Dalton gang was hit. Doctors W. L. Goff and Youngblood were sitting on the porch of the drug store near the depot. Both men were hit several times by stray shots; Dr Goff was fatally wounded. Also wounded were captains Kinney and LaFlore, but they recovered.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalton Gang Train Robbery at Adair, I.T.|url=https://www.lasr.net/travel/city.php?Historic+Dalton+Gang+Robbery&TravelTo=OK0306001&VA=Y&Attraction_ID=OK0306001a002|website=Lasr.net|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref> The gang secured about $18,000. They were also accused of robbing a bank in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] on July 28, however this was based on little evidence as no one identified any members of the gang.\n\n==Coffeyville bank robbery==\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Coffeyville Bank Robbery\n| partof      = \n| image       = Condon Bank Coffeyville, Kansas c. 1890.jpg\n| caption     = Condon Bank Coffeyville, Kansas c. 1890 one of the two banks the Dalton Gang attempted to rob.\n| date        = October 5, 1892\n| place       = [[Coffeyville, Kansas]]\n| result      = Dalton Gang suppressed\n| combatant1  = Dalton Gang\n| combatant2  = Coffeyville citizenry\n| commander1  = [[Bob Dalton (outlaw)|Robert Dalton]] {{KIA}}\n| commander2  = [[U.S. Marshal]] Charles Connelly {{KIA}}\n| strength1   = 5 outlaws\n| strength2   = armed citizenry\n| casualties1 = 4 killed\n1 wounded and captured\n| casualties2 = 4 killed\n4-6 wounded\n}}\n\nBob Dalton had ambitions. He would, he claimed, \"beat anything [[Jesse James]] ever did&mdash;rob two banks at once, in broad daylight.\" On October 5, 1892, the Dalton gang attempted this feat when they set out to rob the C.M. Condon & Company's Bank and the First National Bank on opposite sides of the street in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/daltons.htm|title=The Dalton Gang's Last Raid, 1892|website=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> Bob had planned the entire robbery. Emmett however was against the idea. He had gone to school at Robbins Corners near Coffeyville and knew several hundred people in town. He was afraid some of his friends would be hurt, but Bob assured him there wouldn't be any shooting and that it would all be over before anyone knew what happened. The plan was that Bob and Emmett were to rob the First National Bank while Grat, Broadwell, and Powers robbed the Condon Bank across the street. Emmett thought Grat would mess things up if he went alone with Powers and Broadwell, and thought they should trade places. This led to a heavy argument between Bob and Emmett and created bitterness between them on the way to the robbery.\n\nBob had planned for the gang to tie their horses to a post behind the Condon Bank, where it was protected from the center of town by brick walls. They had not been to the town for several years however and the hitching post had since been removed during street work. Bob would not allow Emmett to check out town beforehand in fear that he would be recognized, so this was not factored into their plan. When they arrived Bob had to think quickly and decided instead to tie their horses in an alley across from the bank to the west, near the city jail, which offered them little protection. This is now known as Dalton Alley.\n\nOn the morning of October 5, the gang emerged from the alley onto the plaza of Coffeyville. A storekeeper who was sweeping the sidewalk a few feet away noticed Bob, Emmett, and even Grat who was wearing a fake mustache, and ran inside his store. In close order the five crossed Walnut Street from the alley to the Condon Bank, holding Winchester rifles close along their legs. Grat, Broadwell, and Powers entered the Condon Bank and Emmett and Bob hurried across Union Street to the First National Bank. There was street work being done at the time and one of the workers noticed the men dog trotting across the alley with rifles, and began to yell, \"The Daltons are robbing the bank!\" Very soon half the businessmen around the plaza knew what was going on and the message quickly passed throughout the town.\n\nGrat entered the Condon Bank and pointed his Winchester at the cashier, ordering his hands up, while Powers and Broadwell took positions at the door. Grat went to the back office and ordered the manager into the front, he then handed the cashier a sack bag and ordered him to fill it with cash from the money drawer. Then, noticing the vault door was open, Grat ordered both of them into the vault where the safe with the gold was. When told to open the safe the manager lied, telling Grat it was a time lock and that it would not open for another ten minutes. Grat believed him and decided he would wait until it opened. He then ordered the bags of silver on the vault floor into his bag, containing $1000 and weighing about two hundred pounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Emmett and Bob had entered the First National Bank, covered the officers and two customers, and ordered the cashier, Thomas Aryes, to open the safe where there was gold and cash. They put the gold into the sack, forced Aryes in front of them as cover, and went out the front door. They had planned to meet up with Grat and cross the plaza to the alley where they could make their escape, but word of the robbery had spread through town. As they exited the door an [[American Express]] agent opened fire with his revolver. Bob and Emmett returned fire and left Aryes on the sidewalk. They turned around, and went through the back door, carrying both rifles and sack bags while taking two other bank employees as cover.\n\nGrat heard the revolver shots from the Express agent. He then decided the sack bag was too heavy to carry and ordered the silver taken out, then stashed what cash he could fit into his coat pockets. Two hardware stores in the town had meanwhile began passing out guns to the local citizens, who began firing through the windows at the Condon Bank. The three returned fire and held out, waiting for the time lock to open. Several citizens were wounded in the fighting.\n\nWhen Emmett and Bob went out the back door of the First National Bank, they were met by Lucius Baldwin who had been watching the door with his pistol. Bob ordered him to drop the gun and, when he failed to answer, shot him with his Winchester killing him. Bob and Emmett then made their way to the end of the back alley onto Eighth Street where they could hear the townspeople shooting at the Condon Bank. Outside of a drug store across from the First National, George Cubine was standing with his Winchester aimed at the front door of the bank, awaiting the exit of Bob and Emmett. Bob shot him in the head. Cubine's partner, Charles Brown, was standing unarmed next to him and went to pick up his winchester. As he lifted the rifle up, Bob shot and killed him.\n\nAfter being left on the sidewalk by Bob and Emmett, Thomas Aryes had run into one of the hardware stores and grabbed a rifle. He spotted Bob just as he had killed Brown and aimed his rifle at him from behind the store window. Bob saw Aryes from about two hundred feet away and quickly shot him in the head. Aryes was not killed, but he would remain paralyzed for life.\n\nAs bullets were showering into the Condon Bank, Powers told Grat he had been hit in the arm. Grat ordered the employees to lay on the floor in the back office and, after receiving the signal from Bob, told Powers and Broadwell that it was time to leave. The three went out the side door crouching and dashing across Walnut Street to the alley where they had hitched their horses. Bob and Emmett met Grat and the others in the alley, the sacks of money still over their arms.\n\n[[File:Law enforcement officers hold up the bodies of Bob and Grat Dalton.jpg|thumb|left|Law enforcement officers hold up the bodies of Bob(23) and Grat(31) Dalton after the attempted Bank Robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas]]\n\nAs the Daltons made their way east down the alley towards the horses town Marshal, Charles T. Connelly, came through the livery stable into the alley and ran west towards the plaza without noticing the bandits behind him. Grat then shot him in the head and killed him. Following behind Marshal Connelly was John Kholer, still in the stable. Grat noticed him but before he could aim Kholer shot him in the throat.\n\nTaking fire from the hardware store Bob was hit in the head and the heart, killing him instantly. Powers tried to mount his horse but shots from the store also killed him. Emmett was able to mount his horse unwounded and began riding away but, after noticing Bob was hit, turned around and attempted to lift Bob onto his horse.

He moved to [[Hollywood, California]] and became a real estate agent, author and actor, and died in 1937 at age 66. Bill Doolin, \"Bitter Creek\" Newcomb, and Charlie Pierce, none of whom were at Coffeyville, were the only members left of the original Dalton Gang.\n\nYears after the robberies and his release from prison, Emmett Dalton said that the relentless pressure put on them by Deputy US Marshal [[Heck Thomas]] as he hunted for them was a key factor in his gang's decision to commit the robberies. They hoped that a big haul from the banks would allow them to leave the territory and escape Thomas' heat.\n\nBill Doolin started a new gang with the Dalton Gang's remaining members. Bill Dalton would eventually join and become one of the leaders. The gang then became known as the [[Doolin-Dalton Gang]]. Dalton was reportedly one of the participants in a gun battle on September 1, 1893 at [[Ingalls, Oklahoma|Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory]]. Three deputy U. S. marshals were killed in the shootout. He may have been one of a four-man gang who robbed the First National Bank of [[Longview, Texas]], on May 21, 1894. He was shot and killed by a posse near [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]] on June 8, 1894. Nine of the deputy U.S. marshals who killed Bill Dalton were indicted for his murder in the federal court at Ardmore in June 1896. Apparently, none were ever tried.

It was also known as '''The Dalton Brothers''' because three of its members were brothers. The gang specialized in [[bank robbery|bank]] and [[train robbery|train robberies]]. During an attempted bank robbery in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]] in 1892, two of the brothers and two other gang members were killed; Emmett survived and was captured, tried, and convicted. He was paroled after serving 14 years in prison.\n\nThe oldest brother [[Frank Dalton|Frank]] had been a [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]], but was killed in 1887. In 1890, [[Gratton Dalton|Gratton \"Grat\"]], [[Bob Dalton (outlaw)|Bob]], and [[Emmett Dalton|Emmett]] turned to crime after not being paid as lawmen. Their middle brother [[William M. Dalton|William M. \"Bill\" Dalton]] never joined any heists with his brothers, but served as their spy and informant. After their death he would form his own gang with [[Bill Doolin]], known as the [[Wild Bunch]], or the Dalton-Doolin Gang. The gangs were first cousins through their mother to the Younger brothers, who rode with [[Jesse James]]. The Daltons were active later than and independently of the [[James-Younger Gang]], who were much older.\n\nDue to the popularity and sensationalism that surrounded the Daltons, they were accused of several different robberies all over the country. This led to the writing of a variety of myths about the gang. However, the last remaining of the brothers, Lit, released the truth of his brothers activities after the death of his brother Emmett. He accused Emmett's book, ''When the Dalton's Rode'', of being largely fabrication, specifically how Emmett denied accompanying Bob to California. Emmett freely admitted on his death bed to [[Frank Forrest Latta]], that he had robbed a train in California, and had used the alias William McElhanie, but asked Latta not to publish the information until after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=1\u201344 |isbn=1892622149 }}</ref>\n\n== Beginnings ==\nTheir father was Lewis Dalton from [[Jackson County, Missouri]]. He was a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] keeper in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], when he married Adeline Younger. She became an aunt of [[Cole Younger|Cole]] and [[Jim Younger]].

As early as 1870, he would travel to California to enter in the circuits, sometimes being gone for months at a time. Starting with his oldest, he would eventually bring all his boys along with him. In 1877, while their father was running horses in [[Visalia, California]], the oldest boys were offered steady work but refused. After returning home from the races Ben, Frank, and Lit, decided to take up the offer and traveled back to California to work as muleskinners. Grat and Cole eventually followed in 1880. Grat would quickly make a reputation as a bar fighter in saloons up and down the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. That same year Frank was offered a job in the [[Indian Territory]], now the state of [[Oklahoma]], as a Deputy U.S. Marshall out of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], and decided the move would leave him closer to home. Bill joined his brothers in 1884, started a family, and leased a ranch in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]].\n\nLewis Dalton eventually gambled away the family home in [[Belton, Missouri]]. Adeline was able to obtain a piece of land near [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]] in 1890, when the [[Oklahoma Territory]] was opened for settlement. Lewis died shortly after, before any of his sons would become outlaws.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=1\u201344 |isbn=1-892622-14-9}}</ref>\n\n==Lawmen==\n[[File:DaltonFrank-edit.jpg|thumb|Frank Dalton]] \nOn Nov 27, 1887, [[Frank Dalton]] and another deputy marshal, Jim Cole, went across the river from Fort Smith to arrest three whiskey bootleggers. As they approached the camp the bootleggers began to fire on them. Frank shot and killed two, but his gun jammed and he was killed by the remaining bootlegger. His deputy abandoned him after being wounded. Frank is buried in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]].\n\nAfter Frank's death, brothers Grat and Bob took over his job as Deputy U.S. Marshal at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]]. Bob soon hired Emmett under him to guard prisoners. The trouble started when Bob killed a man in the line of duty, which he claimed was in self defense. He become restless and began to drink heavily. Afterwards Bob was given the job of organizing a police force in the Osage Nation, and took Emmett along as a deputy. Grat, meanwhile, stayed at Fort Smith. Emmett and Bob kept good reputations in the Osage Nation until July 1890, when they began stealing horses. Eventually, stockmen organized a posse to capture them, and forced Bob and Emmett to flee. They hid out on the bluffs of the [[Canadian River]] about seventy miles southwest of [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]], there they sent to Grat for help. Grat tried to send them food, horses, and ammunition but was caught and thrown in jail at Fort Smith, where he had formerly placed prisoners. After two weeks, Grat was released in the hopes he would lead the law to his brothers. Bob and Emmett, however, were able to take a train to California where they would begin to work at their brother Bill's ranch near [[San Miguel, San Luis Obispo County, California]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=25\u201350 |isbn=1892622149 }}</ref>\n\nDiscredited as lawmen, the Daltons would soon form their gang.\n\n==Outlaws==\n[[Grat Dalton]] returned to California to meet Emmett and Bob at Bill's ranch in January 1891. They worked there for about a month while they played poker and got in bar fights at saloons throughout San Luis Obispo County. Here they spent most of the money they had made from horse stealing. Around this time [[Bob Dalton (outlaw)|Bob Dalton]] began making plans to rob a train with the help of Emmett and Grat. Their brothers Cole, Lit, and Bill unsuccessfully tried to dissuade them. Emmett was initially against the idea, but agreed to follow Bob.\n\nOn the night of February 6, 1891, a [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] passenger train was held up by two masked men who carried only 44-calibre revolvers, near the town of Alila (present day [[Earlimart, California]]). No money was successfully taken, but during the crossfire with the outlaws the fireman had accidentally been killed by the expressman. The outlaws had worn masks during the Alila robbery, concealing their identities. It was asserted many years later by Lit Dalton, however, that Bob and Emmett had told him many times that they robbed the train. Grat was unable to join the heist after spending all his money on drinking and gambling in [[Tulare, California]], therefore unable to secure a horse. Sheriff Eugene Kay of [[Tulare County, California]] and his posse tracked the outlaws to a ranch in San Luis Obispo County, near Cholame. They decided to see if they could spend the night at the ranch and continue their search in the morning. The ranch was owned by [[William M. Dalton|Bill Dalton]]. Early the next morning, as Sheriff Kay prepared to leave, he found the remnants of a saddle in a haystack near Bill\u2019s barn. The saddle was missing a leather strap, the same strap that Kay had found at the scene of the hold up. Unknown to Kay, Bill had hid Bob and Emmett in his barn and they had barely escaped discovery. Sheriff Kay then spent the day in Paso Robles and learned what he could about Bill. He discovered that Bill's brothers had a reputation as horse thieves in Oklahoma, and had spent the past few months working at Bill\u2019s ranch. He then received a telegram from Tulare and learned that Bob, Emmett and Grat had spent the past few days heavily drinking, gambling and following the Southern Pacific pay car as it made its monthly journey down the [[San Joaquin Valley]].\n\nSheriff Kay was met in Paso Robles by Southern Pacific Railway detective Will Smith and San Luis Obispo County Sheriff O\u2019Neal, where he told them what he had learned. Unknown to Kay, Smith and O'Neal then made their own trip to Bill Dalton\u2019s ranch later that same day, expecting to surprise and arrest Bill, Bob, and Emmett. Sheriff Kay had been preparing his own posse to arrest the Daltons at Bill\u2019s ranch, but after learning that Smith and O\u2019Neal had already left, decided it was useless and waited for Smith to return with the Daltons. When Smith and O\u2019Neal arrived at Bill\u2019s, Bob and Emmett hid in a closet through a trapdoor that Bill had built in the attic. Bill invited the lawmen in but argued with Smith over his brother's guilt. He became angry with Smith but was calmed down by O\u2019Neal and reluctantly allowed the lawmen to stay the night. They left the next morning empty handed and Kay was furious with Smith.\n\n[[File:Photo of Robert \"Bob\" Dalton c. 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of Robert \"Bob\" Dalton c. 1889]]\n\nOn March 17, 1891, the Tulare County Grand Jury indicted brothers Bob, Emmett, Grat, and Bill Dalton for the Alila robbery. A few days later Grat and Bill were arrested and placed in the Tulare County jail. A $3000 bounty was placed for the capture of Bob and Emmett. Bill however had already helped them escape California before he was arrested, and Bob and Emmett were on their way back to Oklahoma territory. Bill was soon able to secure bondsmen and was released. He quickly hired attorneys to defend Grat. While Grat sat in jail in [[Visalia, California]], Bob and Emmett began making their way to Oklahoma. They borrowed money and supplies from their brothers, Cole and Lit, and made their way east across the Mojave Desert. After their horses were discovered at [[Ludlow, California]], Sheriff Kay decided to pursue them with his deputy, Jim Ford. He discovered that the brothers had actually made their way to Utah to throw him off, and tracked them to the town of [[Ogden, Utah]]. After some close encounters, Bob and Emmett escaped capture by train. Sheriff Kay continued to track them throughout the Southwest for several months, even at one point entering [[Mexico]], but with no success. Eventually they ended up at the Dalton home near [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]]. The Daltons had many friends in Oklahoma willing to hide them and Sheriff Kay was forced to give up the chase in order to return to California for Grat's trial. After they realized they were no longer being pursued, Bob and Emmett robbed a train at Whorton, now [[Perry, Oklahoma]], in May 1891. They then began to form what would be known as the Dalton Gang.\n\nEven though much of the evidence showed that Grat was in [[Fresno, California]] the night of the Alila robbery, including the testimony of several witnesses, the influence of the powerful [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] led him to receive an unfair trial. The lawyer the Dalton's had hired for Grat was corrupt and it was not mentioned by the defense, nor the prosecution, that the fireman had been accidentally killed by the expressman. This was unknown to Grat, since the Dalton brothers had all assumed that Emmett had killed the fireman. While Grat awaited his sentence, a train robbery occurred near [[Ceres, California]] on September 3, 1891, but was unsuccessful with no money being taken. Sheriff Kay suspected [[William M. Dalton|Bill Dalton]], and arrested him, as well a man joining Bill named Riley Dean. Kay found Bill and Dean at an abandoned overland stage station where they looked as if they were either planning a robbery, or to break Grat from jail. Both Bill and Dean established a clear alibi, but Bill was held in Tulare County Jail to await trial for his part in the Alila robbery.\n\n[[File:Daltonmountain.jpg|thumb|Dalton Mountain, Fresno County, California, Christmas Eve 2019, as viewed from the Wonder Valley Ranch Resort]]\n\nOn the night of September 20th, Grat and two other men escaped from the Tulare County Jail in Visalia while Sheriff Kay was busy in [[San Francisco, California]]. Grat and the other two men had been slipped a saw from someone on the outside and were able to saw a hole in the bars. Bill had remained in his cell, and was found in the morning playing a popular song on the guitar that he set his own words to and titled, \"You'll Never Miss My Brother Till He's Gone\", and joked about how the boys had left him. Bill was acquitted and released on October 15th. He then sold the lease to his ranch in San Luis Obispo County, moved his family to his wife's parents in [[Livingston, California]], and left for [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]]. After arresting the two other men who had escaped with Grat, Sheriff Kay learned that Grat was assisted by Riley Dean, and that they were both hiding on the summit of a steep mountain close to the Kings River, near [[Sanger, California]]. This would later be known as Dalton Mountain. On Christmas Eve, 1891, the posses of both Sheriff Kay of Tulare County, and Sheriff Hensley of Fresno County, ascended the mountain to Daltons camp. They ambushed the outlaws on their way back from a boar hunt. Riley Dean was captured, but Grat managed to escape, firing at the lawmen with his [[Winchester rifle]], and stealing a horse from the nearby Elwood ranch. Grat then rode to a friends near [[Livingston, California]], and stayed for several weeks before he escaped back to Oklahoma with the help of his brother Cole.\n\nBob and Emmett had meanwhile been busy in Oklahoma forming their gang. After their unsuccessful career in California they decided they could do much better in their home country and, unlike their first attempts, they began carefully planning their robberies. With Bob as the leader they recruited mostly men who had grown up with them in Oklahoma. First recruited were [[George Newcomb|George \"Bitter Creek\" Newcomb]] and [[\"Blackfaced\" Charlie Bryant]], Bryant received his nickname because of a gunpowder burn on one cheek. This resulted in the first robbery at Whorton, May 1891, where the gang stole $1200. Joined afterwards were [[Bill Doolin]], Dick Broadwell, Bill Powers, and [[Charley Pierce]]. The gang was also assisted by Bob's lover Eugenia Moore, known by her aliases \"Tom King\" and \"Miss Mundays\", who acted as their informant but was also a notorious horse thief and outlaw.\n\n[[File:Dalton Bill.png|thumb|Bill Dalton]]\n\nIn August 1891, Bryant was spotted in [[Hennessey, Oklahoma]], after leaving the gangs hideout to visit his mother. The locals who identified him notified a Deputy Marshal named Ed Short. He arrested Bryant and took him on a train to be committed to the jail at [[Wichita, Kansas]], without a guard or notifying Marshal Grimes at Fort Smith. After the train left Hennessey and was approaching the stop at [[Waukomis, Oklahoma]], Short noticed a group of mounted men that looked as if they were trying to beat the train, and feared it was the Dalton Gang coming to free Bryant. Short put the baggage man in charge of Bryant, giving him his revolver, while he went to the rear platform with his rifle. The baggageman carelessly stuck the revolver into a [[Pigeon-hole messagebox]] and went to work at the other end of the car. Bryant secured the revolver and ordered the baggageman to go back to work. He opened the door to the rear platform and, while Short had his attention to the mounted men, shot him in the back. Short then turned and they both shot each other to death.\n\nThe second train robbery by the Dalton Gang in Oklahoma was at a small station called Lelietta on September 15, 1891, about four miles north of [[Wagoner, Oklahoma]]. Here they secured $19,000, which Bob spent mostly on women and gambling. Many members of the gang, including Emmett, complained that the $3500 each was not enough to meet their needs. Bill Doolin complained that Bob was not dividing the money fairly, and quit the gang, along with Newcomb and Pierce. Grat returned to Oklahoma in the spring of 1892. Some time later, the three dissatisfied members also returned and new plans began to formulate. Bill had returned to Oklahoma several months earlier, living at his mothers near Kingsfisher. Even though he did not participate in any of the hold ups with his brothers, he acted as their spy and advisor.\n\nOn June 1, 1892, the gang robbed the Sante Fe train at [[Red Rock, Oklahoma]], securing about $50,000. Here the Santa Fe had found out about the Daltons plans and attempted to set up a trap for the gang, filling the train with heavily armed officers. However, they made the mistake of leaving the train dark which made Bob suspicious, and the gang allowed the train to go by. They then robbed the next train a few minutes later. The $50,000 however came out to only $1800 after draft and securities had been thrown out. After splitting the money amongst themselves it was soon necessary to rob another train.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=50\u2013209 |isbn=1892622149 }}</ref>\n\nThe next robbery was on July 14th, at [[Adair, Oklahoma]], near the [[Arkansas]] border. At the station the gang took what they could find in the express and baggage rooms. They sat to wait for the next train on a bench on the platform, talking and smoking, with their [[Winchester rifle]]s across their knees. When the train came in at 9:45&nbsp;p.m., they backed a wagon up to the express car and unloaded all the contents. The eight armed guards on the train all happened to be at the back of the train when it pulled in. They fired at the bandits through the car windows and from behind the train. In the gun fight, 200 shots were fired. None of the Dalton gang was hit. Doctors W. L. Goff and Youngblood were sitting on the porch of the drug store near the depot. Both men were hit several times by stray shots; Dr Goff was fatally wounded. Also wounded were captains Kinney and LaFlore, but they recovered.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalton Gang Train Robbery at Adair, I.T.|url=https://www.lasr.net/travel/city.php?Historic+Dalton+Gang+Robbery&TravelTo=OK0306001&VA=Y&Attraction_ID=OK0306001a002|website=Lasr.net|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref> The gang secured about $18,000. They were also accused of robbing a bank in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] on July 28, however this was based on little evidence as no one saw any members of the gang.\n\n==Coffeyville bank robbery==\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Coffeyville Bank Robbery\n| partof      = \n| image       = Condon Bank Coffeyville, Kansas c. 1890.jpg\n| caption     = Condon Bank Coffeyville, Kansas c. 1890 one of the two banks the Dalton Gang attempted to rob.\n| date        = October 5, 1892\n| place       = [[Coffeyville, Kansas]]\n| result      = Dalton Gang suppressed\n| combatant1  = Dalton Gang\n| combatant2  = Coffeyville citizenry\n| commander1  = [[Bob Dalton (outlaw)|Robert Dalton]] {{KIA}}\n| commander2  = [[U.S. Marshal]] Charles Connelly {{KIA}}\n| strength1   = 5 outlaws\n| strength2   = armed citizenry\n| casualties1 = 4 killed\n1 wounded and captured\n| casualties2 = 4 killed\n4-6 wounded\n}}\n\nBob Dalton had ambitions. He would, he claimed, \"beat anything [[Jesse James]] ever did&mdash;rob two banks at once, in broad daylight.\" On October 5, 1892, the Dalton gang attempted this feat when they set out to rob the C.M. Condon & Company's Bank and the First National Bank on opposite sides of the street in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/daltons.htm|title=The Dalton Gang's Last Raid, 1892|website=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> Bob had planned the entire robbery. Emmett however was against the idea. He had gone to school at Robbins Corners near Coffeyville and knew several hundred people in town. He was afraid some of his friends would be hurt, but Bob assured him there wouldn't be any shooting and that it would all be over before anyone knew what happened. The plan was that Bob and Emmett were to rob the First National Bank while Grat, Broadwell, and Powers robbed the Condon Bank across the street. Emmett thought Grat would mess things up if he went alone with Powers and Broadwell, and thought they should trade places. This led to a heavy argument between Bob and Emmett and created bitterness between them on the way to the robbery.\n\nBob had planned for the gang to tie their horses to a post behind the Condon Bank, where it was protected from the center of town by brick walls. They had not been to the town for several years however and the hitching post had since been removed during street work. Bob would not allow Emmett to check out town beforehand in fear that he would be recognized, so this was not factored into their plan. When they arrived Bob had to think quickly and decided instead to tie their horses in an alley across from the bank to the west, near the city jail, which offered them little protection. This is now known as Dalton Alley.\n\nOn the morning of October 5, the gang emerged from the alley onto the plaza of Coffeyville. A storekeeper who was sweeping the sidewalk a few feet away noticed Bob, Emmett, and even Grat who was wearing a fake mustache, and ran inside his store. In close order the five crossed Walnut Street from the alley to the Condon Bank, holding Winchester rifles close along their legs. Grat, Broadwell, and Powers entered the Condon Bank and Emmett and Bob hurried across Union Street to the First National Bank. There was street work being done at the time and one of the workers noticed the men dog trotting across the alley with rifles, and began to yell, \"The Daltons are robbing the bank!\" Very soon half the businessmen around the plaza knew what was going on and the message quickly passed throughout the town.\n\nGrat entered the Condon Bank and pointed his Winchester at the cashier, ordering his hands up, while Powers and Broadwell took positions at the door. Grat went to the back office and ordered the manager into the front, he then handed the cashier a sack bag and ordered him to fill it with cash from the money drawer. Then, noticing the vault door was open, Grat ordered both of them into the vault where the safe with the gold was. When told to open the safe the manager lied, telling Grat it was a time lock and that it would not open for another ten minutes. Grat believed him and decided he would wait until it opened. He then ordered the bags of silver on the vault floor into his bag, containing $1000 and weighing about two hundred pounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Emmett and Bob had entered the First National Bank, covered the officers and two customers, and ordered the cashier, Thomas Aryes, to open the safe where there was gold and cash. They put the gold into the sack, forced Aryes in front of them as cover, and went out the front door. They had planned to meet up with Grat and cross the plaza to the alley where they could make their escape, but word of the robbery had spread through town. As they exited the door an [[American Express]] agent opened fire with his revolver. Bob and Emmett returned fire and left Aryes on the sidewalk. They turned around, and went through the back door, carrying both rifles and sack bags while taking two other bank employees as cover.\n\nGrat heard the revolver shots from the Express agent. He then decided the sack bag was too heavy to carry and ordered the silver taken out, then stashed what cash he could fit into his coat pockets. Two hardware stores in the town had meanwhile began passing out guns to the local citizens, who began firing through the windows at the Condon Bank. The three returned fire and held out, waiting for the time lock to open. Several citizens were wounded in the fighting.\n\nWhen Emmett and Bob went out the back door of the First National Bank, they were met by Lucius Baldwin who had been watching the door with his pistol. Bob ordered him to drop the gun and, when he failed to answer, shot him with his Winchester killing him. Bob and Emmett then made their way to the end of the back alley onto Eighth Street where they could hear the townspeople shooting at the Condon Bank. Outside of a drug store across from the First National, George Cubine was standing with his Winchester aimed at the front door of the bank, awaiting the exit of Bob and Emmett. Bob shot him in the head. Cubine's partner, Charles Brown, was standing unarmed next to him and went to pick up his winchester. As he lifted the rifle up, Bob shot and killed him.\n\nAfter being left on the sidewalk by Bob and Emmett, Thomas Aryes had run into one of the hardware stores and grabbed a rifle. He spotted Bob just as he had killed Brown and aimed his rifle at him from behind the store window. Bob saw Aryes from about two hundred feet away and quickly shot him in the head. Aryes was not killed, but he would remain paralyzed for life.\n\nAs bullets were showering into the Condon Bank, Powers told Grat he had been hit in the arm. Grat ordered the employees to lay on the floor in the back office and, after receiving the signal from Bob, told Powers and Broadwell that it was time to leave. The three went out the side door crouching and dashing across Walnut Street to the alley where they had hitched their horses. Bob and Emmett met Grat and the others in the alley, the sacks of money still over their arms.\n\n[[File:Law enforcement officers hold up the bodies of Bob and Grat Dalton.jpg|thumb|left|Law enforcement officers hold up the bodies of Bob(23) and Grat(31) Dalton after the attempted Bank Robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas]]\n\nAs the Daltons made their way east down the alley towards the horses town Marshal, Charles T. Connelly, came through the livery stable into the alley and ran west towards the plaza without noticing the bandits behind him. Grat then shot him in the head and killed him. Following behind Marshal Connelly was John Kholer, still in the stable. Grat noticed him but before he could aim Kholer shot him in the throat.\n\nTaking fire from the hardware store Bob was hit in the head and the heart, killing him instantly. Powers tried to mount his horse but shots from the store also killed him. Emmett was able to mount his horse unwounded and began riding away but, after noticing Bob was hit, turned around and attempted to lift Bob onto his horse. Emmett was then hit in the back with a load of buckshot. Broadwell was hit several times but managed to ride away. He was found two miles away dead.\n\n[[File:Emmet at Dr. Wells After Coffeyville raid.jpg|thumb|right|Emmett(21) at the office of Dr. Walter Wells after the attempted bank robbery in Coffeyville]]\n\nBill Dalton and Bill Doolin had been waiting several miles away with extra horses to aid the gangs escape. After getting tired of waiting they left, only to learn later the fate of the gang.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latta |first=Frank |date=1976 |title=Dalton Gang Days:From California to Coffeeville |publisher=Bear State Books |pages=209\u2013265 |isbn=1892622149 }}</ref>\n\nGrat and Bob Dalton, Dick Broadwell and Bill Powers were all killed. [[Emmett Dalton]] received 23 gunshot wounds and survived (he was shot through the right arm, below the shoulder, through the left \u2013 right, in some accounts \u2013 hip and groin, and received 18-23 buckshot in his back).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kayempea.net/coffeyville.shtml|title=Emmett Dalton Biography \u00a6 Oct. 5-10, 1892|website=Kayempea.net|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref> He was given a life sentence in the [[Kansas State Penitentiary]] in [[Lansing, Kansas]], of which he served 14 years before being pardoned. He moved to [[Hollywood, California]] and became a real estate agent, author and actor, and died in 1937 at age 66. Bill Doolin, \"Bitter Creek\" Newcomb, and Charlie Pierce, none of whom were at Coffeyville, were the only members left of the original Dalton Gang.\n\nYears after the robberies and his release from prison, Emmett Dalton said that the relentless pressure put on them by Deputy US Marshal [[Heck Thomas]] as he hunted for them was a key factor in his gang's decision to commit the robberies. They hoped that a big haul from the banks would allow them to leave the territory and escape Thomas' heat.\n\nBill Doolin started a new gang with the Dalton Gang's remaining members. Bill Dalton would eventually join and become one of the leaders. The gang then became known as the [[Doolin-Dalton Gang]]. Dalton was reportedly one of the participants in a gun battle on September 1, 1893 at [[Ingalls, Oklahoma|Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory]]. Three deputy U. S. marshals were killed in the shootout. He may have been one of a four-man gang who robbed the First National Bank of [[Longview, Texas]], on May 21, 1894. He was shot and killed by a posse near [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]] on June 8, 1894. Nine of the deputy U.S. marshals who killed Bill Dalton were indicted for his murder in the federal court at Ardmore in June 1896. Apparently, none were ever tried. Why they were indicted remains a mystery.<ref name=\"EOHC-DaltonGang\">Samuelson, Nancy B.
