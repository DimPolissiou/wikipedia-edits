In the early 1990s, he was a part of the tag team [[The Bad Breed]] with [[Ian Rotten]]. He had a short stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1991, but he was best known for his appearances with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) from 1993 to 1999.<ref name=\"Eck\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-06-12/sports/0506120091_1_knighton-professional-wrestling-matches-pro-wrestling|title=After 'Rotten' past, he returns to center stage|date=June 12, 2005|author=Eck, Kevin|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBad Breed competed in ECW's tag team division in the early years of the company until the team was forced to disband after losing to [[The Pitbulls]] and engaged in a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] against each other that ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' named [[List of Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Feud of the Year|Feud of the Year]] in 1995. After an unsuccessful singles career, Rotten formed short-lived tag teams with [[Hack Meyers]] and [[D-Von Dudley]] before forming Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks with [[Balls Mahoney]] in 1997. The team lasted until Rotten departed ECW in 1999. Knighton then wrestled on the independent circuit and appeared at [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] pay-per-view in 2005.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n[[image:AxlRottenApril2009Turnbuckle.png|left|thumb|250px|Rotten wrestling on the [[independent circuit]] in 2009]]\n\n===Training and independent circuit (1986\u20131993)===\nKnighton was trained to wrestle by [[Ricky Lawless]] at a gym on Baltimore's [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|North Avenue]], receiving supplementary training from [[Joey Maggs]]. He debuted on the [[independent circuit]] at the age of 17, adopting the ring name \"Axl Rotten\", a [[portmanteau]] of the [[Rock music|rockers]] [[Axl Rose]] and [[Johnny Rotten]].<ref name=\"Eck\"/> Rotten won his first championship teaming with Lawless to win the tag team titles in Frank Cain's Star Cavalcade Wrestling during the summer of 1988. He also succeeded Lawless as the promotion's heavyweight champion when, shortly after reigning champion Ricky Lawless was murdered, he won the vacant title from The Psycho in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] on November 30, 1988.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nIn the early 1990s, Rotten trained [[Ian Rotten]], who formed a [[tag team]] with Axl, masquerading as his brother and taking his stage name from [[Tommy Chong]]'s character in ''[[Get Out of My Room]]''. The duo, known as [[The Bad Breed]], wrestled primarily in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. Axl later opened his own [[professional wrestling promotion]] in Maryland called Universal Independent Wrestling. The promotion featured wrestlers such as the Bad Breed, [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and [[Raven (wrestler)|Scotty The Body]]. It had a television series that aired on Saturday nights on the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] channel. The promotion closed in the mid-1990s.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, Axl and Ian Rotten had a run with the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF) in Texas, being featured on their daily [[ESPN]] show. While in GWF, Axl succeeded in winning both the GWF Commonwealth title and the GWF Tag Team Championship, with Ian Rotten.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1991)===\n[[image:AxlRottenChair2009.png|thumb|right|300px|Rotten holding one of his signature chairs in 2009]]\nIn 1991, Rotten had a short stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), where he feuded with [[P.N.

After an unsuccessful singles career, Rotten formed short-lived tag teams with [[Hack Meyers]] and [[D-Von Dudley]] before forming Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks with [[Balls Mahoney]] in 1997. The team lasted until Rotten departed ECW in 1999.

He debuted on the [[independent circuit]] at the age of 17, adopting the ring name \"Axl Rotten\", a [[portmanteau]] of the [[Rock music|rockers]] [[Axl Rose]] and [[Johnny Rotten]].<ref name=\"Eck\"/> Rotten won his first championship teaming with Lawless to win the tag team titles in Frank Cain's Star Cavalcade Wrestling during the summer of 1988. He also succeeded Lawless as the promotion's heavyweight champion when, shortly after reigning champion Ricky Lawless was murdered, he won the vacant title from The Psycho in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] on November 30, 1988.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nIn the early 1990s, Rotten trained [[Ian Rotten]], who formed a [[tag team]] with Axl, masquerading as his brother and taking his stage name from [[Tommy Chong]]'s character in ''[[Get Out of My Room]]''. The duo, known as [[The Bad Breed]], wrestled primarily in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. Axl later opened his own [[professional wrestling promotion]] in Maryland called Universal Independent Wrestling. The promotion featured wrestlers such as the Bad Breed, [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and [[Raven (wrestler)|Scotty The Body]]. It had a television series that aired on Saturday nights on the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] channel. The promotion closed in the mid-1990s.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, Axl and Ian Rotten had a run with the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF) in Texas, being featured on their daily [[ESPN]] show.

Adam is handling the legal case of a former policeman named Martin Killane who does not wish to be evicted from his home, and Adam learns that his own father Ed is on the board of the adversarial land development company. Meanwhile, Adam still has no word from Corinne. Adam learns from Daisy's mother Vicky (who, like Corinne, is a teacher at the school) that nude photos purportedly of her young daughter Ella have been released to the entire school. It is revealed that Mike decapitated the alpaca while under the influence of drugs, so he, Thomas, and Daisy plot to dispose of the animal's severed head.

Johanna asks Wes to hide the fact that she knew Heidi so that she can be assigned to the investigation.  Adam confronts Mike's dad, Doug, after learning that the secretive phone call that Corinne made on the day of her disappearance was to him.  Doug tells Adam that the phone call concerned the money stolen from the football club and that Corinne wanted more time to sort the situation out and to show her innocence. At the murder investigation, Katz attempts to throw suspicion on Heidi's husband or a burglar, and volunteers to check the security videotape.  Thomas and Ryan tell Adam that they have tracked Corinne's phone and the three of them, with Killane, drive toward it, but they eventually find the phone abandoned on a bridge.

Johanna interviews Adam, unaware that Corinne is missing, telling him that Corinne's key fob was found at the caf\u00e9 where Heidi was murdered. As Katz looks on, Adam tells Johanna of the visit from The Stranger that sparked Corinne's disappearance, and about the other victims he is aware of. Thomas and Mike go to see Daisy, and Mike confronts her over her belief that he had proliferated the nude photos of Ella. She believes his protestations of innocence, and admits to having drugged him with PCP during the rave, confessing that Olivia was the person who had accused Mike to her. They go to see Olivia, but her mother lies, saying that Olivia is still in the hospital. The Stranger and her friend wonder why they had not heard from Heidi and learn online that she had been murdered, thereupon deciding to immediately shut down their operation. Phillip (Johanna's estranged husband) visits her at work. Katz admits to never commencing a missing person's investigation for Corinne; after seeing the file, Wes and Johanna realize that Corinne is the woman whom Dante had filmed.

Katz visits the Powers', a man-and-wife who own the company Ethical Share, which aims to open investment to the masses by handling trades through churches. Mr Powers says that Katz is the head of security for the venture. He then tells Powers that the evidence packet he got from Heidi shows that Powers was deeply involved with Kimberley. Adam tells Johanna of Killane's confession. Johanna tells him that Corinne's car was located, and together they go to it and discover one of Corinne's earrings in the rear seat.  Thomas, Mike, and Daisy decide to try again to confront Olivia; she admits to Thomas that it was she, not Mike, who sent the photos from Ella's phone out of jealousy for Mike's attention. Adam tells Johanna about Ingrid. Wes finds Ingrid's office cleaned out.  Interviewing caf\u00e9 workers about Heidi's last days, Johanna learns of Heidi's meeting with The Stranger and Ingrid in a car park; she telephones the station to ask Wes to pull security video. Johanna shows the videotape to Kimberley, who confesses to her work with the Sugar Baby website and to being made aware by her mother of the blackmail.

Dante, recovering in hospital, is interviewed by Johanna; he tells her that Daisy absconded with his clothes after an invitation to skinny-dip. He said he then was discovered by Max Bonner (Robert Ewens), the sports-club caretaker, who chased him with an axe, but that he remembers nothing more. Johanna and Wes interview Max, who claims he was only harvesting firewood and did no harm to Dante, who simply tripped and fell. Ed brings Peter Ince, a private investigator, to Adam to assist in the search for Corinne. Adam tells Ed and Peter about Corinne's fake pregnancy, his own affair, and The Stranger, prompting Ed to relate that The Stranger had visited him as well. Since The Stranger had been in the hospital while Killane was there, Ed surmises that the two are connected and Ed, Peter, and Adam begin to go through Killane's possessions, which Ed's company holds in storage. Johanna eulogizes Heidi at her memorial, while Wes reviews the case evidence. Johanna goes to Katz' house, and he tells her about his daughter's poisoning.

Katz assaults Leila, who cries for help and Johanna escapes to a neighbor. Katz takes Leila's car, in possession of Johanna's phone, and drives away. Peter tracks The Stranger (Christine Killane's) home address. Adam phones Johanna, reaching Katz, saying that The Stranger has been identified, and promising to text the location to Johanna's phone later, which he does on arrival at Christine's home address. Adam enters the apartment building, then is attacked and knocked unconscious by Ingrid.  He wakes in The Stranger's apartment, chained to an anchored table. She tells of finding out later that her father had killed her mother.  She also discloses that she learned that Killane (unbeknownst to him) is not actually her biological father, and that she is in fact Adam's half-sister through an affair Ed had with her mother.  Katz bursts in brandishing a gun and holding Ingrid hostage; he tosses Ingrid to the ground then shoots her in the stomach. Adam escapes from his chains and attacks Katz, but is overpowered.  When Katz shoots at Adam, Christine jumps in front to take the bullet in her back. Police enter to take control of the situation. Johanna arrests Katz for Heidi's murder. Christine is hospitalized; Ingrid dies of her wounds. Christine admits to Adam that Bob, the football coach, had hired her to dig dirt on Corinne. Adam confronts Bob, and Bob tells Adam that Doug claimed Corinne stole the money from the football club and that she intended to pin the theft on Bob.  Adam drives to Doug's house and confronts him about stealing the money and sending texts from Corinne's phone after her disappearance, pulling a gun that Christine passed to him in the hospital. In fear, Doug offers to take Adam to Corinne, who is in the countryside. Johanna visits the school to have Thomas use the phone tracker to locate Adam.  On reaching the site, Doug admits to killing and burying Corinne, and Adam locates her body in a shallow grave.  Adam shoots and kills Doug as Johanna arrives.  In an epilogue set six months later, Johanna has reunited with Phillip after her retirement, and she attends one of Ryan's football matches; Ed also attends. Bob coaches, Dante films the match, Thomas and Daisy are an item, Christine has jumped bail, and a flashback reveals that Johanna covered up the evidence of Adam's killing Doug and that she pinned Corinne's death on Katz, who is due for sentencing. In the final scene, Christine is shown observing the football match from afar.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in January 2019 that [[Netflix]] had begun development of a [[miniseries]] based on the [[Harlan Coben]] novel, with the adaptation being written by [[Danny Brocklehurst]] and with [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] set to star.<ref name=\"Armitage\">{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Peter|title=Richard Armitage To Star In Netflix Thriller 'The Stranger' With Harlan Coben & 'Safe' Team|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/richard-armitage-the-stranger-netflix-1202543129/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=21 December 2019|date=28 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117135205/https://deadline.com/2019/01/richard-armitage-the-stranger-netflix-1202543129/|archive-date=17 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> By March, the cast was rounded out, with the additions including [[Siobhan Finneran]], [[Hannah John-Kamen]], [[Jennifer Saunders]], [[Anthony Head]] and [[Stephen Rea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/the-stranger-casting-1202570113/|title='Happy Valley's Siobhan Finneran & 'Ready Player One's Hannah John-Kamen Join Netflix's 'The Stranger'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Peter|last=White|date=5 March 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218042651/https://deadline.com/2019/03/the-stranger-casting-1202570113/|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in March 2019, taking place in [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ilovemanchester.com/filming-starts-in-manchester-on-new-netflix-drama-the-stranger/|title=Filming starts in Manchester on new Netflix drama The Stranger|website=ilovemanchester|first=Susan|last=Griffin|date=6 March 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref> Scenes were shot in [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] and [[Bolton]] in April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17568191.upcoming-netflix-series-the-stranger-filming-in-bolton/|title=Upcoming Netflix series The Stranger filming in Bolton|website=The Bolton News|first=Tom|last=Molloy|date=11 April 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929172242/https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17568191.upcoming-netflix-series-the-stranger-filming-in-bolton/|archive-date=29 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and in [[Stockport]] in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edwardmellor.co.uk/news/netflix-the-stranger-filming-in-stockport-tomorrow/|title=New Netflix Drama 'The Stranger' will be Filming in Stockport Tomorrow|website=Edward Mellor Estate Agents Ltd|date=27 June 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929172425/https://edwardmellor.co.uk/news/netflix-the-stranger-filming-in-stockport-tomorrow/|archive-date=29 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 86% approval rating for the miniseries with an average rating of 6.63/10, based on 21 reviews.

Adam finds a photo of Killane with The Stranger, who returns to the hospital and enters Killane's room, calling him dad.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Daniel O'Hara\n |WrittenBy       = Danny Brocklehurst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|30|df=yes}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katz' ex-wife, Leila, goes to his home, demanding to know where to find Olivia. Katz assaults Leila, who cries for help and Johanna escapes to a neighbor. Katz takes Leila's car, in possession of Johanna's phone, and drives away. Peter tracks The Stranger (Christine Killane's) home address. Adam phones Johanna, reaching Katz, saying that The Stranger has been identified, and promising to text the location to Johanna's phone later, which he does on arrival at Christine's home address. Adam enters the apartment building, then is attacked and knocked unconscious by Ingrid.  He wakes in The Stranger's apartment, chained to an anchored table. She tells of finding out later that her father had killed her mother.  She also discloses that she learned that Killane (unbeknownst to him) is not actually her biological father, and that she is in fact Adam's half-sister through an affair Ed had with her mother.  Katz bursts in brandishing a gun and holding Ingrid hostage; he tosses Ingrid to the ground then shoots her in the stomach. Adam escapes from his chains and attacks Katz, but is overpowered.  When Katz shoots at Adam, Christine jumps in front to take the bullet in her back. Police enter to take control of the situation. Johanna arrests Katz for Heidi's murder. Christine is hospitalized; Ingrid dies of her wounds. Christine admits to Adam that Bob, the football coach, had hired her to dig dirt on Corinne. Adam confronts Bob, and Bob tells Adam that Doug claimed Corinne stole the money from the football club and that she intended to pin the theft on Bob.  Adam drives to Doug's house and confronts him about stealing the money and sending texts from Corinne's phone after her disappearance, pulling a gun that Christine passed to him in the hospital. In fear, Doug offers to take Adam to Corinne, who is in the countryside. Johanna visits the school to have Thomas use the phone tracker to locate Adam.  On reaching the site, Doug admits to killing and burying Corinne, and Adam locates her body in a shallow grave.  Adam shoots and kills Doug as Johanna arrives.  In an epilogue set six months later, Johanna has reunited with Phillip after her retirement, and she attends one of Ryan's football matches; Ed also attends. Bob coaches, Dante films the match, Thomas and Daisy are an item, Christine has jumped bail, and a flashback reveals that Johanna covered up the evidence of Adam's killing Doug and that she pinned Corinne's death on Katz, who is due for sentencing. In the final scene, Christine is shown observing the football match from afar.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in January 2019 that [[Netflix]] had begun development of a [[miniseries]] based on the [[Harlan Coben]] novel, with the adaptation being written by [[Danny Brocklehurst]] and with [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] set to star.<ref name=\"Armitage\">{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Peter|title=Richard Armitage To Star In Netflix Thriller 'The Stranger' With Harlan Coben & 'Safe' Team|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/richard-armitage-the-stranger-netflix-1202543129/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=21 December 2019|date=28 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117135205/https://deadline.com/2019/01/richard-armitage-the-stranger-netflix-1202543129/|archive-date=17 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> By March, the cast was rounded out, with the additions including [[Siobhan Finneran]], [[Hannah John-Kamen]], [[Jennifer Saunders]], [[Anthony Head]] and [[Stephen Rea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/the-stranger-casting-1202570113/|title='Happy Valley's Siobhan Finneran & 'Ready Player One's Hannah John-Kamen Join Netflix's 'The Stranger'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Peter|last=White|date=5 March 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218042651/https://deadline.com/2019/03/the-stranger-casting-1202570113/|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in March 2019, taking place in [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ilovemanchester.com/filming-starts-in-manchester-on-new-netflix-drama-the-stranger/|title=Filming starts in Manchester on new Netflix drama The Stranger|website=ilovemanchester|first=Susan|last=Griffin|date=6 March 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref> Scenes were shot in [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] and [[Bolton]] in April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17568191.upcoming-netflix-series-the-stranger-filming-in-bolton/|title=Upcoming Netflix series The Stranger filming in Bolton|website=The Bolton News|first=Tom|last=Molloy|date=11 April 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929172242/https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17568191.upcoming-netflix-series-the-stranger-filming-in-bolton/|archive-date=29 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and in [[Stockport]] in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edwardmellor.co.uk/news/netflix-the-stranger-filming-in-stockport-tomorrow/|title=New Netflix Drama 'The Stranger' will be Filming in Stockport Tomorrow|website=Edward Mellor Estate Agents Ltd|date=27 June 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929172425/https://edwardmellor.co.uk/news/netflix-the-stranger-filming-in-stockport-tomorrow/|archive-date=29 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 86% approval rating for the miniseries with an average rating of 6.63/10, based on 21 reviews.

''Video Games Live: Level 3'' was released in 2014, and was funded by 5,679 fans on [[Kickstarter]], beating its goal of $250,000 by $35,081. Unlike the previous albums, this one was recorded in a studio featuring a full orchestra, a 60-person choir, a full rock band and video game composers from around the world. Each segment was personally arranged and orchestrated by their original composers and input from the game designers, developers, and publishers was used, some of which were invited to play in the record themselves. The album was the third-largest album funded on Kickstarter at the time. Level 3 was recorded in a studio with over 175 musicians, primarily the [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Chorus, conducted by [[Emmanuel Fratianni]] and mixed at [[Skywalker Ranch]] by [[Leslie Ann Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reese|first1=Emily|title='Video Games Live: Level 3' on Top Score|url=http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2014/03/13/video-games-live-level-3-on-top-score|website=classicalMPR|publisher=classicalMPR|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Chalk|first1=Andy|title=Video Games Live Kickstarts Level 3|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/126846-Video-Games-Live-Kickstarts-Level-3|website=The Escapist magazine|publisher=The Escapist magazine|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref> The album featured compositions and performances by [[Akira Yamaoka]] (''[[Silent Hill]]''), [[Norihiko Hibino]] (''Metal Gear Solid''), and Jillian Aversa (''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' and ''Halo'').

Also like Level 3, it was performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus and conducted by Fratianni. As a bonus for exceeding the financial goal of the Kickstarter campaign, VGL released ''Through Time and Space: Chrono Piano Album'' concomitantly. It features music composed by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] for the games ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', with the piano versions arranged by Laura Intravia (also providing vocals) and performed by Brendon Shapiro.<ref name=\"kickstarter.com\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1916334303/video-games-live-level-4-lets-do-it-again/description</ref><ref name=\"kickstarter.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=VIDEO GAMES LIVE - LEVEL 4|url=http://hitparade.ch/compilation/Video-Games-Live-Level-4-299428|website=hitparade|publisher=hitparade|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Video Games Live: Level 5'' was released in 2016. VGL also used Kickstarter, raising $264,931 through 3,658 backers. VGL worked with the Prague Philharmonic with [[E\u00edmear Noone]] conducting and [[Leslie Ann Jones]] engineering at Skywalker Ranch. As a bonus for exceeding the goal, the project includes a documentary on the making of the music, plus added tracks. The project involved another piano album, ''Shall we Play?

''Video Games Live: Level 3'' was released in 2014, and was funded by 5,679 fans on [[Kickstarter]], beating its goal of $250,000 by $35,081. Unlike the previous albums, this one was recorded in a studio featuring a full orchestra, a 60-person choir, a full rock band and video game composers from around the world. Each segment was personally arranged and orchestrated by their original composers and input from the game designers, developers, and publishers was used, some of which were invited to play in the record themselves. The album was the third-largest album funded on Kickstarter at the time. Level 3 was recorded in a studio with over 175 musicians, primarily the [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Chorus, conducted by [[Emmanuel Fratianni]] and mixed at [[Skywalker Ranch]] by [[Leslie Ann Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reese|first1=Emily|title='Video Games Live: Level 3' on Top Score|url=http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2014/03/13/video-games-live-level-3-on-top-score|website=classicalMPR|publisher=classicalMPR|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Chalk|first1=Andy|title=Video Games Live Kickstarts Level 3|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/126846-Video-Games-Live-Kickstarts-Level-3|website=The Escapist magazine|publisher=The Escapist magazine|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref> The album featured compositions and performances by [[Akira Yamaoka]] (''[[Silent Hill]]''), [[Norihiko Hibino]] (''Metal Gear Solid''), and Jillian Aversa (''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' and ''Halo'').

The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.<ref>King, Anthony. (2004). The new symbols of European football. ''International Review for the Sociology of Sport 39''(3).

According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".<ref>TEAM. (1999).

The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd\u20134th in their national championship.\n\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the [[UEFA coefficients#League coefficient|UEFA coefficients]] of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/Europa League]] seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\n\nFour of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between the 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, or third in their respective national league.\n\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[FC Petr\u017ealka akad\u00e9mia|Artmedia Bratislava]] became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds.

Real Madrid holds the record for the most consecutive appearances in the group stage, having qualified 22 times in a row (1997\u2013present). They are followed by Arsenal on 19 (1998\u20132016)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2015/matches/live/index.html?day=-1&session=2&match=2014212|title=The official website for European football&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> and Manchester United on 18 (1996\u20132013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euro.futbal.org/EC1.scorers.php?team=Manchester%20United&mode=1&year=0&ignoreQuals=1|title=EuroFutbal&nbsp;\u2013 Manchester United}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds.\n\nAn [[Liverpool F.C. 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League qualification|exception to the usual European qualification system]] happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season.

However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league.

A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.<ref name=\"referees\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/referees/index.html|title=UEFA Referee|publisher=Uefa.com|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Appointment===\nIn co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n===Limitations===\nSince 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness. Today, UEFA Champions League referees are required to pass a fitness test even to be considered at the international level.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n==Prizes==\n===Trophy and medals===\n{{main|European Champion Clubs' Cup}}\n[[File:Trofeo UEFA Champions League.jpg|thumb|Official trophy]]\nEach year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967.

When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Craig|last2=Magnus|first2=Ems|date=February 2003|title=The Uefa Champions League Marketing|journal=Fiba Assist Magazine|pages=49\u201350|url=http://www.ekospor.com/Sports-Marketing/Sport%20Marketing%20uefa.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528155330/http://www.ekospor.com/Sports-Marketing/Sport%20Marketing%20uefa.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|2012\u201313 knockout phase]], UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knock-out participant stadiums, including the final stage.

This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.<ref>King, Anthony. (2004). The new symbols of European football. ''International Review for the Sociology of Sport 39''(3). London, Thousand Oaks, CA, New Delhi.</ref> TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".<ref>TEAM. (1999).

The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd\u20134th in their national championship.\n\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the [[UEFA coefficients#League coefficient|UEFA coefficients]] of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/Europa League]] seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\n\nFour of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between the 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, or third in their respective national league.\n\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[FC Petr\u017ealka akad\u00e9mia|Artmedia Bratislava]] became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds.

Real Madrid holds the record for the most consecutive appearances in the group stage, having qualified 22 times in a row (1997\u2013present). They are followed by Arsenal on 19 (1998\u20132016)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2015/matches/live/index.html?day=-1&session=2&match=2014212|title=The official website for European football&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> and Manchester United on 18 (1996\u20132013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euro.futbal.org/EC1.scorers.php?team=Manchester%20United&mode=1&year=0&ignoreQuals=1|title=EuroFutbal&nbsp;\u2013 Manchester United}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds.\n\nAn [[Liverpool F.C. 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League qualification|exception to the usual European qualification system]] happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season.

However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league.

A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.<ref name=\"referees\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/referees/index.html|title=UEFA Referee|publisher=Uefa.com|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Appointment===\nIn co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n===Limitations===\nSince 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness.

Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while Varangians to Russia.  The [[Hanseatic League]] was an alliance of trading cities that maintained a trade [[monopoly]] over most of [[Northern Europe]] and the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], between the 13th and 17th centuries.\n\n===The Age of Sail and the Industrial Revolution===\n[[Vasco da Gama]] pioneered the European [[Spice trade]] in 1498 when he reached [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] after sailing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and helped spur the [[Age of Discovery]] in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight, sometimes rivaling [[gold]].\n\nFrom 1070 onward, kingdoms in West Africa became [[Economic history of Africa|significant members of global trade]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A fistful of shells : West Africa from the rise of the slave trade to the age of revolution|last=Green, Toby, 1974-|isbn=9780226644578|location=Chicago|oclc=1051687994|date = 2019-03-21}}</ref> This came initially through the movement of gold and other resources sent out by Muslim traders on the [[Trans-Saharan trade|Trans-Saharan trading]] network.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later, West Africa exported gold, spices, cloth, and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] to European traders such as the Portuguese, Dutch, and English.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was often in exchange for cloth, iron, or [[cowrie shells]] which were used locally as currency.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFounded in 1352, the [[Bengal Sultanate]] was a major [[trading nation]] in the world and often referred to by the Europeans as the richest country to trade with.<ref>Nanda, J.

According to economic historian [[Toby Green]], in Kongo \"giving more than receiving was a symbol of spiritual and political power, and privilege.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Seventeen Provinces]] were the centre of free trade, imposing no [[exchange control]]s, and advocating the free movement of goods.  Trade in the [[East Indies]] was dominated by Portugal in the 16th century, the [[Dutch Republic]] in the 17th century, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the 18th century. The [[Spanish Empire]] developed regular trade links across both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.\n\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson - Gda\u0144sk in the XVII century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Danzig]] in the 17th century, a port of the [[Hanseatic League]].]]\nIn 1776, [[Adam Smith]] published the paper ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. It criticised [[Mercantilism]], and argued that [[economic]] specialisation could benefit nations just as much as firms.  Since the [[division of labour]] was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more [[productive]]. Smith said that he considered all rationalisations of [[International trade|import]] and [[export]] controls \"dupery\", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries.\n\nIn 1799, the [[Dutch East India Company]], formerly the world's largest company, became [[bankrupt]], partly due to the rise of competitive free trade.\n[[File:Berber Trade with Timbuktu 1300s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Berber people|Berber]] trade with [[Timbuktu]], 1853.]]\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of [[comparative advantage]]. In [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]] Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in [[economics]]:\n: ''When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.''\n\nThe ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to imports.\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]] proved that a country with monopoly [[pricing power]] on the international market could manipulate the [[terms of trade]] through maintaining [[tariff]]s, and that the response to this might be [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in trade policy.  Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier.  This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the [[economic surplus]] of trade would accrue to a country following ''reciprocal'', rather than completely free, trade policies.  This was followed within a few years by the [[infant industry]] scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that government had the duty to [[protectionism|protect]] young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to [[industrialize|industrialise]] and out-compete English exporters. [[Milton Friedman]] later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.<ref>Price theory Milton Friedman</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe [[Great Depression]] was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s.  During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators.\n\nThe lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression causing stagnation and inflation.<ref>(secondary) [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] \u2013 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/ history]</ref>  Only during the [[World War II]] the recession ended in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the [[Bretton Woods Agreement]], intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions.  It set up rules and institutions to regulate the [[international political economy]]: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements).  These organisations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement.

This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years.\n\n[[Numismatist]]s have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of [[precious metal]].<ref name=\"originsofmoney\">Gold was an especially common form of early money, as described in [[#Davies2002|Davies (2002)]].</ref>\n\n==Trends==\n\n===Doha rounds===\n{{Main|Doha round}}\n\nThe Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aimed to lower [[trade barrier|barriers to trade]] around the world, with a focus on making [[fair trade|trade fairer]] for [[developing countries]].  Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich [[developed countries]], represented by the [[G20]], and the major developing countries. [[Agricultural subsidies]] are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on [[trade facilitation]] and capacity building. The Doha round began in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], and negotiations were continued in: [[Canc\u00fan]], Mexico; [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]; and [[Paris]], [[France]] and Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===China===\nBeginning around 1978, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) began an experiment in [[economic reforms in China|economic reform]]. In contrast to the previous [[USSR|Soviet]]-style [[centrally planned economy]], the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, that led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) [[Special Economic Zone]]s located along the South-east coast.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, [[price]] and [[demand]]. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level.

In most countries, it represents a significant part of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, [[Amber Road]]), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of [[Industrialization]], advanced transportation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nEmpirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as [[South Korea]], which adopted a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]], and India, which historically had a more closed policy.  South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Trade sanctions===\n[[Trade sanctions]] against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action.  An [[embargo]], a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] against [[Cuba]] for over 40 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|title=U.S.\u2013Cuba Relations|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511123927/http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|archive-date=2015-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Trade barriers===\nInternational trade, which is governed by the [[World Trade Organization]], can be restricted by both tariff and non-tariff barriers.  International trade is usually regulated by governmental quotas and restrictions, and often taxed by tariffs.  Tariffs are usually on imports, but sometimes countries may impose export tariffs or [[subsidy|subsidies]]. [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|Non-tariff barriers]] include Sanitary and Phytosanitary rules, labeling requirements and food safety regulations.  All of these are called ''[[trade barriers]]''.  If a government removes all trade barriers, a condition of free trade exists.  A government that implements a protectionist policy establishes trade barriers. There are usually few trade restrictions within countries although a common feature of many developing countries is police and other road blocks along main highways, that primarily exist to extract bribes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Fair trade===\nThe \"[[fair trade]]\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of [[Manual labour|labour]], [[environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Social issues|social]] standards for the production of [[Commodity|commodities]], particularly those exported from the [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]]s to the [[First World]]. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a [[human right]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Should trade be considered a human right? |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=COPLA |url=http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429004458/http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}</ref>. \n\nImporting firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of [[employment law|employment]] and [[commercial law]].  Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of [[good (economics)|goods]] made using [[slave labour]] to minimum [[price support]] schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. [[Non-governmental organization]]s also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAIRTRADE Certification Mark.

According to economic historian [[Toby Green]], in Kongo \"giving more than receiving was a symbol of spiritual and political power, and privilege.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Seventeen Provinces]] were the centre of free trade, imposing no [[exchange control]]s, and advocating the free movement of goods.  Trade in the [[East Indies]] was dominated by Portugal in the 16th century, the [[Dutch Republic]] in the 17th century, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the 18th century. The [[Spanish Empire]] developed regular trade links across both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.\n\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson - Gda\u0144sk in the XVII century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Danzig]] in the 17th century, a port of the [[Hanseatic League]].]]\nIn 1776, [[Adam Smith]] published the paper ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. It criticised [[Mercantilism]], and argued that [[economic]] specialisation could benefit nations just as much as firms.  Since the [[division of labour]] was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more [[productive]]. Smith said that he considered all rationalisations of [[International trade|import]] and [[export]] controls \"dupery\", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries.\n\nIn 1799, the [[Dutch East India Company]], formerly the world's largest company, became [[bankrupt]], partly due to the rise of competitive free trade.\n[[File:Berber Trade with Timbuktu 1300s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Berber people|Berber]] trade with [[Timbuktu]], 1853.]]\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of [[comparative advantage]]. In [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]] Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in [[economics]]:\n: ''When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.''\n\nThe ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to imports.\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]] proved that a country with monopoly [[pricing power]] on the international market could manipulate the [[terms of trade]] through maintaining [[tariff]]s, and that the response to this might be [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in trade policy.  Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier.  This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the [[economic surplus]] of trade would accrue to a country following ''reciprocal'', rather than completely free, trade policies.  This was followed within a few years by the [[infant industry]] scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that government had the duty to [[protectionism|protect]] young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to [[industrialize|industrialise]] and out-compete English exporters. [[Milton Friedman]] later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.<ref>Price theory Milton Friedman</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe [[Great Depression]] was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s.  During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators.\n\nThe lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression causing stagnation and inflation.<ref>(secondary) [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] \u2013 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/ history]</ref>  Only during the [[World War II]] the recession ended in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the [[Bretton Woods Agreement]], intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions.  It set up rules and institutions to regulate the [[international political economy]]: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements).  These organisations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement.  In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] to promote free trade.<ref>(secondary) M Smith \u2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf2VQgAACAAJ&dq=China+Hidden+Cloak+and+Dagger+History+of+MI5&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Z6DsT-yYE8LO8QOSkqXCBQ&redir_esc=y V.

A system of [[international trade]] has helped to develop the world economy but, in combination with bilateral or multilateral agreements to lower [[tariff]]s or to achieve [[free trade]], has sometimes harmed [[Third World|third-world markets]] for local products.\n\n===Free trade===\n{{main|Free trade}}\nFree trade advanced further in the late 20th century and early 2000s:\n* 1992 [[European Union]] lifted barriers to internal trade in [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]].\n* January 1, 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) took effect.\n* 1994 The GATT [[Marrakech Agreement]] specified formation of the WTO.\n* January 1, 1995 [[World Trade Organization]] was created to facilitate [[free trade]], by mandating mutual [[most favoured nation]] trading status between all signatories.\n* EC was transformed into the European Union, which accomplished the Economic and Monnetary Union (EMU) in 2002, through introducing the Euro, and creating this way a real single market between 13 member states as of January 1, 2007.\n* [[File:Accarias de S\u00e9rionne - Int\u00e9r\u00eats des nations de l'Europe, d\u00e9v\u00e9lop\u00e9s relativement au commerce, 1766 - 5790093.tif|thumb|''Int\u00e9r\u00eats des nations de l'Europe, d\u00e9v\u00e9lop\u00e9s relativement au commerce'' (1766)]]2005, the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] was signed; It includes the United States and the Dominican Republic.\n\n== Perspectives ==\n\n===Protectionism===\n{{main|Protectionism}}\nProtectionism is the policy of restraining and discouraging trade between states and contrasts with the policy of free trade.  This policy often takes of form of [[tariff]]s and restrictive [[Import quota|quotas]].  Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the [[Great Depression]] and the onset of World War II.\n\n===Religion===\nIslamic teachings encourage trading (and condemn [[usury]] or [[interest]]).<ref>[[#Nomani1994|Nomani & Rahnema (1994)]], p.&nbsp;?. \"I want nine out of ten people from my Ummah (nation) as traders\" and \"Trader, who did trading in truth, and sold the right quantity and quality of goods, he will stand along Prophets and Martyrs, on Judgment day\".</ref><ref>\"O ye who believe!

This is called [[commodity money]] and includes any commonly available commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare seashells, whale's teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval Iraq, bread was used as an early form of money.  In Mexico under [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] cocoa beans were money. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foodrevolution.org/slavery_chocolate.htm |title=Is There Slavery In Your Chocolate? |access-date=November 24, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128090830/http://www.foodrevolution.org/slavery_chocolate.htm |archive-date=November 28, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Currency]] was introduced as a standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services.  This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years.\n\n[[Numismatist]]s have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of [[precious metal]].<ref name=\"originsofmoney\">Gold was an especially common form of early money, as described in [[#Davies2002|Davies (2002)]].</ref>\n\n==Trends==\n\n===Doha rounds===\n{{Main|Doha round}}\n\nThe Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aimed to lower [[trade barrier|barriers to trade]] around the world, with a focus on making [[fair trade|trade fairer]] for [[developing countries]].  Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich [[developed countries]], represented by the [[G20]], and the major developing countries. [[Agricultural subsidies]] are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on [[trade facilitation]] and capacity building. The Doha round began in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], and negotiations were continued in: [[Canc\u00fan]], Mexico; [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]; and [[Paris]], [[France]] and Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===China===\nBeginning around 1978, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) began an experiment in [[economic reforms in China|economic reform]]. In contrast to the previous [[USSR|Soviet]]-style [[centrally planned economy]], the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, that led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) [[Special Economic Zone]]s located along the South-east coast.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, [[price]] and [[demand]]. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008, China's two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html|title=Foreign Trade: Data|last=Division|first=US Census Bureau Foreign Trade|website=www.census.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 China joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] group, a trade-promotion forum.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/Member-Economies|title=Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation}}</ref> In 2001, it also joined the World Trade Organization. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/china_e.htm|title=China and the WTO}}</ref>\n\n==International trade==\n{{Main|International trade}}\n{{Trade bloc}}\n\nInternational trade is the exchange of goods and services across national borders.  In most countries, it represents a significant part of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, [[Amber Road]]), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of [[Industrialization]], advanced transportation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nEmpirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as [[South Korea]], which adopted a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]], and India, which historically had a more closed policy.  South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Trade sanctions===\n[[Trade sanctions]] against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action.  An [[embargo]], a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] against [[Cuba]] for over 40 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|title=U.S.\u2013Cuba Relations|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511123927/http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|archive-date=2015-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Trade barriers===\nInternational trade, which is governed by the [[World Trade Organization]], can be restricted by both tariff and non-tariff barriers.  International trade is usually regulated by governmental quotas and restrictions, and often taxed by tariffs.  Tariffs are usually on imports, but sometimes countries may impose export tariffs or [[subsidy|subsidies]]. [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|Non-tariff barriers]] include Sanitary and Phytosanitary rules, labeling requirements and food safety regulations.  All of these are called ''[[trade barriers]]''.  If a government removes all trade barriers, a condition of free trade exists.  A government that implements a protectionist policy establishes trade barriers. There are usually few trade restrictions within countries although a common feature of many developing countries is police and other road blocks along main highways, that primarily exist to extract bribes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Fair trade===\nThe \"[[fair trade]]\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of [[Manual labour|labour]], [[environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Social issues|social]] standards for the production of [[Commodity|commodities]], particularly those exported from the [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]]s to the [[First World]]. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a [[human right]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Should trade be considered a human right? |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=COPLA |url=http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429004458/http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}</ref>. \n\nImporting firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of [[employment law|employment]] and [[commercial law]].  Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of [[good (economics)|goods]] made using [[slave labour]] to minimum [[price support]] schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. [[Non-governmental organization]]s also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAIRTRADE Certification Mark.

The former [[Manor House]] on Church Road was by the 1820s a boys' school called Radnor House Academy (a.k.a. Manor House Academy); Grove Cottage, Wood End, a school for young men, opened in the 1830s;  Belle House School for Boys opened on Botwell Lane in the 1850s (it is now St Mary's Convent); in the first half of the 19th century, the Wood End House School for Young Ladies stood on the site of what is now the [[Norman Leddy Memorial Gardens]]; the former Magdalen Hall on Hayes End Road was also a 19th-century private School for Young Ladies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hayes: A Concise History |last=Kelter |first=Catherine |year=1988 |publisher=Hillingdon Borough Libraries |location=Hillingdon |isbn= |pages=40\u20131}}</ref>\n\nWood End House (before 1848, the site of the Wood End House School for Young Ladies) was used - from 1848 to c. 1905 - as an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]].

The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] brought change in the late nineteenth century, up to [[World War I]]. The town's location on the [[Grand Union Canal|Grand Junction Canal]] (later called the Grand Union) and the [[Great Western Railway]] \u2013 [[Hayes and Harlington railway station|Hayes & Harlington railway station]] had opened in 1868<ref>{{cite book| last = MacDermot| first = E.

HDC's company secretary, Alfred Clayton, is commemorated in the name of Clayton Road. Residential districts consisting of dwellings of the [[Garden city movement|garden suburb]] type were built to house workers after World War I.\n[[File:Fountain House Hotel, Church Road, Hayes - geograph.org.uk - 387893.jpg|thumb|left|Fountain House Hotel,<br>Church Road, Hayes]]\nIn 1904 the parish council created Hayes Urban District (from 1930, [[Hayes and Harlington Urban District]]) in order to address the issue of population growth.

In an echo of Blumlein's early stereo recordings, the Sensaura engineers made some of their first 3D audio recordings at [[Hayes and Harlington railway station|Hayes Station]].\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] the EMI factories produced aircraft. [[Charles Richard Fairey]] was seconded there for a short time, before setting up his own company, [[Fairey Aviation]], which relocated in 1918 to a large new factory across the railway in North Hyde Road. Over 4,500 aircraft were subsequently produced here, but Fairey needed an airfield to test these aircraft and in 1928 secured a site in nearby [[Heathrow (hamlet)|Heathrow]]. This became the [[Great West Aerodrome]], which was requisitioned by the [[Air Ministry]] in 1944.

St Mary's has a 12th-century [[Baptismal font|font]], and many interesting memorials and [[Monumental brass|brasses]]. The brass to Robert Lellee, Rector somewhere between 1356 and 1375, is purportedly the oldest brass in Middlesex. Adjacent to it is another to Rector Robert Burgeys (1408\u20131421). (The first recorded Rector was Peter de Lymonicen [1259]). There are tombs in the church to Walter Grene (1456), Thomas Higate (1576), and Sir [[Edward Fenner]] (1611), Judge of the King's Bench. The latter tomb covers earlier tiling on the wall and floors. Some partly uncovered pre-[[English Reformation|Reformation]] wall-paintings and a large mural (dating from the 14th century) of [[Saint Christopher]] with the infant Child are on the North wall. A brass to Veare Jenyns (1644) relates to the Court of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], while other Jenynses, who were [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]], link with [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]]. Judge [[John Heath (judge)|John Heath]], after whom ''Judge Heath Lane'' was named, is also buried at St Mary's.\n\n[[Victorian era|Victorian]] restorers donated a number of windows, and more recent additions include windows to Saints [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] and [[Saint Nicholas|Nicholas]]. The [[Coronation]] window is in the north aisle above the [[Triptych]] painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|pre-Raphaelite]] Edward Fellowes Prynne. His brother [[George Fellowes Prynne]] carved the [[Reredos]] with [[Anselm of Canterbury|St Anselm]] and [[Saint George|St George]] in the [[Niche (architecture)|niches]].

Interim locations included St Christopher's [[Approved school|Approved School]] and Harlington Scout Hut, until in 1978 the club was granted a piece of land at the back of Judge Heath Lane Sports Centre. A concerted effort by club-trainers, boxers and committee-members produced for the club a purpose-built gym.

The former [[Manor House]] on Church Road was by the 1820s a boys' school called Radnor House Academy (a.k.a. Manor House Academy); Grove Cottage, Wood End, a school for young men, opened in the 1830s;  Belle House School for Boys opened on Botwell Lane in the 1850s (it is now St Mary's Convent); in the first half of the 19th century, the Wood End House School for Young Ladies stood on the site of what is now the [[Norman Leddy Memorial Gardens]]; the former Magdalen Hall on Hayes End Road was also a 19th-century private School for Young Ladies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hayes: A Concise History |last=Kelter |first=Catherine |year=1988 |publisher=Hillingdon Borough Libraries |location=Hillingdon |isbn= |pages=40\u20131}}</ref>\n\nWood End House (before 1848, the site of the Wood End House School for Young Ladies) was used - from 1848 to c. 1905 - as an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]].

HDC's company secretary, Alfred Clayton, is commemorated in the name of Clayton Road. Residential districts consisting of dwellings of the [[Garden city movement|garden suburb]] type were built to house workers after World War I.\n[[File:Fountain House Hotel, Church Road, Hayes - geograph.org.uk - 387893.jpg|thumb|left|Fountain House Hotel,<br>Church Road, Hayes]]\nIn 1904 the parish council created Hayes Urban District (from 1930, [[Hayes and Harlington Urban District]]) in order to address the issue of population growth.

In an echo of Blumlein's early stereo recordings, the Sensaura engineers made some of their first 3D audio recordings at [[Hayes and Harlington railway station|Hayes Station]].\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] the EMI factories produced aircraft. [[Charles Richard Fairey]] was seconded there for a short time, before setting up his own company, [[Fairey Aviation]], which relocated in 1918 to a large new factory across the railway in North Hyde Road. Over 4,500 aircraft were subsequently produced here, but Fairey needed an airfield to test these aircraft and in 1928 secured a site in nearby [[Heathrow (hamlet)|Heathrow]].
