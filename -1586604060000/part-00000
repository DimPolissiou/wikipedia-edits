Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The considerable amount of [[Wattle and daub|daub]] found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha, and Walz, Jonathan.

(2015), and to the Resurgence in Maritime Myopia in the Archaeology of the East African Coast\", American Anthropologist 120(3).</ref> Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns.<ref>Horton, Mark and Middleton, Tom. \"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community.\" (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), 46.</ref>\n\nExcavations at nearby Pemba Island, but especially at Shanga in the Lamu Archipelago, provide the clearest picture of architectural development. Houses were originally built with timber (c. 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (c. 1150). The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials. By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone. Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries. According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture. While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century.<ref>Horton, Mark and Middleton, John. \"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community.\" (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), 119.</ref>\n\nPersian, Indian, and Arab traders used Zanzibar as a base for voyages between the Middle East, India, and Africa. Unguja, the larger island, offered a protected and defensible harbor, so although the archipelago offered few products of value, traders settled at [[Zanzibar City]] (\"[[Stone Town]]\") a convenient point from which to trade with the other [[Swahili coast]] towns.\n\nThe impact of these traders and immigrants on the [[Swahili culture]] is uncertain. During the [[Middle Ages]], Zanzibar and other settlements on the Swahili Coast were advanced. The littoral contained a number of autonomous trade cities. These towns grew in wealth as the [[Swahili people]] served as intermediaries and facilitators to local, inland mainland African, Arab, Persian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese merchants and traders.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha. \"The Rise and Decline of Swahili States.\" (Walnut Creek, California: Altamira, 1999).</ref> This interaction contributed in part to the evolution of the [[Swahili culture]], which developed its own written language. Although a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]], the [[Swahili language]] as a consequence today includes some elements that were borrowed from other civilizations, particularly [[loanword]]s from [[Arabic]]. With the wealth that they had acquired through trade, some of the Arab traders also became rulers of the coastal cities.<ref>[http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html The Swahili, African History, ''Ending Stereotypes for America''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904200204/http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Portuguese colonization===\n[[Vasco da Gama]]'s visit in 1498 marked the beginning of European influence.

The first English ship to visit Unguja, the ''Edward Bonaventure'' in 1591, found that there was no Portuguese fort or garrison.

The Portuguese presence was relatively limited, leaving administration in the hands of preexisting local leaders and power structures. This system lasted until 1631, when the Sultan of Mombasa massacred the Portuguese inhabitants. For the remainder of their rule, the Portuguese appointed European governors. The strangling of trade and diminished local power led the Swahili elites in Mombasa and Zanzibar to invite Omani aristocrats to assist them in driving the Europeans out.<ref name=\"Eliot\">Sir Charles Eliot, K.C.M.G., [https://archive.org/details/eastafricaprotec00eliouoft ''The East Africa Protectorate''], London: Edward Arnold, 1905, digitized by the Internet Archive in 2008 ([[PDF]] format).</ref>{{rp|page: 9}}\n\nIn 1698, Zanzibar came under the influence of the [[Oman|Sultanate of Oman]].<ref>N.

Over the next few years, however, almost all of these mainland possessions were lost to European imperial powers.\n\nThe sultans developed an economy of trade and [[cash crop]]s in the Zanzibar Archipelago with a ruling Arab elite. [[Ivory]] was a major trade good. The archipelago, sometimes referred to by locals as the Spice Islands, was famous worldwide for its cloves and other spices, and plantations were developed to grow them. The archipelago's commerce gradually fell into the hands of traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]], whom Said bin Sultan encouraged to settle on the islands.\n\nDuring his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid bin Said consolidated his power around the [[Arab slave trade]]. Malindi in Zanzibar City was the Swahili Coast's main port for the slave trade with the Middle East.

It is cheaper, simpler, less wounding to their self-esteem, gives them more career as public officials, and spares of unnecessary contact with white men.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Salisbury: Victorian Titan'' (1999) p 529</ref>\n\nFrom 1890 to 1913, traditional [[viziers]] were in charge; they were supervised by advisors appointed by the Colonial Office.  However, in 1913 a switch was made to a system of direct rule through residents (effectively governors) from 1913.  The death of the pro-British [[Sultan]] [[Hamad bin Thuwaini]] on 25 August 1896 and the succession of Sultan [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Khalid bin Barghash]], whom the British did not approve of, led to the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]]. On the morning of 27 August 1896, ships of the [[Royal Navy]] destroyed the Beit al Hukum Palace.

Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The considerable amount of [[Wattle and daub|daub]] found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha, and Walz, Jonathan.

Houses were originally built with timber (c. 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (c. 1150). The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials. By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone. Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries. According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture. While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century.<ref>Horton, Mark and Middleton, John. \"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community.\" (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), 119.</ref>\n\nPersian, Indian, and Arab traders used Zanzibar as a base for voyages between the Middle East, India, and Africa. Unguja, the larger island, offered a protected and defensible harbor, so although the archipelago offered few products of value, traders settled at [[Zanzibar City]] (\"[[Stone Town]]\") a convenient point from which to trade with the other [[Swahili coast]] towns.\n\nThe impact of these traders and immigrants on the [[Swahili culture]] is uncertain. During the [[Middle Ages]], Zanzibar and other settlements on the Swahili Coast were advanced. The littoral contained a number of autonomous trade cities. These towns grew in wealth as the [[Swahili people]] served as intermediaries and facilitators to local, inland mainland African, Arab, Persian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese merchants and traders.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha. \"The Rise and Decline of Swahili States.\" (Walnut Creek, California: Altamira, 1999).</ref> This interaction contributed in part to the evolution of the [[Swahili culture]], which developed its own written language. Although a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]], the [[Swahili language]] as a consequence today includes some elements that were borrowed from other civilizations, particularly [[loanword]]s from [[Arabic]]. With the wealth that they had acquired through trade, some of the Arab traders also became rulers of the coastal cities.<ref>[http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html The Swahili, African History, ''Ending Stereotypes for America''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904200204/http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Portuguese colonization===\n[[Vasco da Gama]]'s visit in 1498 marked the beginning of European influence.

The Portuguese presence was relatively limited, leaving administration in the hands of preexisting local leaders and power structures. This system lasted until 1631, when the Sultan of Mombasa massacred the Portuguese inhabitants. For the remainder of their rule, the Portuguese appointed European governors.

[[Ivory]] was a major trade good. The archipelago, sometimes referred to by locals as the Spice Islands, was famous worldwide for its cloves and other spices, and plantations were developed to grow them. The archipelago's commerce gradually fell into the hands of traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]], whom Said bin Sultan encouraged to settle on the islands.\n\nDuring his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid bin Said consolidated his power around the [[Arab slave trade]].

At least formally, most Western democracies never considered the three Baltic states to be constituent parts of the Soviet Union.

The Baltic countries were more interested in gaining access to the rest of the European market.\n\nCurrently, the governments of the Baltic states cooperate in multiple ways, including cooperation among presidents, parliament speakers, heads of government, and foreign ministers. On 8 November 1991, the [[Baltic Assembly]], which includes 15 to 20 MPs from each parliament, was established to facilitate inter-parliamentary cooperation.

There is also significant proficiency in Finnish in Estonia owing to its closeness to the native Estonian and also the widespread practice of listening to Finnish broadcasts during the Soviet era. Russian also achieved significant usage particularly in commerce.\n\nRussian was the most commonly studied foreign language at all levels of schooling during the Soviet era. Despite schooling available and administration conducted in local languages, Russian settlers were neither encouraged nor motivated to learn the official local languages, so knowledge of Russian became a practical necessity in daily life. Even to this day, the majority of the population of the Baltic states profess to be proficient in Russian, especially those who lived during Soviet rule. Meanwhile, the minority of Russian origin generally do not speak the national language. The question of their assimilation is a major factor in social and diplomatic affairs.<ref>{{cite book\n| author1 = Nikolas K.

Teams from the three countries compete in the respective national championships and the [[Baltic Basketball League]]. The Lithuanian teams have been the strongest, with the [[BC \u017dalgiris]] winning the 1999 [[FIBA Euroleague]].\n\nThe [[Lithuania men's national basketball team]] has won the [[EuroBasket]] on three occasions and has claimed third place at the 2010 World Cup and three Olympic tournaments. Meanwhile, the [[Latvian national basketball team|Latvia men's national basketball team]] won the 1935 Eurobasket and finished second in 1939, but has performed poorly since the 1990s. Lithuania hosted the Eurobasket in 1939 and 2011, whereas Latvia was one of the hosts in 2015. The historic Lithuanian basketball team [[Kauno \u017dalgiris]] won the [[Euroleague]] in 1999. However, the [[Latvia women's national basketball team]] finished fourth at the 2007 Eurobasket.\n\n[[Ice hockey]] is also popular in Latvia. [[Dinamo Riga]] is the country's strongest hockey club, playing in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]]. The [[2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] were held in Latvia.\n\n[[Association football]] is popular in the Baltic states, but the only appearance of a Baltic team in a major international competition was [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]]'s qualification for [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. The national teams of the three states have played in the [[Baltic Cup (football)|Baltic Cup]] since 1928.\n\nEstonian and Soviet chess grandmaster [[Paul Keres]] was among the world's top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s. He narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasions.\n\nEstonian [[Markko M\u00e4rtin]] was successful in the [[World Rally Championship]] in the early 2000s, where he got five wins and 18 podiums, as well as a third place in the [[2004 World Rally Championship|2004 drivers' championship]].\n\nOtt T\u00e4nak of Estonia won the 2019 World Rally Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2019/standings|title=Standings|date=22 January 2015|website=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile|language=en|access-date=5 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nLatvian tennis player [[Je\u013cena Ostapenko]] won the [[2017 French Open]], another Latvian tennis player [[Ernests Gulbis]] was a semi-finalist at the 2010 Rome Masters and 2014 French Open.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Nature===\n<gallery>\nFile:Pine forest in Estonia.jpg|Forests cover over half the landmass of Estonia\nFile:Ergeljuklintis424aug037qg.jpg|Devonian sandstone cliffs in [[Gauja National Park]], Latvia's largest and oldest national park\nFile:\u017demait\u0117j\u0117 nug B\u0117liuoniu p\u0117liekaln\u0117 2.JPG| View from the Bilioniai forthill in Lithuania\nFile:Nida sand dunes (14573723178).jpg|Sand dunes of the [[Curonian Spit]] near [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]], which are the highest drifting sand dunes in Europe ([[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Nida and The Curonian Spit, The Insider's Guide to Visiting |url=https://maptrotting.com/nida-guide-baltic-coast/ |website=MapTrotting |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===General statistics===\nAll three are [[Unitary state|Unitary]] [[republic]]s, joined the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004, share [[Eastern European Time|EET]]/[[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]] time zone schedules and [[euro]] currency.\n{| class=wikitable border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|-\n!\n!

After the Brothers of the Sword suffered defeat at the [[Battle of Saule]] to Lithuanians, the remaining Brothers were integrated into the [[Teutonic Order]] as the autonomous [[Livonian Order]]. Northern Estonia initially became a [[Danish Estonia|Danish dominion]], but it was purchased by the Teutonic Order in the mid-14th century. The majority of the crusaders and clergy were German, and [[Baltic Germans]] remained influential in Estonia and most of Latvia until the first half of the 20th century: they formed the backbone of the local gentry, and German served both as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' and for record-keeping.<ref name=\"Bojtar\" />\n\nThe Lithuanians were also targeted by the crusaders; however, they were able to resist and established the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] in 1251 which later became [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

The rulers of different regions within Livonia sought to ally with foreign powers, which resulted in Polish\u2013Lithuanian, Swedish and Danish involvement. As a result, by 1561 the Livonian confederation had ceased to exist and its lands in modern Latvia and Southern Estonia became the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] and the [[Duchy of Livonia]], which were vassals to the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Saaremaa|Osel island]] came under Danish rule and Northern Estonia became the Swedish [[Duchy of Estonia (1561\u20131721)|Duchy of Estonia]]. In the aftermath of later conflicts of the 17th century, much of the Duchy of Livonia and Osel also came under Swedish control as [[Swedish Livonia]]. These newly acquired Swedish territories, as well as [[Swedish Ingria|Ingria]] and [[County of Kexholm|Kexholm]] (now the western part of the [[Leningrad Oblast]] of Russia), became known as the [[Dominions of Sweden|Baltic Dominions]]. Parts of the Duchy of Livonia that remained in the Commonwealth became [[Inflanty Voivodeship]], which contributed to the modern [[Latgale]] region of Eastern Latvia becoming culturally distinct from the rest of Latvia as the German nobility lost its influence and the region remained Catholic just like Poland-Lithuania, while the rest of Latvia (and also Estonia) became Lutheran.\n\n===Baltic governates of Russian Empire===\n[[File:BalticGovernorates1914.png|thumb|right|The [[Baltic German]]-controlled [[Baltic governorates]] in the [[Russian Empire]] - comprising current Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia and Northern Latvia]]\nAt the beginning of the 18th century the [[Swedish Empire]] was attacked by a coalition of several European powers in the [[Great Northern War]].

While separate peoples with their own customs and traditions, historical factors have introduced cultural commonalities across and differences within them.\n\nThe population of the Baltic countries belong to different Christian denominations, a reflection of historical circumstances. Both Western and Eastern Christianity had been introduced by the end of the first millennium. The current divide between [[Lutheranism]] to the north and Catholicism to the south is the remnant of [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] and [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] hegemony, respectively, with [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] remaining the dominant faith among Russian and other East Slavic minorities.\n\n[[File:St Peters Church Riga.JPG|thumb|upright|[[St. Peter's Church, Riga|St. Peter's Lutheran Church]], [[Riga]], Latvia]]\nThe Baltic states have historically been in many different spheres of influence, from Danish over Swedish and [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]], to German ([[Hanseatic League|Hansa]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]]), and before independence in the Russian sphere of influence.\n\nThe Baltic states have a considerable [[Slavs|Slavic]] minority: in Latvia: 33.0% (including 25.4% [[Russians in Latvia|Russian]], 3.3% [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], 2.2% [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], and 2.1% [[Polish language|Polish]]),<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/lv/assets/documents/Iedzivotaju+re%C4%A3istrs/07022017/ISVN_Latvija_pec_TTB_VPD.pdf\n| title = Pilson\u012bbas un migr\u0101cijas lietu p\u0101rvalde \u2013 K\u013c\u016bda 404\n| website = pmlp.gov.lv\n}}</ref> in Estonia: 27.6%<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=PO0222U&ti=POPULATION+BY+SEX,+ETHNIC+NATIONALITY+AND+COUNTY,+1+JANUARY.+ADMINISTRATIVE+DIVISION+AS+AT+01.01.2018&path=../I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/04Population_figure_and_composition/&lang=1\n| title = POPULATION BY SEX, ETHNIC NATIONALITY AND COUNTY, 1 JANUARY.

Today, ethnic [[Baltic Russians|Russian immigrants]] from the former Soviet Union and their descendants make up a sizable minority in the Baltic states, particularly in Latvia (about one-quarter of the total population and close to one-half in the capital Riga) and Estonia (one-quarter of the population).\n\nBecause the three Baltic states had been occupied by Soviet Union later than other territories (hence, e.g., the higher living standard), there was a strong feeling of national identity (often labeled \"bourgeois nationalism\" by Soviets) and popular resentment towards the imposed Soviet rule in the three countries, in combination with Soviet cultural policy, which employed superficial multiculturalism (in order for the Soviet Union to appear as a multinational union based on free will of peoples) in limits allowed by the Communist \"internationalist\" (but in effect pro-[[Russification]]) ideology and under tight control of the Communist Party (those of the Baltic nationals who crossed the line were called \"bourgeois nationalists\" and repressed). This let Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians preserve a high degree of Europe-oriented national identity.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n| title = Baltic states&nbsp;\u2013 Soviet Republics\n| encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n| url = http://search.eb.com/eb/article-37264\n| accessdate = 5 March 2007\n}}</ref> In Soviet times this made them appear as the \"West\" of the Soviet Union in the cultural and political sense, thus as close to emigration a Russian could get without leaving the Soviet Union.\n\n===Languages===\nThe languages of Baltic nations belong to two distinct language families. The [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] languages belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]] and are the only extant members of the [[Baltic languages|Baltic language group]] (or more specifically, Eastern Baltic subgroup of Baltic).\n\nThe [[Estonian language]] is a [[Finnic language]], together with neighboring Finland's [[Finnish language]].\n\n[[File:Vilnius University Great Courtyard 1, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|Catholic [[Church of St. Johns, Vilnius|Church of St. Johns]], [[Vilnius]], Lithuania]]\nApart from the indigenous languages, German was the dominant language in Estonia and Latvia in academics, professional life, and upper society from the 13th century until World War I. [[Polish language|Polish]] served a similar function in Lithuania. Numerous [[Swedish language|Swedish]] loanwords have made it into the Estonian language; it was under the Swedish rule that schools were established and education propagated in the 17th century. Swedish remains spoken in Estonia, particularly the [[Estonian Swedish]] dialect of the [[Estonian Swedes]] of [[Aiboland|northern Estonia and the islands]] (though many fled to Sweden as the [[Soviet Union]] [[Baltic Offensive|invaded]] and [[Occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1944)|re-occupied]] Estonia in 1944). There is also significant proficiency in Finnish in Estonia owing to its closeness to the native Estonian and also the widespread practice of listening to Finnish broadcasts during the Soviet era. Russian also achieved significant usage particularly in commerce.\n\nRussian was the most commonly studied foreign language at all levels of schooling during the Soviet era. Despite schooling available and administration conducted in local languages, Russian settlers were neither encouraged nor motivated to learn the official local languages, so knowledge of Russian became a practical necessity in daily life. Even to this day, the majority of the population of the Baltic states profess to be proficient in Russian, especially those who lived during Soviet rule. Meanwhile, the minority of Russian origin generally do not speak the national language. The question of their assimilation is a major factor in social and diplomatic affairs.<ref>{{cite book\n| author1 = Nikolas K.

Teams from the three countries compete in the respective national championships and the [[Baltic Basketball League]]. The Lithuanian teams have been the strongest, with the [[BC \u017dalgiris]] winning the 1999 [[FIBA Euroleague]].\n\nThe [[Lithuania men's national basketball team]] has won the [[EuroBasket]] on three occasions and has claimed third place at the 2010 World Cup and three Olympic tournaments. Meanwhile, the [[Latvian national basketball team|Latvia men's national basketball team]] won the 1935 Eurobasket and finished second in 1939, but has performed poorly since the 1990s. Lithuania hosted the Eurobasket in 1939 and 2011, whereas Latvia was one of the hosts in 2015. The historic Lithuanian basketball team [[Kauno \u017dalgiris]] won the [[Euroleague]] in 1999. However, the [[Latvia women's national basketball team]] finished fourth at the 2007 Eurobasket.\n\n[[Ice hockey]] is also popular in Latvia. [[Dinamo Riga]] is the country's strongest hockey club, playing in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]]. The [[2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] were held in Latvia.\n\n[[Association football]] is popular in the Baltic states, but the only appearance of a Baltic team in a major international competition was [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]]'s qualification for [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. The national teams of the three states have played in the [[Baltic Cup (football)|Baltic Cup]] since 1928.\n\nEstonian and Soviet chess grandmaster [[Paul Keres]] was among the world's top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s. He narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasions.\n\nEstonian [[Markko M\u00e4rtin]] was successful in the [[World Rally Championship]] in the early 2000s, where he got five wins and 18 podiums, as well as a third place in the [[2004 World Rally Championship|2004 drivers' championship]].\n\nOtt T\u00e4nak of Estonia won the 2019 World Rally Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2019/standings|title=Standings|date=22 January 2015|website=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile|language=en|access-date=5 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nLatvian tennis player [[Je\u013cena Ostapenko]] won the [[2017 French Open]], another Latvian tennis player [[Ernests Gulbis]] was a semi-finalist at the 2010 Rome Masters and 2014 French Open.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Nature===\n<gallery>\nFile:Pine forest in Estonia.jpg|Forests cover over half the landmass of Estonia\nFile:Ergeljuklintis424aug037qg.jpg|Devonian sandstone cliffs in [[Gauja National Park]], Latvia's largest and oldest national park\nFile:\u017demait\u0117j\u0117 nug B\u0117liuoniu p\u0117liekaln\u0117 2.JPG| View from the Bilioniai forthill in Lithuania\nFile:Nida sand dunes (14573723178).jpg|Sand dunes of the [[Curonian Spit]] near [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]], which are the highest drifting sand dunes in Europe ([[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Nida and The Curonian Spit, The Insider's Guide to Visiting |url=https://maptrotting.com/nida-guide-baltic-coast/ |website=MapTrotting |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===General statistics===\nAll three are [[Unitary state|Unitary]] [[republic]]s, joined the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004, share [[Eastern European Time|EET]]/[[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]] time zone schedules and [[euro]] currency.\n{| class=wikitable border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|-\n!\n!

It is similar to the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]], but many elements are different, as appropriate to its setting. It is common for the central character to be a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie]] instead of a [[cowboy]] or [[sheriff]]. Other common characters include fur trappers and traders, [[lumberjack]]s, [[prospecting|prospectors]], [[First Nations]] people, settlers, and townsfolk.\n\nInternational interest in the region and the genre was fuelled by the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896\u201399) and subsequent works surrounding it, fiction and non-fiction. The genre was extremely popular in the [[interwar period]] of the 20th century. Northerns are still produced, but their popularity waned in the late 1950s.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nwmp 1900.jpg|thumb|The North-West Mounted Police, and later the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], were often the heroes of Northern fiction.]]\n[[File:Yukon Donjek Valley 001.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Yukon]] (occasionally near the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Alaskan border]]) was a common setting for Northern fiction.]]\nNortherns are similar to [[Western (genre)|westerns]] but are set in the frozen north of [[North America]]; that is, [[Canada]] or [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Chasing the Sun: A Reader's Guide to Novels Set in the American West|first=Edward Joseph|last=Beverly|publisher=Sunstone Press|year=2008|isbn=9780865346031|chapter=Preface|page=11|quote=Some book reviewers, however, contend that the one thing all Western settings have in common is aridity, and wouldn't consider novels set in Missouri or along the Pacific Coast or in the other non-arid regions to be Western fiction.

Dogs and [[dog sled]]s were popularized by ''The Call of the Wild'' and ''White Fang''.  Scenes involving attacks by bears date back to ''The Klondyke Nugget''.<ref name=\"Solomon\" />\n\nThe primary antagonist in a Northern can be the wilderness, the weather and other natural elements, which the protagonists must endure, overcome and survive.<ref name=\"Hutchison\">{{cite book|year=1998|chapter=Introduction: Scarlet Fiction|title=The Scarlet Riders|first=Don|last=Hutchison|isbn=9780889626478|publisher=Mosaic Press|url=https://archive.org/details/scarletriderspul00hutc}}</ref><ref name=\"Harrison\" />\n\nNortherns often explore the 'Matter of Canada' (the national mythos of Canada, after the [[Matter of Rome]]).<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />  Common elements of which are the [[Black Donnellys|Black Donnelly murders]] (February 1880), the [[North-West Rebellion]] (1885), the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896\u201399), the pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]] (January 1932), the [[October Crisis]] (October 1970), and persistent national anxiety about [[Annexation movements of Canada|potential annexation]] by the United States.<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />\n\nThe Western idea of [[lawlessness]] set in American towns was not a part of the Canadian Northern, though individual lawbreakers or uprisings by Canadians feature in works such as ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951), ''[[Riel (film)|Riel]]'' (1979), and ''[[Northwest Mounted Police (film)|Northwest Mounted Police]]'' (1940).  In Northerns and wider crime fiction, the general Canadian preference is for law enforcement to be performed by the state rather than vigilantes or private investigators.<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />  Likewise, Northerns rarely feature the heroic outlaws often found in Westerns.<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />  On the subject, David Skene-Melvin writes \"Canada never had a Wild West because the Mounties got there first,\"<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" /> while [[Margaret Atwood]] writes \"No outlaws or lawless men for Canada; if one appears, the Mounties always get their man.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature|authorlink=Margaret Atwood|first=Margaret|last=Atwood|year=1972|title-link=Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature}}</ref>\n\nLaw and order in Northerns set in Canada is most often represented by the Mounties, either the [[North-West Mounted Police]] or [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] depending on era.

American-authored Mounties are often little different from [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshalls]] and project the values of Westerns in that they place their individual sense of justice and conscience above their duty to the law. Canadian-authored Mounties represent, and are self-abnegating champions of, the Canadian establishment and its laws.  Further, their authority does not come from either their social class or physical abilities; such a Mountie \"upholds the law by moral rather than physical force\".<ref name=\"Harrison\" />  A common story outline for Northerns involving Mounties is a pursuit, confrontation and capture: the Mountie's pursuit of a fugitive takes place across the Canadian wilderness and may be resolved non-violently.<ref name=\"Harrison\" />\n\nAccording to [[Pierre Berton]] \"the French-Canadian was to the northerns what the Mexican was to the westerns \u2014 an exotic primitive, adaptable as a chameleon to play a hero or a heavy.\"<ref name=Berton>{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Berton|authorlink=Pierre Berton|chapter=Hollywood's Canada|title=Canadian Culture|editor-first=Elspeth|editor-last=Cameron|publisher=Canadian Scholars\u2019 Press|year=1997|isbn=9781551300900}}</ref> French-Canadians were a ubiquitous element of the genre.  As characters, French-Canadians are typically depicted as rustic and uneducated. These characters were usually divided into two broad types: the heroic, happy-go-lucky bon-vivant and the villainous, lecherous killer.  Some later examples merged the two stereotypes into a charming, roguish [[anti-villain]].<ref name=Berton />  Common visual elements were a [[tuque]], a sash and a pipe.<ref name=Berton />  All were present in the first appearance in film, in ''[[A Woman's Way (1908 film)|A Woman's Way]]'' (1908).<ref name=Berton />  Female French-Canadian characters also followed the \"tempestuous\" stereotype of female Mexican characters.  Mexican actress [[Lupe V\u00e9lez]], in line with her identity as \"The Mexican Spitfire\", played the title character in ''[[Tiger Rose (1929 film)|Tiger Rose]]'' (1929) in this mode; as did [[Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e]] in ''[[The Eternal Struggle (film)|The Eternal Struggle]]'' (1923) and Nikki Duval in ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951).<ref name=Berton />\n\nA common anachronism in Northerns was the tyranny and absolute power of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and its officers, even into the modern period.<ref name=Berton />  This was repeated not just in fiction but by reviewers and critics too.<ref name=Berton />  The concept of ''La Longue Traverse'', or the Journey of Death, comes from ''[[The Call of the North (1914 film)|The Call of the North]]'' (1914) and was popular in later films.  In this, the Hudson's Bay Company executes convicts by forcing them into the wilderness without equipment or supplies.<ref name=Berton />  In 1921, the Hudson's Bay Company successfully sued the [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]] for the villainous portrayal of their Company in the latters' remake ''[[The Call of the North (1921 film)|The Call of the North]]''.<ref name=Berton />\n\n[[Alaska Natives]] or [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] are featured in some depictions.\n\nBesides being set in [[Canadian Prairies]], the stories often contrast the [[American frontier]] with the Canadian frontier in several ways.  In films such as ''[[Pony Soldier]]'' and ''[[Saskatchewan (film)|Saskatchewan]]'' the North-West Mounted Police display reason, compassion and a sense of fair play in their dealings with [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal people]] ([[First Nations]]) as opposed to hotheaded American visitors (often criminals), lawmen or the American Army who seem to prefer [[Genocide|extermination]] with violence.\n\n==History==\nDavid Skene-Melvin classes the \"second period\" of Canadian crime literature (1880\u20131920), as \"the heyday of the 'Northern' and the literary exploration of Canada's remote and romantic frontiers.\"<ref name=SkeneMelvin>{{cite book|first=David|last=Skene-Melvin|chapter=Canadian Crime Writing in English|title=Detecting Canada|editor-first=Jeannette|editor-last=Sloniowski|editor-first2=Marilyn|editor-last2=Rose|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781554589289}}</ref>  He refers to [[Joseph Edmund Collins]] as an important figure in this period because, despite his work being of low quality, he was the first Canadian author to address some aspects of the 'Matter of Canada' in his novels, such as ''The Story of Louis Riel: The Rebel Chief'' (1885) and ''Annette, the M\u00e9tis Spy'' (1886).<ref name=SkeneMelvin />  Northerns continued to be written after 1920 but Canadian authors largely moved to other genres after World War 1 as they moved away from a frontier and colonial ethos.<ref name=SkeneMelvin />\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush]] during the 1890s in Canada and Alaska brought a lot of wider, international attention to the far north of North America.<ref name=\"Pronzini\" />  Adventure novels from veterans of the gold rush\u2014such as [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (1903), [[Rex Beach]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (1906) and [[Robert W.

Nevertheless, Skene-Melvin writes \"Just as the Western is widely regarded as emblematic of American culture, it can be argued that the Northern is the only truly indigenous Canadian art form, even if most of its exponents have been foreigners.\"<ref name=SkeneMelvin />\n\nOne of the earliest international examples of the genre is the British play ''The Klondyke Nugget'', which was first performed in 1898.<ref name=\"Solomon\" />  Its author, [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] initially wrote it as a Western but changed the location to capitalize on the contemporary gold rush.<ref name=\"Solomon\" />\n\n[[Charlie Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin's]] 1925 film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' is a comedy that parodies some of the cliches of the Northern genre.<ref name=\"Solomon\">{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Solomon|title=The Gold Rush|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=9781137516114|quote=Chaplin's decision to have ''The Gold Rush'' take place during the 1897\u20138 Klondike Gold Rush placed it squarely within the well established Northern genre, which spanned theatre, literature and film, encompassing stories about trappers, adventurers, lumberjacks, miners, Mounties, Eskimos, and others-even animals-in the Far North.}}</ref> The [[Looney Tunes]] character [[Blacque Jacque Shellacque]], who first appeared in the 1959 short ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]'', is another parody.<ref name=\"Hutchison\" />\n\nWhile the Hollywood [[Western (genre)|Western]] began to change in the post-World War 2 era and the Western myth was eventually debunked, Hollywood Northerns remained unchanged until they stopped being produced in the late 1950s and the underlying mythology was never examined.<ref name=Berton />\n\n==Examples of Northerns==\n[[File:Heart of the Klondike - Chilkoot Pass.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for the play ''Heart of the Klondike'' (c. 1897)]]\n[[File:McKenna of the Mounted poster.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for the film ''[[McKenna of the Mounted]]'' (1932)]]\n[[File:Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of Richard Simmons as Sergeant Preston and Yukon King from the television series ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon (TV series)|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'']]\n\n===Folklore of Canada (Canadian oral stories)===\n* [[Chasse-galerie]], the enchanted canoe that flies over the water of the river like a bird\n* [[Johnny Chinook]], the Canadian cowboy and rancher of [[Alberta]]\n* [[Big Joe Mufferaw]], [[woodsman]] [[Paul Bunyan]] of Canada.\n* [[Louis Riel]]\n\n===Poetry===\n* ''[[The Songs of a Sourdough|The Spell of the Yukon]]'' by [[Robert W.

'''Northwestern''' is a [[genre]] in various arts that tell stories set primarily in the later half of the 19th century in the north of [[North America]], primarily in [[Canada]] but also in [[Alaska]]. It is similar to the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]], but many elements are different, as appropriate to its setting. It is common for the central character to be a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie]] instead of a [[cowboy]] or [[sheriff]]. Other common characters include fur trappers and traders, [[lumberjack]]s, [[prospecting|prospectors]], [[First Nations]] people, settlers, and townsfolk.\n\nInternational interest in the region and the genre was fuelled by the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896\u201399) and subsequent works surrounding it, fiction and non-fiction. The genre was extremely popular in the [[interwar period]] of the 20th century. Northerns are still produced, but their popularity waned in the late 1950s.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nwmp 1900.jpg|thumb|The North-West Mounted Police, and later the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], were often the heroes of Northern fiction.]]\n[[File:Yukon Donjek Valley 001.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Yukon]] (occasionally near the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Alaskan border]]) was a common setting for Northern fiction.]]\nNortherns are similar to [[Western (genre)|westerns]] but are set in the frozen north of [[North America]]; that is, [[Canada]] or [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Chasing the Sun: A Reader's Guide to Novels Set in the American West|first=Edward Joseph|last=Beverly|publisher=Sunstone Press|year=2008|isbn=9780865346031|chapter=Preface|page=11|quote=Some book reviewers, however, contend that the one thing all Western settings have in common is aridity, and wouldn't consider novels set in Missouri or along the Pacific Coast or in the other non-arid regions to be Western fiction.

Popular locations within Canada are the [[Yukon]], the [[Barren Grounds]], and area around [[Hudson Bay]].<ref name=\"Pronzini\">{{cite book|title=Six-Gun in Cheek|first=Bill|last=Pronzini|chapter=The Bull Moose and Other Scourges of the Frozen North|publisher=Courier Dover|year=2017|isbn=9780486820347|quote=Northerns\u2014tales set in the rough-and-tumble frontier days of Alaska, the Yukon, the Canadian Barrens, the Hudsons's Bay region\u2014were a popular adjunct to the Western story during the first half of this century.}}</ref>  Generic names used for this general setting included the \"Far North\", the \"Northlands\", the \"North Woods\", and the \"Great Woods\".\n\nCommon settings include [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forests]], isolated cabins, and mining towns.<ref name=\"Solomon\" /> Snow featured to such an extent that Northern films were sometimes termed \"snow pictures\".<ref name=\"Solomon\" />  Animals were a common feature too.  Dogs and [[dog sled]]s were popularized by ''The Call of the Wild'' and ''White Fang''.  Scenes involving attacks by bears date back to ''The Klondyke Nugget''.<ref name=\"Solomon\" />\n\nThe primary antagonist in a Northern can be the wilderness, the weather and other natural elements, which the protagonists must endure, overcome and survive.<ref name=\"Hutchison\">{{cite book|year=1998|chapter=Introduction: Scarlet Fiction|title=The Scarlet Riders|first=Don|last=Hutchison|isbn=9780889626478|publisher=Mosaic Press|url=https://archive.org/details/scarletriderspul00hutc}}</ref><ref name=\"Harrison\" />\n\nNortherns often explore the 'Matter of Canada' (the national mythos of Canada, after the [[Matter of Rome]]).<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />  Common elements of which are the [[Black Donnellys|Black Donnelly murders]] (February 1880), the [[North-West Rebellion]] (1885), the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896\u201399), the pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]] (January 1932), the [[October Crisis]] (October 1970), and persistent national anxiety about [[Annexation movements of Canada|potential annexation]] by the United States.<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />\n\nThe Western idea of [[lawlessness]] set in American towns was not a part of the Canadian Northern, though individual lawbreakers or uprisings by Canadians feature in works such as ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951), ''[[Riel (film)|Riel]]'' (1979), and ''[[Northwest Mounted Police (film)|Northwest Mounted Police]]'' (1940).  In Northerns and wider crime fiction, the general Canadian preference is for law enforcement to be performed by the state rather than vigilantes or private investigators.<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />  Likewise, Northerns rarely feature the heroic outlaws often found in Westerns.<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" />  On the subject, David Skene-Melvin writes \"Canada never had a Wild West because the Mounties got there first,\"<ref name=\"SkeneMelvin\" /> while [[Margaret Atwood]] writes \"No outlaws or lawless men for Canada; if one appears, the Mounties always get their man.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature|authorlink=Margaret Atwood|first=Margaret|last=Atwood|year=1972|title-link=Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature}}</ref>\n\nLaw and order in Northerns set in Canada is most often represented by the Mounties, either the [[North-West Mounted Police]] or [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] depending on era.  Like snow, Mounties are a common enough feature to become a synonym for the genre, with Northern films sometimes called \"Mountie films\".<ref>{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9781134317066|section=Canada|quote='Mounties' (RCMP officers) have been widely mythologized and lampooned in Anglophone popular culture, from the dozens of early Hollywood Mountie films or 'Northerns' (''McGuire of the Mounted'', ''Rose Marie'') and popular television series ''Sergeant Preston of the Yukon'' and ''Due South'', to the cinematic spoof ''Dudley Do-Right'' [...]}}</ref>  Their popularity was not confined to film; by 1930, 75 volumes of written Mountie fiction had been published, not including juvenile fiction and material published in magazines.<ref name=\"Harrison\">{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Best Mounted Police Stories|first=Dick|last=Harrison|publisher=University of Alberta|year=1978|isbn=9780888640543}}</ref> Where a protagonist in a Western is often part of both civilization and the wild (whether native or criminal), Mounties in Northerns are entirely a part of civilization.<ref name=\"Harrison\" />  The nature of fictional Mounties can vary depending on the nationality of the author.<ref name=\"Harrison\" />  Mounties as written by British authors are often younger members of upper class British families serving the British Empire in the colonies.  American-authored Mounties are often little different from [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshalls]] and project the values of Westerns in that they place their individual sense of justice and conscience above their duty to the law. Canadian-authored Mounties represent, and are self-abnegating champions of, the Canadian establishment and its laws.  Further, their authority does not come from either their social class or physical abilities; such a Mountie \"upholds the law by moral rather than physical force\".<ref name=\"Harrison\" />  A common story outline for Northerns involving Mounties is a pursuit, confrontation and capture: the Mountie's pursuit of a fugitive takes place across the Canadian wilderness and may be resolved non-violently.<ref name=\"Harrison\" />\n\nAccording to [[Pierre Berton]] \"the French-Canadian was to the northerns what the Mexican was to the westerns \u2014 an exotic primitive, adaptable as a chameleon to play a hero or a heavy.\"<ref name=Berton>{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Berton|authorlink=Pierre Berton|chapter=Hollywood's Canada|title=Canadian Culture|editor-first=Elspeth|editor-last=Cameron|publisher=Canadian Scholars\u2019 Press|year=1997|isbn=9781551300900}}</ref> French-Canadians were a ubiquitous element of the genre.  As characters, French-Canadians are typically depicted as rustic and uneducated. These characters were usually divided into two broad types: the heroic, happy-go-lucky bon-vivant and the villainous, lecherous killer.  Some later examples merged the two stereotypes into a charming, roguish [[anti-villain]].<ref name=Berton />  Common visual elements were a [[tuque]], a sash and a pipe.<ref name=Berton />  All were present in the first appearance in film, in ''[[A Woman's Way (1908 film)|A Woman's Way]]'' (1908).<ref name=Berton />  Female French-Canadian characters also followed the \"tempestuous\" stereotype of female Mexican characters.  Mexican actress [[Lupe V\u00e9lez]], in line with her identity as \"The Mexican Spitfire\", played the title character in ''[[Tiger Rose (1929 film)|Tiger Rose]]'' (1929) in this mode; as did [[Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e]] in ''[[The Eternal Struggle (film)|The Eternal Struggle]]'' (1923) and Nikki Duval in ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951).<ref name=Berton />\n\nA common anachronism in Northerns was the tyranny and absolute power of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and its officers, even into the modern period.<ref name=Berton />  This was repeated not just in fiction but by reviewers and critics too.<ref name=Berton />  The concept of ''La Longue Traverse'', or the Journey of Death, comes from ''[[The Call of the North (1914 film)|The Call of the North]]'' (1914) and was popular in later films.  In this, the Hudson's Bay Company executes convicts by forcing them into the wilderness without equipment or supplies.<ref name=Berton />  In 1921, the Hudson's Bay Company successfully sued the [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]] for the villainous portrayal of their Company in the latters' remake ''[[The Call of the North (1921 film)|The Call of the North]]''.<ref name=Berton />\n\n[[Alaska Natives]] or [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] are featured in some depictions.\n\nBesides being set in [[Canadian Prairies]], the stories often contrast the [[American frontier]] with the Canadian frontier in several ways.  In films such as ''[[Pony Soldier]]'' and ''[[Saskatchewan (film)|Saskatchewan]]'' the North-West Mounted Police display reason, compassion and a sense of fair play in their dealings with [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal people]] ([[First Nations]]) as opposed to hotheaded American visitors (often criminals), lawmen or the American Army who seem to prefer [[Genocide|extermination]] with violence.\n\n==History==\nDavid Skene-Melvin classes the \"second period\" of Canadian crime literature (1880\u20131920), as \"the heyday of the 'Northern' and the literary exploration of Canada's remote and romantic frontiers.\"<ref name=SkeneMelvin>{{cite book|first=David|last=Skene-Melvin|chapter=Canadian Crime Writing in English|title=Detecting Canada|editor-first=Jeannette|editor-last=Sloniowski|editor-first2=Marilyn|editor-last2=Rose|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781554589289}}</ref>  He refers to [[Joseph Edmund Collins]] as an important figure in this period because, despite his work being of low quality, he was the first Canadian author to address some aspects of the 'Matter of Canada' in his novels, such as ''The Story of Louis Riel: The Rebel Chief'' (1885) and ''Annette, the M\u00e9tis Spy'' (1886).<ref name=SkeneMelvin />  Northerns continued to be written after 1920 but Canadian authors largely moved to other genres after World War 1 as they moved away from a frontier and colonial ethos.<ref name=SkeneMelvin />\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush]] during the 1890s in Canada and Alaska brought a lot of wider, international attention to the far north of North America.<ref name=\"Pronzini\" />  Adventure novels from veterans of the gold rush\u2014such as [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (1903), [[Rex Beach]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (1906) and [[Robert W. Service]]'s ''[[The Trail of Ninety-Eight]]'' (1909)\u2014became best sellers.<ref name=\"Pronzini\" />  These inspired more adventure fiction which grew in popularity throughout the first half of the twentieth century.<ref name=\"Pronzini\" />  The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years,<ref name=\"Pronzini\" /><ref name=\"Solomon\" /> with a \"Mountie craze\" hitting its peak during the mid-1920s.<ref name=\"Berton\" />\n\nA large amount of Northern fiction is the work of non-Canadians.  Nevertheless, Skene-Melvin writes \"Just as the Western is widely regarded as emblematic of American culture, it can be argued that the Northern is the only truly indigenous Canadian art form, even if most of its exponents have been foreigners.\"<ref name=SkeneMelvin />\n\nOne of the earliest international examples of the genre is the British play ''The Klondyke Nugget'', which was first performed in 1898.<ref name=\"Solomon\" />  Its author, [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] initially wrote it as a Western but changed the location to capitalize on the contemporary gold rush.<ref name=\"Solomon\" />\n\n[[Charlie Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin's]] 1925 film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' is a comedy that parodies some of the cliches of the Northern genre.<ref name=\"Solomon\">{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Solomon|title=The Gold Rush|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=9781137516114|quote=Chaplin's decision to have ''The Gold Rush'' take place during the 1897\u20138 Klondike Gold Rush placed it squarely within the well established Northern genre, which spanned theatre, literature and film, encompassing stories about trappers, adventurers, lumberjacks, miners, Mounties, Eskimos, and others-even animals-in the Far North.}}</ref> The [[Looney Tunes]] character [[Blacque Jacque Shellacque]], who first appeared in the 1959 short ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]'', is another parody.<ref name=\"Hutchison\" />\n\nWhile the Hollywood [[Western (genre)|Western]] began to change in the post-World War 2 era and the Western myth was eventually debunked, Hollywood Northerns remained unchanged until they stopped being produced in the late 1950s and the underlying mythology was never examined.<ref name=Berton />\n\n==Examples of Northerns==\n[[File:Heart of the Klondike - Chilkoot Pass.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for the play ''Heart of the Klondike'' (c. 1897)]]\n[[File:McKenna of the Mounted poster.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for the film ''[[McKenna of the Mounted]]'' (1932)]]\n[[File:Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of Richard Simmons as Sergeant Preston and Yukon King from the television series ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon (TV series)|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'']]\n\n===Folklore of Canada (Canadian oral stories)===\n* [[Chasse-galerie]], the enchanted canoe that flies over the water of the river like a bird\n* [[Johnny Chinook]], the Canadian cowboy and rancher of [[Alberta]]\n* [[Big Joe Mufferaw]], [[woodsman]] [[Paul Bunyan]] of Canada.\n* [[Louis Riel]]\n\n===Poetry===\n* ''[[The Songs of a Sourdough|The Spell of the Yukon]]'' by [[Robert W.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective cover to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective cover to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]] and tasked with delaying the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat's diamond industry grew tremendously. Currently most of the diamond polishing workshops are running in the [[Varachha]] area of Surat, mostly by the people of the [[Patel]] community.<ref name=diamondhistory>{{cite journal|title=Diamond and Patels|citeseerx = 10.1.1.1026.5615|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, 8 out of 10 diamonds on the market were cut and polished in Surat. This industry earns India about US$10 billion in annual exports. A legacy of old Dutch trade links, it began after a Surti entrepreneur returned from East Africa bringing diamond cutters. The rough diamonds are mined in South Africa and other regions of the African continent, and go from here as smooth gems to Antwerp, Belgium where the international diamond trade is run mainly by Hasidic Jews and Jains from Palanpur in North Gujarat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/6/104|title=https://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/6/104|website=www.gujarattourism.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165648/https://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/6/104|archive-date=13 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Textiles===\n[[File:SuratAhmedabadMumbai 020.jpg|thumbnail|Surat's Textile District Ring Road]]\nSince it is known for producing textiles, including silk, Surat is known as the textile hub of the nation or the Silk City of India.
