The company pronounces its name Ravn like the bird, [[Raven]].\n\n[[Hageland Aviation Services]] and [[Frontier Flying Service]], the sister airlines of Corvus, also fly under the Ravn brand as '''Ravn Connect'''. '''Hageland Aviation Services''' operates scheduled passenger flights for Ravn Alaska, while '''Frontier Flying Service''' operates cargo and charter services.\n\nRavn has a partnership with [[Alaska Airlines]], allowing passengers to book [[Codeshare agreement|codesharing flights]] and allowing passengers on most Ravn flights to earn miles in Alaska's [[Mileage Plan]] frequent-flyer program.\n\nOn April 5, 2020 Ravn filed for bankruptcy and ceased all operations, along with laying off all staff.<ref>https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/RavnAir-stops-all-operations-and-lays-off-staff-due-to-COVID-19-pandemic-569394471.html</ref><ref>https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/aviation/2020/04/02/ravn-suspends-air-service-including-mail-deliveries-to-most-rural-alaska-communities/</ref><ref>https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/04/05/ravnair-group-stops-all-flights-and-lays-off-staff-due-to-covid-19/</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Era Aviation, loading.jpg|thumb|An Era Alaska [[Bombardier Dash 8|de Havilland Dash 8-100]] operated by Era Aviation, 2008]]\n[[File:Ravn Alaska B1900C (Quintin Soloviev - QFS Aviation).jpg|thumb|A Ravn Alaska Beechcraft 1900C (N575Q) in Nome, Alaska.]]\n\nCorvus Airlines traces its roots back to 1948 and the founding of '''Economy Helicopters'''. The company was founded by Carl Brady, when he flew the first commercial helicopter to Alaska to work on a mapping contract for the U.S. government.\n\nIn the years that followed, Economy Helicopters renamed itself '''Era Helicopters''' and the company saw most of its business by supporting [[Offshore drilling|offshore oil drilling]]. Era's helicopters supported the efforts to build the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Alyeska Pipeline]] and it was during the construction of the pipeline that the company started its fixed-wing division with [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHaviland Twin Otter]] and [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 580]] aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flyravn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Media_Kit_History.pdf|title=Ravn Alaska History|access-date=November 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the construction of the pipeline, Era saw an opportunity to scheduled passenger service, which first started in May 1983. The Convair planes were used for service to Valdez, Kenai, Kodiak, Cordova, and Homer. The Twin Otter fleet was based out of Bethel and operated service to many of the small communities surrounding it.\n\nIn 1988, Era Helicopters formally changed its name to '''Era Aviation'''.\n\nThe company endured a very turbulent transition between December 2004 and December 2006, which saw several changes in ownership, the spinoff of the Era Helicopters division,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and the company entering and emerging from [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|chapter 11 bankruptcy]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/economy/article/rivals-acquire-era-aviation/2009/02/17/|title=Rivals to acquire Era Aviation|last=White|first=Bill|date=February 17, 2009|website=Anchorage Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2009, HoTH Inc., the holding company that owned [[Hageland Aviation Services]] and [[Frontier Flying Service]], purchased Era Aviation.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, Era Helicopters was not part of the acquisition and instead became an independent company.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/aviation/article/era-alaska-becoming-ravn-alaska/2014/01/05/|title=Era Alaska rebranding itself as Ravn Alaska|last=Mondor|first=Colleen|date=January 4, 2014|website=Anchorage Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref> In October 2009, HoTH Inc. also acquired [[Arctic Circle Air Service]], a local cargo airline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/bush-pilot/article/hoth-buys-arctic-circle-air-service/2009/10/15/|title=HoTH buys Arctic Circle Air Service|last=Saul|first=Joshua|date=October 14, 2009|website=Anchorage Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref> The combined air group rebranded itself as '''Era Alaska''', taking advantage of Era's recognizable name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.akbizmag.com/Alaska-Business-Monthly/December-2009/HoTH-Inc-Announces-Rebranding-OF-Air-Carrier-Group/|title=HoTH Inc.

The company was founded by Carl Brady, when he flew the first commercial helicopter to Alaska to work on a mapping contract for the U.S. government.\n\nIn the years that followed, Economy Helicopters renamed itself '''Era Helicopters''' and the company saw most of its business by supporting [[Offshore drilling|offshore oil drilling]]. Era's helicopters supported the efforts to build the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Alyeska Pipeline]] and it was during the construction of the pipeline that the company started its fixed-wing division with [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHaviland Twin Otter]] and [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 580]] aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flyravn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Media_Kit_History.pdf|title=Ravn Alaska History|access-date=November 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the construction of the pipeline, Era saw an opportunity to scheduled passenger service, which first started in May 1983. The Convair planes were used for service to Valdez, Kenai, Kodiak, Cordova, and Homer. The Twin Otter fleet was based out of Bethel and operated service to many of the small communities surrounding it.\n\nIn 1988, Era Helicopters formally changed its name to '''Era Aviation'''.\n\nThe company endured a very turbulent transition between December 2004 and December 2006, which saw several changes in ownership, the spinoff of the Era Helicopters division,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and the company entering and emerging from [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|chapter 11 bankruptcy]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/economy/article/rivals-acquire-era-aviation/2009/02/17/|title=Rivals to acquire Era Aviation|last=White|first=Bill|date=February 17, 2009|website=Anchorage Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2009, HoTH Inc., the holding company that owned [[Hageland Aviation Services]] and [[Frontier Flying Service]], purchased Era Aviation.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, Era Helicopters was not part of the acquisition and instead became an independent company.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/aviation/article/era-alaska-becoming-ravn-alaska/2014/01/05/|title=Era Alaska rebranding itself as Ravn Alaska|last=Mondor|first=Colleen|date=January 4, 2014|website=Anchorage Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref> In October 2009, HoTH Inc. also acquired [[Arctic Circle Air Service]], a local cargo airline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/bush-pilot/article/hoth-buys-arctic-circle-air-service/2009/10/15/|title=HoTH buys Arctic Circle Air Service|last=Saul|first=Joshua|date=October 14, 2009|website=Anchorage Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref> The combined air group rebranded itself as '''Era Alaska''', taking advantage of Era's recognizable name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.akbizmag.com/Alaska-Business-Monthly/December-2009/HoTH-Inc-Announces-Rebranding-OF-Air-Carrier-Group/|title=HoTH Inc.

He was part of [[Art Blakey]]'s band for two years, then backed vocalist [[Betty Carter]] from 1965 to 1967, before joining [[Woody Herman]]'s big band, where he stayed until 1970. Following these largely mainstream jazz experiences, Hicks expanded into [[free jazz|freer]] bands, including those of trumpeters [[Charles Tolliver]] and [[Lester Bowie]]. He rejoined Carter in 1975; the five-year stay brought him more attention and helped to launch his recording career as a leader. He continued to play and record extensively in the United States and internationally. Under his own leadership, his recordings were mostly [[bebop]]-influenced, while those for other leaders continued to be in a diversity of styles, including multi-year associations with saxophonists [[Arthur Blythe]], [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]], [[David \"Fathead\" Newman]], and [[Pharoah Sanders]].\n\n==Early life==\nHicks was born in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, on December 21, 1941,<ref name=\"guardian\" /> the oldest of five children.<ref name=\"NYAM\" /> As a child, he moved with his family around the United States, as his father, Rev John Hicks Sr, took up jobs with the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church.<ref name=\"guardian\">Vacher, Peter (May 12, 2006) [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/may/12/guardianobituaries.usa \"John Hicks\"].
