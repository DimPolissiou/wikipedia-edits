He became known in Europe with his 2005 book ''NATO's Secret Armies'', an adaption of his 2001 dissertation. Since then he has published, among other things, on open and covert military actions of [[NATO]] countries, which he describes as being contrary to international law, as well as on the global maximum production of crude oil. He picks up on various conspiracy theories, especially on [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]] and presents them as explanatory approaches still to be examined by scientists. Since September 2019, he holds that the Hulsey study has scientifically proven that only a controlled demolition by explosives can explain the destruction of World Trade Center 7.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rubikon.news/artikel/die-sprengung|title=Die Sprengung|website=www.rubikon.news|language=de|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nGanser was born in [[Lugano]], Switzerland as the son of the protestant priest Gottfried Ganser and the nurse Jeanette Ganser.

In this book, Ganser states that [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] units were in close cooperation with NATO and the CIA and that Gladio in Italy was responsible for terrorist attacks against the Italian civilian population.<ref>Andreas Anton, Michael Schetsche, Michael K. Walter ''Konspiration'' p. 175, Springer VS 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-531-19324-3}}</ref>\n\nPeer Henrik Hansen, a scholar at [[Roskilde University]], wrote two scathing criticisms of the book for the ''[[International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence]]'' and the ''Journal of Intelligence History'', describing Ganser's work as \"a journalistic book with a big spoonful of conspiracy theories\" that \"fails to present proof of and an in-depth explanation of the claimed conspiracy between USA, CIA, NATO and the European countries.\"  Hansen also criticized Ganser for basing his \"claim of the big conspiracy\" on the [[US Army Field Manual 30-31B]], which members of the intelligence community claim is just a 'Cold War era hoax document.'<ref>Peer Henrik Hansen, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070826145603/http://www.intelligence-history.org/jih/reviews-5-1.html Review of NATO\u2019s Secret Armies],\" Journal of Intelligence History, Summer 2005.

Davies of the [[Brunel University London|Brunel University]] Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies likewise concludes that the book is \"marred by imagined conspiracies, exaggerated notions of the scale and impact of covert activities, misunderstandings of the management and coordination of operations within and between national governments, and... an almost complete failure to place the actions and decisions in question in the appropriate historical context.\" According to Davies, \"The underlying problem is that Ganser has not really undertaken the most basic necessary research to be able to discuss covert action and special operations effectively\".<ref>Philip HJ Davies, \"Review of NATO\u2019s Secret Armies,\" The Journal of Strategic Studies, December 2005, 1064-1068.</ref> \n\n[[Olav Riste]] of the [[Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies]], writing for the journal ''Intelligence and National Security'', mentions several instances where his own research on the stay-behind network in Norway was twisted by Ganser and concludes that \"A detailed refutation of the many unfounded allegations that Ganser accepts as historical findings would fill an entire book\".<ref>Olav Riste, \"Review of NATO\u2019s Secret Armies,\" Intelligence and National Security, September 2005, 550-551.</ref> In a later joint article with Leopoldo Nuti of the [[Roma Tre University|University of Rome III]], the two concluded that the book's \"ambitious conclusions do not seem to be entirely corroborated by a sound evaluation of the sources available.\"<ref>Olav Riste and Leopoldo Nuti, \"Introduction: Strategy of 'Stay-Behind',\" The Journal of Strategic Studies, December 2007, 930.</ref>\n\n[[Lawrence F. Kaplan|Lawrence Kaplan]] wrote a mixed review commending Ganser for making \"heroic efforts to tease out the many strands that connect this interlocking right-wing conspiracy\", but also arguing that \"Connecting the dots between terrorist organizations in NATO countries and a master plan centred in NATO's military headquarters requires a stretch of facts that Ganser cannot manage.\" Kaplan believes that some of Ganser's theories \"may be correct\", but that \"they do damage to the book's credibility.\"<ref>Lawrence Kaplan, \"Review of NATO\u2019s Secret Armies,\" The International History Review, September 2006, 685-686.</ref> \n\nIn a mostly positive review for the journal ''Cold War History'', [[Beatrice Heuser]] praised Ganser's \"fascinating study\" while also noting that \"It would definitely have improved the work if Ganser had used a less polemical tone, and had occasionally conceded that the Soviet Empire was by no means nicer\".<ref>Beatrice Heuser, \"Review of NATO\u2019s Secret Armies,\" Cold War History, November 2006, 567-568.</ref> \n\nSecurity analyst [[John Prados]] writes \"Ganser, the principal analyst of Gladio, presents evidence across many nations that Gladio networks amounted to anti-democratic elements in their own societies.\"<ref>John Prados ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA'' 2006, p. 95, {{ISBN|978-1-61578-011-2}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[State Department]] stated in 2006 that Ganser had been taken in by long-discredited Cold-War era disinformation and \"fooled by the forgery\".
