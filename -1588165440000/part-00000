No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.\n\nIn theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.\n\nA collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light. The amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] equation, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |date=11 August 2011\n |title=Smidgen of Antimatter Surrounds Earth\n |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926174944/http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html\n |archivedate=26 September 2011\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nAntimatter particles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons .

No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.\n\nIn theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.\n\nA collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.\n\nOne researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:\n{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |year=2004 [2008]\n |title=Angels and Demons: Do antimatter atoms exist?\n |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |accessdate=2010-11-18\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160609/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archivedate=2010-11-16\n}}</ref>}}\n--->\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main|Antimatter weapon}}\n\nAntimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |title=Antimatter weapons\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424174413/http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |archivedate=24 April 2013\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Gsponer |first1=Andre\n |last2=Hurni |first2=Jean-Pierre\n |year=1987\n |chapter=The physics of antimatter induced fusion and thermonuclear explosions\n |editor1-last=Velarde |editor1-first=G.\n |editor2-last=Minguez |editor2-first=E.\n |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, Madrid, June/July, 1986\n |volume=4 |issue=30 |pages=66\u2013169\n |publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n |arxiv=physics/0507114\n |bibcode=2005physics...7114G\n}}</ref> However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the [[Cold War]], and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101650/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F04%2FMNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |archivedate=9 June 2012\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Antimatter comet}}\n* {{annotated link|Plasma cosmology#Alfv\u00e9n\u2013Klein cosmology}}\n* {{annotated link|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=G.

Despite being so critical of himself, LaMarche would be granted the opportunity of being part of the 1985 [[HBO]] production, ''Rodney Dangerfield Hosts the 9th Annual Young Comedians Special'', on which also appeared [[Bob Saget]], [[Rita Rudner]], [[Louie Anderson]], [[Yakov Smirnoff]], and the breakout first appearance of [[Sam Kinison]]. Although he was received and reviewed favorably, in looking back on his own performance in that special, LaMarche believed he was \"probably about five years away from going from being a good comedian to being a great comedian\" and being the \"only impressionist that actually comes from somewhere\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Plume |first=Ken |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (Questions 42\u201343) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303214850/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |archivedate=2008-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his standup career, LaMarche opened for such acts as [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[George Carlin]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[David Sanborn]] and [[Donna Summer]], usually in the main showrooms of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Atlantic City]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Plume |first=Ken |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (45th question) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303214850/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |archivedate=2008-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 1987, LaMarche's father was murdered, shot to death by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby, in front of dozens of witnesses.

When LaMarche left the show in 1981, a young up-and-coming comic named [[Jim Carrey]] was recruited to take his place as a voice actor.  <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/scrollingeye/article/15643 |title=All-Night Show's new dawn |first=Marc |last=Weisblott |date=21 January 2008 |newspaper=[[Eye Weekly]] |accessdate=2008-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522152801/http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/scrollingeye/article/15643 |archivedate=2011-05-22 }}</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nIt took a few years after his 1981 move to L.A. for LaMarche to establish himself in the American voiceover industry, which he initially pursued as a side endeavor during his full-time standup comedy career.  LaMarche began on ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' in 1983, and went on to ''[[Dennis the Menace (1986 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Popeye and Son]]'' and ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' where he played [[Egon Spengler]]. After ''The Real Ghostbusters'', LaMarche became a regular mainstay of the voiceover industry, appearing in such shows as ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1989 TV series)|GI Joe]]'', ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Taz-Mania]]'', ''[[Where's Waldo? (TV series)|Where's Waldo]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'' before landing perhaps his most recognized role in 1993 as [[Pinky and the Brain#The Brain|The Brain]] on ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and later its spin-off show ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''. Following this, LaMarche worked on ''[[The Critic]]'', ''[[Freakazoid!]]'', and ''[[The Tick]]'' before then reprising his role of Egon in ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]''. The stretch of two years after this saw LaMarche portray characters in such shows as ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'' as Big Bob Pataki, ''[[Queer Duck]]'', ''[[The Chimp Channel]]'', and ''[[Sonic Underground]]'' as Sleet. During this time Maurice would become the voice actor for [[Mortimer Mouse (Disney)|Mortimer Mouse]] whom he would voice in the television series ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. It was at this time, 1999, that LaMarche began work on ''[[Futurama]]'', and since ''Futurama'' LaMarche has continued to work steadily in television, including guest roles on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (where he once again parodied [[Orson Welles]]). His most recent regular role came as Hovis the butler on the Nickelodeon series ''[[Catscratch]]''. LaMarche was the voice of Victor in Playhouse Disney's ''[[Handy Manny]]''  Halloween episode.\n\nLaMarche has done various voice work for many [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[DiC Entertainment]] cartoons.  He also delivered the protracted belches for the \"Great Wakkorotti\" shorts on ''Animaniacs'', in which [[Wakko Warner]] performed various pieces of music. In 2011, LaMarche reprised his role as [[Yosemite Sam]] in [[Cartoon Network]]'s new series, ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', and its spin-off, ''[[New Looney Tunes]]''.\n\nLaMarche made several roles in ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' where he voiced Chancellor Neighsay.\n\n====Pinky and the Brain====\nLaMarche plays the character of The Brain in both ''Animaniacs'' and [[Pinky and the Brain|the spin-off]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centurycityview.org/stan-lees-comikaze-expo-p361-176.htm |title=Stan Lee\u2019s Comikaze Expo 2016 |publisher=Century City View |date= |accessdate=2016-10-31}}</ref> In creating the voice for Brain, LaMarche says he looked at a picture of the character and immediately thought of [[Orson Welles]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=2 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (5th question) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118110117/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=2 |archivedate=2008-01-18 }}</ref> although the character was not modeled after Welles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=3 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (3rd page, 27th question) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051034/http://quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=3 |archivedate=2007-10-16 }}</ref> Voicing Brain gave LaMarche the opportunity to make use of his signature impersonation of Welles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2009/11/war-of-the-welles/2 |title=War of the Welles: Seven Actors Who\u2019ve Played Orson |publisher=[[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}</ref> Many ''Pinky and the Brain'' episodes are nods to Welles' career.

He has also done his [[Orson Welles]] impression on the show, winning a 2011 Outstanding Voice-Over Performance Emmy for his portrayal of Lrrr and Orson Welles in the episode \"[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]\". He won another Emmy the following year for the ''Futurama'' episode \"[[The Silence of the Clamps]]\".\n\n==== ''Heroes'' ====\nLaMarche acted, voice only, in the second episode of the hit NBC show ''[[Heroes (TV)|Heroes]]'', \"[[Don't Look Back (Heroes)|Don't Look Back]]\", as the villain [[Sylar]].

The film follows the story of a young standup comedian's attempt to break into the big-time on the L.A. comedy scene. LaMarche played Dickie Lyons, an impressionist who befriends the main character, Mark Champlin. The film also starred [[Howie Mandel]], [[Eileen Brennan]], and [[Miles Chapin]].\n\nIn [[Mark Hamill]]'s 2004 movie ''[[Comic Book: The Movie]]'', LaMarche made a rare live appearance to be in the special features of the [[DVD]] alongside ''Pinky and the Brain'' co-star [[Rob Paulsen]]. Among other gags, he re-enacted his impression of [[Orson Welles]]' famous frozen peas commercial outtake.\n\n=== Commercials ===\nLaMarche has also lent his voice to commercials. He voiced [[Kellogg's]] [[Froot Loops]] spokesbird [[Toucan Sam]], the animated [[Willy Wonka]] character in [[Nestl\u00e9]]'s ''[[Willy Wonka Candy Company]]'' commercials, and the narrator for [[Lexus]] commercials.

He returned to Canada, continued to do stand-up, and also started a career in voice work (see below).\n\nThree years later, at the age of 22, LaMarche moved to [[Los Angeles]] to further his stand-up career.

Despite being so critical of himself, LaMarche would be granted the opportunity of being part of the 1985 [[HBO]] production, ''Rodney Dangerfield Hosts the 9th Annual Young Comedians Special'', on which also appeared [[Bob Saget]], [[Rita Rudner]], [[Louie Anderson]], [[Yakov Smirnoff]], and the breakout first appearance of [[Sam Kinison]]. Although he was received and reviewed favorably, in looking back on his own performance in that special, LaMarche believed he was \"probably about five years away from going from being a good comedian to being a great comedian\" and being the \"only impressionist that actually comes from somewhere\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Plume |first=Ken |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (Questions 42\u201343) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303214850/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |archivedate=2008-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his standup career, LaMarche opened for such acts as [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[George Carlin]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[David Sanborn]] and [[Donna Summer]], usually in the main showrooms of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Atlantic City]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Plume |first=Ken |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (45th question) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303214850/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=1 |archivedate=2008-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 1987, LaMarche's father was murdered, shot to death by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby, in front of dozens of witnesses.

When LaMarche left the show in 1981, a young up-and-coming comic named [[Jim Carrey]] was recruited to take his place as a voice actor.  <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/scrollingeye/article/15643 |title=All-Night Show's new dawn |first=Marc |last=Weisblott |date=21 January 2008 |newspaper=[[Eye Weekly]] |accessdate=2008-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522152801/http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/scrollingeye/article/15643 |archivedate=2011-05-22 }}</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nIt took a few years after his 1981 move to L.A. for LaMarche to establish himself in the American voiceover industry, which he initially pursued as a side endeavor during his full-time standup comedy career.  LaMarche began on ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' in 1983, and went on to ''[[Dennis the Menace (1986 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Popeye and Son]]'' and ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' where he played [[Egon Spengler]]. After ''The Real Ghostbusters'', LaMarche became a regular mainstay of the voiceover industry, appearing in such shows as ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1989 TV series)|GI Joe]]'', ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Taz-Mania]]'', ''[[Where's Waldo? (TV series)|Where's Waldo]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'' before landing perhaps his most recognized role in 1993 as [[Pinky and the Brain#The Brain|The Brain]] on ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and later its spin-off show ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''. Following this, LaMarche worked on ''[[The Critic]]'', ''[[Freakazoid!]]'', and ''[[The Tick]]'' before then reprising his role of Egon in ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]''. The stretch of two years after this saw LaMarche portray characters in such shows as ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'' as Big Bob Pataki, ''[[Queer Duck]]'', ''[[The Chimp Channel]]'', and ''[[Sonic Underground]]'' as Sleet. During this time Maurice would become the voice actor for [[Mortimer Mouse (Disney)|Mortimer Mouse]] whom he would voice in the television series ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. It was at this time, 1999, that LaMarche began work on ''[[Futurama]]'', and since ''Futurama'' LaMarche has continued to work steadily in television, including guest roles on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (where he once again parodied [[Orson Welles]]). His most recent regular role came as Hovis the butler on the Nickelodeon series ''[[Catscratch]]''. LaMarche was the voice of Victor in Playhouse Disney's ''[[Handy Manny]]''  Halloween episode.\n\nLaMarche has done various voice work for many [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[DiC Entertainment]] cartoons.  He also delivered the protracted belches for the \"Great Wakkorotti\" shorts on ''Animaniacs'', in which [[Wakko Warner]] performed various pieces of music. In 2011, LaMarche reprised his role as [[Yosemite Sam]] in [[Cartoon Network]]'s new series, ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', and its spin-off, ''[[New Looney Tunes]]''.\n\nLaMarche made several roles in ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' where he voiced Chancellor Neighsay.\n\n====Pinky and the Brain====\nLaMarche plays the character of The Brain in both ''Animaniacs'' and [[Pinky and the Brain|the spin-off]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centurycityview.org/stan-lees-comikaze-expo-p361-176.htm |title=Stan Lee\u2019s Comikaze Expo 2016 |publisher=Century City View |date= |accessdate=2016-10-31}}</ref> In creating the voice for Brain, LaMarche says he looked at a picture of the character and immediately thought of [[Orson Welles]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=2 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (5th question) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118110117/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=2 |archivedate=2008-01-18 }}</ref> although the character was not modeled after Welles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=3 |title=Interview with Quick Stop Entertainment (3rd page, 27th question) |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051034/http://quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1153&page=3 |archivedate=2007-10-16 }}</ref> Voicing Brain gave LaMarche the opportunity to make use of his signature impersonation of Welles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2009/11/war-of-the-welles/2 |title=War of the Welles: Seven Actors Who\u2019ve Played Orson |publisher=[[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}</ref> Many ''Pinky and the Brain'' episodes are nods to Welles' career.

He won another Emmy the following year for the ''Futurama'' episode \"[[The Silence of the Clamps]]\".\n\n==== ''Heroes'' ====\nLaMarche acted, voice only, in the second episode of the hit NBC show ''[[Heroes (TV)|Heroes]]'', \"[[Don't Look Back (Heroes)|Don't Look Back]]\", as the villain [[Sylar]].

The film follows the story of a young standup comedian's attempt to break into the big-time on the L.A. comedy scene. LaMarche played Dickie Lyons, an impressionist who befriends the main character, Mark Champlin. The film also starred [[Howie Mandel]], [[Eileen Brennan]], and [[Miles Chapin]].\n\nIn [[Mark Hamill]]'s 2004 movie ''[[Comic Book: The Movie]]'', LaMarche made a rare live appearance to be in the special features of the [[DVD]] alongside ''Pinky and the Brain'' co-star [[Rob Paulsen]]. Among other gags, he re-enacted his impression of [[Orson Welles]]' famous frozen peas commercial outtake.\n\n=== Commercials ===\nLaMarche has also lent his voice to commercials. He voiced [[Kellogg's]] [[Froot Loops]] spokesbird [[Toucan Sam]], the animated [[Willy Wonka]] character in [[Nestl\u00e9]]'s ''[[Willy Wonka Candy Company]]'' commercials, and the narrator for [[Lexus]] commercials. He would also appear as himself, doing the voice of [[Popeye the Sailor]] for the [[Long John Silver's]] restaurant chain in the early 1990s.\n\nOn 8 September 2018 LaMarche was featured in the commercial for the upcoming open world driving game ''[[Forza Horizon 4]]''.\n\n=== Theme parks ===\nLaMarche provided the voice of [[Yosemite Sam]] for the ''Yosemite Sam and the Gold River Adventure'' [[dark ride]] at [[Six Flags Over Texas]], which opened in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Maurice-LaMarche/|title=Maurice LaMarche |website=Behind the Voice Actors|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nLaMarche has been married to Robin Eisenman since May 19, 1991; together they have a son, Jonathan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/34/Maurice-Lamarche.html|title=Maurice Lamarche Biography (1958-)|website=www.filmreference.com}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" <!-- Please note: inserting \"rowspan\" breaks table sortability -->\n|+ List of voice performances in films\n!

Though he often fights with his cousin Gopi ([[Deepak Dobriyal]])\u2014who runs a competing sweet-shop nearby\u2014over the Ghasiteram family name, they are greatly fond of each other and of Champak's daughter Tarika ([[Radhika Madan]]), who has always harboured a dream to travel and study abroad. Despite Tarika being poor in studies, Champak is strongly supportive of her dream, and, with some effort, she secures a high rank in her final school examinations, enough for her to secure a scholarship from London's Truford University, which has partnered with her school.\n\nOn the school's Annual Day, Champak notices that the chief guest is Judge Chheda, who had accepted a watch as a bribe from Gopi a few days before so that he could win the rights to the Ghasiteram name. He goes on stage and exposes the judge, who is in the middle of a speech on honesty and values, not knowing that he is the principal's husband. The following morning, he meets the principal at her home and asks for forgiveness, only for her to tear Tarika's scholarship letter to pieces. He vows to send Tarika to London, come what may.\n\nWith the help of a London-based acquaintance, Bablu ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), Champak and Tarika along with Gopi proceed to London so that Tarika can find accommodation there till college opens. However, Champak and Gopi are caught and interrogated by the airport police. When they inadvertently say that they have 'drugs', they are deported and their passports blacklisted. Tarika, who had been calling Champak, Gopi and Bablu to no avail, goes to a rented home, and starts enjoying the free-spirited London life while also trying to fund her education. Meanwhile, Champak and Gopi are referred to a fixer in Dubai, Tony ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), who gives them Pakistani aliases and forged passports. They return to London and are briefly accosted by Naina ([[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]), a cop. They find lodging in a house owned by Mrs. Kohli ([[Dimple Kapadia]]), who is Naina's estranged mother.\n\nWhen they meet Tarika, Champak is aghast at her lifestyle, and demands that she leave her lodgings or he will severe ties with her. Gopi asks him why he says so, to which he replies that this is in order to avoid getting caught by Naina. The two visit a police station, where Bablu is lodged; they pay for his bail, and he tells them that he is now penniless. One night, Mrs. Kohli has invited the Bansals for dinner on the eve of her birthday, when Naina suddenly barges in and says that since her mother has not cared for her, she can do whatever she pleases. The next day, Champak and Gopi find the senior Kohli unconscious on the floor, and rush her to the hospital, narrowly saving her life. When Naina arrives on the scene, she breaks down and realises the value of caring for her.\n\nChampak, Gopi and Bablu hear of a fundraiser organised by Truford University and reluctantly agree to bid for its renovation, which costs 250,000 pounds. At their wits' end for arranging for such a large sum, they agree to sell the Ghasiteram family name. When Champak tells Tarika the news, she is nonplussed. The next day, as the three go to a scrapyard to collect the money, Champak pours his entire story to Tarika, who is convinced that she should not have put him and Gopi through so much trouble to fulfil her dream. Tarika later decides to give up her London scholarship and study back home in Udaipur, to which everyone agrees. The film ends with Champak and Gopi making peace over the Ghasiteram name.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Champak Bansal\n* [[Radhika Madan]] as Tarika Bansal\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Gopi Bansal \n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Mrs. Sampada Kohli\n*[[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] as Officer Naina Kohli\n* [[Ranvir Shorey]] as Balashankar Tripathi / Bablu\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Tony \n* [[Kiku Sharda]] as Gajju\n* [[Manu Rishi]] as Bheluram Bansal\n* [[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]] as Judge Chedda\n* [[Meghna Malik]] as Principal\n* [[Poorvi Jain]] as Rashi Bansal\n* [[Manish Gandhi]] as Advait\n* [[Tillotama Shome]] as Consultant\n* Vipul Tank as Lagnesh\n* Ankit Bisht as Anmol\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Katrina Kaif]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Alia Bhatt]] Special appearance in song  \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Janhvi Kapoor]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Ananya Panday]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Kriti Sanon]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Kiara Advani]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\"\n\n== Production ==\nIn June 2017 in an interview after the success of his film ''[[Hindi Medium]]'' producer [[Dinesh Vijan]] told ''[[Mid Day]]'', \"There is definitely scope for a sequel.

Though he often fights with his cousin Gopi ([[Deepak Dobriyal]])\u2014who runs a competing sweet-shop nearby\u2014over the Ghasiteram family name, they are greatly fond of each other and of Champak's daughter Tarika ([[Radhika Madan]]), who has always harboured a dream to travel and study abroad. Despite Tarika being poor in studies, Champak is strongly supportive of her dream, and, with some effort, she secures a high rank in her final school examinations, enough for her to secure a scholarship from London's Truford University, which has partnered with her school.\n\nOn the school's Annual Day, Champak notices that the chief guest is Judge Chheda, who had accepted a watch as a bribe from Gopi a few days before so that he could win the rights to the Ghasiteram name. He goes on stage and exposes the judge, who is in the middle of a speech on honesty and values, not knowing that he is the principal's husband. The following morning, he meets the principal at her home and asks for forgiveness, only for her to tear Tarika's scholarship letter to pieces. He vows to send Tarika to London, come what may.\n\nWith the help of a London-based acquaintance, Bablu ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), Champak and Tarika along with Gopi proceed to London so that Tarika can find accommodation there till college opens. However, Champak and Gopi are caught and interrogated by the airport police. When they inadvertently say that they have 'drugs', they are deported and their passports blacklisted. Tarika, who had been calling Champak, Gopi and Bablu to no avail, goes to a rented home, and starts enjoying the free-spirited London life while also trying to fund her education. Meanwhile, Champak and Gopi are referred to a fixer in Dubai, Tony ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), who gives them Pakistani aliases and forged passports. They return to London and are briefly accosted by Naina ([[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]), a cop. They find lodging in a house owned by Mrs. Kohli ([[Dimple Kapadia]]), who is Naina's estranged mother.\n\nWhen they meet Tarika, Champak is aghast at her lifestyle, and demands that she leave her lodgings or he will severe ties with her. Gopi asks him why he says so, to which he replies that this is in order to avoid getting caught by Naina. The two visit a police station, where Bablu is lodged; they pay for his bail, and he tells them that he is now penniless. One night, Mrs. Kohli has invited the Bansals for dinner on the eve of her birthday, when Naina suddenly barges in and says that since her mother has not cared for her, she can do whatever she pleases. The next day, Champak and Gopi find the senior Kohli unconscious on the floor, and rush her to the hospital, narrowly saving her life. When Naina arrives on the scene, she breaks down and realises the value of caring for her.\n\nChampak, Gopi and Bablu hear of a fundraiser organised by Truford University and reluctantly agree to bid for its renovation, which costs 250,000 pounds. At their wits' end for arranging for such a large sum, they agree to sell the Ghasiteram family name. When Champak tells Tarika the news, she is nonplussed. The next day, as the three go to a scrapyard to collect the money, Champak pours his entire story to Tarika, who is convinced that she should not have put him and Gopi through so much trouble to fulfil her dream. Tarika later decides to give up her London scholarship and study back home in Udaipur, to which everyone agrees. The film ends with Champak and Gopi making peace over the Ghasiteram name.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Champak Bansal\n* [[Radhika Madan]] as Tarika Bansal\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Gopi Bansal \n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Mrs. Sampada Kohli\n*[[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] as Officer Naina Kohli\n* [[Ranvir Shorey]] as Balashankar Tripathi / Bablu\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Tony \n* [[Kiku Sharda]] as Gajju\n* [[Manu Rishi]] as Bheluram Bansal\n* [[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]] as Judge Chedda\n* [[Meghna Malik]] as Principal\n* [[Poorvi Jain]] as Rashi Bansal\n* [[Manish Gandhi]] as Advait\n* [[Tillotama Shome]] as Consultant\n* Vipul Tank as Lagnesh\n* Ankit Bisht as Anmol\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Katrina Kaif]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Alia Bhatt]] Special appearance in song  \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Janhvi Kapoor]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Ananya Panday]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Kriti Sanon]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Kiara Advani]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\"\n\n== Production ==\nIn June 2017 in an interview after the success of his film ''[[Hindi Medium]]'' producer [[Dinesh Vijan]] told ''[[Mid Day]]'', \"There is definitely scope for a sequel.

[[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]] has hired her under mysterious circumstances, against the will of her gruff brother, Roger Collins, who is David's father. Victoria, an orphan, believes the job might lead her to find something about her past. Maggie Evans, a waitress at the local [[inn]], warns Victoria about the Collins family, but Victoria goes to Collinwood anyway. Having arrived at Collinwood, Victoria starts to settle in. During her first night at Collinwood, Victoria is awakened by the sounds of a sobbing woman. While searching for the source of the sound, she meets David, who only says, \u201cI hate you.\"\n\nAfter her first night at Collinwood, Victoria decides to go back to New York. Near Widows' Hill, Victoria meets Sam Evans, an artist and Maggie's alcoholic father, who tells her about [[Josette du Pres|Josette Collins]], a Collins family ancestor who jumped to her death.

Bill Malloy, [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]]'s right-hand man at the family owned cannery, meets with Burke, who admits to Bill he has a grudge against the Collins family. Burke visits Sam Evans, who is very uncomfortable with his return to town. [[Carolyn Stoddard]], Elizabeth's daughter, curious about all the talk of Burke Devlin, goes to his hotel room to meet him and ends up bringing him back to [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]]. Burke meets Elizabeth and offers to buy Collinwood from her, but she tells him it is not for sale. They discuss the five years he spent in prison, and how he has traveled and made a great deal of money in the five years since he has gotten out of prison. Roger believes Burke blames him for being sent to prison ten years ago. Elizabeth tells Carolyn that Burke was convicted of manslaughter ten years ago, and Roger was a witness at the trial. Roger talks with Sam; he says they are the only two people who know what really happened ten years ago. Elizabeth asks Roger if he did send Burke to prison when he was innocent. Roger claims his truthful testimony on the witness stand sent Burke to prison. Whilst [[Victoria Winters]] is at the Evans\u2019 cottage for dinner, Burke's manslaughter case comes up. Sam tells her that Roger and Burke had been out drinking one night. When they decided to go home, Burke had insisted on driving. On the way back, he hit and killed a man. Burke invites himself to dinner with Sam, Maggie, and Victoria. Burke tells his version of the accident that happened ten years ago; he believes that Roger was the one driving the car that night.\n\nBurke tries to 'buy' employees from the Collins cannery, hoping they will help him with his plot to destroy the Collins family. Amos Fitch, one of the Collins cannery employees, makes it clear that he and his colleagues cannot be bought; he then tells Elizabeth of Burke's plan. Elizabeth calls Burke to tell him she is ready for a fight. Burke purchases the Logansport cannery to compete against the Collins cannery. Laura Collins, Roger's estranged wife, returns to Collinsport. Roger and Sam are both concerned, as Laura also knows what happened ten years earlier when Burke was charged with manslaughter. Roger asks Laura where she stands in the Burke's manslaughter case; she claims she has no interest in getting involved. Burke visits Laura at the cottage; he wants Laura to testify that Roger was driving the car the night of the \u201caccident\u201d. Roger, holding a gun, bursts in on Burke and Laura. Roger warns Burke to leave his wife alone. After a brief struggle and a few insults, Burke leaves. Portia Fitzsimmons, an art dealer, visits Sam telling him she wants to arrange a showing of his work, but he needs to get as many samples of his work from ten to twelve years ago. Sam goes to Roger to get some paintings that Roger purchased ten years earlier to buy Sam's silence in Burke's manslaughter case. Sam warns Roger if he does not come up with the paintings, he will go to Burke with the truth. Roger is unable to locate the paintings. Maggie finds out why Roger purchased the paintings from her father; she encourages Sam to tell Burke the truth. Sam invites Burke over and tells him the whole truth about the accident. Burke and Sam confront Roger. Roger finally breaks down and confesses he was responsible for killing the man who Burke went to prison for.

Roger refuses to believe it was a body; they send Matthew Morgan, the [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]] caretaker, to check. Matthew claims to find nothing and shows [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]] the spot and says it was just seaweed that must have washed up on the shore. Later, Matthew confesses to Elizabeth that there ''was'' a body and it was Bill Malloy. He explains he found the body on the shore and pushed it back out to sea. Elizabeth calls the sheriff. Bill Malloy's body is found. Matthew threatens Burke that if he does not leave the Collins family alone, he will kill him; he tries to choke Burke, but the sheriff walks in.\n\nVictoria finds an expensive-looking fountain pen on the beach not far from where Bill was thought to have died, the same pen Roger was supposed to return to Burke the night of Bill's death. Roger steals the fountain pen from Victoria, as he worries that it will be incriminating evidence. He buries it. Whilst locked in one of the disused rooms in Collinwood, Victoria encounters Bill's ghost, who urges her to leave [[Collinsport]] before she is killed like him. Victoria learns that the fountain pen she found belonged to Burke, which leads her to suspect that Burke killed Bill. Carolyn tells Victoria about the pen that Burke gave it her and how Roger lost it the night Bill died. Victoria now suspects Roger. Roger confronts Victoria and swears that he did not kill Bill, but that he found Bill dead when he got to Lookout Point. [[David Collins (Dark Shadows)|David Collins]] tells Matthew that Victoria knows who killed Bill. Victoria is almost killed by someone driving a car on her walk back to Collinwood. Burke tricks Roger into digging up the pen where he buried it; the sheriff and Burke catch him.\n\nVictoria goes to the Old House, the previous [[mansion]] inhabited by the Collins family, also situated on the same grounds as Collinwood, to try to find David. Whilst there, Matthew pushes an [[urn]] off of the roof in an attempt to kill her.

Matthew admits to Elizabeth that he killed Bill and that he tried to kill Victoria. Matthew flees and hides in a secret room at the Old House. Victoria goes to the Old House to find David; while there, she loses her wallet. Victoria later goes back to find it, and Matthew catches her and takes her prisoner, threatening to kill her.

When Julia next meets Barnabas, she implies she knows something about the \u201coriginal\u201d Barnabas Collins that Barnabas would be interested in. Barnabas agrees to meet with Julia the next evening. Barnabas appears in Julia's room and fearing she knows his secret attempts to kill her; however, she is expecting him. Julia tells Barnabas that she may be able to cure his \u201ccondition\u201d.\n\nSam and Joe are tired of not getting answers about Maggie's condition from Julia. Fearing Julia is deceiving him about a cure, Barnabas attempts to kill her, however, she tells him that Maggie is still alive and will name him unless she is able to keep Maggie from remembering. The ghost of Sarah Collins visits Maggie at Windcliff and helps her escape. Maggie walks into the Blue Whale and passes out. She starts to remember what happened to her, however, Julia is able to hypnotize her before she can reveal it. Barnabas attempts to kill Maggie however he hears Sarah singing and leaves. Barnabas feels Julia's experiments to cure him are making him weak. Dr. Woodard comes up with plan to let people think Maggie is getting her memory back to lure out the kidnapper. Julia tells Barnabas she has written a letter that will expose him if anything should happen to her or Maggie. [[Willie Loomis]] is concerned that Barnabas still plans to kill Maggie. Willie breaks into the Evans\u2019 Cottage in an attempt to warn Maggie; however, the police shoot him. They believe him to be Maggie's kidnapper.\n\nDr. Woodard learns that Julia keeps a journal of her experiments on Barnabas. He reads the medical notes and finds out what Barnabas is. Barnabas kills Dr. Woodard with an injection that makes his death look like a heart attack. Barnabas wants Julia treatments accelerated, as he is anxious to win [[Victoria Winters|Victoria Winters']] love and be free of the vampire curse. Julia's treatments on Barnabas cause his hand to change into that of a very old man. Julia prepares another treatment to reverse the aging that Barnabas has experienced; however, the experiment fails and Barnabas ages even more. [[Carolyn Stoddard]] gets suspicious of Barnabas, so she goes to the basement of the Old House where she finds a coffin. Barnabas bites her, placing her under his control. His age is reversed back to normal. Barnabas tells Julia the experiments are over. Julia hypnotizes Victoria and warns her that Barnabas is trying to turn her into Josette Collins. Carolyn finds out Julia is hypnotizing Victoria and tells Barnabas. Julia tells Barnabas she has given her medical notes to someone to turn over to the police if she dies. Barnabas tells Julia that sooner or later he will have her notes and then kill her. He plans to drive her insane so that no one will believe anything she says. She tells him that she has spoken to the ghost of Sarah Collins; he gets angry and tries to strangle her. However, Sarah appears, she tells Barnabas that she will never appear to him again until he learns to be good. A s\u00e9ance is held at Collinwood to contact Sarah Collins; Barnabas fears she will expose him as a vampire. Sarah speaks through Victoria, then Victoria disappears and a strange woman appears in her place.\n|- style=\"border-top: 3px solid silver;\"\n| 9\n| '''1795 Flashback and Barnabas' Curse'''\n| 365 to 461\n| November 17, 1967, to April 1, 1968\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" | [[Victoria Winters]] is transported back in time to 1795 where she meets [[Barnabas Collins]], at the time of the curse. Abigail Collins, Barnabas' religiously fanatic aunt, immediately becomes suspicious of Victoria's strange clothes and behavior, and accuses her of being possessed by the devil. Joshua Collins, Barnabas' gruff and stern father, agrees to hire Victoria as Sarah's governess. Barnabas eagerly awaits the arrival of [[Josette du Pres]] who he will marry. Natalie du Pres, Josette's aunt, and [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique Bouchard]], Josette's maid servant, arrive at [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]]. Angelique and Barnabas apparently had an affair in the past; however, Barnabas turns down her current advances. Josette and her father, Andre duPres arrive. Angelique, jealous, uses witchcraft to cause Barnabas to choke. She then casts a spell that causes Josette and [[Jeremiah Collins]], Barnabas' uncle, to fall in love with each other. Jeremiah decides to leave town to stop his love for Josette from going any further. Angelique turns Joshua into a cat in order to keep Jeremiah at Collinwood. Following the disappearance of Joshua, Natalie starts to suspect Victoria of being a witch. Angelique is forced to cast a new spell on Josette because of the plans to expedite the marriage to Barnabas. As the ceremony is about to begin, Josette disappears. Abigail and Natalie are now certain a witch is operating at Collinwood. The cat turns back into Joshua Collins in Victoria's room while Abigail is searching it. Abigail decides to send for Reverend Trask from Salem.\n\nJeremiah and Josette become concerned that they have hurt their families by marrying each other and decide to go back to Collinwood. Following their return, Barnabas challenges Jeremiah to a duel. Angelique gives Barnabas a good-luck charm to protect him in the duel. He shoots and mortally wounds Jeremiah. Barnabas tells Angelique that he still loves Josette despite what has happened. Angelique causes Sarah Collins to become ill by putting pins in her doll. Barnabas, desperate to help Sarah, agrees to marry Angelique if she can cure Sarah. Angelique then brews a tea that \u201ccures\u201d Sarah. Jeremiah dies. Barnabas and Angelique marry.\n\nReverend Trask performs the rite of exorcism at the threshold of the Old House. At the same time, Angelique casts a spell that causes Victoria's room to catch fire. Barnabas overhears Angelique as she casts her spell. Victoria runs from the fire into Reverend Trask's arms, who takes this as a confirmation that she is a witch and hands her over to the authorities. Barnabas begins to suspect there is a witch but is not sure if it is Angelique or Victoria. After finding out that Angelique is the witch and is the cause of all the trouble and unhappiness at Collinwood, Barnabas shoots her. Believing herself to be mortally wounded, Angelique puts a curse on Barnabas that he will become one of the undead and anyone who loves him will die. A bat suddenly enters the house and bites Barnabas, making him fatally ill. Angelique recovers from the gunshot and begins to feel remorse for placing the curse on Barnabas. She tries to remove it, but is unsuccessful. A doctor suspects that Barnabas has a case of the plague, but is unsure. When Barnabas dies, Joshua insists that his death be kept a secret so that no one in town will fear a possible plague. Barnabas' coffin is interred in a secret room in the mausoleum, and Joshua gives a false report to the town that Barnabas moved to England for business purposes. Angelique attempts to drive a stake through Barnabas\u2019 heart, but he rises from his coffin as a vampire before she is able to do so and he strangles her to death. Barnabas orders Ben Stokes, a servant at Collinwood, to dig a grave for Angelique and bury her. Barnabas intends to turn Josette into a vampire so they may be together for all eternity. However, the ghost of Angelique tricks Josette into going to Widows' Hill where she sees a horrifying vision of what her life will be like with Barnabas. Frightened, Josette falls to her death.\n\nMeanwhile, Victoria is unable to get a respected lawyer to defend her at a witch trial, however, a young law student named Peter Bradford agrees to represent her. Reverend Trask leads the prosecution against her. Peter is unable to prove Victoria's innocence. Despite the best efforts to prove that Angelique was the real witch, Victoria is convicted of witchcraft by the biased panel of judges and sentenced to hang. Barnabas punishes Reverend Trask for what he has done to Victoria by walling him up in the Old House basement. When Joshua finds Barnabas in the Old House, he tells Joshua all about Angelique's curse upon him and that he is one of the undead. Joshua hides Barnabas in the tower room of Collinwood and intends to find a way to lift the curse.\n\nElsewhere, Nathan Forbes pursues [[Millicent Collins-Forbes|Millicent Collins]] affections after finding out she is wealthy. They marry, shortly after Nathan discovers she has signed all her money over to her younger brother [[Daniel Collins (Dark Shadows)|Daniel Collins]]. Nathan drives Millicent insane and plans to kill Daniel to get control of their money. Nathan attempts to gain guardianship of Daniel, however [[Naomi Collins]], Barnabas' mother, sends Daniel out of his reach. Nathan discovers Barnabas is a vampire and tells Naomi what Barnabas is, and that Barnabas is responsible for a recent spate of attacks in [[Collinsport]]. Naomi sees Barnabas bite Millicent and becomes despondent after finding out what her son is. She takes poison, then visits Barnabas and dies in his arms. Barnabas kills Nathan in retribution. Joshua cannot bring himself to kill Barnabas. Unwilling to reveal the secret out of fear about his son being a vampire that it will ruin the family name or save the falsely convicted Victoria, Joshua has Barnabas' coffin in the secret room of the Collins mausoleum chained shut by Ben Stokes, leaving Joshua and Daniel the only surviving members of the Collins family.\n\nVictoria and Peter declare their love for each other, and she is then led to the gallows and hung. As Victoria is hung, she is suddenly transported back to the present day, and Phyllis Wick, the woman who switched places with her at the s\u00e9ance, is sent back to 1795 and hung in Victoria's place.\n|- style=\"border-top: 3px solid silver;\"\n| 10\n| '''The Dream Curse'''\n| 461 to 536\n| April 1, 1968, to July 15, 1968\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" | Although [[Victoria Winters]] endured five months living in the year 1795, only about five minutes passed in the present time when she was away. Victoria has trouble remembering things that happened to her in 1795, however, [[Barnabas Collins]] (remembering Victoria from his past) is concerned she knows too much. Victoria has a dream in which [[Jeremiah Collins]] warns her that Barnabas will destroy her. As Victoria begins to remember, Barnabas becomes more concerned she will expose him as a vampire. He bites her and compels her to forget everything about her experiences in 1795. Victoria purchases a portrait of [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique Collins]], disturbed by it Barnabas burns it, however, it reappears undamaged. [[Dr. Julia Hoffman]] discovers the wounds on Victoria's neck and confronts Barnabas threatening to expose him if he harms Victoria further. Victoria dreams she witnesses Peter Bradford being hanged. Barnabas and Victoria go away together. Whilst out driving, the car crashes as Victoria tries to avoid hitting a man in the road who looks like Peter. Following the accident they are taken to the hospital, Dr. Eric Lang, who is treating Barnabas, tells Julia that he knows what Barnabas is. Dr. Lang exposes Barnabas to sunlight in his hospital room. However, Dr. Lang reveals his treatments have temporarily cured Barnabas of the vampire curse.\n\nMeanwhile, Roger Collins starts to become obsessed with the portrait of Angelique and occasionally believes he is Joshua Collins. Under the spell of the portrait, Roger uses black magic in an attempt to kill Dr. Lang. Barnabas feels he is regressing back into a vampire; however, Dr. Lang believes he has a way to permanently cure him. Roger mysteriously leaves [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]] in the middle of the night with the portrait of Angelique and when he returns, he is now married to a woman named Cassandra Blair. Everyone reacts with shock at the suddenness on the marriage. Barnabas and Victoria both recognize that Cassandra is really Angelique in disguise. Dr. Lang shows Barnabas a body which he plans to transfer Barnabas\u2019 life force into so he escape Angelique's curse.\n\nAngelique comes to Barnabas in a dream and tells him she will turn him back into a vampire through a dream curse; a shared dream that increases in terror as it is passed from one person to another until it reaches its intended victim. Angelique as Cassandra starts the dream curse, she chooses [[Maggie Evans]] to be the first to have it. In the dream, Maggie is beckoned by Jeff Clark to a room, which has several doors, she opens one of them and finds a skull, she is then compelled to recount the dream to Jeff. He and several others experience the dream, each one more terrifying than the last. Professor Timothy Eliot Stokes plans to stop the dream curse by making himself the beckoner when [[Carolyn Stoddard]] experiences dream. He hypnotizes her, Carolyn has the dream and finds her own grave. Professor Stokes has the dream, breaks all the rules of the curse and Angelique appears to him. When he awakens, Sam Evans shows up believing Professor Stokes has something to tell him. Professor Stokes refuses to tell Sam the dream and doesn't feel compelled by the curse to do. Cassandra gives Sam a potion that will continue the dream curse. Sam starts to tell Victoria the dream, however he dies before he can finish. Cassandra raises Sam's ghost and tells him he will not rest until he tells Victoria the dream. Sam tells Victoria the dream and she experiences it in which Barnabas beckons her, and she sees him collapsed on the floor bleeding at the neck. Barnabas admits defeat to Cassandra and asks her to spare Victoria the effects of the dream if he will try to be a faithful husband. [[Nicholas Blair]], a powerful warlock who serves the same \"master\" as Angelique, arrives and gets angry with her when he finds that she is considering taking Barnabas up on his offer rather than returning the vampire curse. Victoria attempts to resist the temptation to tell Barnabas the dream, however, he shows up at Collinwood and makes her tell it to him to spare her suffering. Barnabas has the dream, when he awakes there is a knock on the door and a bat attacks him.

Adam, although a fully grown human, is unable to speak and acts like a child; however, he can be very violent if upset. At dawn, Barnabas finds he is no longer a vampire and has been cured for good. Adam runs off after attacking Barnabas. Barnabas decides he must kill Adam because he is too violent and uncontrollable. Professor Timothy Eliot Stokes secretly helps Adam and teaches him to speak and educates him. Barnabas appears to die, as a result of [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique Collins']] dream curse, at the same time Adam also dies. Professor Stokes gets Julia to examine Adam, who now appears to be dead. Adam revives and appears to be suffocating. Julia suspects that Adam's reactions are tied to Barnabas\u2019, and that Barnabas is suffocating in his grave. Julia and Professor Stokes dig up Barnabas and find he is alive and not a vampire. As Barnabas revives, Adam also recovers.\n\nThe manipulative [[Nicholas Blair]] encourages Adam to lie and cheat to get what he wants. Adam goes to Barnabas and demands he create a woman for him to love. Tom Jennings, a local handyman, finds a coffin in the basement of the house Nicholas has taken up residence in.

Adam tells Barnabas and Julia that they are taking too long in creating his mate and gives them four weeks or he will kill everyone at [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]]. Angelique schemes so that she will be the life force for the experiment, in order for her to escape the vampire curse. Barnabas prevents this. Nicholas summons the spirit of Danielle Roget, one of the most evil women that ever lived, so she can be the life force. The experiment to create Adam mate Eve is a success. Eve tells Nicholas that she hates Adam. Julia, Barnabas and Stokes hold a s\u00e9ance to find out more about Danielle Roget. The spirit of Danielle Roget's lover, Phillippe Cordier, attacks Adam, Barnabas also suffers. Barnabas plans to kill Eve. Nicholas learns this and sets up a trap for him. Angelique bites Barnabas placing him under her control. Eve tells Jeff Clark that he is really Peter Bradford and that she knows him from somewhere. Angelique sends Eve back in time so she can find out more about Peter. In 1795, Eve sees him on the night he is to be hanged. She offers to help him escape from prison if he will go away with her. He turns down Eve's help and is hanged. Adam finds that Eve really loves Peter; he then kills her. Adam then attempts to resurrect Eve by using Victoria's life energy by re-conducting the experiment on his own, but Julia and Barnabas stop him, destroying Eve's body, saving Victoria, and shooting Adam in his shoulder.

Quentin's grandmother Edith Collins, the mistress of [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]], is on her death bed and is expected to tell the family secret to the next in line, her grandson and Quentin's older brother, Edward Collins. Barnabas materializes in his coffin at the Collins family crypt and is released by a Gypsy handyman and con artist, named Sandor Rakosi, whom Barnabas (a vampire once again) bites him and makes Sandor his human slave and daytime protector. Barnabas then arrives at Collinwood and introduces himself as a cousin from England (as he did in the contemporary time back in 1967), and then begins to investigate Quentin.\n\nQuentin attempts to learn the family secret from Edith by threatening her. Edward returns to [[Collinsport]] with a new governess, Rachel Drummond, for his children Jamison and Nora Collins. Barnabas meets with Edith; she is shocked and declares that he is the family secret; the vampire son of the late Joshua and Naomi Collins imprisoned in a coffin in the family crypt. She is unable to tell Edward the secret and dies. Quentin plans to make sure that he gets something in Edith's will even if he has to have it changed; he finds out from Magda Rakosi, a Gypsy and Edith's fortune teller and the wife of Sandor, that the will is hidden in Edith's coffin. Quentin is tormented by the ghost of Edith; she warns him to return the will. Evan Handly, the Collins family lawyer and a Satanist, approaches Sandor to hire him to help forge a new will. In order to stop Barnabas from interfering with their plans, Quentin and Evan hold a ceremony which brings the witch [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique Collins]] back into existence.

She is the new mistress of Collinwood.\n\nAt Edward's request, Reverend Gregory Trask shows up to take Nora and Jamison to his boarding school, Worthington Hall. Rachel is very upset by his presence. She tells Barnabas that she used to live and work at Worthington Hall and was intimidated and blackmailed into staying there by Gregory. Edward arranges to have the children sent to Worthington Hall. Tim Shaw, one of the teachers, comes to pick up the children, he tells Rachel that he had been accused of murdering Gregory's brother-in-law and has also been blackmailed into working at the school. Gregory accuses Rachel of stealing and warns her to come back with him. Minerva Trask, Gregory's wife, shows up to take Rachel back to Worthington Hall; she accuses her of being an accessory to the murder of her brother. Minerva threatens to go to the police if Rachel does not go back with her.\n\nWhile continuing to investigate Quentin Collins, Barnabas meets Edward's estranged wife Laura Collins, who ran away to Egypt with Quentin some years ago. Barnabas recognizes Laura as the Phoenix from his lifetime in the 18th century and she has returned to reclaim her children, Jamison and Nora, and whom she sets fire to Worthington Hall. Barnabas also meets and bites Charity Trask, Gregory Trask's daughter, and makes her his slave to keep tabs on Reverend Trask and of his intentions.

Julia is able to see [[David Collins (Dark Shadows)|David Collins\u2019]] funeral in 1969, she sees David come alive and the ghosts of Quentin and Beth have gone. Count Petofi forces Julia to tell him that the I-Ching wands are the key to time travel. He realizes he must have a body in the future if he wishes to travel there. He causes Beth to see a vision of the future and Quentin is there. Julia starts to feel strange and hears voices from 1969. She is called back and disappears. \n\nCount Petofi enters a trance, which causes his and Quentin's minds to switch bodies. He tells Quentin that he will be using his body to travel to the future. He then enters the I-Ching trance and arrives in 1969, however, Beth disrupts it and causes him to return to 1897. Still in the body of Quentin, he finds the hand isn't working anymore.

In this year, [[Quentin Collins]] returns to Collinwood after some time away. Quentin's grandmother Edith Collins, the mistress of [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]], is on her death bed and is expected to tell the family secret to the next in line, her grandson and Quentin's older brother, Edward Collins. Barnabas materializes in his coffin at the Collins family crypt and is released by a Gypsy handyman and con artist, named Sandor Rakosi, whom Barnabas (a vampire once again) bites him and makes Sandor his human slave and daytime protector. Barnabas then arrives at Collinwood and introduces himself as a cousin from England (as he did in the contemporary time back in 1967), and then begins to investigate Quentin.\n\nQuentin attempts to learn the family secret from Edith by threatening her. Edward returns to [[Collinsport]] with a new governess, Rachel Drummond, for his children Jamison and Nora Collins. Barnabas meets with Edith; she is shocked and declares that he is the family secret; the vampire son of the late Joshua and Naomi Collins imprisoned in a coffin in the family crypt. She is unable to tell Edward the secret and dies. Quentin plans to make sure that he gets something in Edith's will even if he has to have it changed; he finds out from Magda Rakosi, a Gypsy and Edith's fortune teller and the wife of Sandor, that the will is hidden in Edith's coffin. Quentin is tormented by the ghost of Edith; she warns him to return the will. Evan Handly, the Collins family lawyer and a Satanist, approaches Sandor to hire him to help forge a new will. In order to stop Barnabas from interfering with their plans, Quentin and Evan hold a ceremony which brings the witch [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique Collins]] back into existence. Judith Collins, Quentin's older sister, finds Edith's real will and learns that Edith has left her everything. She is the new mistress of Collinwood.\n\nAt Edward's request, Reverend Gregory Trask shows up to take Nora and Jamison to his boarding school, Worthington Hall. Rachel is very upset by his presence. She tells Barnabas that she used to live and work at Worthington Hall and was intimidated and blackmailed into staying there by Gregory. Edward arranges to have the children sent to Worthington Hall. Tim Shaw, one of the teachers, comes to pick up the children, he tells Rachel that he had been accused of murdering Gregory's brother-in-law and has also been blackmailed into working at the school. Gregory accuses Rachel of stealing and warns her to come back with him. Minerva Trask, Gregory's wife, shows up to take Rachel back to Worthington Hall; she accuses her of being an accessory to the murder of her brother. Minerva threatens to go to the police if Rachel does not go back with her.\n\nWhile continuing to investigate Quentin Collins, Barnabas meets Edward's estranged wife Laura Collins, who ran away to Egypt with Quentin some years ago. Barnabas recognizes Laura as the Phoenix from his lifetime in the 18th century and she has returned to reclaim her children, Jamison and Nora, and whom she sets fire to Worthington Hall. Barnabas also meets and bites Charity Trask, Gregory Trask's daughter, and makes her his slave to keep tabs on Reverend Trask and of his intentions. Quentin teams up with Barnabas to investigate Laura and find a way to stop her from taking Jamison and Nora away. Laura then meets Dirk Wilkins, a Collinwood employee, to do her bidding while Quentin teams up with Barnabas' rival Angelique to fight against Laura's powers, which eventually ends with Angelique turning Laura into an old version of herself and being burned alive (as in the 1967 storyline ''Laura the Phoenix''), saving Jamison and Nora.\n\nThings take a turn when Dirk Wilkins discovers that Barnabas is a vampire. Barnabas attacks him; Dirk dies and rises as a vampire. Dirk attacks Judith; under his control she shoots and kills Rachel. Edward follows Judith, finds Dirk's coffin and kills him by driving a wooden stake through his heart. Meanwhile, Gregory gets Evan Hanley to brainwash Tim to kill on command. They have him kill Minerva. Gregory asks Judith to marry him, she agrees and they are married that night. With Evan's help, Gregory summons up the spirit of Minerva in order to make Judith think she is going insane. She is committed to a sanitarium, giving Gregory full control over the Collins estate.\n\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that Quentin's insane wife, Jenny Collins, is being secretly kept in the tower room at Collinwood. She escapes and stabs Quentin to death. Angelique raises Quentin from the dead and he wanders around the house as a zombie. Gregory performs a ceremony and Quentin is returned to normal and is alive and well. Quentin promises Beth that he will get his marriage to Jenny annulled and will marry her. Laura Collins finds and releases Jenny from her cell where she finds Quentin and Beth together in the west wing and prepares to stab them both; however, Quentin strangles Jenny to death. Magda, Jenny's sister, places a curse on Quentin to avenge her death. Quentin changes into the werewolf during the full moon while Beth watches. \n\nRegretting her actions, Magda returns to Collinsport with the Hand of [[Andreas Petofi|Count Andreas Petofi]], a magical talisman, hoping that it will cure Quentin of the werewolf curse. Victor Fenn-Gibbon arrives at Collinwood searching for the Hand. Quentin and Victor struggle causing Victor's glove to come off revealing that he has no right hand, Magda and Quentin realize Victor is actually Count Petofi. Petofi emerges with the hand re-attached. Charles Delaware Tate, an artist, is commissioned by Count Petofi to paint a portrait of Quentin. Barnabas and Magda find the portrait of Quentin as the werewolf and deduct it has cured Quentin of the curse, and thus erasing the timeline of Quentin's spirit haunting Collinwood.\n\nBarnabas attempts to return to 1969 using the I-Ching, however, Edward disrupts Barnabas\u2019 I-Ching trance causing his body in 1969 to disappear. Now trapped in the year 1897, Barnabas writes a letter explaining everything and leaves it to be found in the future. In 1969, [[Dr. Julia Hoffman]] reads the letter and goes to Collinwood to find out more about Quentin. The ghost of Beth explains to Julia that she killed Quentin back in 1897. Julia uses the I-Ching wands to travel back to 1897. Events unfold just as Julia had learned, however Count Petofi intervenes and stops Beth before she kills Quentin. Julia is able to see [[David Collins (Dark Shadows)|David Collins\u2019]] funeral in 1969, she sees David come alive and the ghosts of Quentin and Beth have gone. Count Petofi forces Julia to tell him that the I-Ching wands are the key to time travel. He realizes he must have a body in the future if he wishes to travel there. He causes Beth to see a vision of the future and Quentin is there. Julia starts to feel strange and hears voices from 1969. She is called back and disappears. \n\nCount Petofi enters a trance, which causes his and Quentin's minds to switch bodies. He tells Quentin that he will be using his body to travel to the future. He then enters the I-Ching trance and arrives in 1969, however, Beth disrupts it and causes him to return to 1897. Still in the body of Quentin, he finds the hand isn't working anymore. Its power is back in his original body that Quentin inhabits. Quentin uses the powers of the hand to switch bodies back with Count Petofi. The [[vengeful ghost]] of Garth Blackwood sets Charles's studio on fire with Count Petofi inside; he is presumed dead. \n\nJudith returns from the sanitarium, she tells Edward that Gregory never visited her while there. Realizing she has been manipulated by Gregory for her money, she has Tim wall him up in Quentin's room. He goes insane and shoots himself. Meanwhile, Kitty Soames arrives up at Collinwood.
