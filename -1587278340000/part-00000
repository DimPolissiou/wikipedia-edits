W. Murnau]]'s 1927 film ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]''.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in [[San Francisco, California]], George O'Brien was the oldest son of Daniel J. and Margaret L. (''n\u00e9e'' Donahue) O'Brien; O'Brien's father later became the Chief of Police for the City of [[San Francisco]]. (Dan O'Brien ordered the arrest of [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]] in September 1921 at the scandalous [[Labor Day]] party held by Arbuckle.) After his retirement from that office, Dan was the Director of Penology for the State of California.\n\nIn 1917, O'Brien enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] to fight in [[World War I]], serving on a [[submarine chaser]]. He volunteered to act as a stretcher bearer for wounded Marines and was decorated for bravery. After the war, O'Brien became Light Heavyweight boxing champion of the Pacific Fleet.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Dolores Costello-George O'Brien in Noah's Ark.jpg|thumb|With [[Dolores Costello]] in ''[[Noah's Ark (1928 film)|Noah's Ark]]'' (1928)]]\nO'Brien came to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in his early twenties hoping to become a cameraman and worked as an assistant cameraman for a while, for both [[Tom Mix]] and [[Buck Jones]].  He began his acting career in bit parts and as a stuntman. One of his earliest roles was in the 1922 [[George Melford]]-directed drama ''Moran of the Lady Letty'', most notable for starring [[Rudolph Valentino]]. In 1924, O'Brien received his first starring role in the drama ''The Man Who Came Back'' opposite the English actress [[Dorothy Mackaill]]. That same year he was chosen by the famed movie director [[John Ford]] to star in ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' opposite actress [[Madge Bellamy]]. The film was an immense success at the box-office and O'Brien made nine more films for Ford. In 1927, he starred in the [[F. W. Murnau]]-directed ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' opposite [[Janet Gaynor]], which won three major [[Academy Awards]] and remains his most famous film, and also played the lead in the [[New York City]] epic ''[[East Side, West Side (1927 film)|East Side, West Side]]'' that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/georgeobrien.html|website=Golden Silents|title=George O'Brien}}</ref>\n[[File:Park Avenue Logger (1937) 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|O'Brien and [[Beatrice Roberts]] in ''[[Park Avenue Logger]]'', 1937]]\nO'Brien would spend the remainder of the 1920s as an extremely popular leading man in films, often starring in action and adventure roles alongside such popular actresses of the era as [[Alma Rubens]], [[Anita Stewart]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Madge Bellamy]], [[Olive Borden]] (with whom he was linked romantically during the 1920s), and [[Janet Gaynor]]. With the advent of sound, O'Brien became a popular star of Westerns and rarely took parts outside of the Western film genre. Throughout the 1930s, O'Brien was a consistent Top Ten box-office draw appearing in scores of Westerns, often atop his horse named Mike.\n[[File:George O'Brien in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) trailer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|O' Brien in ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'', 1949]]\nDuring [[World War II]], O'Brien re-enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], where he served as a [[beachmaster]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]] and was decorated several times. He left service with the rank of commander.  He later joined the [[United States Naval Reserve]] and retired with the rank of captain in 1962, having four times been recommended for the rank of admiral. Following his service in World War II, O'Brien would occasionally take featured parts in films directed by his old friend and mentor [[John Ford]], including ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'', ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'', and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''. O'Brien's last leading role was in the 1951 movie ''[[Gold Raiders]]'', with top-billed O'Brien handling the action and the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]] ([[Shemp Howard]], [[Larry Fine]], and [[Moe Howard]]) doing comedy routines in a feature film more or less evenly dividing screen time between O'Brien and the Stooges.\n\nWhile serving in the Naval Reserve, O'Brien took on a project for the Department of Defense as part of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]]'s \"People to People\" program.  He was project officer for a series of orientation films on three Asian countries.  One of these films, on Korea, was directed by his old friend, John Ford. The other two countries covered were Formosa (Taiwan) and the Philippines.\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn the 1920s, O'Brien dated actress [[Olive Borden]] for many years and most thought they would marry. For some reason (some say his family did not approve of Olive) they ended their relationship and he eventually married actress [[Marguerite Churchill]] on July 15, 1933. Their first child, Brian, died 10 days after his birth. Daughter [[Orin O'Brien]] became a [[double bassist]] for the [[New York Philharmonic]]. Their youngest child [[Darcy O'Brien]] was a successful writer and college professor. George and Marguerite divorced in 1948.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\n== Later years and death ==\nO'Brien suffered a [[stroke]] in 1981 and was bedridden the last four years of his life. He died in 1985 in [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma]]. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Brien was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6201 Hollywood Blvd., in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n|+ Film performances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=3|1922\n| ''Moran of the Lady Letty''\n| Deck Hand\n| {{Unbulleted list|Directed by [[George Melford]]|Uncredited|With Rudolph Valentino}}\n|-\n| ''[[The Ghost Breaker (1922 film)|The Ghost Breaker]]''\n| A Ghost\n| {{Unbulleted list|Directed by [[Alfred E.

By 1987, more than a dozen [[non-strict]], purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was [[proprietary software]]. At the conference on [[Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture]] (FPCA '87) in [[Portland, Oregon]], there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an [[open standard]] for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing [[functional languages]] into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}}\n\n=== Haskell 1.0 to 1.4 ===\n[[Type classes]], which enable [[type safety|type-safe]] [[operator overloading]], were first proposed by [[Philip Wadler]] and Stephen Blott for [[Standard ML]] but were first implemented in Haskell between 1987 and version 1.0.<ref>\"Type classes, first proposed during the design of the Haskell programming language, ...\"&nbsp;\u2014[https://jgbm.github.io/pubs/morris-dissertation.pdf John Garrett Morris (2013), \"Type Classes and Instance Chains: A Relational Approach\"]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2710954|title=How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less ad hoc|last=Wadler|first=Philip|date=October 1988|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n<!-- To do: Describe the change-over in I/O, from lazy streams to monads. -->\nThe first version of Haskell (\"Haskell 1.0\") was defined in 1990.{{sfn|Hudak|Hughes|Peyton Jones|Wadler|2007}} The committee's efforts resulted in a series of language definitions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4).\n\n[[File:Base-classes.svg|thumb|right|[[Type class]]es originated in Haskell]]\n\n=== Haskell 98 ===\n\nIn late 1997, the series culminated in ''Haskell 98'', intended to specify a stable, minimal, portable version of the language and an accompanying standard [[library (computer science)|library]] for teaching, and as a base for future extensions.

The first revision, named '''Haskell 2010''', was announced in November 2009<ref name=\"2010ann\"/> and published in July 2010.\n\nHaskell 2010 is an incremental update to the language, mostly incorporating several well-used and uncontroversial features previously enabled via compiler-specific flags.\n* Hierarchical module names. Module names are allowed to consist of dot-separated sequences of capitalised identifiers, rather than only one such identifier. This lets modules be named in a hierarchical manner (e.g., <code>Data.List</code> instead of <code>List</code>), although technically modules are still in a single monolithic namespace. This extension was specified in an addendum to Haskell 98 and was in practice universally used.\n* The [[foreign function interface]] (FFI) allows bindings to other programming languages. Only bindings to [[C (programming language)|C]] are specified in the Report, but the design allows for other language bindings. To support this, data type declarations were permitted to contain no constructors, enabling robust nonce types for foreign data that could not be constructed in Haskell. This extension was also previously specified in an Addendum to the Haskell 98 Report and widely used.\n* So-called ''n''+''k'' patterns (definitions of the form <code>fact (n+1) = (n+1) * fact n</code>) were no longer allowed. This [[syntactic sugar]] had misleading semantics, in which the code looked like it used the <code>(+)</code> operator, but in fact desugared to code using <code>(-)</code> and <code>(>=)</code>.\n* The rules of [[type inference]] were relaxed to allow more programs to type check.\n* Some [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] issues (changes in the formal grammar) were fixed: pattern guards were added, allowing pattern matching within guards; resolution of [[Order of operations|operator fixity]] was specified in a simpler way that reflected actual practice; an edge case in the interaction of the language's [[lexical syntax]] of operators and comments was addressed; and the interaction of do-notation and if-then-else was tweaked to eliminate unexpected syntax errors.\n* The <code>LANGUAGE</code> [[Directive (programming)|pragma]] was specified. By 2010 dozens of extensions to the language were in wide use, and GHC (among other compilers) provided the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma to specify individual extensions with a list of identifiers. Haskell 2010 compilers are required to support the <code>Haskell2010</code> extension, and are encouraged to support several others which correspond to extensions added in Haskell 2010. \n*The most significant language changes represented in the diagram: [https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-history History of Haskell].\n\n== Features ==\n{{Main|Haskell features}}\n{{See also|Glasgow Haskell Compiler#Extensions to Haskell}}\n\n[[File:Black-box-strictness.png|thumb|right|Haskell features lazy evaluation of expressions, that is, 'call by need']]\n\nHaskell features [[lazy evaluation]], lambda expressions, [[pattern matching]], [[list comprehension]], [[type class]]es and [[type polymorphism]].

A distinct construct exists to represent side effects, [[Orthogonal#Computer science|orthogonal]] to the type of functions.

It is implemented using [[attribute grammar]]s and is currently used mostly for research on generated type systems and language extensions.\n\nImplementations no longer actively maintained include:\n* The Haskell User's Gofer System ([[Hugs]]) is a [[bytecode]] interpreter. It was once one of the implementations used most widely, alongside the GHC compiler,{{sfn|Hudak|Hughes|Peyton Jones|Wadler|2007|pp=12\u201322}} but has now been mostly replaced by GHCi. It also comes with a graphics library.\n* HBC is an early implementation supporting Haskell 1.4. It was implemented by [[Lennart Augustsson]] in, and based on, [[Lazy ML]]. It has not been actively developed for some time.\n* nhc98 is a bytecode compiler focusing on minimizing memory use.\n** The York Haskell Compiler ([[Yhc]]) was a fork of nhc98, with the goals of being simpler, more portable and efficient, and integrating support for Hat, the Haskell tracer. It also had a [[JavaScript]] backend, allowing users to run Haskell programs in [[web browser]]s.\n\nImplementations not fully Haskell 98 compliant, and using a variant Haskell language, include:\n* Eta and Frege are dialects of Haskell targeting the [[Java virtual machine|Java Virtual Machine]].\n* [[Gofer (software)|Gofer]] was an educational dialect of Haskell, with a feature called ''constructor classes'', developed by Mark Jones. It was supplanted by Hugs (Haskell User's Gofer System).\n* Helium, a newer dialect of Haskell. The focus is on making learning easier via clearer error messages.

By 1987, more than a dozen [[non-strict]], purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was [[proprietary software]]. At the conference on [[Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture]] (FPCA '87) in [[Portland, Oregon]], there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an [[open standard]] for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing [[functional languages]] into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}}\n\n=== Haskell 1.0 to 1.4 ===\n[[Type classes]], which enable [[type safety|type-safe]] [[operator overloading]], were first proposed by [[Philip Wadler]] and Stephen Blott for [[Standard ML]] but were first implemented in Haskell between 1987 and version 1.0.<ref>\"Type classes, first proposed during the design of the Haskell programming language, ...\"&nbsp;\u2014[https://jgbm.github.io/pubs/morris-dissertation.pdf John Garrett Morris (2013), \"Type Classes and Instance Chains: A Relational Approach\"]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2710954|title=How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less ad hoc|last=Wadler|first=Philip|date=October 1988|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n<!-- To do: Describe the change-over in I/O, from lazy streams to monads. -->\nThe first version of Haskell (\"Haskell 1.0\") was defined in 1990.{{sfn|Hudak|Hughes|Peyton Jones|Wadler|2007}} The committee's efforts resulted in a series of language definitions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4).\n\n[[File:Base-classes.svg|thumb|right|[[Type class]]es originated in Haskell]]\n\n=== Haskell 98 ===\n\nIn late 1997, the series culminated in ''Haskell 98'', intended to specify a stable, minimal, portable version of the language and an accompanying standard [[library (computer science)|library]] for teaching, and as a base for future extensions.

The first revision, named '''Haskell 2010''', was announced in November 2009<ref name=\"2010ann\"/> and published in July 2010.\n\nHaskell 2010 is an incremental update to the language, mostly incorporating several well-used and uncontroversial features previously enabled via compiler-specific flags.\n* Hierarchical module names. Module names are allowed to consist of dot-separated sequences of capitalised identifiers, rather than only one such identifier. This lets modules be named in a hierarchical manner (e.g., <code>Data.List</code> instead of <code>List</code>), although technically modules are still in a single monolithic namespace. This extension was specified in an addendum to Haskell 98 and was in practice universally used.\n* The [[foreign function interface]] (FFI) allows bindings to other programming languages. Only bindings to [[C (programming language)|C]] are specified in the Report, but the design allows for other language bindings. To support this, data type declarations were permitted to contain no constructors, enabling robust nonce types for foreign data that could not be constructed in Haskell. This extension was also previously specified in an Addendum to the Haskell 98 Report and widely used.\n* So-called ''n''+''k'' patterns (definitions of the form <code>fact (n+1) = (n+1) * fact n</code>) were no longer allowed. This [[syntactic sugar]] had misleading semantics, in which the code looked like it used the <code>(+)</code> operator, but in fact desugared to code using <code>(-)</code> and <code>(>=)</code>.\n* The rules of [[type inference]] were relaxed to allow more programs to type check.\n* Some [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] issues (changes in the formal grammar) were fixed: pattern guards were added, allowing pattern matching within guards; resolution of [[Order of operations|operator fixity]] was specified in a simpler way that reflected actual practice; an edge case in the interaction of the language's [[lexical syntax]] of operators and comments was addressed; and the interaction of do-notation and if-then-else was tweaked to eliminate unexpected syntax errors.\n* The <code>LANGUAGE</code> [[Directive (programming)|pragma]] was specified. By 2010 dozens of extensions to the language were in wide use, and GHC (among other compilers) provided the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma to specify individual extensions with a list of identifiers. Haskell 2010 compilers are required to support the <code>Haskell2010</code> extension, and are encouraged to support several others which correspond to extensions added in Haskell 2010. \n*The most significant language changes represented in the diagram: [https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-history History of Haskell].\n\n== Features ==\n{{Main|Haskell features}}\n{{See also|Glasgow Haskell Compiler#Extensions to Haskell}}\n\n[[File:Black-box-strictness.png|thumb|right|Haskell features lazy evaluation of expressions, that is, 'call by need']]\n\nHaskell features [[lazy evaluation]], lambda expressions, [[pattern matching]], [[list comprehension]], [[type class]]es and [[type polymorphism]].

A distinct construct exists to represent side effects, [[Orthogonal#Computer science|orthogonal]] to the type of functions.

He improved the [[Zoological specimens|zoological collections]] to make them amongst the best in the world.\n\n==Biography==\nGray was born in [[Walsall]], but his family soon moved to London, where Gray studied medicine. He assisted his father in writing ''The Natural Arrangement of British Plants'' (1821). After being [[Blackballing|blackballed]] by the [[Linnean Society of London]], Gray shifted his interest from [[botany]] to [[zoology]].<ref>{{cite DNB\n|first=George Simonds |last=Boulger|authorlink=George Simonds Boulger|wstitle=Gray, John Edward|volume=23}}</ref> He began his zoological career by volunteering to collect insects for the British ] at age 15. He officially joined the Zoological Department in 1824 to help [[John George Children]] catalog the [[reptile]] collection.

It is the third largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres) after the ones of the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]] and [[Villa Ada]]. The gardens were developed for the [[Galleria Borghese|Villa Borghese Pinciana]] (\"Borghese villa on the [[Pincian Hill]]\"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by [[Scipione Borghese]], who used it as a ''villa suburbana'', a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the late 18th century.\n\n==History==\nIn 1605, Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of [[Pope Paul V]] and patron of [[Bernini]], began turning this former vineyard into the most extensive gardens built in Rome since Antiquity. The vineyard's site is identified with the [[gardens of Lucullus]], the most famous in the late Roman republic. In the 19th century much of the garden's former formality was remade as a landscape garden in the English taste (''illustration, right''). The Villa Borghese gardens were long informally open, but were bought by the commune of Rome and given to the public in 1903. The large landscape park in the English taste contains several villas. The [[Spanish Steps]] lead up to this park, and there is another entrance at the Porte del Popolo by [[Piazza del Popolo]]. The ''Pincio'' (the [[Pincian Hill]] of ancient Rome), in the south part of the park, offers one of the greatest views over Rome.\n\nThe Piazza di Siena, located in the villa, hosted the [[Equestrian at the 1960 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] [[dressage]], individual [[jumping]], and the jumping part of the [[eventing]] competition for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. A balustrade (dating from the early seventeenth century) from the gardens, was taken to England in the late 19th century, and installed in the grounds of [[Cliveden]] House, a mansion in [[Buckinghamshire]], in 1896.  In 2004, a species of [[Papillifera papillaris|Italian snail]] was discovered, still living on the balustrade after more than 100 years in England.\n\n==Villas in the gardens==\n[[Image:Vista del jard\u00edn de la Villa Medici en Roma, por Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Painting by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n*Today the [[Galleria Borghese]] is housed in the Villa Borghese itself.

{"title_page": "Investigative journalism", "text_new": "{{broader|Watchdog journalism}}\n{{other uses|Investigative Journalism (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n\n{{Journalism sidebar}}\n'''Investigative journalism''' is a form of [[journalism]] in which reporters deeply investigate a single topic of interest, such as serious crimes, [[political corruption]], or corporate wrongdoing. An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report. Practitioners sometimes use the terms \"watchdog reporting\" or \"accountability reporting\".\n\nMost investigative journalism has traditionally been conducted by [[newspaper]]s, [[News agency|wire service]]s, and [[Freelancer|freelance]] journalists. With the decline in income through advertising, many traditional news services have struggled to fund investigative journalism, which is time-consuming and therefore expensive. Journalistic investigations are increasingly carried out by news organizations working together, even internationally (as in the case of the [[Panama Papers]] and [[Paradise Papers]]), or by organizations such as [[ProPublica]], which have not operated previously as news publishers and which rely on the support of the public and benefactors to fund their work.\n\nThe growth of [[media conglomerate]]s in the U.S. since the 1980s has been accompanied by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded \"that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Problem of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the 21st century|url=https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch|url-access=registration|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58367-105-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch/page/81 81]|authorlink=Robert W.

An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report. Practitioners sometimes use the terms \"watchdog reporting\" or \"accountability reporting\".\n\nMost investigative journalism has traditionally been conducted by [[newspaper]]s, [[News agency|wire service]]s, and [[Freelancer|freelance]] journalists. With the decline in income through advertising, many traditional news services have struggled to fund investigative journalism, which is time-consuming and therefore expensive. Journalistic investigations are increasingly carried out by news organizations working together, even internationally (as in the case of the [[Panama Papers]] and [[Paradise Papers]]), or by organizations such as [[ProPublica]], which have not operated previously as news publishers and which rely on the support of the public and benefactors to fund their work.\n\nThe growth of [[media conglomerate]]s in the U.S. since the 1980s has been accompanied by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded \"that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Problem of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the 21st century|url=https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch|url-access=registration|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58367-105-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch/page/81 81]|authorlink=Robert W.

There are currently university departments for teaching investigative journalism.

Its headquarters and its main hub are at [[Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport]]. It is currently the first and largest airline operating in Romania based on international destinations, international flights and the third-largest measured by fleet size and passengers carried.\n\nThe brand name is an [[acronym]] for {{lang-ro|'''T'''ransporturile '''A'''eriene '''Rom'''\u00e2ne}} (Romanian Air Transport). Over ninety-seven percent (97.17%) of TAROM is owned by the [[Government of Romania|Romanian Government]] ([[Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (Romania)|Ministry of Transport]]). The airline transported almost 2.75 million passengers in 2018, with an average load factor of 74%.

In 1925, the city of [[Gala\u021bi]] became the first destination in Romania served by regular flights followed, from 24 June 1926, by an extended service to [[Ia\u0219i]] and [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]. Ten [[Airco DH.9|de Havilland DH.9]] and five [[Ansaldo A.300]], in addition to the Potez aircraft, operated the service.\n\nIn 1928 the airline changed its name to SNNA (''Serviciul Na\u021bional de Naviga\u021bie Aerian\u0103'', The National Air Navigation Service). In 1930, the company adopted the name LARES (''Liniile Aeriene Rom\u00e2ne Exploatate de Stat'', Romanian State-Operated Air Lines) while 1937 saw the merger of LARES with its competitor, SARTA (''Societatea Anonim\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 de Transporturi Aeriene'').<ref name=\"interbelic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanairlines.no/airline-companies-in-rumania-1918-1945/ |title=Airline companies in Rumania (1918-1945) \u00ab European Airlines |publisher=Europeanairlines.no |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nImmediately After [[World War II]], in 1945, when the [[Soviet Union]] had extended its influence across Eastern Europe, a new reorganization replaced LARES with TARS (''Transporturi Aeriene Rom\u00e2no-Sovietice''),<ref name=\"about\"/> jointly owned by the governments of Romania and the Soviet Union. Domestic operations were started from Bucharest ([[B\u0103neasa Airport]]) on 1 February 1946, when TARS took over all air services and aircraft from LARES.<ref name=\"interbelic\"/>\n\nOver the following decade, the company's Soviet share was purchased by the Romanian government and, on 18 September 1954, the airline adopted the name of TAROM (''Transporturi Aeriene Rom\u00e2ne'', Romanian Air Transport). By 1960, TAROM was flying to a dozen cities across Europe. 1966 saw the operation of its first transatlantic flight. On 14 May 1974, it launched a regular service to [[New York City]] ([[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]).\n\nBeing part of the regional group of airlines within [[Eastern Bloc]] states meant that for much of its history TAROM has operated Soviet-designed aircraft. These included [[Lisunov Li-2]]s, [[Ilyushin Il-14]]s, [[Ilyushin Il-18]] long-range turboprops, [[Ilyushin Il-62]] long-range jet airliners, [[Antonov An-24]] regional turboprops, and [[Tupolev Tu-154]] medium-range tri-jets. As was the case with several other nations, the Il-62 was the first long-range jet airliner to be put into operation by Romania, in 1973. Five examples (three Il-62s and two later version Il-62Ms) were owned by TAROM, which also leased the aircraft to other operators.\n\nAn exception to Soviet-built aircraft was made in 1968, when TAROM bought [[BAC One Eleven]]s for European and Middle East destinations, and in 1974 when it acquired [[Boeing 707]] aircraft to share its long-haul operations with the Il-62. Plans were made to acquire [[Vickers VC10]] aircraft as well, but in the end, the Soviets did not allow it, and made them buy the Il-62 instead.<ref>{{cite book |author=Henderson, Scott; Walker, Timothy |date=1998 |title=Silent Swift Superb: The Story of the Vickers VC10 |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=SCOVAL |isbn=9781902236025}}</ref> With 59 aircraft in operation, in the late '70s, TAROM had the largest fleet in the Eastern Bloc, after [[Aeroflot]].<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%200623.html 1978 Flight World Airline Directory] at Flight International</ref>\n\nIn 1978, a contract was signed with the UK enabling Rombac to manufacture the BAC One Eleven at [[Romaero]], near Bucharest. Meanwhile, the 707 and Il-62 long-range aircraft were operating New York (via Amsterdam, later London and finally Vienna), Abu-Dhabi-Bangkok-Singapore, and Karachi-Beijing. TAROM was the only Eastern Bloc airline to operate flights to [[Tel Aviv]], Israel.\n\nDuring the mid 1980s, TAROM leased [[Tupolev Tu-154]] jets to [[Guyana Airways]] and also supported these aircraft which were operated in scheduled passenger service between [[Georgetown, Guyana]] in South America and both [[Miami]] and [[New York City]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===The 1990s===\nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|collapse of the communist regime]] in 1989, the airline, operating a fleet of 65 aircraft of six basic types, was able to acquire more Western-built jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1990/1990%20-%201875.PDF|title=Airbus beats Boeing in TAROM update|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref> By 1993, TAROM had introduced long-haul flights to [[Montreal]] and [[Bangkok]] using Ilyushin Il-62 and [[Airbus A310]] aircraft.\n\nDuring the 1990s, TAROM replaced its long-haul fleet of Boeing 707s and IL-62s with [[Airbus A310]]s (the last Il-62 being sold in 1999). In 2001, the airline cancelled its non-profitable long-haul services to Bangkok and Montreal and also terminated services to its remaining intercontinental destinations of [[Chicago]] in 2002, and [[Beijing]] and New York City in 2003.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Czech Airlines, Mal\u00e9v and Tarom all axe long-haul services| publisher=Anna.Aero| date=23 March 2010| url=http://www.anna.aero/2010/03/23/central-european-ce-carriers-abandon-many-long-haul-routes/| accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTAROM terminated loss-making domestic services to [[Craiova]], [[Tulcea]], [[Caransebe\u0219]], and [[Constan\u021ba]], and focused its activity on service to key destinations in Europe and the Middle East. 2004 was the first profitable year of the last decade.\n\n===2000 onwards===\nTAROM is recovering from a difficult period that began in the 1990s when losses of up to $68 million per year were registered, caused by unprofitable routes. At the beginning of the new millennium, the airline initiated a programme that was aimed at restoring profitability. This was achieved by terminating loss-making intercontinental services. TAROM has decided to focus its operations on Bucharest ([[Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport]]) (OTP) and [[Cluj-Napoca International Airport]] (CLJ), and initiated direct international flights from [[Sibiu International Airport]].\n\nA fleet upgrade programme started in 2006 with the acquisition of four [[Airbus A318]]s, three [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800s]], and two [[ATR 72|ATR 72-500s]], which resulted in a fleet increase to 26 by 2009.\n\nThe airline had a frequent-flyer programme \"Smart Miles\", which was turned into [[Flying Blue]] on 5 June 2010. [[Codeshare]] agreements with foreign partner airlines are in place for several international routes. On 25 June 2010, TAROM joined [[SkyTeam]] as the alliance's thirteenth member.\n\nStarting with November 2012, in accordance with the Romanian state-company legislation, TAROM was led by a private manager, the Belgian Christian Heinzmann occupying the positions of CEO and Accountable Manager until March 2016. During Heinzmann's leadership, the company reduced its financial losses by more than 75%, grew its yearly passenger number to a record 2.4 million and stabilised its load-factor around 70%. However, broad reforms like the fleet renewal and harmonisation, as well as the establishment of profit centers such as the TAROM Maintenance and TAROM Charter services, were not accomplished due to a constant lack of a decision from the company's board of administrators.<ref>[http://www.economica.net/interviu-heinzmann-am-fost-un-corp-strain-la-tarom-am-fost-un-manager-fara-putere-reala-de-decizie_116703.html Heinzmann interview], economica.net, 21 March 2016.

It is sometimes confused with the similar logo of [[LOT Polish Airlines]], which features a crane in flight. The 1970s livery had the logo on the tail painted in red, with a red [[cheatline]]. The livery introduced in the early 1990s (on the Airbus A310 aircraft) is an overall-white scheme with the titles and the tailfin painted in dark blue. The current colour scheme (introduced in 2006 on the A318) is a slightly modified version of the previous one, with an oversized logo on the tailfin, and the engine pods also painted in dark blue.\n\nAll aircraft in the TAROM fleet receive a \"name\" which is a Romanian [[toponym]]. For instance, the names of the ATR aircraft in the fleet are related to the rivers of Romania, the Boeing aircraft bear names of Romanian cities, the Airbus long-haul aircraft bear Romanian historical province names, while the Airbus A318s bear names of Romanian aviation pioneers.\n\nIn 2009, marking the airline's 55th anniversary, a Boeing 737-700 (YR-BGG \"Craiova\") was painted in a retro jet colour scheme, representing airline's first livery used in the 1950s on [[Lisunov Li-2]] aircraft.\n\n===TAROM Technical Division===\nThe TAROM Technical Division provides aircraft maintenance services for the entire fleet of the company and the fleet of other national and international companies. The objective of TAROM Technical Department is to be the best and the most efficient, in terms of costs, maintenance service provider for Boeing 737, ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft in Central and Eastern Europe. The services provided by the TAROM Technical Department include unscheduled maintenance works, scheduled maintenance works and repair works for spare parts.\n\nThe major maintenance activity is performed in the hangar of the technical department, built between 1969 and 1972, with an area of 6,000 m{{sup|2}} and restored in 2000 to fully comply with EASA (European Safety Aviation Agency) and FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) standards. The hangar is equipped to perform all types of inspections for TAROM fleet, and the personnel is qualified and licensed for all types of aircraft in the fleet. Maintenance activities for 3 to 6 aircraft, depending on their size, may be carried out simultaneously in the hangar. The hangar is equipped with full MERO system for B737 docking.\n\nThe most important maintenance capacities of the TAROM Technical Department include full maintenance services for Boeing 737 and ATR42/72 aircraft, inspection capacity type C for Airbus A310 and A318 aircraft, total painting, interior cleaning, modifications.\n\nThe technical department also provides safe storage facilities for spare parts and materials necessary for maintenance activity, dedicated spaces for chemicals, for special tools and testing equipment, and quarantine spaces. The TAROM Technical Department also provides conveyance services (packaging, preparation of documents, customs) and acceptance services (customs, disassembly, and reception inspection) for various substances and equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tarom.ro/en/services/technical-department/|title=Technical Department - tarom.ro|website=www.tarom.ro|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Destinations==\n{{main|List of TAROM destinations}}\nThe airline directly operates 50 destinations including charter and seasonal services in 22 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa including 8 domestic destinations.\nThe airline's flights to the USA ceased in 2003 and are now operated under a codeshare agreement with Air France via Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tarom.ro/destinatii/harta-destinatiilor/|title=Harta destina\u0163iilor TAROM - tarom.ro|website=www.tarom.ro|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Alliances===\nIn 2006, TAROM was scheduled to join SkyTeam as an associate member (sponsored by [[Alitalia]]), but the entry into the alliance was postponed until 2008.

The flight crew, and an aircraft maintenance crew, all consisting of 9 people, died instantly. Whilst the official cause of the crash was attributed to [[pilot error]] (the pilots did not use radar instruments and only assumed their positions, thus getting lost), the secrecy regarding the crash sparked a few conspiracy theories, which include sabotage, accidental shootdown from a nearby [[surface-to-air missile]]s unit (theory later dismissed by the MApN), and UFOs that tricked the pilots into believing they had arrived at their destination, linked to the sightings of unusual lights on 4 August 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19910813-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident Ilyushin Il-18V YR-IMH Uricani|first=Harro|last=Ranter|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asfanufo.ro/index.php/istorie/106-muntele-retezat-4-august-1991|title=Muntele Retezat - 4 august 1991|website=www.asfanufo.ro|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n*On 24 September 1994, TAROM Flight 381, an [[Airbus A310]] registered YR-LCA flying from Bucharest to [[Paris Orly]], went into a sudden and uncommanded nose-up position and stalled. The crew attempted to countermand the aircraft's flight control system but were unable to get the nose down while remaining on course. Witnesses saw the aircraft climb with an extreme nose-up attitude, then bank sharply left, then right, then fall into a steep dive. Only when the dive produced additional speed was the crew able to recover steady flight. An investigation found that an overshoot of flap placard speed during the approach, incorrectly commanded by the captain, caused a mode transition to flight level change. The auto-throttles increased power and trim went full nose-up as a result. The crew's attempt at commanding the nose-down elevator could not counteract the effect of stabilizer nose-up trim, and the resulting dive brought the aircraft from a height of 4,100&nbsp;ft at the time of the stall to 800&nbsp;ft when the crew was able to recover command.

In 1925, the city of [[Gala\u021bi]] became the first destination in Romania served by regular flights followed, from 24 June 1926, by an extended service to [[Ia\u0219i]] and [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]. Ten [[Airco DH.9|de Havilland DH.9]] and five [[Ansaldo A.300]], in addition to the Potez aircraft, operated the service.\n\nIn 1928 the airline changed its name to SNNA (''Serviciul Na\u021bional de Naviga\u021bie Aerian\u0103'', The National Air Navigation Service). In 1930, the company adopted the name LARES (''Liniile Aeriene Rom\u00e2ne Exploatate de Stat'', Romanian State-Operated Air Lines) while 1937 saw the merger of LARES with its competitor, SARTA (''Societatea Anonim\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 de Transporturi Aeriene'').<ref name=\"interbelic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanairlines.no/airline-companies-in-rumania-1918-1945/ |title=Airline companies in Rumania (1918-1945) \u00ab European Airlines |publisher=Europeanairlines.no |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nImmediately After [[World War II]], in 1945, when the [[Soviet Union]] had extended its influence across Eastern Europe, a new reorganization replaced LARES with TARS (''Transporturi Aeriene Rom\u00e2no-Sovietice''),<ref name=\"about\"/> jointly owned by the governments of Romania and the Soviet Union. Domestic operations were started from Bucharest ([[B\u0103neasa Airport]]) on 1 February 1946, when TARS took over all air services and aircraft from LARES.<ref name=\"interbelic\"/>\n\nOver the following decade, the company's Soviet share was purchased by the Romanian government and, on 18 September 1954, the airline adopted the name of TAROM (''Transporturi Aeriene Rom\u00e2ne'', Romanian Air Transport). By 1960, TAROM was flying to a dozen cities across Europe. 1966 saw the operation of its first transatlantic flight. On 14 May 1974, it launched a regular service to [[New York City]] ([[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]).\n\nBeing part of the regional group of airlines within [[Eastern Bloc]] states meant that for much of its history TAROM has operated Soviet-designed aircraft. These included [[Lisunov Li-2]]s, [[Ilyushin Il-14]]s, [[Ilyushin Il-18]] long-range turboprops, [[Ilyushin Il-62]] long-range jet airliners, [[Antonov An-24]] regional turboprops, and [[Tupolev Tu-154]] medium-range tri-jets. As was the case with several other nations, the Il-62 was the first long-range jet airliner to be put into operation by Romania, in 1973. Five examples (three Il-62s and two later version Il-62Ms) were owned by TAROM, which also leased the aircraft to other operators.\n\nAn exception to Soviet-built aircraft was made in 1968, when TAROM bought [[BAC One Eleven]]s for European and Middle East destinations, and in 1974 when it acquired [[Boeing 707]] aircraft to share its long-haul operations with the Il-62. Plans were made to acquire [[Vickers VC10]] aircraft as well, but in the end, the Soviets did not allow it, and made them buy the Il-62 instead.<ref>{{cite book |author=Henderson, Scott; Walker, Timothy |date=1998 |title=Silent Swift Superb: The Story of the Vickers VC10 |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=SCOVAL |isbn=9781902236025}}</ref> With 59 aircraft in operation, in the late '70s, TAROM had the largest fleet in the Eastern Bloc, after [[Aeroflot]].<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%200623.html 1978 Flight World Airline Directory] at Flight International</ref>\n\nIn 1978, a contract was signed with the UK enabling Rombac to manufacture the BAC One Eleven at [[Romaero]], near Bucharest. Meanwhile, the 707 and Il-62 long-range aircraft were operating New York (via Amsterdam, later London and finally Vienna), Abu-Dhabi-Bangkok-Singapore, and Karachi-Beijing. TAROM was the only Eastern Bloc airline to operate flights to [[Tel Aviv]], Israel.\n\nDuring the mid 1980s, TAROM leased [[Tupolev Tu-154]] jets to [[Guyana Airways]] and also supported these aircraft which were operated in scheduled passenger service between [[Georgetown, Guyana]] in South America and both [[Miami]] and [[New York City]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===The 1990s===\nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|collapse of the communist regime]] in 1989, the airline, operating a fleet of 65 aircraft of six basic types, was able to acquire more Western-built jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1990/1990%20-%201875.PDF|title=Airbus beats Boeing in TAROM update|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref> By 1993, TAROM had introduced long-haul flights to [[Montreal]] and [[Bangkok]] using Ilyushin Il-62 and [[Airbus A310]] aircraft.\n\nDuring the 1990s, TAROM replaced its long-haul fleet of Boeing 707s and IL-62s with [[Airbus A310]]s (the last Il-62 being sold in 1999). In 2001, the airline cancelled its non-profitable long-haul services to Bangkok and Montreal and also terminated services to its remaining intercontinental destinations of [[Chicago]] in 2002, and [[Beijing]] and New York City in 2003.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Czech Airlines, Mal\u00e9v and Tarom all axe long-haul services| publisher=Anna.Aero| date=23 March 2010| url=http://www.anna.aero/2010/03/23/central-european-ce-carriers-abandon-many-long-haul-routes/| accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTAROM terminated loss-making domestic services to [[Craiova]], [[Tulcea]], [[Caransebe\u0219]], and [[Constan\u021ba]], and focused its activity on service to key destinations in Europe and the Middle East. 2004 was the first profitable year of the last decade.\n\n===2000 onwards===\nTAROM is recovering from a difficult period that began in the 1990s when losses of up to $68 million per year were registered, caused by unprofitable routes. At the beginning of the new millennium, the airline initiated a programme that was aimed at restoring profitability. This was achieved by terminating loss-making intercontinental services. TAROM has decided to focus its operations on Bucharest ([[Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport]]) (OTP) and [[Cluj-Napoca International Airport]] (CLJ), and initiated direct international flights from [[Sibiu International Airport]].\n\nA fleet upgrade programme started in 2006 with the acquisition of four [[Airbus A318]]s, three [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800s]], and two [[ATR 72|ATR 72-500s]], which resulted in a fleet increase to 26 by 2009.\n\nThe airline had a frequent-flyer programme \"Smart Miles\", which was turned into [[Flying Blue]] on 5 June 2010. [[Codeshare]] agreements with foreign partner airlines are in place for several international routes. On 25 June 2010, TAROM joined [[SkyTeam]] as the alliance's thirteenth member.\n\nStarting with November 2012, in accordance with the Romanian state-company legislation, TAROM was led by a private manager, the Belgian Christian Heinzmann occupying the positions of CEO and Accountable Manager until March 2016. During Heinzmann's leadership, the company reduced its financial losses by more than 75%, grew its yearly passenger number to a record 2.4 million and stabilised its load-factor around 70%. However, broad reforms like the fleet renewal and harmonisation, as well as the establishment of profit centers such as the TAROM Maintenance and TAROM Charter services, were not accomplished due to a constant lack of a decision from the company's board of administrators.<ref>[http://www.economica.net/interviu-heinzmann-am-fost-un-corp-strain-la-tarom-am-fost-un-manager-fara-putere-reala-de-decizie_116703.html Heinzmann interview], economica.net, 21 March 2016.

It is sometimes confused with the similar logo of [[LOT Polish Airlines]], which features a crane in flight. The 1970s livery had the logo on the tail painted in red, with a red [[cheatline]]. The livery introduced in the early 1990s (on the Airbus A310 aircraft) is an overall-white scheme with the titles and the tailfin painted in dark blue. The current colour scheme (introduced in 2006 on the A318) is a slightly modified version of the previous one, with an oversized logo on the tailfin, and the engine pods also painted in dark blue.\n\nAll aircraft in the TAROM fleet receive a \"name\" which is a Romanian [[toponym]]. For instance, the names of the ATR aircraft in the fleet are related to the rivers of Romania, the Boeing aircraft bear names of Romanian cities, the Airbus long-haul aircraft bear Romanian historical province names, while the Airbus A318s bear names of Romanian aviation pioneers.\n\nIn 2009, marking the airline's 55th anniversary, a Boeing 737-700 (YR-BGG \"Craiova\") was painted in a retro jet colour scheme, representing airline's first livery used in the 1950s on [[Lisunov Li-2]] aircraft.\n\n===TAROM Technical Division===\nThe TAROM Technical Division provides aircraft maintenance services for the entire fleet of the company and the fleet of other national and international companies. The objective of TAROM Technical Department is to be the best and the most efficient, in terms of costs, maintenance service provider for Boeing 737, ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft in Central and Eastern Europe. The services provided by the TAROM Technical Department include unscheduled maintenance works, scheduled maintenance works and repair works for spare parts.\n\nThe major maintenance activity is performed in the hangar of the technical department, built between 1969 and 1972, with an area of 6,000 m{{sup|2}} and restored in 2000 to fully comply with EASA (European Safety Aviation Agency) and FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) standards. The hangar is equipped to perform all types of inspections for TAROM fleet, and the personnel is qualified and licensed for all types of aircraft in the fleet. Maintenance activities for 3 to 6 aircraft, depending on their size, may be carried out simultaneously in the hangar. The hangar is equipped with full MERO system for B737 docking.\n\nThe most important maintenance capacities of the TAROM Technical Department include full maintenance services for Boeing 737 and ATR42/72 aircraft, inspection capacity type C for Airbus A310 and A318 aircraft, total painting, interior cleaning, modifications.\n\nThe technical department also provides safe storage facilities for spare parts and materials necessary for maintenance activity, dedicated spaces for chemicals, for special tools and testing equipment, and quarantine spaces. The TAROM Technical Department also provides conveyance services (packaging, preparation of documents, customs) and acceptance services (customs, disassembly, and reception inspection) for various substances and equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tarom.ro/en/services/technical-department/|title=Technical Department - tarom.ro|website=www.tarom.ro|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Destinations==\n{{main|List of TAROM destinations}}\nThe airline directly operates 50 destinations including charter and seasonal services in 22 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa including 8 domestic destinations.\nThe airline's flights to the USA ceased in 2003 and are now operated under a codeshare agreement with Air France via Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tarom.ro/destinatii/harta-destinatiilor/|title=Harta destina\u0163iilor TAROM - tarom.ro|website=www.tarom.ro|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Alliances===\nIn 2006, TAROM was scheduled to join SkyTeam as an associate member (sponsored by [[Alitalia]]), but the entry into the alliance was postponed until 2008.

The flight crew, and an aircraft maintenance crew, all consisting of 9 people, died instantly. Whilst the official cause of the crash was attributed to [[pilot error]] (the pilots did not use radar instruments and only assumed their positions, thus getting lost), the secrecy regarding the crash sparked a few conspiracy theories, which include sabotage, accidental shootdown from a nearby [[surface-to-air missile]]s unit (theory later dismissed by the MApN), and UFOs that tricked the pilots into believing they had arrived at their destination, linked to the sightings of unusual lights on 4 August 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19910813-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident Ilyushin Il-18V YR-IMH Uricani|first=Harro|last=Ranter|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asfanufo.ro/index.php/istorie/106-muntele-retezat-4-august-1991|title=Muntele Retezat - 4 august 1991|website=www.asfanufo.ro|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n*On 24 September 1994, TAROM Flight 381, an [[Airbus A310]] registered YR-LCA flying from Bucharest to [[Paris Orly]], went into a sudden and uncommanded nose-up position and stalled. The crew attempted to countermand the aircraft's flight control system but were unable to get the nose down while remaining on course. Witnesses saw the aircraft climb with an extreme nose-up attitude, then bank sharply left, then right, then fall into a steep dive. Only when the dive produced additional speed was the crew able to recover steady flight. An investigation found that an overshoot of flap placard speed during the approach, incorrectly commanded by the captain, caused a mode transition to flight level change. The auto-throttles increased power and trim went full nose-up as a result. The crew's attempt at commanding the nose-down elevator could not counteract the effect of stabilizer nose-up trim, and the resulting dive brought the aircraft from a height of 4,100&nbsp;ft at the time of the stall to 800&nbsp;ft when the crew was able to recover command.

The key used for [[disk encryption]] is sealed (encrypted) by the TPM chip and will only be released to the OS loader code if the early boot files appear to be unmodified. The pre-OS components of BitLocker achieve this by implementing a Static Root of Trust Measurement\u2014a methodology specified by the [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG). This mode is vulnerable to a [[cold boot attack]], as it allows a powered-down machine to be [[Booting|booted]] by an attacker. It is also vulnerable to a sniffing attack, as the volume encryption key is transferred in plain text from the TPM to the CPU during a successful boot.\n* '''User authentication mode''': This mode requires that the user provide some authentication to the pre-boot environment in the form of a pre-boot [[Personal identification number|PIN]] or password.\n* '''USB Key Mode''': The user must insert a USB device that contains a startup key into the computer to be able to boot  the protected OS. Note that this mode requires that the BIOS on the  protected machine supports the reading of USB devices in the pre-OS  environment.  The key may also be provided by a [[CCID (protocol)|CCID]] for reading a cryptographic [[smartcard]].

Once the malicious bootloader captures the secret, it can decrypt the Volume Master Key (VMK), which would then allow access to decrypt or modify any information on an encrypted hard disk. By configuring a TPM to protect the trusted boot pathway, including the [[BIOS]] and [[boot sector]], BitLocker can mitigate this threat. (Note that some non-malicious changes to the boot path may cause a [[Trusted Platform Module#Platform integrity|Platform Configuration Register]] check to fail, and thereby generate a false warning.)<ref name=\"Win7FAQ\">{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/ee449438(v=ws.10) |title=BitLocker Drive Encryption in Windows 7: Frequently Asked Questions |date=September 12, 2012 |publisher=Microsoft |work=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Security concerns ==\nAccording to Microsoft sources,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/si_team/back-door-nonsense |title=Back-door nonsense |date=March 2, 2006 |publisher=Microsoft |work=System Integrity Team Blog |access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref> BitLocker does not contain an intentionally built-in [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]; without which there is no way for [[law enforcement]] to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft.

The key used for [[disk encryption]] is sealed (encrypted) by the TPM chip and will only be released to the OS loader code if the early boot files appear to be unmodified. The pre-OS components of BitLocker achieve this by implementing a Static Root of Trust Measurement\u2014a methodology specified by the [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG). This mode is vulnerable to a [[cold boot attack]], as it allows a powered-down machine to be [[Booting|booted]] by an attacker. It is also vulnerable to a sniffing attack, as the volume encryption key is transferred in plain text from the TPM to the CPU during a successful boot.\n* '''User authentication mode''': This mode requires that the user provide some authentication to the pre-boot environment in the form of a pre-boot [[Personal identification number|PIN]] or password.\n* '''USB Key Mode''': The user must insert a USB device that contains a startup key into the computer to be able to boot  the protected OS.

The first interchange is with [[Tennessee State Route|SR 48]]. I-24 then has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US 79]], [[Tennessee State Route 237|SR 237]], and [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], and crosses the [[Red River (Tennessee-Kentucky)|Red River]]. It then enters a long straight section with several steep grades, crossing into [[Robertson County, Tennessee|Robertson County]], and has interchanges with [[Tennessee State Route 256|SR 256]], and [[Tennessee State Route 49|SR 49]] near [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], respectively. The route then enters the rolling hilly terrain of the [[Nashville Basin]], and crosses briefly into [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], where it has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 249|SR 249]]. I-24 then crosses into [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]]. The interstate continues for several miles through rural woodlands and multiple steep grades before coming to an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]). Three miles later, I-24 crosses the Nashville Urban Boundary, widens to six lanes, and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Parkway), the northern beltway around Nashville. Less than a mile later, I-24 joins a concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|Interstate 65]], where the combined routes carry ten through lanes, and travel due south. About a mile later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|US 41A]]/431 (Trinity Lane), and about a mile beyond this point, I-65 splits off, and I-24 enters downtown Nashville, where it has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], US 431, and [[U.S. Route 31E in Tennessee|US 31E]], as well as several city streets. I-24 then crosses the [[Cumberland River]], and joins in a concurrency with Interstate 40, travelling southeast with eight through lanes, and two miles later, I-40 splits off eastwardly, heading toward Knoxville. Located at this interchange is also an interchange with US 41/[[U.S. Route 70S in Tennessee|70S]], and less than a mile later is an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|Interstate 440]], which is also accessible from I-40 nearby. About a mile later is once again an interchange with SR 155/Briley Parkway near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and I-24 continues southeast, bisecting a major residential area. Here I-24 carries eight through lanes, and beginning at the next exit, [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]], the left lanes operate as [[HOV lane]]s during rush hour. Over the next few miles, I-24 has interchanges with Haywood Lane, [[Tennessee State Route 254|SR 254]] (Bell Road), Hickory Hollow Parkway, and [[Tennessee State Route 253|SR 253]] (Old Hickory Boulevard).\n\n====Middle Tennessee====\nI-24 continues southeast through the rapidly growing suburbs of Nashville, and crosses into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]] near the city of [[LaVergne, Tennessee|LaVergne]], where it has an interchange with a connector road to that respective city. Beginning at this point, I-24 is relatively straight and flat for most of its distance through Middle Tennessee. The straightest stretch of highway in Tennessee is located on I-24 between Lavergne and eastern [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], where the route is perfectly straight for about fifteen miles, although the median widens and narrows. Two miles later, I-24 reaches [[Smyrna, Tennessee|Smyrna]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 266|SR 266]] (Sam Ridley Pkwy.). Four miles later is an interchange with [[SR 102 (TN)|SR 102]] (Almaville Road), which also serves Smyrna, as well as the [[Nissan Smyrna assembly plant]]. Another four miles later is an interchange with [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville, and beyond this point I-24 enters Murfreesboro, the largest suburb of Nashville. In Murfreesboro, I-24 has interchanges with [[SR 96 (TN)|SR 96]] (which connects to [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]), [[SR 99 (TN)|SR 99]] (New Salem Highway), and [[US 231 (TN)|US 231]] (which connects to [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]] and [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]]), respectively, and at the final Murfreesboro exit (US 231), the HOV lane designation ends, and I-24 narrows to six lanes and then four lanes a short distance later. Three miles later is an interchange with the [[Joe B. Jackson Parkway]], which serves as an outer beltway around southeast Murfreesboro. I-24 then enters a more rural area, and remains relatively straight for many miles. Around milepost 96, I-24 briefly enters [[Bedford County, Tennessee|Bedford County]], and then [[Coffee County, Tennessee|Coffee County]], and at exit 97 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 64|SR 64]], which connects to Shelbyville. I-24 then curves to the south, then the east, and several miles later at exit 105 is an interchange with US 41, and five miles later I-24 enters [[Manchester, Tennessee|Manchester]], where it has interchanges with [[SR 53 (TN)|SR 53]], [[SR 55 (TN)|SR 55]], and US 41, respectively. I-24 continues through a rural, largely agricultural area where it crosses into [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]] and has an interchange with [[US 64 (TN)|US 64]] and [[SR 50 (TN)|SR 50]].\n\n====Monteagle Mountain====\n{{main|Monteagle Mountain}}\nOne of the most hazardous stretches of interstate highway in the United States{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} is located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Chattanooga on I-24 in [[Monteagle, Tennessee|Monteagle]], where the highway crosses the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The eastbound grade is particularly known to be hazardous, with a 4\u20136% grade protracted over a distance of several miles. Compared to grades elsewhere in the state, this downgrade does not come close to the steepest (I-40 between Nashville and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] features 5% grades in each direction as well as a 5% grade north of Nashville on I-24, near [[Joelton, Tennessee|Joelton]]). On this stretch, I-24 is three lanes in each direction, and contains two [[runaway truck ramp]]s. Owing to geography, these two ramps are on the left side of the grade. The westbound downgrade of the plateau is also extremely hazardous, and contains several sharp curves. Portions of this downgrade also feature off-ramp approach style lane dividers, in order to slow both motorists and truckers. Throughout the entire stretch across the Cumberland Plateau, the speed limit reduces to a maximum of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h}}; the westbound downgrade contains a {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit for trucks, and the eastbound downgrade contains a maximum {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit and {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|round=5}} limit for trucks.\n\nThe eastern Monteagle grade also has one of the three widest medians of any Interstate highway, with the others being [[Interstate 8|I-8]] through the In-Ko-Pah grade in [[California]] and [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] through the Cabbage Hill grade east of [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], [[Oregon]]. There is more than a mile between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend the other, and are part of the original interstate path in this area.\n\n====Georgia and Chattanooga==== \nAfter crossing Monteagle Mountain, I-24 travels for several miles through a relatively flat and straight segment before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 72|US&nbsp;72]] near [[Kimball, Tennessee|Kimball]] and [[South Pittsburg, Tennessee|South Pittsburg]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-24 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 28|SR&nbsp;28]] in [[Jasper, Tennessee|Jasper]]. Beyond this point, in a rare engineering feat, the east and westbound lanes split more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} apart, encompassing farms, homes, and a few businesses in between. This was reportedly a result of extensively fought disputes over [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] acquisitions, and is also one of the widest medians of any highway. The route then crosses a mountain, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 27|SR&nbsp;27]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, crosses the [[Nickajack Lake]] impoundment of the [[Tennessee River]]. Beyond this point, traveling through a gorge, I-24 can experience potentially strong [[crosswind]]s for several miles. I-24 enters [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and then into Georgia less than {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later.\n\nIn the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], I-24 travels for {{convert|4|mi}}, traveling along the southern flank of [[Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant|Raccoon Mountain]] and having an interchange with [[Interstate 59|I-59]] before turning back north to the Tennessee River and around the northern flank of [[Lookout Mountain]]. The exits remain numbered according to Tennessee's mileposts; however, the roadway mileposts are numbered according to Georgia's mileposts.<ref name=\"Athens\">{{cite news |url= http://onlineathens.com/stories/011600/new_0116000005.shtml |title= DOT to Change Interstate Exit Numbers |first=Ben |last= Deck |work= [[Athens Banner-Herald]] |date= January 16, 2000 |access-date= April 6, 2017 }}</ref> This segment also carries the [[Unsigned highway|unsigned]] '''State Route&nbsp;409''' (SR&nbsp;409) designation.<ref name=\"GDOT 2002\">{{cite GDOT map |year= 2002 |access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon re-entering Tennessee and Hamilton County, I-24 travels through [[Lookout Valley, Tennessee|Lookout Valley]] for several miles, and has interchanges with several key roads, including [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]]/US&nbsp;41/US&nbsp;72. Several miles later, I-24 curves sharply to the east, traveling on a causeway between the Tennessee River and the northern tip of [[Lookout Mountain]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, curves sharply to the north. Entering [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is a three-way interchange with [[U.S. Route 27|US&nbsp;27]] northbound, which is a freeway beyond this point. Forming a concurrency with US&nbsp;27, the highways then curve sharply to the east, then to the west about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, where US&nbsp;27 splits off to the south as Rossville Boulevard. With interchanges with several city streets, I-24 travels through the inner city of Chattanooga. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-24 reaches the \"Ridge Cut\", a {{convert|1/4|mi|m|spell=in|adj=on}} section of [[Missionary Ridge]], between the 4th Avenue exit and the Germantown/Belvoir exit, where the interstate curves sharply to the north, then to the east again, crossing the ridge with an extremely steep grade. Accidents and severe congestion are common here.

About a mile later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|US 41A]]/431 (Trinity Lane), and about a mile beyond this point, I-65 splits off, and I-24 enters downtown Nashville, where it has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], US 431, and [[U.S. Route 31E in Tennessee|US 31E]], as well as several city streets. I-24 then crosses the [[Cumberland River]], and joins in a concurrency with Interstate 40, travelling southeast with eight through lanes, and two miles later, I-40 splits off eastwardly, heading toward Knoxville. Located at this interchange is also an interchange with US 41/[[U.S. Route 70S in Tennessee|70S]], and less than a mile later is an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|Interstate 440]], which is also accessible from I-40 nearby. About a mile later is once again an interchange with SR 155/Briley Parkway near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and I-24 continues southeast, bisecting a major residential area. Here I-24 carries eight through lanes, and beginning at the next exit, [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]], the left lanes operate as [[HOV lane]]s during rush hour. Over the next few miles, I-24 has interchanges with Haywood Lane, [[Tennessee State Route 254|SR 254]] (Bell Road), Hickory Hollow Parkway, and [[Tennessee State Route 253|SR 253]] (Old Hickory Boulevard).\n\n====Middle Tennessee====\nI-24 continues southeast through the rapidly growing suburbs of Nashville, and crosses into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]] near the city of [[LaVergne, Tennessee|LaVergne]], where it has an interchange with a connector road to that respective city. Beginning at this point, I-24 is relatively straight and flat for most of its distance through Middle Tennessee. The straightest stretch of highway in Tennessee is located on I-24 between Lavergne and eastern [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], where the route is perfectly straight for about fifteen miles, although the median widens and narrows. Two miles later, I-24 reaches [[Smyrna, Tennessee|Smyrna]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 266|SR 266]] (Sam Ridley Pkwy.). Four miles later is an interchange with [[SR 102 (TN)|SR 102]] (Almaville Road), which also serves Smyrna, as well as the [[Nissan Smyrna assembly plant]]. Another four miles later is an interchange with [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville, and beyond this point I-24 enters Murfreesboro, the largest suburb of Nashville. In Murfreesboro, I-24 has interchanges with [[SR 96 (TN)|SR 96]] (which connects to [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]), [[SR 99 (TN)|SR 99]] (New Salem Highway), and [[US 231 (TN)|US 231]] (which connects to [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]] and [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]]), respectively, and at the final Murfreesboro exit (US 231), the HOV lane designation ends, and I-24 narrows to six lanes and then four lanes a short distance later. Three miles later is an interchange with the [[Joe B. Jackson Parkway]], which serves as an outer beltway around southeast Murfreesboro. I-24 then enters a more rural area, and remains relatively straight for many miles. Around milepost 96, I-24 briefly enters [[Bedford County, Tennessee|Bedford County]], and then [[Coffee County, Tennessee|Coffee County]], and at exit 97 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 64|SR 64]], which connects to Shelbyville. I-24 then curves to the south, then the east, and several miles later at exit 105 is an interchange with US 41, and five miles later I-24 enters [[Manchester, Tennessee|Manchester]], where it has interchanges with [[SR 53 (TN)|SR 53]], [[SR 55 (TN)|SR 55]], and US 41, respectively. I-24 continues through a rural, largely agricultural area where it crosses into [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]] and has an interchange with [[US 64 (TN)|US 64]] and [[SR 50 (TN)|SR 50]].\n\n====Monteagle Mountain====\n{{main|Monteagle Mountain}}\nOne of the most hazardous stretches of interstate highway in the United States{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} is located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Chattanooga on I-24 in [[Monteagle, Tennessee|Monteagle]], where the highway crosses the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The eastbound grade is particularly known to be hazardous, with a 4\u20136% grade protracted over a distance of several miles. Compared to grades elsewhere in the state, this downgrade does not come close to the steepest (I-40 between Nashville and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] features 5% grades in each direction as well as a 5% grade north of Nashville on I-24, near [[Joelton, Tennessee|Joelton]]). On this stretch, I-24 is three lanes in each direction, and contains two [[runaway truck ramp]]s. Owing to geography, these two ramps are on the left side of the grade. The westbound downgrade of the plateau is also extremely hazardous, and contains several sharp curves. Portions of this downgrade also feature off-ramp approach style lane dividers, in order to slow both motorists and truckers. Throughout the entire stretch across the Cumberland Plateau, the speed limit reduces to a maximum of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h}}; the westbound downgrade contains a {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit for trucks, and the eastbound downgrade contains a maximum {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit and {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|round=5}} limit for trucks.\n\nThe eastern Monteagle grade also has one of the three widest medians of any Interstate highway, with the others being [[Interstate 8|I-8]] through the In-Ko-Pah grade in [[California]] and [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] through the Cabbage Hill grade east of [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], [[Oregon]]. There is more than a mile between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend the other, and are part of the original interstate path in this area.\n\n====Georgia and Chattanooga==== \nAfter crossing Monteagle Mountain, I-24 travels for several miles through a relatively flat and straight segment before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 72|US&nbsp;72]] near [[Kimball, Tennessee|Kimball]] and [[South Pittsburg, Tennessee|South Pittsburg]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-24 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 28|SR&nbsp;28]] in [[Jasper, Tennessee|Jasper]]. Beyond this point, in a rare engineering feat, the east and westbound lanes split more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} apart, encompassing farms, homes, and a few businesses in between. This was reportedly a result of extensively fought disputes over [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] acquisitions, and is also one of the widest medians of any highway. The route then crosses a mountain, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 27|SR&nbsp;27]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, crosses the [[Nickajack Lake]] impoundment of the [[Tennessee River]]. Beyond this point, traveling through a gorge, I-24 can experience potentially strong [[crosswind]]s for several miles. I-24 enters [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and then into Georgia less than {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later.\n\nIn the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], I-24 travels for {{convert|4|mi}}, traveling along the southern flank of [[Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant|Raccoon Mountain]] and having an interchange with [[Interstate 59|I-59]] before turning back north to the Tennessee River and around the northern flank of [[Lookout Mountain]]. The exits remain numbered according to Tennessee's mileposts; however, the roadway mileposts are numbered according to Georgia's mileposts.<ref name=\"Athens\">{{cite news |url= http://onlineathens.com/stories/011600/new_0116000005.shtml |title= DOT to Change Interstate Exit Numbers |first=Ben |last= Deck |work= [[Athens Banner-Herald]] |date= January 16, 2000 |access-date= April 6, 2017 }}</ref> This segment also carries the [[Unsigned highway|unsigned]] '''State Route&nbsp;409''' (SR&nbsp;409) designation.<ref name=\"GDOT 2002\">{{cite GDOT map |year= 2002 |access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon re-entering Tennessee and Hamilton County, I-24 travels through [[Lookout Valley, Tennessee|Lookout Valley]] for several miles, and has interchanges with several key roads, including [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]]/US&nbsp;41/US&nbsp;72. Several miles later, I-24 curves sharply to the east, traveling on a causeway between the Tennessee River and the northern tip of [[Lookout Mountain]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, curves sharply to the north. Entering [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is a three-way interchange with [[U.S. Route 27|US&nbsp;27]] northbound, which is a freeway beyond this point. Forming a concurrency with US&nbsp;27, the highways then curve sharply to the east, then to the west about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, where US&nbsp;27 splits off to the south as Rossville Boulevard. With interchanges with several city streets, I-24 travels through the inner city of Chattanooga. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-24 reaches the \"Ridge Cut\", a {{convert|1/4|mi|m|spell=in|adj=on}} section of [[Missionary Ridge]], between the 4th Avenue exit and the Germantown/Belvoir exit, where the interstate curves sharply to the north, then to the east again, crossing the ridge with an extremely steep grade. Accidents and severe congestion are common here. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 reaches its eastern terminus with [[Interstate 75|I-75]] in [[East Ridge, Tennessee|East Ridge]].\n\nThe entire length of I-24 is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.<ref name=\"NHS Illinois\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/illinois/il_illinois.pdf |title=National Highway System: Illinois |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 8, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Kentucky\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/kentuckty/ky_kentucky.pdf |title=National Highway System: Kentucky |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Tennessee\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/tn_tennessee.pdf |title=National Highway System: Tennessee |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Clarksville\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/clarksville_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Clarksville, TN--KY |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Nashville\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/nashville-davidson_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Nashville-Davidson, TN |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Murfreesboro\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/murfreesboro_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Murfreesboro, TN |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Chattanooga\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/chattanooga_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Chattanooga, TN--GA |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 10, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><!-- Georgia map is not included because I-24 is not shown on it.
