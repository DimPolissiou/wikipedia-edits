It extends from [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in [[Toronto]] to {{STN|Oshawa GO}} in [[Regional Municipality of Durham|Durham Region]]. Buses from Oshawa connect to communities further east in [[Newcastle, Ontario|Newcastle]], [[Bowmanville, Ontario|Bowmanville]] and [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]].\n\nMost off-peak and some peak trains are interlined with the [[Lakeshore West line]], continuing to [[Aldershot GO Station|Aldershot]] or [[Niagara Falls station (Ontario)|Niagara Falls]].\n\n==History==\nThe Lakeshore East line is the second oldest of GO's services, opening as part of the then-unified Lakeshore line on GO's first day of operations, 23 May 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2007/23/c3558.html|title=GO celebrates 40 years of success|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> It is ten minutes younger than its twin; although the first train from [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] bound for Toronto left at 5:00 am that day, a 4:50 am departure from [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] on Lakeshore West beat it into the record books.\n\nThe line initially ran along the [[CN Kingston Subdivision]] from Union to Pickering. Just prior to the opening of GO service, CN had moved much of its freight operations from downtown areas to the new [[MacMillan Yard]] north of the city. To feed freight traffic from the east into the Yard, CN built the new [[CN York Subdivision|York Subdivision]] across the top of the city (in what was then farmland) and connected the Yard to the Kingston Sub just west of Pickering at Pickering Junction. This offloaded the majority of traffic from the Kingston Sub between Pickering Junction and Union, allowing ample scheduling room for GO service. Sections of the Kingston Sub to the east of Pickering Junction remained in use as the mainline to [[Montreal]], and CN did not have capacity to allow GO traffic on these sections.\n\nGO had originally planned to address this as part of a much larger project known as [[GO-Urban]], and later, [[GO ALRT]]. GO ALRT would have used a new electric train car running on a dedicated right-of-way between Pickering and its terminus to the east of Harmony Road on the far eastern edge of [[Oshawa]]. ALRT was to have followed the CN lines east to Whitby, then across the 401 to follow the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]] [[CP Belleville Subdivision|Belleville Sub]], which runs in parallel on the north side of the 401. Stations would be built at Pickering, Ajax, Whitby, Hopkins (west edge of Oshawa), Simcoe (downtown Oshawa), Oshawa east (at Stevenson) and finally Harmony. First proposed in 1982, ALRT lived for only a short time before it was cancelled in 1985 with a change of government.\n\nInstead, the basic alignment planned for ALRT from Pickering to Oshawa was laid using conventional track, splitting off at Pickering Junction and running under the York Sub bridge over the 401 in a complex basket weave. It ran along the original ALRT layout to Whitby, but abandoned the 401 overpass and instead continued along the CN lines to the current [[Oshawa GO Station]] on the far western edge of town. The new lines were laid in sections, reaching Oshawa in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gotransitmotive.bravehost.com/RosterStats/significantdates.htm |title=Significant dates in GO Transit |access-date=2018-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195027/http://gotransitmotive.bravehost.com/RosterStats/significantdates.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Until 29 December 2006, weekend and holiday trains still ended in Pickering,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://transit.toronto.on.ca/regional/2101.shtml |title=GO Transit's Lakeshore Line|website=Transit Toronto|author1=Daniel Garcia|author2=James Bow|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> but service is now offered along the entire route every day of the year.\n\nIn December 1993, GO Transit initiated a program for the eastward expansion of the Lakeshore East line, for which it received approval in 1994.<ref name=\"Cole\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oshawaexpress.ca/viewposting.php?view=411|title=GO Train expansion - Will all be 'all aboard?'|last=Cole|first=Lindsay|newspaper=The Oshawa Express|date=|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> GO Transit undertook a study to determine whether to use the tracks of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] or [[Canadian National Railway]].<ref name=\"Cole\" />\n\nMetrolinx purchased the Kingston Sub between Pickering Junction and Union on 31 March 2011.<ref name=\"CNtoGO\">{{cite news|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110330/go-metrolinx-pickering-toronto-canadian-national-railway-110330/20110330?hub=TorontoNewHome|title=GO owner buys rail line between T.O. and Pickering|publisher=CTV Toronto (CTVGlobeMedia) |date=30 March 2011|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> This means that GO now completely owns the Lakeshore East, Newmarket/Barrie and Stouffville corridors.\n\nOn 29 June 2013, off-peak service was improved to every 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/04/19/go_trains_to_run_every_30_minutes_all_day_on_lakeshore_lines.html|title=GO trains to run every 30 minutes all day on Lakeshore lines|last=Kalinowski|first=Tess|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>  On 24 September 2018, weekday mid-day service frequency was improved again, now operating every 15 minutes.  <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/go-trains-lakeshore-service-increase-1.4831511|title=GO trains on Lakeshore lines to run more often|last=|first=|newspaper=CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=20 September 2018|accessdate=2018-10-27}}</ref>\n\n==Service==\nAs of September 2018, local service operates every 15 minutes on weekdays mid-day, and every 30 minutes during other periods.

It extends from [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in [[Toronto]] to {{STN|Oshawa GO}} in [[Regional Municipality of Durham|Durham Region]]. Buses from Oshawa connect to communities further east in [[Newcastle, Ontario|Newcastle]], [[Bowmanville, Ontario|Bowmanville]] and [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]].\n\nMost off-peak and some peak trains are interlined with the [[Lakeshore West line]], continuing to [[Aldershot GO Station|Aldershot]] or [[Niagara Falls station (Ontario)|Niagara Falls]].\n\n==History==\nThe Lakeshore East line is the second oldest of GO's services, opening as part of the then-unified Lakeshore line on GO's first day of operations, 23 May 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2007/23/c3558.html|title=GO celebrates 40 years of success|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> It is ten minutes younger than its twin; although the first train from [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] bound for Toronto left at 5:00 am that day, a 4:50 am departure from [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] on Lakeshore West beat it into the record books.\n\nThe line initially ran along the [[CN Kingston Subdivision]] from Union to Pickering. Just prior to the opening of GO service, CN had moved much of its freight operations from downtown areas to the new [[MacMillan Yard]] north of the city. To feed freight traffic from the east into the Yard, CN built the new [[CN York Subdivision|York Subdivision]] across the top of the city (in what was then farmland) and connected the Yard to the Kingston Sub just west of Pickering at Pickering Junction. This offloaded the majority of traffic from the Kingston Sub between Pickering Junction and Union, allowing ample scheduling room for GO service. Sections of the Kingston Sub to the east of Pickering Junction remained in use as the mainline to [[Montreal]], and CN did not have capacity to allow GO traffic on these sections.\n\nGO had originally planned to address this as part of a much larger project known as [[GO-Urban]], and later, [[GO ALRT]]. GO ALRT would have used a new electric train car running on a dedicated right-of-way between Pickering and its terminus to the east of Harmony Road on the far eastern edge of [[Oshawa]]. ALRT was to have followed the CN lines east to Whitby, then across the 401 to follow the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]] [[CP Belleville Subdivision|Belleville Sub]], which runs in parallel on the north side of the 401. Stations would be built at Pickering, Ajax, Whitby, Hopkins (west edge of Oshawa), Simcoe (downtown Oshawa), Oshawa east (at Stevenson) and finally Harmony. First proposed in 1982, ALRT lived for only a short time before it was cancelled in 1985 with a change of government.\n\nInstead, the basic alignment planned for ALRT from Pickering to Oshawa was laid using conventional track, splitting off at Pickering Junction and running under the York Sub bridge over the 401 in a complex basket weave. It ran along the original ALRT layout to Whitby, but abandoned the 401 overpass and instead continued along the CN lines to the current [[Oshawa GO Station]] on the far western edge of town. The new lines were laid in sections, reaching Oshawa in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gotransitmotive.bravehost.com/RosterStats/significantdates.htm |title=Significant dates in GO Transit |access-date=2018-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195027/http://gotransitmotive.bravehost.com/RosterStats/significantdates.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Until 29 December 2006, weekend and holiday trains still ended in Pickering,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://transit.toronto.on.ca/regional/2101.shtml |title=GO Transit's Lakeshore Line|website=Transit Toronto|author1=Daniel Garcia|author2=James Bow|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> but service is now offered along the entire route every day of the year.\n\nIn December 1993, GO Transit initiated a program for the eastward expansion of the Lakeshore East line, for which it received approval in 1994.<ref name=\"Cole\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oshawaexpress.ca/viewposting.php?view=411|title=GO Train expansion - Will all be 'all aboard?'|last=Cole|first=Lindsay|newspaper=The Oshawa Express|date=|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> GO Transit undertook a study to determine whether to use the tracks of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] or [[Canadian National Railway]].<ref name=\"Cole\" />\n\nMetrolinx purchased the Kingston Sub between Pickering Junction and Union on 31 March 2011.<ref name=\"CNtoGO\">{{cite news|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110330/go-metrolinx-pickering-toronto-canadian-national-railway-110330/20110330?hub=TorontoNewHome|title=GO owner buys rail line between T.O. and Pickering|publisher=CTV Toronto (CTVGlobeMedia) |date=30 March 2011|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> This means that GO now completely owns the Lakeshore East, Newmarket/Barrie and Stouffville corridors.\n\nOn 29 June 2013, off-peak service was improved to every 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/04/19/go_trains_to_run_every_30_minutes_all_day_on_lakeshore_lines.html|title=GO trains to run every 30 minutes all day on Lakeshore lines|last=Kalinowski|first=Tess|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>  On 24 September 2018, weekday mid-day service frequency was improved again, now operating every 15 minutes.  <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/go-trains-lakeshore-service-increase-1.4831511|title=GO trains on Lakeshore lines to run more often|last=|first=|newspaper=CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=20 September 2018|accessdate=2018-10-27}}</ref>\n\n==Service==\nAs of September 2018, local service operates every 15 minutes on weekdays mid-day, and every 30 minutes during other periods.

Their lives are good until they get married and their lives turn to hell. Meet marries Anchal ([[Amrita Rao]]) who is obsessively possessive about her husband. Prem marries Geeta ([[Tara Sharma]]) who is overly religious and thus their sex life suffers. Amar marries Bindiya ([[Genelia D'Souza]]) who is dominating and lives with her mother ([[Archana Puran Singh]]). The friends get together one night and try to think of a way to get away from their wives for some time and relive their fun bachelor days. The men set their sights on other women but eventually realise they have all been seeing the same girl, Monica ([[Lara Dutta]]). She blackmails them about revealing their affair to their wives for Rs. 1&nbsp;million.\n\nThe terrified men arrive at Monica's car with all the money, only to find her dead. To not be accused, they try to hide her body, interrupted by police officer Sikander ([[Ajay Devgan]]) who begins to suspect, and then starts following, them. Thereafter, the trio goes to Monica's house for further investigation. Insp. Sikander traces the three who hide at Monica's verandah. Next morning, a mysterious man finds them and reveals that he killed Monica and demands [[ransom]] to cover the crime. The trio, guilt-ridden goes to their respective wives to apologise. But the very next day, the killer traces them and chases them in a car. Unknown to them, they shoot the killer and escape but end up in jail. After their wives show up, it is revealed that it was just a prank played on them and reveals Monica is alive and the killer turns to be a police officer. The men then apologise their wives and promise to never do \"Masti\" again.\n\n===''Grand Masti'' (2013)===\n{{Main article|Grand Masti}}\nThree friends \u2013 Meet ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), Prem ([[Aftab Shivdasani]]) and Amar ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]), who are married and don't like their wives: Meet thinks his wife Unatti ([[Karishma Tanna]]) is having an affair with her boss, Prem doesn't like it when his wife Tulsi ([[Manjari Fadnis]]) doesn't spend quality time with him and Amar hates his marital life because his wife Mamta ([[Sonalee Kulkarni]]) is more concerned about their son, Pappu.\n\nOne day, the trio receive an invite from their college, SLUTS (Sri Lalchand University of Technology And Science), to attend their college reunion. Their wives don't come with them, so the trio decide to have Grand Masti there to escape their boredom.\n\nWhen they arrive, they see the women full clothed and the boys too afraid to express their love for them. This all due to the fear of a Principal Roberts ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), who hangs people naked on a tree if they disagree with his rules. They find out that their former colleague, Hardik ([[Suresh Menon]]), is in the mental asylum because of the principal. Meanwhile, Prem meets one of his former teachers, Rose ([[Maryam Zakaria]]), and is attracted to her. Meet meets Marlow ([[Kainaat Arora]]) and is attracted to her. Amar meets Mary ([[Bruna Abdullah]]) and is attracted to her. The trio then goes to the girl's place to have sex with them. But just when they were about to do it, they find out that Marlow, Mary and Rose are relatives of the principal. The principal chases them down thinking they had sex with Marlow, Mary and Rose, but they get away as their wives come to spend time with them.\n\nThe trio then get an MMS showing them the footage of them having sex. Luckily, the video doesn't meet the eyes of their wives. They then find out that it was Hardik who sent them the video, and he blackmails them. Their task is to kill the principal to fulfill Hardik's revenge. They fail in killing him, so they decide to try and delete the videos off Hardik's phone. They succeed, and continue to spend their time at the reunion.\n\nIt's the last day, and the vengeful principal has put pills inside the soup which attract people to the ones they love. The trio end up being with the girls, and the principal catches them red handed. The girls then reveal that the principal is impotent. The trio then get chased by the principal along with the attracted girls, but then when the trio end up on the roof of a building, Hardik pushes the principal and the principal slides down the roof and hangs on to a bar. The trio try to save him but Hardik pushes them too and they hang onto the principal. The girls come and push Hardik off the roof and he hangs on to Meet. The trio then tell principal the truth about not having sex with Marlow, Mary and Rose. The girls try to make a rope out of their clothes, but the boys fall and end up in the hospital. The trio wives angrily ask them what exactly happened that night. Principal Roberts calmly replies that due to a misunderstood affair, their husband suffered this consequence. Shortly later, a doctor comes and informs the principal that he is no more impotent since the blood now properly flows all over his body due to the pressure generated while hanging on the bar. Hardik marries Marlow and the film ends up Roberts, Hardik and the trio about to have sex with their respective wives with everything now going well.\n\n===''Great Grand Masti'' (2016)===\n{{Main article|Great Grand Masti}}\nThe film features three friends Amar, Meet and Prem who always want fun (Masti). The film begins with the title song where the three friends marry Sapna, Rekha and Nisha. They are unhappy with their marital lives because of their brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law. Amar's mother-in-law wants her late husband to be reborn and on the order of a fraud baba (fake spiritual leader) she has stopped her daughter from having any physical relations with Amar for over six months to achieve the rebirth of her late husband. Prem's sister-in-law is attractive but silly, she comes to live with them and wants to sleep with her elder sister, forcing Prem to sleep on the couch away from his wife. Meet's wife is a twin and whenever he tries to go near his wife, it turns on his brother-in-law (who is a body builder). The connection between the two twins causes great problems like Meet's wife beating him up unintentionally when her brother is beating some goon up.\n\nOne day they meet in a bar and decide to enjoy their lives. They decide to go to Amar's village to sell off his family haveli (old mansion) and meanwhile have fun with the beautiful ladies in the village. When they reach the village, they find out that people are scared of the haveli. An old man tells them that there used to be a father daughter duo who lived in the haveli 50 years ago, the daughter, Ragini was very beautiful and many boys were smitten by her beauty but her father never let any guy near her, at the age of 20, Ragini died due to snake bite but her soul still resides in the haveli in search of a man who'll do masti with her. \nThe guys laugh it off and proceed towards the haveli, there they meet a very attractive girl who's been living secretly in the haveli as she is alone and has no where to go. The boys hire her as their maid and each one starts trying to attract her. Soon it is revealed that she is indeed Ragini and she informs the boys that one of them must sleep with her in order to free her soul and whoever does so will die. The boys get scared and try escaping the mansion but to no avail. Prem commits to doing so in front of Ragini to buy them some time and meanwhile they hire Babu Rangeela, a male prostitute to sleep with Ragini. But on the last moment their wives show up and Ragini turns Babu into a chicken. Ragini makes the boys do weird stuff in front of their wives and in laws who join them at the haveli so they would leave. When the boys see that their wives are secretly fasting for them even when Ragini depicted them off as such perverts in front of them, they decide to confront Ragini. The meet Ragini and tell her they won't sleep with her and she can't harm them as their wives are fasting for their long lives. Ragini hurts them but they light fire around her and call her father's spirit to help them. Rather Babu's spirit comes (who was cooked by the three wives) and does Masti with Ragini hence satisfying her urge. Babu and Ragini leave the world together and the three couples live happily ever after.\n<ref>[http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/great-grand-masti-first-look-out-riteish-deshmukh-aftab-shivdasani-vivek-oberoi-starrer-set-to-triple-the-fun-2856005/ \"Great Grand Masti first look out, Riteish Deshmukh, Aftab Shivdasani, Vivek Oberoi starrer set to triple the fun\"]</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"3\" | Film\n|-\n!  width:10%;\"| ''[[Masti (2004 film)|Masti]]'' <br>(2004)\n!  width:10%;\"| ''[[Grand Masti]]'' <br>(2013)\n!  width:10%;\"| ''[[Great Grand Masti]]'' <br>(2016)\n|-\n!

Thereafter, the trio goes to Monica's house for further investigation. Insp. Sikander traces the three who hide at Monica's verandah. Next morning, a mysterious man finds them and reveals that he killed Monica and demands [[ransom]] to cover the crime. The trio, guilt-ridden goes to their respective wives to apologise. But the very next day, the killer traces them and chases them in a car. Unknown to them, they shoot the killer and escape but end up in jail. After their wives show up, it is revealed that it was just a prank played on them and reveals Monica is alive and the killer turns to be a police officer. The men then apologise their wives and promise to never do \"Masti\" again.\n\n===''Grand Masti'' (2013)===\n{{Main article|Grand Masti}}\nThree friends \u2013 Meet ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), Prem ([[Aftab Shivdasani]]) and Amar ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]), who are married and don't like their wives: Meet thinks his wife Unatti ([[Karishma Tanna]]) is having an affair with her boss, Prem doesn't like it when his wife Tulsi ([[Manjari Fadnis]]) doesn't spend quality time with him and Amar hates his marital life because his wife Mamta ([[Sonalee Kulkarni]]) is more concerned about their son, Pappu.\n\nOne day, the trio receive an invite from their college, SLUTS (Sri Lalchand University of Technology And Science), to attend their college reunion. Their wives don't come with them, so the trio decide to have Grand Masti there to escape their boredom.\n\nWhen they arrive, they see the women full clothed and the boys too afraid to express their love for them. This all due to the fear of a Principal Roberts ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), who hangs people naked on a tree if they disagree with his rules. They find out that their former colleague, Hardik ([[Suresh Menon]]), is in the mental asylum because of the principal. Meanwhile, Prem meets one of his former teachers, Rose ([[Maryam Zakaria]]), and is attracted to her. Meet meets Marlow ([[Kainaat Arora]]) and is attracted to her. Amar meets Mary ([[Bruna Abdullah]]) and is attracted to her. The trio then goes to the girl's place to have sex with them. But just when they were about to do it, they find out that Marlow, Mary and Rose are relatives of the principal. The principal chases them down thinking they had sex with Marlow, Mary and Rose, but they get away as their wives come to spend time with them.\n\nThe trio then get an MMS showing them the footage of them having sex. Luckily, the video doesn't meet the eyes of their wives. They then find out that it was Hardik who sent them the video, and he blackmails them. Their task is to kill the principal to fulfill Hardik's revenge. They fail in killing him, so they decide to try and delete the videos off Hardik's phone. They succeed, and continue to spend their time at the reunion.\n\nIt's the last day, and the vengeful principal has put pills inside the soup which attract people to the ones they love. The trio end up being with the girls, and the principal catches them red handed. The girls then reveal that the principal is impotent. The trio then get chased by the principal along with the attracted girls, but then when the trio end up on the roof of a building, Hardik pushes the principal and the principal slides down the roof and hangs on to a bar. The trio try to save him but Hardik pushes them too and they hang onto the principal. The girls come and push Hardik off the roof and he hangs on to Meet. The trio then tell principal the truth about not having sex with Marlow, Mary and Rose. The girls try to make a rope out of their clothes, but the boys fall and end up in the hospital. The trio wives angrily ask them what exactly happened that night. Principal Roberts calmly replies that due to a misunderstood affair, their husband suffered this consequence. Shortly later, a doctor comes and informs the principal that he is no more impotent since the blood now properly flows all over his body due to the pressure generated while hanging on the bar. Hardik marries Marlow and the film ends up Roberts, Hardik and the trio about to have sex with their respective wives with everything now going well.\n\n===''Great Grand Masti'' (2016)===\n{{Main article|Great Grand Masti}}\nThe film features three friends Amar, Meet and Prem who always want fun (Masti). The film begins with the title song where the three friends get married to Sapna, Rekha and Nisha. They are unhappy with their marriage life because of their Brother-in-law,Sister-in-law,and Mother-in-law. Amar's mother in law wants her late husband to be reborn and on the order of a fraud baba (fake spiritual leader) she has stopped her daughter from having any physical relations with Amar for over 6 months to achieve the rebirth of her late husband. Prem's sister in law is very attractive yet very silly, she comes to live with them and wants to sleep with her elder sister, forcing Prem to sleep on the couch away from his wife. Meet's wife is a twin and whenever he tries to go near his wife, it turns on his brother-in-law (who is a body builder).  The connection between the two twins causes great problems like Meet's wife beating him up unintentionally when her brother is beating some goon up.\n\nOne day they meet in a bar and decide to enjoy their lives. They decide to go to Amar's village to sell off his family haveli (old mansion) and meanwhile have fun with the beautiful ladies in the village. When they reach the village, they find out that people are scared of the haveli. An old man tells them that there used to be a father daughter duo who lived in the haveli 50 years ago, the daughter, Ragini was very beautiful and many boys were smitten by her beauty but her father never let any guy near her, at the age of 20, Ragini died due to snake bite but her soul still resides in the haveli in search of a man who'll do masti with her. \nThe guys laugh it off and proceed towards the haveli, there they meet a very attractive girl who's been living secretly in the haveli as she is alone and has no where to go. The boys hire her as their maid and each one starts trying to attract her. Soon it is revealed that she is indeed Ragini and she informs the boys that one of them must sleep with her in order to free her soul and whoever does so will die. The boys get scared and try escaping the mansion but to no avail. Prem commits to doing so in front of Ragini to buy them some time and meanwhile they hire Babu Rangeela, a male prostitute to sleep with Ragini. But on the last moment their wives show up and Ragini turns Babu into a chicken. Ragini makes the boys do weird stuff in front of their wives and in laws who join them at the haveli so they would leave. When the boys see that their wives are secretly fasting for them even when Ragini depicted them off as such perverts in front of them, they decide to confront Ragini. The meet Ragini and tell her they won't sleep with her and she can't harm them as their wives are fasting for their long lives. Ragini hurts them but they light fire around her and call her father's spirit to help them. Rather Babu's spirit comes (who was cooked by the three wives) and does Masti with Ragini hence satisfying her urge. Babu and Ragini leave the world together and the three couples live happily ever after.\n<ref>[http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/great-grand-masti-first-look-out-riteish-deshmukh-aftab-shivdasani-vivek-oberoi-starrer-set-to-triple-the-fun-2856005/ \"Great Grand Masti first look out, Riteish Deshmukh, Aftab Shivdasani, Vivek Oberoi starrer set to triple the fun\"]</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"3\" | Film\n|-\n!  width:10%;\"| ''[[Masti (2004 film)|Masti]]'' <br>(2004)\n!  width:10%;\"| ''[[Grand Masti]]'' <br>(2013)\n!  width:10%;\"| ''[[Great Grand Masti]]'' <br>(2016)\n|-\n!

[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
