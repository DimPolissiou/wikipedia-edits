When the final choice comes down to Peter and another employee, Peter blacks out from the stress.

When the guys get hooked on the music as well, they learn of an upcoming Yacht Rock Cruise and decide to all go along. While attempting to board, Brian finds himself in a dog crate and stored beneath deck. On board, the rest of the family and Peter's friends rub shoulders with numerous stars. But when the ship's captain gets distracted hanging out with Peter, he leaves the bridge unattended as a rogue wave capsizes the ship.

Some other species, although having edible fruit, are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, sour cherries, as well as sweet cherries sometimes, are harvested by using a mechanized \"shaker\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Chainpure |url=http://www.chainpure.com/2009/06/wow-its-cherry-harvesting.html |title=Soul to Brain: Wow!

The number of chilling hours required depends on the variety. Because of this cold-weather requirement, no members of the genus ''Prunus'' can grow in tropical climates. (See \"production\" section for more information on [[chilling requirement]]s)\n\nCherries have a short growing season and can grow in most [[temperateness|temperate]] latitudes.<ref name=ucd/> Cherries blossom in April (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the peak season for the cherry harvest is in the summer. In [[southern Europe]] in June, in [[North America]] in June, in [[England]] in mid-July, and in southern [[British Columbia]] ([[Canada]]) in June to mid-August. In many parts of North America, they are among the first tree fruits to flower and ripen in mid-Spring.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, cherries are usually at their peak in late December and are widely associated with [[Christmas]]. 'Burlat' is an early variety which ripens during the beginning of December, 'Lapins' ripens near the end of December, and 'Sweetheart' finish slightly later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australiancherries.com.au/varieties-and-seasonality |title=Varieties |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Cherish the moment |publisher=Cherry Growers of Australia |access-date=12 September 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913000440/http://australiancherries.com.au/varieties-and-seasonality |archivedate=13 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Pests and diseases ===\n\nGenerally, the cherry can be a difficult fruit tree to grow and keep alive.<ref name=\"ingels\">{{cite book | last = Ingels| first= Chuck |display-authors=etal | title=The Home Orchard:  Growing Your Own Deciduous Fruit and Nut Trees | pages=27\u20138 | year=2007 | publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources}}</ref>  In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the [[Myzus cerasi|black cherry aphid]] (\"cherry blackfly\", ''Myzus cerasi''), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit.

Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they usually do not [[cross-pollinate]]. Some other species, although having edible fruit, are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, sour cherries, as well as sweet cherries sometimes, are harvested by using a mechanized \"shaker\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Chainpure |url=http://www.chainpure.com/2009/06/wow-its-cherry-harvesting.html |title=Soul to Brain: Wow!

The number of chilling hours required depends on the variety. Because of this cold-weather requirement, no members of the genus ''Prunus'' can grow in tropical climates. (See \"production\" section for more information on [[chilling requirement]]s)\n\nCherries have a short growing season and can grow in most [[temperateness|temperate]] latitudes.<ref name=ucd/> Cherries blossom in April (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the peak season for the cherry harvest is in the summer. In [[southern Europe]] in June, in [[North America]] in June, in [[England]] in mid-July, and in southern [[British Columbia]] ([[Canada]]) in June to mid-August. In many parts of North America, they are among the first tree fruits to flower and ripen in mid-Spring.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, cherries are usually at their peak in late December and are widely associated with [[Christmas]]. 'Burlat' is an early variety which ripens during the beginning of December, 'Lapins' ripens near the end of December, and 'Sweetheart' finish slightly later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australiancherries.com.au/varieties-and-seasonality |title=Varieties |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Cherish the moment |publisher=Cherry Growers of Australia |access-date=12 September 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913000440/http://australiancherries.com.au/varieties-and-seasonality |archivedate=13 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Pests and diseases ===\n\nGenerally, the cherry can be a difficult fruit tree to grow and keep alive.<ref name=\"ingels\">{{cite book | last = Ingels| first= Chuck |display-authors=etal | title=The Home Orchard:  Growing Your Own Deciduous Fruit and Nut Trees | pages=27\u20138 | year=2007 | publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources}}</ref>  In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the [[Myzus cerasi|black cherry aphid]] (\"cherry blackfly\", ''Myzus cerasi''), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the [[Rhagoletis cerasi|cherry fruit fly]] (''Rhagoletis cingulata'' and ''Rhagoletis cerasi'') lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1&nbsp;mm diameter), which in turn is the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/Datasheet.aspx?dsid=47051|title=cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis cingulata)|work=plantwise.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924074441/http://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/Datasheet.aspx?dsid=47051|archivedate=2015-09-24}}</ref> In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial [[canker]], [[cytospora]] canker, [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot of the fruit]], [[root rot]] from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.<ref name=\"ingels\"/>\n\n== Cultivars ==\n[[File:Washington USA Rainier cherries.jpg|thumb|Rainier cherries from the state of Washington, USA]]\nThe following cultivars have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
