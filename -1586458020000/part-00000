All monetary instruments issued by the government are on its liability side and are created and destroyed with spending and taxing/bond offerings, respectively.\"<ref name=\"MMTreply\"/> In MMT, \"vertical money\" enters circulation through [[government spending]]. [[Taxation]] and its [[legal tender]] enable power to discharge debt and establish the [[fiat money]] as currency, giving it value by creating demand for it in the form of a private tax obligation that must be met. In addition, fines, fees and licenses create demand for the currency. This can be a currency issued by the domestic government, or a foreign currency.<ref>[[Warren Mosler|Mosler, Warren]].

Sawyer, Elgar Publishing (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-84376-915-6}}</ref> An ongoing tax obligation, in concert with private confidence and acceptance of the currency, maintains its value. Because the government can issue its own currency at will, MMT maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's [[deficit spending]] or [[budget surplus]]) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and [[unemployment]], and not a means of funding the government's activities by itself. The approach of MMT typically reverses theories of governmental [[austerity]]. The policy implications of the two are likewise typically opposed.\n\n===Vertical transactions===\n[[File:Sectoral balances circuit diagram.png|thumb|400px|Illustration of the [[saving identity]] with the three sectors, the computation of the surplus or deficit balances for each and the flows between them<ref name=\"CBO_Aug2018\">[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54318 CBO-An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028-Retrieved November 12, 2018]</ref>]]\n{{Further|Sectoral balances}}\nMMT labels any transactions between the government, or public sector, and the non-government, or private sector, as a \"vertical transaction\".

From this account, the government can spend and also receive taxes and other inflows.<ref name=def1013 /> Each commercial bank also has an account with the central bank, by means of which it manages its reserves (that is, money for clearing and settling interbank transactions).<ref name=\"Meulendyke\">Meulendyke, A.M. (1998) U.S. Monetary Policy and Financial Markets. New York: Federal\nReserve Bank of New York.</ref>\n\nWhen the government spends money, the treasury debits its operating account at the central bank, and deposits this money into private bank accounts (and hence into the commercial banking system). This money adds to the total deposits in the commercial bank sector. Taxation works exactly in reverse; private bank accounts are debited, and hence deposits in the commercial banking sector fall. In the United States, a portion of tax receipts are deposited in the treasury operating account, and a portion in commercial banks' designated [[Treasury Tax and Loan]] accounts.<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /><ref name=\"NYFed\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed21.html|title=Treasury and Tax and Loan Program|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York|date=April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Government bonds and interest rate maintenance===\n[[File:U.S. Treasuries.png|thumb|right|350px|The Federal Reserve raising the [[Federal Funds Rate]] above [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury]] interest rates creates an [[inverted yield curve]], which is a predictor of recessions.]]\nVirtually all central banks set an interest rate target, and conduct [[open market operations]] to ensure base interest rates remain at that target level. According to MMT, the issuing of government bonds is best understood as an operation to ''offset'' government spending rather than a requirement to ''finance'' it.<ref name=\"FullPrimer\" />\n\nIn most countries, commercial banks\u2019 reserve accounts with the central bank must have a positive balance at the end of every day; in some countries, the amount is specifically set as a proportion of the liabilities a bank has (i.e. its customer deposits). This is known as a [[reserve requirement]].\nAt the end of every day, a commercial bank will have to examine the status of their reserve accounts. Those that are in deficit have the option of borrowing the required funds from the central bank, where they may be charged a ''lending rate'' (sometimes known as a ''[[discount window|discount rate]]'') on the amount they borrow. On the other hand, the banks that have excess reserves can simply leave them with the central bank and earn a ''support rate'' from the central bank. Some countries, such as [[Economy of Japan|Japan]], have a support rate of zero.<ref name=\"bis.org\">[http://www.bis.org/publ/work292.pdf?noframes=1 \"Unconventional monetary policies: an appraisal\"] by Claudio Borio and Piti Disyatat, Bank for International Settlements, November 2009</ref>\n\nBanks with more reserves than they need will be willing to lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the [[interbank lending market]]. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.<ref name=\"bis.org\"/>\n\nUnder an MMT framework where government spending injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw them from the banking system,<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /> government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves have been added to the banking system (see [[#Vertical transactions|vertical transactions]]). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.<ref name=\"Fullwiler2005\">Fullwiler, Scott T. (2005) \"Paying Interest on Reserve Balances: It\u2019s More Significant Than You Think\" (Working Paper No. 38), Wartburg College and the UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref>\n\nThe alternate case is where the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, there may be a system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that the correct amount of reserves is on hand in the banking system.<ref name=\"Bell2000\">Bell, Stephanie, (2000), \"Do Taxes and Bonds Finance Government Spending?\", Journal of Economic Issues, 34, issue 3, p. 603-620</ref>\n\nCentral banks manage this by buying and selling government bonds on the open market. On a day where there are excess reserves in the banking system, the central bank sells bonds and therefore removes reserves from the banking system, as private individuals pay for the bonds. On a day where there are not enough reserves in the system, the central bank buys government bonds from the private sector, and therefore adds reserves to the banking system.\n\nIt is important to note that the central bank buys bonds by simply creating money \u2014 it is not financed in any way.<ref name=\"Bell287\">Bell, Stephanie (1999), \"Functional Finance: What, Why, and How?\" (Working Paper No. 287), UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref> It is a net injection of reserves into the banking system.

In this case the only way the government can sustainably repay its foreign debt is to ensure that its currency is continually in high demand by foreigners over the period that it wishes to repay the debt \u2013 an exchange rate collapse would potentially multiply the debt many times over asymptotically, making it impossible to repay. In that case, the government can default, or attempt to shift to an export-led strategy or raise interest rates to attract foreign investment in the currency. Either one has a negative effect on the economy.<ref>[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11854 \"There is no financial crisis so deep that cannot be dealt with by public spending \u2013 still!\"] Bill Mitchell, 11 October 2010</ref>\n\n==Policy implications==\n{{Further|NAIBER}}\n\nEconomist [[Stephanie Kelton]] explained several policy claims made by MMT in March 2019:\n*Under MMT, [[fiscal policy]] (i.e., government taxing and spending decisions) is the primary means of achieving full employment, establishing the budget deficit at the level necessary to reach that goal. In mainstream economics, [[monetary policy]] (i.e., central bank adjustment of interest rates and its balance sheet) is the primary mechanism, assuming there is some interest rate low enough to achieve full employment. Kelton claims that cutting interest rates is ineffective in a slump, because businesses expecting weak profits and few customers will not invest at even very low interest rates.\n*Government interest expenses are proportional to interest rates, so raising rates is a form of stimulus (it increases the budget deficit and injects money into the private sector, other things equal), while cutting rates is a form of austerity.\n*Achieving full employment can be administered via a federally funded [[job guarantee]], which acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]]. When private sector jobs are plentiful, the government spending on guaranteed jobs is lower, and vice versa.\n*Under MMT, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., money creation to fund purchases) can increase bank reserves, which can lower interest rates. In mainstream economics, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., debt issuance and spending) can result in higher interest rates, crowding out economic activity.<ref name=\"Kelton1\"/><ref name=\"Kelton2\"/>\n\nEconomist [[John T. Harvey]] explained several of the premises of MMT and their policy implications in March 2019:\n*The private sector treats labor as a cost to be minimized, so it cannot be expected to achieve full employment without government creating jobs as well, such as through a job guarantee.\n*The public sector's deficit is the private sector's surplus and vice-versa, by accounting identity, a reason why private sector debt increased during the Clinton-era budget surpluses.\n*Idle resources (mainly labor) can be activated by money creation. Not acting to do so is immoral.\n*Demand can be insensitive to interest rate changes, so a key mainstream assumption, that lower interest rates lead to higher demand, is questionable.\n*When the economy is below full employment, there is a \"free lunch\" in creating money to fund government expenditure to achieve full employment. Unemployment is a burden; full employment is not.\n*Creating money alone does not cause inflation; spending it when the economy is at or above full employment can.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2019/03/05/mmt-sense-or-nonsense/#37c9928b5852 Forbes-John T.

A Critique of ''This Time Is Different'', by Reinhart and Rogoff,\"] Levy Economics Institute (June 2010), p. 15.</ref>\n\nIn this theory, sovereign government is not ''financially'' constrained in its ability to spend; it is argued that the government can afford to buy anything that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a [[debt ceiling]] law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms, or public) could cause inflationary pressures.\n\nMMT economists advocate a government-funded [[job guarantee]] scheme to eliminate [[involuntary unemployment]]. Proponents argue that this can be consistent with [[price stability]] as it targets unemployment directly rather than attempting to increase private sector job creation indirectly through a much larger economic stimulus, and maintains a \"buffer stock\" of labor that can readily switch to the private sector when jobs become available. A job guarantee program could also be considered an [[automatic stabilizer]] to the economy, expanding when private sector activity cools down and shrinking in size when private sector activity heats up.<ref name=\"elrJobGuarantee\">L.

He argues that these insights are well captured by standard Keynesian stock-flow consistent [[IS-LM model]]s, and have been well understood by Keynesian economists for decades. He also criticizes MMT for \"assum[ing] away the problem of fiscal\u2013monetary conflict\"<ref name=\"palley2\"/> \u2014 that is, that the governmental body that creates the spending budget (e.g. Congress) may refuse to cooperate with the governmental body that controls the money supply (e.g. the [[Federal Reserve]]).

[[Taxation]] and its [[legal tender]] enable power to discharge debt and establish the [[fiat money]] as currency, giving it value by creating demand for it in the form of a private tax obligation that must be met. In addition, fines, fees and licenses create demand for the currency. This can be a currency issued by the domestic government, or a foreign currency.<ref>[[Warren Mosler|Mosler, Warren]].

Sawyer, Elgar Publishing (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-84376-915-6}}</ref> An ongoing tax obligation, in concert with private confidence and acceptance of the currency, maintains its value. Because the government can issue its own currency at will, MMT maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's [[deficit spending]] or [[budget surplus]]) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and [[unemployment]], and not a means of funding the government's activities by itself. The approach of MMT typically reverses theories of governmental [[austerity]].

From this account, the government can spend and also receive taxes and other inflows.<ref name=def1013 /> Each commercial bank also has an account with the central bank, by means of which it manages its reserves (that is, money for clearing and settling interbank transactions).<ref name=\"Meulendyke\">Meulendyke, A.M. (1998) U.S. Monetary Policy and Financial Markets. New York: Federal\nReserve Bank of New York.</ref>\n\nWhen the government spends money, the treasury debits its operating account at the central bank, and deposits this money into private bank accounts (and hence into the commercial banking system). This money adds to the total deposits in the commercial bank sector. Taxation works exactly in reverse; private bank accounts are debited, and hence deposits in the commercial banking sector fall. In the United States, a portion of tax receipts are deposited in the treasury operating account, and a portion in commercial banks' designated [[Treasury Tax and Loan]] accounts.<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /><ref name=\"NYFed\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed21.html|title=Treasury and Tax and Loan Program|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York|date=April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Government bonds and interest rate maintenance===\n[[File:U.S. Treasuries.png|thumb|right|350px|The Federal Reserve raising the [[Federal Funds Rate]] above [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury]] interest rates creates an [[inverted yield curve]], which is a predictor of recessions.]]\nVirtually all central banks set an interest rate target, and conduct [[open market operations]] to ensure base interest rates remain at that target level. According to MMT, the issuing of government bonds is best understood as an operation to ''offset'' government spending rather than a requirement to ''finance'' it.<ref name=\"FullPrimer\" />\n\nIn most countries, commercial banks\u2019 reserve accounts with the central bank must have a positive balance at the end of every day; in some countries, the amount is specifically set as a proportion of the liabilities a bank has (i.e. its customer deposits). This is known as a [[reserve requirement]].\nAt the end of every day, a commercial bank will have to examine the status of their reserve accounts. Those that are in deficit have the option of borrowing the required funds from the central bank, where they may be charged a ''lending rate'' (sometimes known as a ''[[discount window|discount rate]]'') on the amount they borrow. On the other hand, the banks that have excess reserves can simply leave them with the central bank and earn a ''support rate'' from the central bank. Some countries, such as [[Economy of Japan|Japan]], have a support rate of zero.<ref name=\"bis.org\">[http://www.bis.org/publ/work292.pdf?noframes=1 \"Unconventional monetary policies: an appraisal\"] by Claudio Borio and Piti Disyatat, Bank for International Settlements, November 2009</ref>\n\nBanks with more reserves than they need will be willing to lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the [[interbank lending market]]. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.<ref name=\"bis.org\"/>\n\nUnder an MMT framework where government spending injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw them from the banking system,<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /> government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves have been added to the banking system (see [[#Vertical transactions|vertical transactions]]). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.<ref name=\"Fullwiler2005\">Fullwiler, Scott T. (2005) \"Paying Interest on Reserve Balances: It\u2019s More Significant Than You Think\" (Working Paper No. 38), Wartburg College and the UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref>\n\nThe alternate case is where the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, there may be a system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that the correct amount of reserves is on hand in the banking system.<ref name=\"Bell2000\">Bell, Stephanie, (2000), \"Do Taxes and Bonds Finance Government Spending?\", Journal of Economic Issues, 34, issue 3, p. 603-620</ref>\n\nCentral banks manage this by buying and selling government bonds on the open market. On a day where there are excess reserves in the banking system, the central bank sells bonds and therefore removes reserves from the banking system, as private individuals pay for the bonds. On a day where there are not enough reserves in the system, the central bank buys government bonds from the private sector, and therefore adds reserves to the banking system.\n\nIt is important to note that the central bank buys bonds by simply creating money \u2014 it is not financed in any way.<ref name=\"Bell287\">Bell, Stephanie (1999), \"Functional Finance: What, Why, and How?\" (Working Paper No. 287), UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref> It is a net injection of reserves into the banking system.

In this case the only way the government can sustainably repay its foreign debt is to ensure that its currency is continually in high demand by foreigners over the period that it wishes to repay the debt \u2013 an exchange rate collapse would potentially multiply the debt many times over asymptotically, making it impossible to repay. In that case, the government can default, or attempt to shift to an export-led strategy or raise interest rates to attract foreign investment in the currency. Either one has a negative effect on the economy.<ref>[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11854 \"There is no financial crisis so deep that cannot be dealt with by public spending \u2013 still!\"] Bill Mitchell, 11 October 2010</ref>\n\n==Policy implications==\n{{Further|NAIBER}}\n\nEconomist [[Stephanie Kelton]] explained several policy claims made by MMT in March 2019:\n*Under MMT, [[fiscal policy]] (i.e., government taxing and spending decisions) is the primary means of achieving full employment, establishing the budget deficit at the level necessary to reach that goal. In mainstream economics, [[monetary policy]] (i.e., central bank adjustment of interest rates and its balance sheet) is the primary mechanism, assuming there is some interest rate low enough to achieve full employment. Kelton claims that cutting interest rates is ineffective in a slump, because businesses expecting weak profits and few customers will not invest at even very low interest rates.\n*Government interest expenses are proportional to interest rates, so raising rates is a form of stimulus (it increases the budget deficit and injects money into the private sector, other things equal), while cutting rates is a form of austerity.\n*Achieving full employment can be administered via a federally funded [[job guarantee]], which acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]]. When private sector jobs are plentiful, the government spending on guaranteed jobs is lower, and vice versa.\n*Under MMT, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., money creation to fund purchases) can increase bank reserves, which can lower interest rates. In mainstream economics, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., debt issuance and spending) can result in higher interest rates, crowding out economic activity.<ref name=\"Kelton1\"/><ref name=\"Kelton2\"/>\n\nEconomist [[John T. Harvey]] explained several of the premises of MMT and their policy implications in March 2019:\n*The private sector treats labor as a cost to be minimized, so it cannot be expected to achieve full employment without government creating jobs as well, such as through a job guarantee.\n*The public sector's deficit is the private sector's surplus and vice-versa, by accounting identity, a reason why private sector debt increased during the Clinton-era budget surpluses.\n*Idle resources (mainly labor) can be activated by money creation. Not acting to do so is immoral.\n*Demand can be insensitive to interest rate changes, so a key mainstream assumption, that lower interest rates lead to higher demand, is questionable.\n*When the economy is below full employment, there is a \"free lunch\" in creating money to fund government expenditure to achieve full employment. Unemployment is a burden; full employment is not.\n*Creating money alone does not cause inflation; spending it when the economy is at or above full employment can.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2019/03/05/mmt-sense-or-nonsense/#37c9928b5852 Forbes-John T.

A Critique of ''This Time Is Different'', by Reinhart and Rogoff,\"] Levy Economics Institute (June 2010), p. 15.</ref>\n\nIn this theory, sovereign government is not ''financially'' constrained in its ability to spend; it is argued that the government can afford to buy anything that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a [[debt ceiling]] law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms, or public) could cause inflationary pressures.\n\nMMT economists advocate a government-funded [[job guarantee]] scheme to eliminate [[involuntary unemployment]]. Proponents argue that this can be consistent with [[price stability]] as it targets unemployment directly rather than attempting to increase private sector job creation indirectly through a much larger economic stimulus, and maintains a \"buffer stock\" of labor that can readily switch to the private sector when jobs become available. A job guarantee program could also be considered an [[automatic stabilizer]] to the economy, expanding when private sector activity cools down and shrinking in size when private sector activity heats up.<ref name=\"elrJobGuarantee\">L.

He argues that these insights are well captured by standard Keynesian stock-flow consistent [[IS-LM model]]s, and have been well understood by Keynesian economists for decades. He also criticizes MMT for \"assum[ing] away the problem of fiscal\u2013monetary conflict\"<ref name=\"palley2\"/> \u2014 that is, that the governmental body that creates the spending budget (e.g. Congress) may refuse to cooperate with the governmental body that controls the money supply (e.g. the [[Federal Reserve]]). In Palley's view the policies proposed by MMT proponents would cause serious financial instability in an open economy with [[Floating exchange rate|flexible exchange rates]], while using [[Fixed exchange-rate system|fixed exchange rates]] would restore hard financial constraints on the government and \"undermines MMT\u2019s main claim about sovereign money freeing governments from standard market disciplines and financial constraints\". He also argues that MMT lacks a plausible [[Monetary inflation|theory of inflation]], particularly in the context of full employment in the [[employer of last resort]] policy first proposed by [[Hyman Minsky]] and advocated by [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Bill Mitchell]] and other MMT theorists; of a lack of appreciation of the financial instability that could be caused by permanently zero interest rates; and of overstating the importance of government created money.

Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh.\n\nPaul's teachers and father refer to Paul's \"case\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed.

At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and can be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile.

Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh.\n\nPaul's teachers and father refer to Paul's \"case\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed.

At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and can be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013) on October 16, 2013. Inspiration for the song came primarily from a humanitarian trip to [[Madagascar]] that Perry made in partnership with [[UNICEF]]. Having been surrounded by what she described as [[unconditional love]], she co-wrote it with the song's producers [[Dr. Luke]], [[Max Martin]] and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]] to reflect that feeling.\n\n\"Unconditionally\" is a [[power ballad]] styled in [[Rock music|rock]], backed against a [[bassline]] and [[percussion]]. Commercially, it peaked within the top ten in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Lebanon, and South Africa as well as the top twenty in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the United States.\n\nThe single release was promoted with an [[Instagram]]-based campaign, a lyric video directed by [[Aya Tanimura]] and live performances\u2014one of the latter, at the [[American Music Awards of 2013]], was the center of controversy due to accusations of [[cultural appropriation]] and [[racism]]. Brent Benacorso served as the director for the track's [[music video]], which adopts the theme of love and uses a series of metaphors to enrich its concept.\n\n==Writing and production==\n\"Unconditionally\" was written by Perry alongside its producers [[Dr. Luke]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]]. Perry denoted the song as her favorite within the record. She also mentioned that she wrote the song bearing in mind the sentiments she had felt during her [[UNICEF]] humanitarian trip to [[Madagascar]] in April 2013. Such sentiments inspired her to delve into the theme of [[unconditional love]]. She stated that, while on that voyage, Perry and her team would \"go in cruisers up the mountain\" to see newly constructed schools. After observing a group of children, she realized that even without social networking, they felt \"pure\" [[unconditional love]] towards each other.<ref name=Goosebump>{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Katy Perry Reveals Secret Formula For Single Success: 'The Goose Bump Test'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717816/katy-perry-unconditionally-goosebumps.jhtml|publisher=MTV. [[Viacom Media Networks]].|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nInspired by that situation, the song was described by Perry as approaching all forms of [[love]]. \"I love this song because not only can it be a romantic, intimate song\", she expounded. \"But it can be about the type of love that a mother has when she sees her first child, or best friends [...] It is a transcendent love, not just relationship status.\"<ref name=Goosebump /> \"Unconditionally\" was also inspired by the acceptance of one's flaws in a relationship, which Perry believed was relatable to listeners.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=MTV UK.

He stressed that he wanted to match the song's tone with its visual, explaining that he wanted to depict a \"more mysterious, elegant and sophisticated world to live in..... less about a time period and more about creating an impression and a feeling.\" As the song essentially discusses the feeling of love, the video itself sees Perry amidst scenarios which indirectly refer to the power of it.<ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite web|title=Katy Perry's Bed Is on Fire: Her 'Unconditionally' Director Explains Why|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717850/katy-perry-unconditionally-video-director-explains.jhtml|accessdate=March 22, 2014|date=November 21, 2013|author=Vena, Jocelyn|publisher=MTV.

As she finishes the first verse, the camera shifts to a ballroom, in which elegantly-dressed dancers start to dance. The song's chorus kicks in, and Perry is now found in the ballroom, in the middle of all the dancers. As the second verse begins, she has an [[owl]] on her arm, which she lets go and flies. The bird represents \"something strong, free [and] powerful\", according to Bonacorso, who added: \"She lets it go into the world[,] and that literally [means] letting this force within her go wild. That's an important part of love[,] is that you have to let it go.\" The video also shows Perry, with a golden dress and cross-shaped earrings, with flames on her body. By the second repetition of the chorus, a bed gets lit on fire, which the director included to refer to love that \"can burn you like an inferno\". As the song reaches its climax, Perry gets hit by a car, with tiny broken debris from it shattering behind her, while she remains stationary and unharmed. This scene symbolizes the experience of true love, that changes \"your world\" and \"hits you out of the blue\". This scene cuts back to the ballroom, where Perry is surrounded by a similar explosion of \"colorful\" flowers, which is used to contrast the more violent nature of falling in love and the softer part of it, the \"joyful and wonderful\" feelings.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Katy Perry - The Prismatic 16.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Perry performing \"Unconditionally\" on her Prismatic World Tour.]]\nOn October 22, 2013, Perry first performed \"Unconditionally\" along with her other ''Prism'' tracks at the [[iHeartRadio]] Theater in Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\"ReleaseParty\">{{cite web|last=Gundersen|first=Edna|title=Live stream: Katy Perry's 'Prism' album release party|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/10/22/katy-perry-prism-album-party-stream/3153989/|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 22, 2013|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> She also performed these songs the next day when hosting the \"We Can Survive\" concert along with friends [[Bonnie McKee]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Ellie Goulding]], and duo [[Tegan and Sara]] at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Hollywood Bowl\">{{cite web|last=Aguila|first=Justino|title=Katy Perry Hosts Famous Friends, Previews Next Tour at Hollywood Bowl: Live Review|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5770379/katy-perry-hosts-famous-friends-previews-next-tour-at-hollywood|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> Perry also performed the song on [[The X Factor (Australian TV series)|the Australian version of ''The X Factor'']] on October 28, 2013 alongside \"Roar\"<ref name=XFactorPrismSongs>{{cite web|first=Carl|last=Williott|title=Watch Katy Perry Perform \"Unconditionally\" & \"Roar\" On 'The X Factor Australia'|url=http://www.idolator.com/7490750/katy-perry-x-factor-australia|publisher=Idolator|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> and also performed it on the Australian breakfast program ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' that day.<ref name=SydneyShow>{{cite news|title=Katy Perry shines at Sydney Opera House performance on Sunrise |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/katy-perry-shines-at-sydney-opera-house-performance-on-sunrise/story-fni0cvc9-1226748691445|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> On November 10, 2013, she performed \"Unconditionally\" at the [[2013 MTV Europe Music Awards]].<ref name=KatyEMAUnconditionally>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Katy Perry Gets 'Unconditionally' High For EMA|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717178/katy-perry-2013-ema-performance.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=10 November 2013}}</ref> She also opened the [[American Music Awards of 2013]] on November 24, 2013 with a [[geisha]]-inspired performance of the song.<ref name=OpenAMA2013>{{cite web|last=Talbott|first=Chris|title=Katy Perry Kicks off AMAs With Beautiful Moment |publisher=ABC News|date=November 24, 2013|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/katy-perry-miley-cyrus-book-end-amas-20995268}}</ref> On December 5, 2013, Perry performed the song on the Italian ''[[The X Factor (Italy)|X Factor]]''.<ref name=ItalyXFactor>{{cite web |last=Fowler|first=Brandi |title=Katy Perry Rocks Flower-Covered Sheer Dress at X Factor Italy Show |publisher=E!

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013) on October 16, 2013. Inspiration for the song came primarily from a humanitarian trip to [[Madagascar]] that Perry made in partnership with [[UNICEF]]. Having been surrounded by what she described as [[unconditional love]], she co-wrote it with the song's producers [[Dr. Luke]], [[Max Martin]] and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]] to reflect that feeling.\n\n\"Unconditionally\" is a [[power ballad]] styled in [[Rock music|rock]], backed against a [[bassline]] and [[percussion]]. Commercially, it peaked within the top ten in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Lebanon, and South Africa as well as the top twenty in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the United States.\n\nThe single release was promoted with an [[Instagram]]-based campaign, a lyric video directed by [[Aya Tanimura]] and live performances\u2014one of the latter, at the [[American Music Awards of 2013]], was the center of controversy due to accusations of [[cultural appropriation]] and [[racism]]. Brent Benacorso served as the director for the track's [[music video]], which adopts the theme of love and uses a series of metaphors to enrich its concept.\n\n==Writing and production==\n\"Unconditionally\" was written by Perry alongside its producers [[Dr. Luke]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]]. Perry denoted the song as her favorite within the record. She also mentioned that she wrote the song bearing in mind the sentiments she had felt during her [[UNICEF]] humanitarian trip to [[Madagascar]] in April 2013. Such sentiments inspired her to delve into the theme of [[unconditional love]]. She stated that, while on that voyage, Perry and her team would \"go in cruisers up the mountain\" to see newly constructed schools. After observing a group of children, she realized that even without social networking, they felt \"pure\" [[unconditional love]] towards each other.<ref name=Goosebump>{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Katy Perry Reveals Secret Formula For Single Success: 'The Goose Bump Test'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717816/katy-perry-unconditionally-goosebumps.jhtml|publisher=MTV. [[Viacom Media Networks]].|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nInspired by that situation, the song was described by Perry as approaching all forms of [[love]]. \"I love this song because not only can it be a romantic, intimate song\", she expounded. \"But it can be about the type of love that a mother has when she sees her first child, or best friends [...] It is a transcendent love, not just relationship status.\"<ref name=Goosebump /> \"Unconditionally\" was also inspired by the acceptance of one's flaws in a relationship, which Perry believed was relatable to listeners.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=MTV UK.

He stressed that he wanted to match the song's tone with its visual, explaining that he wanted to depict a \"more mysterious, elegant and sophisticated world to live in..... less about a time period and more about creating an impression and a feeling.\" As the song essentially discusses the feeling of love, the video itself sees Perry amidst scenarios which indirectly refer to the power of it.<ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite web|title=Katy Perry's Bed Is on Fire: Her 'Unconditionally' Director Explains Why|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717850/katy-perry-unconditionally-video-director-explains.jhtml|accessdate=March 22, 2014|date=November 21, 2013|author=Vena, Jocelyn|publisher=MTV.

As she finishes the first verse, the camera shifts to a ballroom, in which elegantly-dressed dancers start to dance. The song's chorus kicks in, and Perry is now found in the ballroom, in the middle of all the dancers. As the second verse begins, she has an [[owl]] on her arm, which she lets go and flies. The bird represents \"something strong, free [and] powerful\", according to Bonacorso, who added: \"She lets it go into the world[,] and that literally [means] letting this force within her go wild. That's an important part of love[,] is that you have to let it go.\" The video also shows Perry, with a golden dress and cross-shaped earrings, with flames on her body. By the second repetition of the chorus, a bed gets lit on fire, which the director included to refer to love that \"can burn you like an inferno\". As the song reaches its climax, Perry gets hit by a car, with tiny broken debris from it shattering behind her, while she remains stationary and unharmed. This scene symbolizes the experience of true love, that changes \"your world\" and \"hits you out of the blue\". This scene cuts back to the ballroom, where Perry is surrounded by a similar explosion of \"colorful\" flowers, which is used to contrast the more violent nature of falling in love and the softer part of it, the \"joyful and wonderful\" feelings.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Katy Perry - The Prismatic 16.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Perry performing \"Unconditionally\" on her Prismatic World Tour.]]\nOn October 22, 2013, Perry first performed \"Unconditionally\" along with her other ''Prism'' tracks at the [[iHeartRadio]] Theater in Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\"ReleaseParty\">{{cite web|last=Gundersen|first=Edna|title=Live stream: Katy Perry's 'Prism' album release party|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/10/22/katy-perry-prism-album-party-stream/3153989/|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 22, 2013|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> She also performed these songs the next day when hosting the \"We Can Survive\" concert along with friends [[Bonnie McKee]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Ellie Goulding]], and duo [[Tegan and Sara]] at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Hollywood Bowl\">{{cite web|last=Aguila|first=Justino|title=Katy Perry Hosts Famous Friends, Previews Next Tour at Hollywood Bowl: Live Review|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5770379/katy-perry-hosts-famous-friends-previews-next-tour-at-hollywood|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> Perry also performed the song on [[The X Factor (Australian TV series)|the Australian version of ''The X Factor'']] on October 28, 2013 alongside \"Roar\"<ref name=XFactorPrismSongs>{{cite web|first=Carl|last=Williott|title=Watch Katy Perry Perform \"Unconditionally\" & \"Roar\" On 'The X Factor Australia'|url=http://www.idolator.com/7490750/katy-perry-x-factor-australia|publisher=Idolator|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> and also performed it on the Australian breakfast program ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' that day.<ref name=SydneyShow>{{cite news|title=Katy Perry shines at Sydney Opera House performance on Sunrise |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/katy-perry-shines-at-sydney-opera-house-performance-on-sunrise/story-fni0cvc9-1226748691445|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> On November 10, 2013, she performed \"Unconditionally\" at the [[2013 MTV Europe Music Awards]].<ref name=KatyEMAUnconditionally>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Katy Perry Gets 'Unconditionally' High For EMA|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717178/katy-perry-2013-ema-performance.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=10 November 2013}}</ref> She also opened the [[American Music Awards of 2013]] on November 24, 2013 with a [[geisha]]-inspired performance of the song.<ref name=OpenAMA2013>{{cite web|last=Talbott|first=Chris|title=Katy Perry Kicks off AMAs With Beautiful Moment |publisher=ABC News|date=November 24, 2013|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/katy-perry-miley-cyrus-book-end-amas-20995268}}</ref> On December 5, 2013, Perry performed the song on the Italian ''[[The X Factor (Italy)|X Factor]]''.<ref name=ItalyXFactor>{{cite web |last=Fowler|first=Brandi |title=Katy Perry Rocks Flower-Covered Sheer Dress at X Factor Italy Show |publisher=E!

The season begins in March and finishes in October.\n\n==Teams==\nThe last-placed [[A Lyga]] team is normally relegated to I Lyga. Since [[FC Stumbras]] had gone out of business in July 2019, no team was relegated from A Lyga in 2019. The 7th placed team in A Lyga contests a play-off match with 2nd placed I Lyga team. In this play-off match [[FK Banga Garg\u017edai]] beat A Lyga side [[FC Palanga]] to claim a spot in the A Lyga.\n\nTwo teams from the [[II Lyga]] are promoted to I Lyga, the winners of each of the two II Lyga groups. Last season's winners were [[Kauno \u017dalgiris B]] and [[FSK Radvili\u0161kis]].\n\nIn Lithuanian football, ultimately the licensing process determines clubs eligibility to contest in the respective league.\n\n===Licensing Process===\nAt the end of [[2019 A Lyga]] season, a match fixing investigation was launched after irregular betting patterns were reported. In December 2019 the results of the investigation were published, resulting expulsion of [[FK Atlantas]] and [[FC Palanga]] from A Lyga, and their demotion to II Lyga. The clubs appealed, but their appeals were rejected. The clubs attempted to license to I Lyga, but the decision to demote the clubs to II Lyga stood ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lff.lt/news/9442/2020-m-sezono-i-lygos-licenciju-sieks-14-futbolo-klubu-ir-komandu/\n|website=LFF\n|title=2020 m. sezono I lygos licencij\u0173 sieks 14 futbolo klub\u0173 ir komand\u0173\n|date=2020-02-19\n|accessdate=2020-02-26\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lff.lt/news/9419/fk-atlantas-ir-fk-palanga-del-manipuliavimo-rezultatais-yra-salinami-is-a-lygos/\n|website=LFF\n|title=FK \"Atlantas\" ir FK \"Palanga\" d\u0117l manipuliavimo rezultatais yra \u0161alinami i\u0161 A lygos\n|date=2019-12-05\n|accessdate=2020-02-26\n}}</ref>\n\nWith reduction of numbers in A Lyga, several I Lyga clubs attempted to leapfrog into promotion to A Lyga. [[DFK Dainava]], [[Vilniaus Vytis]] and [[FC Hegelmann Litauen]] have applied for A Lyga license. [[FC Hegelmann Litauen]] later withdrew their application, while [[DFK Dainava]] and [[Vilniaus Vytis]] had their applications rejected. [[FC D\u017eiugas]], last season's I Lyga winners application was also rejected failing to meet several criteria. [[FK Banga Garg\u017edai]] was the only I Lyga club that successfully licensed to A Lyga. Three of the four other applicants, [[FC D\u017eiugas]], [[DFK Dainava]] and [[FC Hegelmann Litauen]] I Lyga licenses were automatically approved. [[Vilniaus Vytis]] failed to meet I Lyga licensing criteria, and license was not issued even after the appeal. However, the club was granted an exception with a condition that the club reaches certain milestones by 9 March. Vytis will start the season with 3 point penalty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lff.lt/news/9466/isibegeja-a-ir-i-lygos-klubu-licencijavimo-sezonas/\n|website=LFF\n|title=\u012esib\u0117g\u0117ja A ir I lygos klub\u0173 licencijavimo sezonas\n|date=2020-01-13\n|accessdate=2020-02-26\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lff.lt/news/9582/licencijavimo-komitetas-isdave-i-lygos-licencijas-13ai-klubu-ir-komandu/\n|website=LFF\n|title=Licencijavimo komitetas i\u0161dav\u0117 I lygos licencijas 13 klub\u0173 ir komand\u0173\n|date=2020-02-19\n|accessdate=2020-02-26\n}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2020 further match fixing investigation results were published.

The season begins in March and finishes in October.\n\n==Teams==\nThe last-placed [[A Lyga]] team is normally relegated to I Lyga. Since [[FC Stumbras]] had gone out of business in July 2019, no team was relegated from A Lyga in 2019. The 7th placed team in A Lyga contests a play-off match with 2nd placed I Lyga team. In this play-off match [[FK Banga Garg\u017edai]] beat A Lyga side [[FC Palanga]] to claim a spot in the A Lyga.\n\nTwo teams from the [[II Lyga]] are promoted to I Lyga, the winners of each of the two II Lyga groups. Last season's winners were [[Kauno \u017dalgiris B]] and [[FSK Radvili\u0161kis]].\n\nIn Lithuanian football, ultimately the licensing process determines clubs eligibility to contest in the respective league.\n\n===Licensing Process===\nAt the end of [[2019 A Lyga]] season, a match fixing investigation was launched after irregular betting patterns were reported. In December 2019 the results of the investigation were published, resulting expulsion of [[FK Atlantas]] and [[FC Palanga]] from A Lyga, and their demotion to II Lyga. The clubs appealed, but their appeals were rejected. The clubs attempted to license to I Lyga, but the decision to demote the clubs to II Lyga stood ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lff.lt/news/9442/2020-m-sezono-i-lygos-licenciju-sieks-14-futbolo-klubu-ir-komandu/\n|website=LFF\n|title=2020 m. sezono I lygos licencij\u0173 sieks 14 futbolo klub\u0173 ir komand\u0173\n|date=2020-02-19\n|accessdate=2020-02-26\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lff.lt/news/9419/fk-atlantas-ir-fk-palanga-del-manipuliavimo-rezultatais-yra-salinami-is-a-lygos/\n|website=LFF\n|title=FK \"Atlantas\" ir FK \"Palanga\" d\u0117l manipuliavimo rezultatais yra \u0161alinami i\u0161 A lygos\n|date=2019-12-05\n|accessdate=2020-02-26\n}}</ref>\n\nWith reduction of numbers in A Lyga, several I Lyga clubs attempted to leapfrog into promotion to A Lyga. [[DFK Dainava]], [[Vilniaus Vytis]] and [[FC Hegelmann Litauen]] have applied for A Lyga license. [[FC Hegelmann Litauen]] later withdrew their application, while [[DFK Dainava]] and [[Vilniaus Vytis]] had their applications rejected. [[FC D\u017eiugas]], last season's I Lyga winners application was also rejected failing to meet several criteria. [[FK Banga Garg\u017edai]] was the only I Lyga club that successfully licensed to A Lyga. Three of the four other applicants, [[FC D\u017eiugas]], [[DFK Dainava]] and [[FC Hegelmann Litauen]] I Lyga licenses were automatically approved. [[Vilniaus Vytis]] failed to meet I Lyga licensing criteria, and license was not issued even after the appeal. However, the club was granted an exception with a condition that the club reaches certain milestones by 9 March.

It featured a representative program in August and September where [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] went undefeated. The season commenced on the 20th of May, with the start of the competition for the Myers Cup.\n\nUnlike in 1910 when only two venues were used, there were 5 venues used. They were [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]], Takapuna Racecourse, 'Avondale', [[Auckland Domain]], and [[Eden Park]] (which was the venue for the club final between [[City Rovers]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]].\n\n==Eden Ramblers Formed==\nThe senior competition saw the addition of the Eden Ramblers who had been formed in April. A meeting was held at the Avondale Public Hall on Wednesday 26 April with Mr [[John Bollard (politician)|John Bollard, MP]] presiding over it. He was elected president and chairman, and the name Eden Ramblers was chosen along with the colours or green and gold. The following officers were selected: Hon Secretary, Mr B Boone; Management Committee, W. A. Cummings, J Eddoes, W Fairweather, M Morrow, and J Denyer. The membership was close to 50 and they were to begin their training for the season ahead on April 29 with a join practice with Ponsonby at Victoria Park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Eden Ramblers

The main theme throughout the series is the love between Princess Fantaghir\u00f2 and King Romualdo, which changes and affects everyone around them. The main villains throughout the series are the Black Witch and her master, the lord of evil Darken, both of whom appear from the very first episode. Various places and people that were not named in the films have been given names in the cartoon adaptation, such as the kingdoms of Tuan and Dana, which are Fantaghir\u00f2 and Romualdo's respective home kingdoms.\n\nThe series revolves around the adventures of Fantaghir\u00f2, the youngest daughter of King Hadrian of the kingdom of Tuan. She is brave and outspoken, and refuses to be demure and obedient like all women are supposed to be. Initially unknown to her, Fantaghir\u00f2 was born with a very specific destiny, which is to conquer all the evil in the land. Her passion comes from her great love for Romualdo, the prince of the kingdom of Dana. Throughout the series the Black Witch and Darken attempt to separate or destroy both Fantaghir\u00f2 and Romualdo.\n\n==Characters==\nMany of the characters from the live-action films are in this animated series, but some have been renamed or changed. There also a number of new characters added. Among the film characters that have been brought over to the series are Fantaghir\u00f2, Romualdo, Fantaghir\u00f2's father, Catherine, Caroline, Cataldo, Ivaldo, the Black Witch, Darken, Tarabas, Xelesia, and Golden Mane. However, the character of Tarabas, who was a very prominent character in the third and fourth films, is only a minor character in this series. Characters that have been changed are Lightning and Bolt from the films, who have become an imp-boy named Flash and a cat named Bolt, and the White Witch who has been split into two characters named the White Fairy and Mother Goose.\n\n==Episodes==<!-- based on official descriptions -->\n\n*1. \"The Prophecy\": The introduction of the kingdoms of Tuan and Dana, which have been fighting for centuries ever since Princess Kyra of Tuan made a pact with the dark lord Darken to steal the holy Kuorum, which is linked to the emotions of the two kingdoms. As long as the two kingdoms fight, the Kuorum is a source of dark magic. Many years later a prophecy comes to be that a girl will be born who will destroy all evil in the world. The Black Witch sets out to kill Fantaghir\u00f2, who has just been born to King Hadrian of Tuan, but the White Fairy sets out to protect the baby princess.\n*2. \"The Grotto of the Holy Beast\": Fantaghir\u00f2 has grown up into a young woman, and has been having dreams about a young man with enchanting eyes. She feels that she has to find that young man, but her father King Hadrian has summoned a trio of princes from another kingdom to marry her and her elder sisters Catherine and Caroline. Fantaghir\u00f2 rejects the proposal and flees to the forest, where she meets the White Fairy who tells her of her destiny, and later encounters her enemy Prince Romualdo from the kingdom of Dana.\n*3. \"The Scarlet Knight\": Prince Romualdo dreams that he is fighting the dark lord Darken, and he is helped by a mysterious Scarlet Knight. Romualdo sends a message to the king of Tuan asking for a final duel to end the war between their two kingdoms. King Hadrian agrees and holds a tournament to decide which Tuan warrior will represent the kingdom in the duel. Fantaghir\u00f2 secretly enters the tournament as the Scarlet Knight thanks to her friend Mother Goose. When the Black Witch learns of this tournament, she sends her own minion, the Black Knight, to defeat the Scarlet Knight...\n*4. \"The Duel of Love\": Fantaghir\u00f2 is preparing for her duel to the death with Romualdo, unaware that he is the one with whom she is in love.The Black Witch, fearing that Fantaghiro and Romualdo will discover their true identities and that love will join them together forever, wants to make sure they will never realise that they are destined for each other. Her spell creates a double of Fantaghiro who then lures Romualdo to the Bottomless Swamp to die there. The White Fairy warns Romualdo of the danger waiting for him when, in the duel, he faces the Scarlet Knight, whose identity is unknown...\n*while the Black Witch plots to sabotage their duel so that the two will never realise that they are destined for each other. The White Fairy fights back with her own plot to protect the would-be lovers.\n*5. \"The Hunter's Prey\": King Hadrian is travelling away from his kingdom when he is hunted down by Darken and his minions, the Drakes. Elsewhere, Catherine and Caroline are preparing to marry their beaus Cataldo and Ivaldo, respectively. At this event, Fantaghir\u00f2 makes a magical vow never to fight with weapons ever again. The celebrations are cut short when news arrives that King Hadrian has been captured by the Black Witch, so Romualdo, Cataldo, Ivaldo and the army leave to save the king. Fantaghir\u00f2 secretly goes after that and battles her own way to the Dark Castle.\n*6. \"The Rescue of the Kuorum\": Fantaghir\u00f2 arrives at the Dark Castle. Inside, she has to battle many creatures and avoid many traps, but is shocked when she finally reaches the Kuorum and discovers that she has to fight her beloved Romualdo, who has been put under a spell by the Black Witch...\n*7. \"The Forest of the Elves\": As Fantaghir\u00f2 and Romualdo are traveling to the kingdom of Torelia, they are attacked by Darken and the Black Witch again, and this time they are separated in the Forest of the Elves. Fantaghir\u00f2 meets a Unicorn and has to face three trials set by the Elves.\n*8. \"Heart of Stone\": Xelesia, mother of the dark wizard Tarabas, discovers a prophecy that he will be defeated by Fantaghir\u00f2. Xelesia sends her clay warriors to fight Fantaghir\u00f2, and during the battle one of the clay warriors drags Romualdo into the river, where he is turned into a stone statue. Fantaghir\u00f2 then discovers that the only way to save her beloved is to get a kiss from Tarabas himself.\n*9. \"The Black Cloud\": While Fantaghiro stays in the Forest of Oread and while Romualdo, Ivaldo and Cataldo are in the kingdom of Dana, the Black Witch conjures the terrible Black Cloud and sends it to the kingdom of Tuan, where it swallows Fantaghir\u00f2's castle completely.

It was created by [[BRB Internacional]] with animation by Colorland Animation Production, written by Francesca Melandri, Giovanni Romoli and [[Lamberto Bava]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2000/10/22/arriva-fantaghiro-una-fiaba-di-cartoon.html |title=Arriva Fantaghir\u00f2 una fiaba di cartoon - la Repubblica.it |language=it |publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date=2000-10-22 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref> produced by [[Mediaset]], [[Telecinco]] and [[Grupo Planeta]], with music by Mark Bradley and [[Terry Wilson (musician)|Terry Wilson]]. A 75-minute animated film ''Fantaghir\u00f2: Quest for the Kuorum'' edited together using footage from the series was released in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brb.es/en/productions/animation-tv-movies/fantaghiro-quest-kuorum |title=Fantaghir\u00f2, Quest For The Kuorum &#124; Brb Internacional |publisher=Brb.es |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706225217/http://www.brb.es/en/productions/animation-tv-movies/fantaghiro-quest-kuorum |archive-date=2013-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series uses elements from all five of the live-action ''[[Fantaghir\u00f2]]'' movies, combining and rearranging various events and characters appearances. The main theme throughout the series is the love between Princess Fantaghir\u00f2 and King Romualdo, which changes and affects everyone around them. The main villains throughout the series are the Black Witch and her master, the lord of evil Darken, both of whom appear from the very first episode. Various places and people that were not named in the films have been given names in the cartoon adaptation, such as the kingdoms of Tuan and Dana, which are Fantaghir\u00f2 and Romualdo's respective home kingdoms.\n\nThe series revolves around the adventures of Fantaghir\u00f2, the youngest daughter of King Hadrian of the kingdom of Tuan. She is brave and outspoken, and refuses to be demure and obedient like all women are supposed to be. Initially unknown to her, Fantaghir\u00f2 was born with a very specific destiny, which is to conquer all the evil in the land. Her passion comes from her great love for Romualdo, the prince of the kingdom of Dana. Throughout the series the Black Witch and Darken attempt to separate or destroy both Fantaghir\u00f2 and Romualdo.\n\n==Characters==\nMany of the characters from the live-action films are in this animated series, but some have been renamed or changed. There also a number of new characters added. Among the film characters that have been brought over to the series are Fantaghir\u00f2, Romualdo, Fantaghir\u00f2's father, Catherine, Caroline, Cataldo, Ivaldo, the Black Witch, Darken, Tarabas, Xelesia, and Golden Mane. However, the character of Tarabas, who was a very prominent character in the third and fourth films, is only a minor character in this series. Characters that have been changed are Lightning and Bolt from the films, who have become an imp-boy named Flash and a cat named Bolt, and the White Witch who has been split into two characters named the White Fairy and Mother Goose.\n\n==Episodes==<!-- based on official descriptions -->\n\n*1. \"The Prophecy\": The introduction of the kingdoms of Tuan and Dana, which have been fighting for centuries ever since Princess Kyra of Tuan made a pact with the dark lord Darken to steal the holy Kuorum, which is linked to the emotions of the two kingdoms. As long as the two kingdoms fight, the Kuorum is a source of dark magic. Many years later a prophecy comes to be that a girl will be born who will destroy all evil in the world. The Black Witch sets out to kill Fantaghir\u00f2, who has just been born to King Hadrian of Tuan, but the White Fairy sets out to protect the baby princess.\n*2. \"The Grotto of the Holy Beast\": Fantaghir\u00f2 has grown up into a young woman, and has been having dreams about a young man with enchanting eyes. She feels that she has to find that young man, but her father King Hadrian has summoned a trio of princes from another kingdom to marry her and her elder sisters Catherine and Caroline. Fantaghir\u00f2 rejects the proposal and flees to the forest, where she meets the White Fairy who tells her of her destiny, and later encounters her enemy Prince Romualdo from the kingdom of Dana.\n*3. \"The Scarlet Knight\": Prince Romualdo dreams that he is fighting the dark lord Darken, and he is helped by a mysterious Scarlet Knight. Romualdo sends a message to the king of Tuan asking for a final duel to end the war between their two kingdoms. King Hadrian agrees and holds a tournament to decide which Tuan warrior will represent the kingdom in the duel. Fantaghir\u00f2 secretly enters the tournament as the Scarlet Knight thanks to her friend Mother Goose. When the Black Witch learns of this tournament, she sends her own minion, the Black Knight, to defeat the Scarlet Knight...\n*4. \"The Duel of Love\": Fantaghir\u00f2 is preparing for her duel to the death with Romualdo, unaware that he is the one with whom she is in love.The Black Witch, fearing that Fantaghiro and Romualdo will discover their true identities and that love will join them together forever, wants to make sure they will never realise that they are destined for each other. Her spell creates a double of Fantaghiro who then lures Romualdo to the Bottomless Swamp to die there. The White Fairy warns Romualdo of the danger waiting for him when, in the duel, he faces the Scarlet Knight, whose identity is unknown...\n*while the Black Witch plots to sabotage their duel so that the two will never realise that they are destined for each other. The White Fairy fights back with her own plot to protect the would-be lovers.\n*5. \"The Hunter's Prey\": King Hadrian is travelling away from his kingdom when he is hunted down by Darken and his minions, the Drakes. Elsewhere, Catherine and Caroline are getting ready to get married to their beaus Cataldo and Ivaldo, respectively. At this event, Fantaghir\u00f2 makes a magical vow never to fight with weapons ever again. The celebrations are cut short when news arrives that King Hadrian has been captured by the Black Witch, so Romualdo, Cataldo, Ivaldo and the army leave to save the king. Fantaghir\u00f2 secretly goes after that and battles her own way to the Dark Castle.\n*6. \"The Rescue of the Kuorum\": Fantaghir\u00f2 arrives at the Dark Castle. Inside, she has to battle many creatures and avoid many traps, but is shocked when she finally reaches the Kuorum and discovers that she has to fight her beloved Romualdo, who has been put under a spell by the Black Witch...\n*7. \"The Forest of the Elves\": As Fantaghir\u00f2 and Romualdo are traveling to the kingdom of Torelia, they are attacked by Darken and the Black Witch again, and this time they are separated in the Forest of the Elves. Fantaghir\u00f2 meets a Unicorn and has to face three trials set by the Elves.\n*8. \"Heart of Stone\": Xelesia, mother of the dark wizard Tarabas, discovers a prophecy that he will be defeated by Fantaghir\u00f2. Xelesia sends her clay warriors to fight Fantaghir\u00f2, and during the battle one of the clay warriors drags Romualdo into the river, where he is turned into a stone statue. Fantaghir\u00f2 then discovers that the only way to save her beloved is to get a kiss from Tarabas himself.\n*9. \"The Black Cloud\": While Fantaghiro stays in the Forest of Oread and while Romualdo, Ivaldo and Cataldo are in the kingdom of Dana, the Black Witch conjures the terrible Black Cloud and sends it to the kingdom of Tuan, where it swallows Fantaghir\u00f2's castle completely. Fantaghir\u00f2 teams up with the Dragon and the White Fairy to prevent the Black Cloud from reaching Dana and redirect it towards the Mountains of the Eternal Eclipse, the only place where it can be defeated. Meanwhile, concerned about the fate of Fantaghiro and the inhabitants of Tuan, Romualdo, Cataldo and Ivaldo try to reach this kingdom...\n*10. \"Captain Redface\": The Black Witch has sent an enchanted balloon to destroy Fantaghir\u00f2's castle.

The singles were also released as a double LP vinyl set, entitled ''[[I'm Beside You]]'', in November 2013 and was sold exclusively on [[Record Store Day]].\n\n==Background==\nDuring a Q&A on May 5, 2012, Chad Smith announced through his Twitter page that the album's unreleased songs would eventually see the light of day. On May 27, 2012, Smith said in response to a tweet that, at some point in the next six months, the band would be releasing ten unreleased songs on 7-inch and as digital downloads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RHCPchad/status/206844914158403584 |title=Twitter / RHCPchad: RT @TheAnimalBar: @RHCPcha |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> Flea followed up Smith's announcement a few days later on May 29, 2012 by stating that eighteen unreleased songs from the ''I'm with You'' sessions would be released over the next six months. He also confirmed that the band has been writing new music while touring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/flea333/status/207347947954913281 |title=Twitter / flea333: @_MattCave yes we have bee |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\nJosh Klinghoffer commented on the unreleased songs by saying \"Finding songs that seem to want to join hands with others is a special task that require the right people...and the right songs! Some songs seem to have a lot more of an agenda than others. Some songs play well with others and some songs need more attention and a little extra care. Here are some songs that seemed to want to pair up and take a later train. Keep your eye on them, they're up to something...\"\n\nSmith said in July 2012 of the unreleased songs that \"We just wanted them to come out because we just really like them. We didn't want them to get lost, so we're gonna put them out, mainly for our fans. They would've waited for the Warner Bros. box set in, like, 2020, if there's even a record company around then. I'm glad they're going to see the light of day because it's an important part of the band and what we were doing at the time.\" On the sound of the songs, Smith says he finds it \"hard to explain\" what the first two songs to be released sound like but describes \"Long Progression\" as \"kind of a flowing, kind of midtempo funk\". He also stated the band is currently working on new music. \"Those are just waiting,\" Smith said. \"We'll go back to those when we start writing again, I'm sure \u2013 or not. We're just always trying to come up with new stuff; usually the latest and greatest is what we use, but you never know.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/red-hot-chili-peppers/64889 |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: 'Our new singles need to come out' &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and composition==\nAll of the seventeen songs were recorded during the sessions for ''I'm with You''. \"Long Progression\", the b-side to \"Strange Man\" which was the first single released, almost made the album's final cut but was left off in favor of \"Goodbye Hooray\". One of the songs, \"In Love, Dying\" is an eight-minute rocker captured in a single studio take that occupies both sides of a single, as Klinghoffer told Rolling Stone from a recent tour stop in Berne, Switzerland. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do that old trick where it fades out and fades back in on the B-side.\u201d Another cut, \u201cVictorian Machinery\u201d \u201csounds like a big three-headed monster playing drums,\u201d Klinghoffer said, adding that the band captured \u201cabsolute magic\u201d with \u201cNever Is a Long Time,\u201d a \u201cpop-tastic\u201d number featuring [[Greg Kurstin]] on piano. \u201cIt\u2019s really one of those cases where they had too many good songs to fit on an album. They have this cohesive thing in the studio \u2013 when they get that take, that\u2019s the take that they keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult, but we use a democratic process and the songs with the most votes are usually the backbone of the album,\u201d producer [[Rick Rubin]] wrote in an email. \u201cI can just say as is always the case, some of my personal favorites don\u2019t make the cut.

The singles were also released as a double LP vinyl set, entitled ''[[I'm Beside You]]'', in November 2013 and was sold exclusively on [[Record Store Day]].\n\n==Background==\nDuring a Q&A on May 5, 2012, Chad Smith announced through his Twitter page that the album's unreleased songs would eventually see the light of day. On May 27, 2012, Smith said in response to a tweet that, at some point in the next six months, the band would be releasing ten unreleased songs on 7-inch and as digital downloads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RHCPchad/status/206844914158403584 |title=Twitter / RHCPchad: RT @TheAnimalBar: @RHCPcha |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> Flea followed up Smith's announcement a few days later on May 29, 2012 by stating that eighteen unreleased songs from the ''I'm with You'' sessions would be released over the next six months. He also confirmed that the band has been writing new music while touring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/flea333/status/207347947954913281 |title=Twitter / flea333: @_MattCave yes we have bee |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\nJosh Klinghoffer commented on the unreleased songs by saying \"Finding songs that seem to want to join hands with others is a special task that require the right people...and the right songs! Some songs seem to have a lot more of an agenda than others. Some songs play well with others and some songs need more attention and a little extra care. Here are some songs that seemed to want to pair up and take a later train. Keep your eye on them, they're up to something...\"\n\nSmith said in July 2012 of the unreleased songs that \"We just wanted them to come out because we just really like them. We didn't want them to get lost, so we're gonna put them out, mainly for our fans. They would've waited for the Warner Bros. box set in, like, 2020, if there's even a record company around then. I'm glad they're going to see the light of day because it's an important part of the band and what we were doing at the time.\" On the sound of the songs, Smith says he finds it \"hard to explain\" what the first two songs to be released sound like but describes \"Long Progression\" as \"kind of a flowing, kind of midtempo funk\". He also stated the band is currently working on new music. \"Those are just waiting,\" Smith said. \"We'll go back to those when we start writing again, I'm sure \u2013 or not. We're just always trying to come up with new stuff; usually the latest and greatest is what we use, but you never know.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/red-hot-chili-peppers/64889 |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: 'Our new singles need to come out' &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and composition==\nAll of the seventeen songs were recorded during the sessions for ''I'm with You''. \"Long Progression\", the b-side to \"Strange Man\" which was the first single released, almost made the album's final cut but was left off in favor of \"Goodbye Hooray\". One of the songs, \"In Love, Dying\" is an eight-minute rocker captured in a single studio take that occupies both sides of a single, as Klinghoffer told Rolling Stone from a recent tour stop in Berne, Switzerland. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do that old trick where it fades out and fades back in on the B-side.\u201d Another cut, \u201cVictorian Machinery\u201d \u201csounds like a big three-headed monster playing drums,\u201d Klinghoffer said, adding that the band captured \u201cabsolute magic\u201d with \u201cNever Is a Long Time,\u201d a \u201cpop-tastic\u201d number featuring [[Greg Kurstin]] on piano. \u201cIt\u2019s really one of those cases where they had too many good songs to fit on an album. They have this cohesive thing in the studio \u2013 when they get that take, that\u2019s the take that they keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult, but we use a democratic process and the songs with the most votes are usually the backbone of the album,\u201d producer [[Rick Rubin]] wrote in an email. \u201cI can just say as is always the case, some of my personal favorites don\u2019t make the cut. I\u2019m sure everyone in the band can tell you the same.\u201d\n\nKlinghoffer said that they recorded 48 songs during the album's sessions and some could eventually see the light of day. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Klinghoffer said. \u201cWe just had so much material back then that certain things just straight-up didn\u2019t get enough attention. There\u2019s a couple that will probably just remain in our [[iPods]].\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Klinghoffer said that post-session work was done to the b-sides meaning that the band spent time in 2012 and 2013 working on some of songs.<ref>https://sites.google.com/site/rhcpsessions/i-m-with-you</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\nEach of the nine seven-inches feature cover artwork by [[Kelsey Brookes]], and when combined together, form one larger piece of artwork.
