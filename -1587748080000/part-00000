Because the members come from different areas of the island, the collection of data could serve as an animal distribution map of the island. According to the geographical data and pictures of dead animals collected by the members, the community itself and the sponsor the Endemic Species Center could find out the hotspots and the reasons of animals\u2019 death. One of the most renowned case is that the community successfully detected rabies cases due to the massively collected data and the corpse of Melogale moschata have been accumulated for years and alarmed the government authority to take actions to prevent the prevalence of rabies in Taiwan immediately. Another case in 2014 that some citizen scientists discovered birds that died from unknown causes near an agricultural area, then Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network cooperated with National Pingtung University of Science and Technology and engaged citizen scientists to collect bird carcass. The volunteers collected 250 bird corpses for laboratory tests, which con\ufb01rmed that the bird deaths were attributable to the pesticides used on crops. This prompted the Taiwanese government to restrict pesticides, and the Bill of Pesticide Management amendment, establishing a pesticide control system, was passed after the third reading in the Legislative Yuan. The results indicated that Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network developed a set of shared working methods and jointly completed certain actions. Furthermore, the community of Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network have made real changes on road resign to avoid roadkill, improved the management of usage of pesticide, epidemic prevention, and so on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Chia-Hsuan|last2=Lin|first2=Te-En|last3=Fang|first3=Wei-Ta|last4=Liu|first4=Chi-Chang|date=2018-10-10|title=Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network: An Example of a Community of Practice Contributing to Taiwanese Environmental Literacy for Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328208270|journal=Sustainability|volume=10|issue=10|pages=3610|doi=10.3390/su10103610}}</ref>\n*The AirBox Project was launched in Taiwan to create a participatory ecosystem with a focus on PM2.5 monitoring with AirBox devices. At the end of 2014, the public paid more attention to the PM2.5 level because the air pollution problem became worse, especially in central and southern Taiwan. High PM2.5 level is harmful to our health, such as respiratory problems, so it aroused public concerns and led to an intensive debate about air pollution sources. Some experts indicated that the air quality was affected by pollutants from Mainland China, while some environmentalists believed that it is the result of industrialization such as exhaust fumes from local power plants or factories; however, no one knew the answer because of insufficient data. Dr. Ling-Jyh Chen, a researcher of the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, launched The AirBox Project. His original idea is inspired by a popular Taiwanese slogan Save Your Environment by Yourself. As an expert in Participatory Sensing System, he decided to take this bottom-up approach to collect PM2.5 level data, and through open data and data analysis to have a better understanding of the possible air pollution source. In this ecosystem, massive data was collected from the AirBox device. Data was instantly revealed online to inform people of PM2.5 level so that they take proper action, such as wearing a mask or staying at home, to prevent themselves from directly exploring to polluted environment. Data could be also analyzed to understand the possible sources of pollution and provide recommendations for improving the situation. To be precise, there are four main steps in this project. '''I)''' Develop the AirBox device. Developing a device that could correctly collect the data of the PM2.5 level was time-consuming. It took more than three years to develop AirBox that can be easily used, but with both high accuracy and low cost. '''II)''' Broad installation of AirBox. In the beginning, very few people were willing to install it at their homes because of their concerns about the possible harm to their health, power-consuming problem and maintenances of it, so that AirBoxs were only installed in a relatively small area. Thanks to the help from Taiwan's LASS (Location Aware Sensing System) community, AirBox appeared in all parts of Taiwan. As of February 2017, there are more than 1,600 Air Boxes installed in more than 27 countries. '''III)''' Open Source and Data Analysis. All measurement results were released and visualized in real-time to the public through different media, such as [https://pm25.lass-net.org/ their website] and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/pm25opendata/ Facebook page]. Data can be analyzed to trace pollution sources.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://research.sinica.edu.tw/pm25-air-box/|title=\u7a7a\u6c23\u76d2\u5b50\u63a8\u624b\uff1a\u7a7a\u6c23\u8b8a\u9ad2\u4e86\uff0c\u96e3\u9053\u6c92\u6709\u8fa6\u6cd5\u55ce\uff1f\u2502\u7814\u4e4b\u6709\u7269 - \u4e2d\u592e\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u8cc7\u6599\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76|date=2017-02-16|language=zh-TW|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n*Japan has a long history of citizen science involvement, the 1,200-year-old tradition of collecting records on [[cherry blossom]] flowering probably being the world's longest-running citizen science project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technology.org/2015/03/25/cherry-blossom-season-emperors-sake-and-citizen-science/|title=Cherry blossom season, Emperor's sake and Citizen Science|date=25 March 2015|website=Technology Org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> One of the most influential citizen science projects has also come out of Japan: [[Safecast (organization)|Safecast]].

Because the members come from different areas of the island, the collection of data could serve as an animal distribution map of the island. According to the geographical data and pictures of dead animals collected by the members, the community itself and the sponsor the Endemic Species Center could find out the hotspots and the reasons of animals\u2019 death. One of the most renowned case is that the community successfully detected rabies cases due to the massively collected data and the corpse of Melogale moschata have been accumulated for years and alarmed the government authority to take actions to prevent the prevalence of rabies in Taiwan immediately. Another case in 2014 that some citizen scientists discovered birds that died from unknown causes near an agricultural area, then Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network cooperated with National Pingtung University of Science and Technology and engaged citizen scientists to collect bird carcass. The volunteers collected 250 bird corpses for laboratory tests, which con\ufb01rmed that the bird deaths were attributable to the pesticides used on crops. This prompted the Taiwanese government to restrict pesticides, and the Bill of Pesticide Management amendment, establishing a pesticide control system, was passed after the third reading in the Legislative Yuan. The results indicated that Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network developed a set of shared working methods and jointly completed certain actions. Furthermore, the community of Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network have made real changes on road resign to avoid roadkill, improved the management of usage of pesticide, epidemic prevention, and so on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Chia-Hsuan|last2=Lin|first2=Te-En|last3=Fang|first3=Wei-Ta|last4=Liu|first4=Chi-Chang|date=2018-10-10|title=Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network: An Example of a Community of Practice Contributing to Taiwanese Environmental Literacy for Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328208270|journal=Sustainability|volume=10|issue=10|pages=3610|doi=10.3390/su10103610}}</ref>\n*The AirBox Project was launched in Taiwan to create a participatory ecosystem with a focus on PM2.5 monitoring with AirBox devices. At the end of 2014, the public paid more attention to the PM2.5 level because the air pollution problem became worse, especially in central and southern Taiwan. High PM2.5 level is harmful to our health, such as respiratory problems, so it aroused public concerns and led to an intensive debate about air pollution sources. Some experts indicated that the air quality was affected by pollutants from Mainland China, while some environmentalists believed that it is the result of industrialization such as exhaust fumes from local power plants or factories; however, no one knew the answer because of insufficient data. Dr. Ling-Jyh Chen, a researcher of the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, launched The AirBox Project. His original idea is inspired by a popular Taiwanese slogan Save Your Environment by Yourself. As an expert in Participatory Sensing System, he decided to take this bottom-up approach to collect PM2.5 level data, and through open data and data analysis to have a better understanding of the possible air pollution source. In this ecosystem, massive data was collected from the AirBox device. Data was instantly revealed online to inform people of PM2.5 level so that they take proper action, such as wearing a mask or staying at home, to prevent themselves from directly exploring to polluted environment. Data could be also analyzed to understand the possible sources of pollution and provide recommendations for improving the situation. To be precise, there are four main steps in this project. '''I)''' Develop the AirBox device. Developing a device that could correctly collect the data of the PM2.5 level was time-consuming. It took more than three years to develop AirBox that can be easily used, but with both high accuracy and low cost. '''II)''' Broad installation of AirBox. In the beginning, very few people were willing to install it at their homes because of their concerns about the possible harm to their health, power-consuming problem and maintenances of it, so that AirBoxs were only installed in a relatively small area. Thanks to the help from Taiwan's LASS (Location Aware Sensing System) community, AirBox appeared in all parts of Taiwan. As of February 2017, there are more than 1,600 Air Boxes installed in more than 27 countries. '''III)''' Open Source and Data Analysis. All measurement results were released and visualized in real-time to the public through different media, such as [https://pm25.lass-net.org/ their website] and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/pm25opendata/ Facebook page]. Data can be analyzed to trace pollution sources.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://research.sinica.edu.tw/pm25-air-box/|title=\u7a7a\u6c23\u76d2\u5b50\u63a8\u624b\uff1a\u7a7a\u6c23\u8b8a\u9ad2\u4e86\uff0c\u96e3\u9053\u6c92\u6709\u8fa6\u6cd5\u55ce\uff1f\u2502\u7814\u4e4b\u6709\u7269 - \u4e2d\u592e\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u8cc7\u6599\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76|date=2017-02-16|language=zh-TW|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n*Japan has a long history of citizen science involvement, the 1,200-year-old tradition of collecting records on [[cherry blossom]] flowering probably being the world's longest-running citizen science project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technology.org/2015/03/25/cherry-blossom-season-emperors-sake-and-citizen-science/|title=Cherry blossom season, Emperor's sake and Citizen Science|date=25 March 2015|website=Technology Org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> One of the most influential citizen science projects has also come out of Japan: [[Safecast (organization)|Safecast]].

After organizing themselves with Bill Loelius as president, Kevin Smith as vice president, and Luanne Bialecki as Secretary-Treasurer, the group hosted two drum corps shows, Southern Gold Classic at [[Davidson College]] and NightBEAT at Charlotte's Memorial Stadium. Southern Gold Classic drew a small audience and lost money. NightBEAT was much better attended, but the group was unable to pay the stadium rental. When NightBEAT Chairperson Doug Madar, Bill Loelius, and Kevin Smith met with Charlotte Parks & Recreation Department Superintendent Marvin Billups to discuss working out some sort of payment schedule, they were surprised when Billups not only wrote off the bill for the 1988 NightBEAT but offered the Department's sponsorship for future shows. In 1989, a gift of $1000 was offered by the Queen City [[Optimist International|Optimists]] with the proviso that the organization start a performance group; after discussions initially centered on starting a drumline, Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps was born.<ref name=\"crown\">{{Cite web |url=http://carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=83&Itemid=96# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823050834/http://carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=83&Itemid=96# |archive-date=2008-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"reps\">[http://www.corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=43&corpstype=Junior corpsreps.com - The Drum Corps Repertoire Database<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"hist\">A History of Drum & Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; Drum Corps World, 2003</ref>\n\nAfter the corps bought a complete set of drums from a defunct drum and bugle corps only to discover that they were seriously damaged, John Cummings of [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig Drums]] offered to repair the drums as part of an informal sponsorship of the corps. The name Carolina Crown was adopted to recognize the groups' desire to represent the Carolinas region while still recognizing Charlotte, the Queen City, which has a crown in its logo. The leadership group met, in the fall of 1989, with several young band directors who were also alumni of Suncoast Sound, [[Spirit Drum and Bugle Corps|Spirit of Atlanta]], and the [[Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps|Madison Scouts]] drum and bugle corps to tell them of their efforts to start a new local corps. From this group, Don Taylor, Cecil Adderley, Bill Register, and Van Mathews volunteered to be the corps' first instructors. After locating and purchasing the horns of the defunct California Dons, Carolina Crown began recruiting members. The corps also formed a partnership with the Mecklenburg Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] as Explorer Post #588, which aided them in finding school space for auditions and practices.<ref name=\"crown\"/><ref name=\"reps\"/><ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\nIn 1990, fielding a corps of only sixty-one members, Carolina Crown elected to compete in the Open Class (now known as World Class) in DCI. However, not only was the corps out-classed by the other, larger corps in Open Class, but it was also bested in DCI prelims by seven corps that had advanced from Classes A and A60, finishing thirty-third of 33 corps at their first DCI World Championships in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fromthepressbox.com/19900815div1prelims.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023175801/http://www.fromthepressbox.com/19900815div1prelims.htm# |archive-date=2014-10-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1991, the corps dropped down to Class A. At the DCI Championships in [[Dallas]], Carolina Crown finished in second place in Class A and advanced to Open Class prelims, where they placed twenty-fifth, earning DCI Associate membership. Carolina Crown was third in the 1992 Division II championship in [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]], once more finishing in twenty-fifth place in Division I (which had been renamed from Open Class) prelims in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. At the 1993 DCI Championships in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], Carolina Crown won the Division II Championship title and finished in twenty-first place in Division I prelims.<ref name=\"crown\"/><ref name=\"reps\"/><ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\nAfter winning Division II in 1993, Carolina Crown opted to compete exclusively in Division I in 1994. That year, the corps finished seventeenth in DCI semifinals in [[Boston]]. In 1995, in only its sixth season, Carolina Crown earned a spot as one of DCI's Top Twelve Finalists, taking eleventh place in quarterfinals and holding that position through Finals. Since that first Finals appearance, Carolina Crown has failed to make DCI Finals only once (2002), finishing in fourth place in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2018, and 2019, third place in 2016 and 2017, second place in 2009, 2012 and 2015, and winning the World Class DCI World Championship in 2013.<ref name=\"dci.org\">[http://www.dci.org/news/view.cfm?news_id=49f8a973-d562-4c9c-b14a-16d4f3866e41 DCI.org News: A New Champion is 'Crowned'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In recent years, Crown has become renowned for its hornline, consistently one of DCI's best.

Carolina Crown has won these caption awards:\n\n'''Jim Ott Best Brass Performance Award'''\n* 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019\n\n'''John Brazale Best Visual Performance Award'''\n* 2012, 2013, 2016\n\n'''Don Angelica Best General Effect Award'''\n* 2013, 2015\n\n'''George Zingali Best Color Guard Award'''\n* 2016\n\nDCI also presents an award to the best drum major, as voted on by the DCI Hall of Fame committee:\n\n'''Jim Jones Leadership Award'''\n* Bob Beasley, 2006\n* Evan VanDoren, 2007\n\n==Traditions==\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}\n'''Corps song'''\n\nCarolina Crown's official corps song is \"[[Carolina in My Mind]]\" written by North Carolina native James Taylor and originally arranged by former corps faculty member Marty McCartt and re-arranged by Andre Feagin. The current arrangement is by longtime Crown Brass Arranger Micheal Klesch. The lyrics were adjusted for the corps by guard member Adele Honrath (n\u00e9e Williamson) in 2001. The corps sings in harmony before entering the field before each performance. All Crown alumni are welcomed to sing this with the corps.\n\nThe adjusted lyrics are: \"In my mind, I'm going to Carolina can't you see the sunshine, this feeling lasts for a lifetime, something that I have come to find, I'll never leave behind, yes I'm going to Carolina in my mind.\"\n\n'''Theme from ''Band of Brothers'''''\n\nIn addition to the corps song, the hornline also sings and performs the theme from the HBO miniseries ''Band of Brothers'' (composed by Michael Kamen and arranged by Michael Klesch) as a theme of brotherhood within the hornline. They sing it after all rehearsals and perform it on their instruments during encores. The hornline never sings it publicly, but only in a close huddle after rehearsals.\n\n'''Bead necklace and age-out crown'''\n\nThe tradition of the bead necklace was started in 1998. Members receive a bead for every year that they march. The beads are specific to each year, and the shape, color and material of the beads based on the theme of that year's field production. For instance, bead given in 2009 was green, as the show was entitled \"The Grass is Always Greener\".\n\nThe bead is usually given to members on the last day of spring training, often the day of the corp's annual preview show. It serves as a formal induction into the corps for that year's new (\"rookie\") members. The spirit of this tradition holds that the members have completed the most difficult and grueling part of the season (spring training), and are now full members of the family. Members are free to personalize their necklace as they see fit.\n\nUpon aging out, members will be awarded a silver crown pendant to add to their bead necklace. This is presented to the age-out members at the corps annual awards banquet.\n\n'''Corps picture \"crown\"'''\n\nSince 1990, the corps has always formed the trademark crown logo while having its group picture taken at DCI Championships. Usually, the drum major forms the very tip at the top of the crown. In addition, the bass drum section has often made it a tradition to have their eyes looking off to one side as the picture is snapped.\n\n'''Age-out dinner'''\n\nEvery year, the corps recognizes the age outs from the current year with a formal dinner held during finals week. Age-outs are given an opportunity to speak and are awarded their age-out crown pendants at this time. In 2007, the decision was made to combine the age-out dinner with the corps awards banquet, which had traditionally been held the December following the summer. In 2009, another change was added as the corps held the age-out dinner in the afternoon of the day after Finals. This was the first time in the corps' 20-year history that it did not depart the Finals city immediately after the Saturday Night Finals show.\n\n'''NightBEAT'''\n\nFrom 1988 to 2008, Carolina Crown hosted \"NightBEAT\" at American Legion Memorial Stadium in Downtown Charlotte. This show is considered to be the premier non-regional DCI show in the country.\n\nFrom 2009-2011, NightBEAT was moved to Rock Hill's District III Stadium. While this is a smaller venue than Memorial Stadium (about 4100 seats vs. 7000-8000 for ALMS), the move was necessary as the City of Charlotte was forced to temporarily close ALMS due to a part of the concrete stands collapsing.\n\nIn 2012, NightBEAT returned to ALMS when the stadium repairs were completed. Its return was a great success, with a nearly sold-out crowd, and the Carolina Crown missed defeating the Blue Devils by 0.2 points.\n\nNightBEAT was again held at ALMS in 2013, with the largest crowd in NightBEAT history; nearly 7,500 spectators. Again Carolina Crown narrowly missed defeating the Blue Devils by 0.05 points.\n\nIn 2015, 2016, and 2017, NightBEAT was held at Wake Forest University's BB&T Field in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. A paid attendance of 10,418 set a new NightBEAT record in 2017.\n\nRevenue from NightBEAT is one of Crown's largest funding sources.\n\n'''CrownBEAT'''\n\nFirst starting in 2012, CrownBEAT has been a new edition to the Crown-hosted events in the DCI season. Crown took first in the inaugural season of CrownBEAT, scoring a 74.90.\n\nCrownBEAT was then discontinued from 2013 to 2015 until returning to the regular season in 2016. Though the Crown organization ran this competition, Crown did not compete, as they were in the mid-west at the time. However, in 2017, Crown performed at CrownBEAT and took first with a 79.2.\n\nSince 2016, CrownBEAT has been held at River Bluff High School in Lexington, SC.\n\nRecently, revenue from CrownBEAT has been growing over the past three years that it has occurred. This competition is a must-go for any DCI fans in the Midlands of South Carolina.\n\n'''Age-out crowns for guard'''\n\nThe color guard for Carolina Crown has its own tradition to honor age-outs. At the awards ceremony for the DCI Finals, the guard members who are aging out wear gold crowns so they can stand out and be honored.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.carolinacrown.org Carolina Crown website]\n*[http://www.dci.org Drum Corps International website]\n\n{{DCI Nav}}\n{{DCI Former Classes Champions}}\n{{Drum Corps International World Class Champions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carolina Crown Drum And Bugle Corps}}\n[[Category:Drum and bugle corps]]\n[[Category:DCI World Class corps]]\n[[Category:Fort Mill, South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox drums corps\n| name= Carolina Crown<br />Drum and Bugle Corps\n| logo= Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps.png\n| logo_size      = 240px\n| location=[[Fort Mill, South Carolina]], United States\n| division=World Class\n| founded=1988\n| director=Jim Coates\n| titles=1993 (Div.

After organizing themselves with Bill Loelius as president, Kevin Smith as vice president, and Luanne Bialecki as Secretary-Treasurer, the group hosted two drum corps shows, Southern Gold Classic at [[Davidson College]] and NightBEAT at Charlotte's Memorial Stadium. Southern Gold Classic drew a small audience and lost money. NightBEAT was much better attended, but the group was unable to pay the stadium rental. When NightBEAT Chairperson Doug Madar, Bill Loelius, and Kevin Smith met with Charlotte Parks & Recreation Department Superintendent Marvin Billups to discuss working out some sort of payment schedule, they were surprised when Billups not only wrote off the bill for the 1988 NightBEAT but offered the Department's sponsorship for future shows. In 1989, a gift of $1000 was offered by the Queen City [[Optimist International|Optimists]] with the proviso that the organization start a performance group; after discussions initially centered on starting a drumline, Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps was born.<ref name=\"crown\">{{Cite web |url=http://carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=83&Itemid=96# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823050834/http://carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=83&Itemid=96# |archive-date=2008-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"reps\">[http://www.corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=43&corpstype=Junior corpsreps.com - The Drum Corps Repertoire Database<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"hist\">A History of Drum & Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; Drum Corps World, 2003</ref>\n\nAfter the corps bought a complete set of drums from a defunct drum and bugle corps only to discover that they were seriously damaged, John Cummings of [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig Drums]] offered to repair the drums as part of an informal sponsorship of the corps. The name Carolina Crown was adopted to recognize the groups' desire to represent the Carolinas region while still recognizing Charlotte, the Queen City, which has a crown in its logo. The leadership group met, in the fall of 1989, with several young band directors who were also alumni of Suncoast Sound, [[Spirit Drum and Bugle Corps|Spirit of Atlanta]], and the [[Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps|Madison Scouts]] drum and bugle corps to tell them of their efforts to start a new local corps. From this group, Don Taylor, Cecil Adderley, Bill Register, and Van Mathews volunteered to be the corps' first instructors. After locating and purchasing the horns of the defunct California Dons, Carolina Crown began recruiting members. The corps also formed a partnership with the Mecklenburg Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] as Explorer Post #588, which aided them in finding school space for auditions and practices.<ref name=\"crown\"/><ref name=\"reps\"/><ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\nIn 1990, fielding a corps of only sixty-one members, Carolina Crown elected to compete in the Open Class (now known as World Class) in DCI. However, not only was the corps out-classed by the other, larger corps in Open Class, but it was also bested in DCI prelims by seven corps that had advanced from Classes A and A60, finishing thirty-third of 33 corps at their first DCI World Championships in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fromthepressbox.com/19900815div1prelims.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023175801/http://www.fromthepressbox.com/19900815div1prelims.htm# |archive-date=2014-10-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1991, the corps dropped down to Class A. At the DCI Championships in [[Dallas]], Carolina Crown finished in second place in Class A and advanced to Open Class prelims, where they placed twenty-fifth, earning DCI Associate membership. Carolina Crown was third in the 1992 Division II championship in [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]], once more finishing in twenty-fifth place in Division I (which had been renamed from Open Class) prelims in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. At the 1993 DCI Championships in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], Carolina Crown won the Division II Championship title and finished in twenty-first place in Division I prelims.<ref name=\"crown\"/><ref name=\"reps\"/><ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\nAfter winning Division II in 1993, Carolina Crown opted to compete exclusively in Division I in 1994.

In 1995, in only its sixth season, Carolina Crown earned a spot as one of DCI's Top Twelve Finalists, taking eleventh place in quarterfinals and holding that position through Finals. Since that first Finals appearance, Carolina Crown has failed to make DCI Finals only once (2002), finishing in fourth place in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2018, and 2019, third place in 2016 and 2017, second place in 2009, 2012 and 2015, and winning the World Class DCI World Championship in 2013.<ref name=\"dci.org\">[http://www.dci.org/news/view.cfm?news_id=49f8a973-d562-4c9c-b14a-16d4f3866e41 DCI.org News: A New Champion is 'Crowned'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In recent years, Crown has become renowned for its hornline, consistently one of DCI's best.

The corps would win the award again in 2016, 2017, and 2019.\n\nIn 1995, the corps moved from Charlotte to [[Belmont, North Carolina]]. Following the 1997 season, the corps relocated to its present home of [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]].<ref name=\"crown\" /><ref name=\"reps\" /><ref name=\"hist\" />\n\n==Sponsorship==\nCarolina Crown, Inc. is a [[501(c)(3)]] musical organization that has a board of directors, corps director, and staff assigned to carry out the organization's mission.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=441# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425222945/http://carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=441# |archive-date=2012-04-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jim Coates is the corps director.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_contact&view=category&catid=12&Itemid=443# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425222744/http://carolinacrown.org/web/index.php?option=com_contact&view=category&catid=12&Itemid=443# |archive-date=2012-04-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Show summary (1990\u20132020) ==\n''Source:''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corpsreps.com/dcx/index.cfm?view=corpslist&Corpsid=43 |title=Carolina Crown/Repertoire |publisher=DCX: The Drum Corps Xperience |accessdate=1 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n''Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width:100%\"\n|-\n!

Carolina Crown has won these caption awards:\n\n'''Jim Ott Best Brass Performance Award'''\n* 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019\n\n'''John Brazale Best Visual Performance Award'''\n* 2012, 2013, 2016\n\n'''Don Angelica Best General Effect Award'''\n* 2013, 2015\n\n'''George Zingali Best Color Guard Award'''\n* 2016\n\nDCI also presents an award to the best drum major, as voted on by the DCI Hall of Fame committee:\n\n'''Jim Jones Leadership Award'''\n* Bob Beasley, 2006\n* Evan VanDoren, 2007\n\n==Traditions==\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}\n'''Corps song'''\n\nCarolina Crown's official corps song is \"[[Carolina in My Mind]]\" written by North Carolina native James Taylor and originally arranged by former corps faculty member Marty McCartt and re-arranged by Andre Feagin. The current arrangement is by longtime Crown Brass Arranger Micheal Klesch. The lyrics were adjusted for the corps by guard member Adele Honrath (n\u00e9e Williamson) in 2001. The corps sings in harmony before entering the field before each performance. All Crown alumni are welcomed to sing this with the corps.\n\nThe adjusted lyrics are: \"In my mind, I'm going to Carolina can't you see the sunshine, this feeling lasts for a lifetime, something that I have come to find, I'll never leave behind, yes I'm going to Carolina in my mind.\"\n\n'''Theme from ''Band of Brothers'''''\n\nIn addition to the corps song, the hornline also sings and performs the theme from the HBO miniseries ''Band of Brothers'' (composed by Michael Kamen and arranged by Michael Klesch) as a theme of brotherhood within the hornline. They sing it after all rehearsals and perform it on their instruments during encores. The hornline never sings it publicly, but only in a close huddle after rehearsals.\n\n'''Bead necklace and age-out crown'''\n\nThe tradition of the bead necklace was started in 1998. Members receive a bead for every year that they march. The beads are specific to each year, and the shape, color and material of the beads based on the theme of that year's field production. For instance, bead given in 2009 was green, as the show was entitled \"The Grass is Always Greener\".\n\nThe bead is usually given to members on the last day of spring training, often the day of the corp's annual preview show. It serves as a formal induction into the corps for that year's new (\"rookie\") members. The spirit of this tradition holds that the members have completed the most difficult and grueling part of the season (spring training), and are now full members of the family. Members are free to personalize their necklace as they see fit.\n\nUpon aging out, members will be awarded a silver crown pendant to add to their bead necklace. This is presented to the age-out members at the corps annual awards banquet.\n\n'''Corps picture \"crown\"'''\n\nSince 1990, the corps has always formed the trademark crown logo while having its group picture taken at DCI Championships. Usually, the drum major forms the very tip at the top of the crown. In addition, the bass drum section has often made it a tradition to have their eyes looking off to one side as the picture is snapped.\n\n'''Age-out dinner'''\n\nEvery year, the corps recognizes the age outs from the current year with a formal dinner held during finals week. Age-outs are given an opportunity to speak and are awarded their age-out crown pendants at this time. In 2007, the decision was made to combine the age-out dinner with the corps awards banquet, which had traditionally been held the December following the summer. In 2009, another change was added as the corps held the age-out dinner in the afternoon of the day after Finals. This was the first time in the corps' 20-year history that it did not depart the Finals city immediately after the Saturday Night Finals show.\n\n'''NightBEAT'''\n\nFrom 1988 to 2008, Carolina Crown hosted \"NightBEAT\" at American Legion Memorial Stadium in Downtown Charlotte. This show is considered to be the premier non-regional DCI show in the country.\n\nFrom 2009-2011, NightBEAT was moved to Rock Hill's District III Stadium. While this is a smaller venue than Memorial Stadium (about 4100 seats vs. 7000-8000 for ALMS), the move was necessary as the City of Charlotte was forced to temporarily close ALMS due to a part of the concrete stands collapsing.\n\nIn 2012, NightBEAT returned to ALMS when the stadium repairs were completed. Its return was a great success, with a nearly sold-out crowd, and the Carolina Crown missed defeating the Blue Devils by 0.2 points.\n\nNightBEAT was again held at ALMS in 2013, with the largest crowd in NightBEAT history; nearly 7,500 spectators. Again Carolina Crown narrowly missed defeating the Blue Devils by 0.05 points.\n\nIn 2015, 2016, and 2017, NightBEAT was held at Wake Forest University's BB&T Field in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. A paid attendance of 10,418 set a new NightBEAT record in 2017.\n\nRevenue from NightBEAT is one of Crown's largest funding sources.\n\n'''CrownBEAT'''\n\nFirst starting in 2012, CrownBEAT has been a new edition to the Crown-hosted events in the DCI season. Crown took first in the inaugural season of CrownBEAT, scoring a 74.90.\n\nCrownBEAT was then discontinued from 2013 to 2015 until returning to the regular season in 2016. Though the Crown organization ran this competition, Crown did not compete, as they were in the mid-west at the time. However, in 2017, Crown performed at CrownBEAT and took first with a 79.2.\n\nSince 2016, CrownBEAT has been held at River Bluff High School in Lexington, SC.\n\nRecently, revenue from CrownBEAT has been growing over the past three years that it has occurred. This competition is a must-go for any DCI fans in the Midlands of South Carolina.\n\n'''Age-out crowns for guard'''\n\nThe color guard for Carolina Crown has its own tradition to honor age-outs. At the awards ceremony for the DCI Finals, the guard members who are aging out wear gold crowns so they can stand out and be honored.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.carolinacrown.org Carolina Crown website]\n*[http://www.dci.org Drum Corps International website]\n\n{{DCI Nav}}\n{{DCI Former Classes Champions}}\n{{Drum Corps International World Class Champions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carolina Crown Drum And Bugle Corps}}\n[[Category:Drum and bugle corps]]\n[[Category:DCI World Class corps]]\n[[Category:Fort Mill, South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "Sschiera", "label": "safe", "comment": "Capitalized all letters of \"COVID\" in COVID-19", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Crown_Drum_and_Bugle_Corps"}
