He said that \"It is for the court to accept or reject or ask for further investigation by CBI. Let us wait for the court decision\".

Historians believe that the town was originally part of a larger settlement, but later it split and Kaltin\u0117nai became a separate region.\n\nKaltin\u0117nai was first mentioned in a German chronicle as ''terram Kalctene'' in 1371. Northern Crusaders tried to conquer Kaltin\u0117nai castle many times (in 1375, 1377 and 1389, also planned from 1386&ndash;1394), but local inhabitants repelled the attacks.\n\nAt the end of the 14th century and beginning of the 15th Kaltin\u0117nai was one of 6\u20137 of the most important centres in [[\u017demaitija]]. Signatures of noblemen from Kaltin\u0117nai can be found on important documents. The town was so important that [[Vytautas the Great]] ordered one of the first [[Catholic church]]es in \u017demaitija built in Kaltin\u0117nai (the local population didn't convert to Christianity until 1413) and it was complete by 1421. The See of \u017demaitija was founded in 1417 and it ruled the town for more than 400 years.\n\nKaltin\u0117nai the town was established in 1524. It first appeared on a Polish map two years later, earlier than most of the surrounding towns.\n\nThere were more than 70 farms in Kaltin\u0117nai as of 1638, but by 1668 only 50 remained. After the [[Great Northern War]] the town continued to decline, for example in 1773 there were only 15 farms that could pay a tax, 19 in 1778.\n\nIn 1842 authorities of the Russian [[tsar]] brought the ecclesiastical lands under their control and in 1861 made Kaltin\u0117nai the [[volost]] centre. In 1901 a local teacher O. Skobinas published the book ''Kaltin\u0117nai town'' in which he described contemporary town life. He wrote that a post office opened in 1861, a paramedic centre in 1882, a savings bank in 1897, and a chemist in 1898. Small markets took place every Wednesday, and large ones six times a year. 10 shops, several tearoom-canteens, and 17 craftsmen (seven tailors, five shoemakers, two blacksmiths, two glaziers and a woodworker) also worked in the town. 430 people lived in Kaltin\u0117nai at that time&mdash;263 Catholics, 140 Jews, 15 Orthodox and 12 Evangelical Lutherans. Skobinas also mentions that many people had left the area for America to look for a better life.\n\nKaltin\u0117nai inhabitants were very active in the 1905 [[Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution]] and the town also remained volost centre after the declaration of the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Lithuania Independence Act]] in 1918. The town grew from 660 inhabitants in 1923 to 800 in 1939. Various shops were open in the town during that period, and there was a very active cultural life.\n\nThe [[German Occupation]] reached Kaltin\u0117nai in June 1941. German soldiers and Lithuanians transferred all Jewish men aged 15 and older, along with those from nearby towns, to the Heydekrug (Silute) work camp. All the Jewish men of Kaltin\u0117nai were killed before troops arrived to liberate the region&mdash;one group of weak and elderly men in August 1941, another group in October and November, about 100 men in 1943 when they were transferred from Heydekrug to Auschwitz, some in a Warsaw typhus epidemic after Auschwitz, and the rest in Dachau in 1944.  The Jewish women and children were made to do agricultural work, then in September 1941 they were shot en masse in [[T\u016bbin\u0117s]] forest about seven kilometres ({{convert|7|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from Kaltin\u0117nai and buried in mass graves that eventually held 1200 people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosin|first=Josef|title=Protecting Our Litvak Heritage: A History of 50 Jewish Communities in Lithuania|year=2009|publisher=Friends of the Yurburg Jewish Cemetery|pages=62&ndash;66}}</ref>\n\nA Lithuanian Underground Representatives\u2019 Congress gathered in Kaltin\u0117nai on 5 September 1944. Its goal was to unite all patriotic organisations into one central resistance group. Although seven representatives were caught in an accident caused by Soviet reconnaissance, and German occupation authorities also sent their representative to the Congress, the Congress was nonetheless very important because the Lithuanian Army for Freedom came out of it as the main organiser of resistance.\n\nOn 7 October 1944 Kaltin\u0117nai was occupied by the [[Red Army|soviet army]] and the second [[Soviet Occupation]] began. Although this was one of the most difficult times in Lithuanian history, Kaltin\u0117nai retained considerable significance as the centre of the precinct, [[kolkhoz]] and [[parish]]. The population declined sharply after World War II, but it began to climb again some years later.\n\nSince [[Lithuania]] gained independence in 1990, Kaltin\u0117nai has continued to honour its traditions. The town remains the centre of the [[Elderships of Lithuania|eldership]], which contains 74 settlements.\n\n== Kaltin\u0117nai Aleksandras Stulginskis Gymnasium ==\n\n[[File:Kaltinenai school.JPG|thumb|right|Kaltin\u0117nai Aleksandras Stulginskis Gymnasium]]\nA parish school was founded in Kaltin\u0117nai in 1777. This was later divided into four departments of [[Primary education|primary school]]. In 1944 a pro-gymnasium was founded and after five years it was reorganised into a school with seven forms. In 1951 this school became the [[High school|secondary school]], and in 1969 a new school building was constructed.\n\nSince 1992 the school has participated in a foreign exchange program with the German [[Hankensb\u00fcttel]] Gymnasium.\n\nOn 20 December 1999 the school was named Aleksandras Stulginskis Secondary School, and on 29 January 2009 the school became a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]].\n\nThe school now has both primary and secondary divisions, as well as some divisions in nearby villages. The primary school is housed in the former hostel, with four years of study and a kindergarten.\n\nThe secondary school is housed in a two-story building with six forms, two optional higher forms, administrative offices, a canteen, a library, two gyms and an Aleksandras Stulginskis museum.  There are over 500 students and over 50 teachers.\n\nIn 2006 the school won a grant to improve its energy use and was renovated.\n\n== The Church ==\n\n[[File:Kaltinenai church.JPG|thumb|right|St. John the Baptist church]]\nSince [[Vytautas the Great]] built the first wooden church in 1416, there have been about six wooden churches in Kaltin\u0117nai. Some of these churches burned down and others simply collapsed.\n \nThe second-most recent church was built in 1896 and burned down in 1988. Only a traditional masonry stone fence, its gate and a wooden belfry remain. After the belfry was rearranged into a temporary chapel it lost the original form somewhat.\n\nThe current church, known as the church of [[St. John the Baptist]], was designed by an architect Regimantas Andriu\u0161kevi\u010dius and completed in 1995. It is a modern sacred architecture building with two {{convert|40|m|2|abbr=on}} high triangular towers and a {{convert|4.5|m|2|abbr=on}} high white marble and bronze sculpture of The Risen Christ by A. Vaura. V. \u0160vanys created stained glass windows for the basement chambers of the church.\n\n== The Graveyard ==\n\n[[File:Kaltinenai chapel.JPG|thumb|right|The chapel]]\nThe parish graveyard is on the west side of the town. There is an octagonal wooden folk architecture chapel on the hill, built in 1798 and restored in 1989. There are also many saints\u2019 sculptures on the same hill.\n\nThe chapel is surrounded by many very old, historical and artistic graves around the chapel, marked with metallic crosses and other gravestones.  A high stone obelisk for [[Dionizas Po\u0161ka]] stands near the chapel. Po\u0161ka was a great poet and founder of the ''[[Baubliai]]'' museum, the first history museum in Lithuania. Marijona Stulginskien\u0117 ([[Aleksandras Stulginskis]]'s mother) is buried on the southeast side of the graveyard hill.\n\n== The Pil\u0117s mound (Kepalu\u0161kalnis) ==\n\n[[File:Kepaluskalnis.JPG|thumb|right|The Pil\u0117s mound]]\nThe Pil\u0117s mound (or Kepalu\u0161kalnis) is one of the most valuable cultural monuments in the \u0160ilal\u0117 region.\n\nIts hillsides stand at {{convert|20|m|2|abbr=on}} high, and the upper part of the mound is about {{convert|2250|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}}. Its sides were originally surrounded by defence ramparts that are now flat, but the location of two ramparts is still visible, as are three defence ditches.\n\nBased on the size of the mound and the dimensions of its fortifications, one of the strongest castles in \u017demaitija stood on the Pil\u0117s Mound during the war with the Crusaders.  There have also been various archaeological finds on the mound, such as stone shells.\n\n== The Rehabilitation Centre ==\n\nThe Rehabilitation Centre of Kaltin\u0117nai stands near the church. It was built by local priest [[Petras Linkevi\u010dius]].\n\nThe Centre offers a [[swimming pool]], salt and herb baths, underwater massage and a comfortable training-hall.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Taurage County}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kaltinenai}}\n[[Category:Towns in Lithuania]]\n[[Category:Towns in Taurag\u0117 County]]\n[[Category:Rossiyensky Uyezd]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Lithuania]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{POV check|date=May 2012}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement <!-- more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement -->\n| name = Kaltin\u0117nai\n| image_skyline = Panorama of Kaltin\u0117nai, Lithuania.jpg\n| image_shield = Kaltinenuherbas.png\n| settlement_type = Town\n| pushpin_map = Lithuania \u0160ilal\u0117 District Municipality\n| pushpin_image = Kaltinenu seniunija (Silales rajono zemelapis).png\n| pushpin_label_position = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location in \u0160ilal\u0117 district municipality{{hidden begin|title=Location of \u0160ilal\u0117 district in Lithuania}}[[File:Silale district location.png|220px|center]]{{hidden end}}\n| coordinates       = {{coord|55|34|00|N|22|27|00|E|region:LT|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n| subdivision_name = {{LTU}}\n| subdivision_type1 = [[Regions of Lithuania|Ethnographic&nbsp;region]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Samogitia]]\n| subdivision_type2 = [[Counties of Lithuania|County]]\n| subdivision_name2 = [[Taurag\u0117 County|Taurag\u0117]]\n| subdivision_type3 = [[List of municipalities of Lithuania|Municipality]]\n| subdivision_name3 = [[\u0160ilal\u0117 district municipality|\u0160ilal\u0117]]\n| subdivision_type4 = [[Elderships of Lithuania|Eldership]]\n| subdivision_name4 = Kaltin\u0117n\u0173\n| subdivision_type6 = [[Capital (political)|Capital of]]\n| subdivision_name6 = Kaltin\u0117n\u0173 eldership\n| established_date = 1370\n| established_title = First mentioned\n| established_date2 =\n| established_title2 =\n| area_total_km2 =\n| elevation_m =\n| population_total = 728\n| population_as_of = 2011\n| timezone = [[Eastern European Time|EET]]\n| utc_offset = +2\n| timezone_DST = [[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST = +3\n}}\n\n'''Kaltin\u0117nai''' ([[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian]]: ''Kaltinien\u0101'', {{lang-pl|Ko\u0142tyniany}}) is a small town in the west of [[Lithuania]], located near \u017demai\u010di\u0173 highway in [[\u0160ilal\u0117 district municipality]], [[Taurag\u0117 County]].

Historians believe that the town was originally part of a larger settlement, but later it split and Kaltin\u0117nai became a separate region.\n\nKaltin\u0117nai was first mentioned in a German chronicle as ''terram Kalctene'' in 1371. Northern Crusaders tried to conquer Kaltin\u0117nai castle many times (in 1375, 1377 and 1389, also planned from 1386&ndash;1394), but local inhabitants repelled the attacks.\n\nAt the end of the 14th century and beginning of the 15th Kaltin\u0117nai was one of 6\u20137 of the most important centres in [[\u017demaitija]]. Signatures of noblemen from Kaltin\u0117nai can be found on important documents. The town was so important that [[Vytautas the Great]] ordered one of the first [[Catholic church]]es in \u017demaitija built in Kaltin\u0117nai (the local population didn't convert to Christianity until 1413) and it was complete by 1421. The See of \u017demaitija was founded in 1417 and it ruled the town for more than 400 years.\n\nKaltin\u0117nai the town was established in 1524. It first appeared on a Polish map two years later, earlier than most of the surrounding towns.\n\nThere were more than 70 farms in Kaltin\u0117nai as of 1638, but by 1668 only 50 remained. After the [[Great Northern War]] the town continued to decline, for example in 1773 there were only 15 farms that could pay a tax, 19 in 1778.\n\nIn 1842 authorities of the Russian [[tsar]] brought the ecclesiastical lands under their control and in 1861 made Kaltin\u0117nai the [[volost]] centre. In 1901 a local teacher O. Skobinas published the book ''Kaltin\u0117nai town'' in which he described contemporary town life. He wrote that a post office opened in 1861, a paramedic centre in 1882, a savings bank in 1897, and a chemist in 1898. Small markets took place every Wednesday, and large ones six times a year. 10 shops, several tearoom-canteens, and 17 craftsmen (seven tailors, five shoemakers, two blacksmiths, two glaziers and a woodworker) also worked in the town. 430 people lived in Kaltin\u0117nai at that time&mdash;263 Catholics, 140 Jews, 15 Orthodox and 12 Evangelical Lutherans. Skobinas also mentions that many people had left the area for America to look for a better life.\n\nKaltin\u0117nai inhabitants were very active in the 1905 [[Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution]] and the town also remained volost centre after the declaration of the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Lithuania Independence Act]] in 1918. The town grew from 660 inhabitants in 1923 to 800 in 1939. Various shops were open in the town during that period, and there was a very active cultural life.\n\nThe [[German Occupation]] reached Kaltin\u0117nai in June 1941. German soldiers and Lithuanians transferred all Jewish men aged 15 and older, along with those from nearby towns, to the Heydekrug (Silute) work camp.

A sister facility, known as the [[National Archives at College Park]] (\"Archives II\") was opened 1994 near the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].  The [[Washington National Records Center]] (WNRC), also located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, is a large warehouse facility where federal records that are still under the control of the creating agency are stored.  Federal government agencies pay a yearly fee for storage at the facility. In accordance with federal records schedules, documents at WNRC are transferred to the legal custody of the National Archives after a certain time; this usually involves a relocation of the records to College Park. Temporary records at WNRC are either retained for a fee or destroyed after retention times have elapsed.  WNRC also offers research services and maintains a small research room.\n\nAcross the United States, the National Archives maintains both research facilities and additional federal records centers (FRCs). In many cases, the research rooms of regional archives are located at the same site as the federal records center, which are inaccessible to the public.\n\nIn April 2019 an unknown person set fire to an exterior wall of the archives building using a homemade incendiary device before firefighters were able to extinguish the flames.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/authorities-are-looking-suspect-who-started-fire-national-archives-180972056/|title=Authorities Are Looking for the Suspect Who Started a Fire at the National Archives|last=Katz|first=Brigit|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===Public\u2013private partnerships===\nIn an effort to make its holdings more widely available and more easily accessible, the National Archives began entering into public\u2013private partnerships in 2006.

NARA's mission also includes resolving FOIA disputes between Federal agencies and requesters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ArchivesRotunda.jpg|thumb|right|The Rotunda of the [[National Archives Building]], where the [[Charters of Freedom]] documents are publicly exhibited]]\n\nOriginally, each branch and agency of the U.S. government was responsible for maintaining its own documents, which often resulted in the loss and destruction of records. [[United States Congress|Congress]] created the National Archives Establishment in 1934 to centralize federal record keeping, with the [[Archivist of the United States]] serving as chief administrator. [[R.D.W. Connor]] was chosen to be the first leader of the organization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Quigley|first=Sarah|date=2007|title=Cultural Record Keepers|doi=10.1353/lac.2007.0017|journal=Libraries & the Cultural Record|volume=42|pages=81}}</ref>\n\nAfter a recommendation by the first [[Hoover Commission]] in 1949, the National Archives was placed within the newly formed [[General Services Administration]] (GSA). NARA was officially given its independence from the GSA with the passing of the Records Administration Act of 1984, thus giving birth to the institution we have today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bradsher|first=G|date=2015|title=National Archives Independence 30 Years Ago|url=|journal=Federalist (Society for History in the Federal Government)|volume=45|pages=4-5|via=EBSCOHost}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1978, millions of feet of news reels were destroyed in a fire at an offsite location in Suitland, Maryland.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/forty-years-ago-126-million-feet-history-went-smoke-180970977/|title=Forty Years Ago, 12.6 Million Feet of History Went Up in Smoke|last=Daley|first=Jason|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> The reels, made of exceptionally flammable nitrate material, had been donated previously by Universal Pictures and were stored in special vaults to protect against fires.

A sister facility, known as the [[National Archives at College Park]] (\"Archives II\") was opened 1994 near the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].  The [[Washington National Records Center]] (WNRC), also located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, is a large warehouse facility where federal records that are still under the control of the creating agency are stored.  Federal government agencies pay a yearly fee for storage at the facility. In accordance with federal records schedules, documents at WNRC are transferred to the legal custody of the National Archives after a certain time; this usually involves a relocation of the records to College Park. Temporary records at WNRC are either retained for a fee or destroyed after retention times have elapsed.  WNRC also offers research services and maintains a small research room.\n\nAcross the United States, the National Archives maintains both research facilities and additional federal records centers (FRCs). In many cases, the research rooms of regional archives are located at the same site as the federal records center, which are inaccessible to the public.\n\nIn April 2019 an unknown person set fire to an exterior wall of the archives building using a homemade incendiary device before firefighters were able to extinguish the flames.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/authorities-are-looking-suspect-who-started-fire-national-archives-180972056/|title=Authorities Are Looking for the Suspect Who Started a Fire at the National Archives|last=Katz|first=Brigit|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===Public\u2013private partnerships===\nIn an effort to make its holdings more widely available and more easily accessible, the National Archives began entering into public\u2013private partnerships in 2006.
