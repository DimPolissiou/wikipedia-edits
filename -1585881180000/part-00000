Major themes of his poetry are nature, family, grief over the loss of loved ones, and the ideas of peace, humanity and mutual respect between individuals and nations. His basic mood is warm, melancholic, reserved and unpretentious. He was a champion of disciplined, tight forms; his style embodied elegance, taste and refinement. From 1921 to 1965 he published several collections of poems and translations from French and Russian; he also wrote verse dramas, translating [[Aleksander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and other works.\n\n==Biography==\nLajos \u00c1prily's original name was Lajos J\u00e9kely. He attended elementary and secondary school in Parajd (now [[Praid|Praid, Romania]]) and Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely (now [[Odorheiu Secuiesc]]), two towns which still have Hungarian-speaking majority populations. From 1899, he studied at the Protestant [[Cluj-Napoca Reformed College|Reformed College]] in Kolozsv\u00e1r (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]). His teachers included famed [[musicology|musicologist]] and [[folklore|folklorist]] [[J\u00e1nos Sepr\u0151di]] (1874\u20131923) and Hungarian writer and editor [[Dezs\u0151 Kov\u00e1cs]] (1866\u20131935). To this day Cluj retains a sizable ethnic Hungarian minority population.\n\nIn 1909 J\u00e9kely earned his teacher's degree and became instructor of [[German language|German]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] language and literature at ''Bethlen G\u00e1bor Koll\u00e9gium'' in Nagyenyed (Colegiul Na\u021bional Bethlen, [[Aiud|Aiud, Romania]]). In 1911 he married Ida Sch\u00e9fer; in 1913, whilst they were still living in Nagyenyed, their eldest son, the poet, writer and translator Zolt\u00e1n J\u00e9kely, was born.\n\nAfter Kov\u00e1cs had reprimanded him over the supposed \"modern tone\" of some of his poems, J\u00e9kely refrained from publishing for several years. In 1918, however, he began using the pen name Lajos \u00c1prily for his writings in the magazine ''Uj Erd\u00e9ly'' (\"New Transylvania\"). He soon became a member of three literary societies, ''Erd\u00e9lyi Irodalmi T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g'', ''[[Kisfaludy Society|Kisfaludy T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g]]'' and ''[[Zsigmond Kem\u00e9ny|Kem\u00e9ny Zsigmond T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g]]''. By 1923 he had earned a degree in [[French language]] at the [[University of Burgundy]] in [[Dijon]].\n\nIn 1926 he and his family returned to Cluj, the same town where he had studied from the age of 12, when it had been known as Kolozsv\u00e1r. Here he taught languages and literature at the Reformed College. In 1928 he became editor of ''Erd\u00e9lyi Helikon''.\n\nIn 1929 the family moved from [[Romania]] to [[Budapest]], where in 1934 the poet was named as director of [[Ba\u00e1r\u2013Madas Reform\u00e1tus Gimn\u00e1zium|Ba\u00e1r-Madas]], at that time a boarding school for girls. One of his pupils there was the polyglot poet and translator [[\u00c1gnes Nemes Nagy]] (1922-1991). In the fall of 1935 he began a half-year study tour in northern and western Europe. In 1942 the family moved back to [[Praid]] in [[Transylvania]] for a short time, before they resettled in 1943 to Szentgy\u00f6rgypuszta, a farm near [[Visegr\u00e1d]].\n\n==Works==\n* 1921: ''Falusi el\u00e9gia'' (\"Rural elegy\"), poems\n* 1923: ''Esti p\u00e1rbesz\u00e9d'' (\"Evening dialogues\"), poems\n* 1926: ''Rasmussen haj\u00f3j\u00e1n'' (\"Rasmussen's ship\"), poems\n* 1926: ''Vers vagy te is'', poems\n* 1926: ''Idahegyi p\u00e1sztorok'', verse drama\n* 1934: ''R\u00f6nk a Tisz\u00e1n'', poems\n* 1934: ''\u00dati jegyzetek.

It describes its aim as the \"furtherance of interest and knowledge in the art, science and literature of the defence services\".\n\nUSI operates centres for research in various areas of national security. The USI Journal, published quarterly since 1872, is the oldest defence journal in [[Asia]]. It also publishes a number of [[monograph]]s based on research and study by its members.\n\n==History==\nThe United Service Institution was established in 1870 by [[Charles MacGregor|Major General Sir Charles MacGregor]] in [[Shimla]]. It was founded as a society in the ''furtherance of interest and knowledge in the art, science and literature of the Defence Services''. The institute was initially housed in the Old Town Hall, and later received temporary accommodation in the Indian Army Headquarters, which was also then based in Shimla.\n\nIn 1908, the institute acquired its own premises near the Cumbermere Post Office in Shimla Hills. Among the distinguished officers who have served as its Secretary, was [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Field Marshal William Joseph Slim]] in the 1930s.\n\nAfter [[independence of India|independence]] and the subsequent [[partition of India]], the institute attempted to continue as a joint institution for both countries as the ''United Service Institution of India and Pakistan''. The four 1948 issues of the institute's journal were published jointly. However, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]], cross-border relations were interrupted and the institute has since been known as the ''United Service Institution of India''.\n\nFollowing independence, the institute went through financially testing times.

It describes its aim as the \"furtherance of interest and knowledge in the art, science and literature of the defence services\".\n\nUSI operates centres for research in various areas of national security. The USI Journal, published quarterly since 1872, is the oldest defence journal in [[Asia]]. It also publishes a number of [[monograph]]s based on research and study by its members.\n\n==History==\nThe United Service Institution was established in 1870 by [[Charles MacGregor|Major General Sir Charles MacGregor]] in [[Shimla]]. It was founded as a society in the ''furtherance of interest and knowledge in the art, science and literature of the Defence Services''. The institute was initially housed in the Old Town Hall, and later received temporary accommodation in the Indian Army Headquarters, which was also then based in Shimla.\n\nIn 1908, the institute acquired its own premises near the Cumbermere Post Office in Shimla Hills. Among the distinguished officers who have served as its Secretary, was [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Field Marshal William Joseph Slim]] in the 1930s.\n\nAfter [[independence of India|independence]] and the subsequent [[partition of India]], the institute attempted to continue as a joint institution for both countries as the ''United Service Institution of India and Pakistan''. The four 1948 issues of the institute's journal were published jointly. However, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]], cross-border relations were interrupted and the institute has since been known as the ''United Service Institution of India''.\n\nFollowing independence, the institute went through financially testing times. It had to sell its Shimla headquarters. In 1953, the institute relocated to New Delhi. The institute survived primarily due to the efforts of Colonel (Retd.) Pyara Lal, its Secretary from 1957 to 1987. The institute operated in New Delhi from [[Kashmir House]] until 1996. The foundation stone for its current headquarters in [[Vasant Vihar]], New Delhi, was laid on 26 April 1993, and the institute was relocated in 1996.<ref name=usi-history>{{cite web|url=http://www.usiofindia.org/About/History/|title=USI History|publisher=United Service Institution of India|accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nUSI operates two centres of research and one centre for coaching predominantly Indian Army and limited Indian Naval officers for Professional Military Education exams.\n\n===Centre for Strategic Studies and Simulation===\nThe Centre for Strategic Studies and Simulation (CS3) is focused on conducting research and analyses on national and international security issues.

He was among the first genuine working-class writers in [[Hungarian literature]]. Self-taught, he became a writer within the socialist movement and published journals important to the radical intellectual culture of Budapest in the early 1900s.\n\nAlthough he cannot be fully identified with any single avant-garde movement, he adopted elements of [[expressionism]], [[futurism]] and [[dadaism]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nLajos Kass\u00e1k was born in \u00c9rsek\u00fajv\u00e1r, [[Austria-Hungary]] (present-day [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky]], [[Slovakia]]).  His father was an apothecary assistant and his mother a laundress. Although his parents wanted him to attend higher education, he decided to quit his studies and started work as a locksmith assistant, gaining a letter of indenture as an [[apprentice]]. His sister was [[Erzsi \u00dajv\u00e1ri]] who went on to marry [[S\u00e1ndor Barta]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1904 Kass\u00e1k moved to [[Budapest]], where he worked in a factory on the outskirts of the city. He participated in the labor union movement, and organized several strikes. In 1905 he was fired several times for organizing strikes.\n\nIn 1907 he left for [[Paris]] \u2013 on foot and without any money; the city was attracting artists and intellectuals from throughout eastern Europe. He was expelled to Hungary in 1910. The experiences of this journey were later covered in his autobiography entitled ''Egy ember \u00e9lete'' ''(A Man's Life)''.\n\nDespite his lack of formal education and inadequate writing skills, Kass\u00e1k fought fiercely to publish his works. His first poem was published in 1908, and his first collections of short stories in 1912, titled ''\u00c9letsirat\u00e1s''. In 1915 he published his first collection of poems, ''\u00c9posz Wagner maszkj\u00e1ban'' ''(Epic in the Mask of Wagner).'' That same year, he launched his first journal, entitled ''A Tett'' ''(The Action)'', which was soon censored and banned for being \"pacifist\". He was part of the intellectual movement that included the group of painters known as [[The Eight (Nyolcak)|The Eight]] whose work he supported in his journals. He started ''Ma'' (Today) in Budapest, and later published it from Vienna.\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919, he became a member of the special Writers Directorate. After fierce debates with the republic's leader, [[B\u00e9la Kun]], he distanced himself from [[Bolshevism]] whilst always remaining a leftist. He never distinguished between being a socially responsible individual and an artist: his art was part of his self-definition as a \"socialist man\".  After the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, he emigrated to Vienna. There he continued publishing his second journal, ''[[MA (journal)|MA]]'' (\"Today\" but also \"Magyar Aktivizmus\"= Hungarian Activism]<ref name=\"MS\">{{cite web |title=MA - Monoskop |url=https://monoskop.org/Ma |website=monoskop.org |publisher=Monoskop |accessdate=27 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref>). He also published an anthology, ''Buch neuer K\u00fcnstler'', a project in which [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]] was to help him by gathering material for him from [[Berlin]].\n\nHowever in May 1922 [[B\u00e9la Uitz]] and [[Alad\u00e1r Komj\u00e1t]] published the first issue of [[Egys\u00e9g]], a rival journal, critical of Kassak.<ref name=\"Botar\">{{cite journal |last1=Botar |first1=Oliver A.

He continued editing and publishing journals such as ''Munka'' ''(Work)'' (1927\u20131938) and ''Dokumentum'' ''(Document)'' (1927), both of which were independent leftist avant-garde journals.\n\nHis autobiography, ''Egy ember \u00e9lete'' ''(A Man's Life)'' was published in sections periodically in the Hungarian literary journal, ''[[Nyugat]],'' between 1923 and 1937. After he published it as a book, he was prosecuted because of its chapters concerning the Hungarian Soviet Republic.\n\nHe regularly published in leftist newspapers. From 1945 to 1947, he edited the journal ''Kort\u00e1rs'' ''(Contemporary),'' which closed when it was banned. In 1947 he returned to political duties, as the communists had taken over the Hungarian government. He was appointed as the head of the Social Democratic Party's Art Commission. In 1948 he became an MP. A year later he had to change seats in the Parliament, and later he had to resign, and finally retire because of the change of the political climate.\n\nIn 1953, Kass\u00e1k criticised the Party's cultural politics, and was expelled from the party. Because of this, he was not allowed to publish for years, until 1956, when he was elected to be a chair in the Writers Association, an influential organization of the era. From 1957 he became practically muted by the cultural censorship of the Party, and for the rest of his life was not allowed to travel, exhibit and publish. However even in his silence, he influenced a large number of artist both in Hungary and internationally. He died in Budapest on July 22, 1967.\n\n== Work ==\nKass\u00e1k is considered to be the main father figure of the literary Hungarian [[Avant-garde]], and one of the first poet/writer/artists from a working-class background.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} His views on historical avant-garde movements influenced the region's perception and artistic production. His journals ''Ma'' (\"Today\") and the ''Tett'' (\"The Deed\") were widely followed. He was heavily influenced by the international [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] movement and issued several manifestos: ''K\u00e9parchitekt\u00fara'' (\"Image Architecture\", 1922), ''Vissza a kaptaf\u00e1hoz'' (\"Back to the Basics\", 1923),  and ''A konstruktivizmusr\u00f3l'' (\"On Constructivism\", 1922).\n\nAs he is associated with more than one style or movement, most art historians refer him as an \"Activist\", a special label issued to express the socially engaged style of his artistic production. Functionality and social effectivity were the main characteristics of his works, which have to be implemented by the modern being in order to create a world of social equality.\n\nHis works include [[concrete poetry]], billboards, design, novels, and paintings, and were influenced by [[Expressionism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] tendencies.\n\n===K\u00e9parchitekt\u00fara===\nK\u00e9parchitekt\u00fara, or Image Architecture was first defined in pamphlet by Kass\u00e1k in late 1921.

His sister was [[Erzsi \u00dajv\u00e1ri]] who went on to marry [[S\u00e1ndor Barta]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1904 Kass\u00e1k moved to [[Budapest]], where he worked in a factory on the outskirts of the city. He participated in the labor union movement, and organized several strikes. In 1905 he was fired several times for organizing strikes.\n\nIn 1907 he left for [[Paris]] \u2013 on foot and without any money; the city was attracting artists and intellectuals from throughout eastern Europe. He was expelled to Hungary in 1910. The experiences of this journey were later covered in his autobiography entitled ''Egy ember \u00e9lete'' ''(A Man's Life)''.\n\nDespite his lack of formal education and inadequate writing skills, Kass\u00e1k fought fiercely to publish his works. His first poem was published in 1908, and his first collections of short stories in 1912, titled ''\u00c9letsirat\u00e1s''. In 1915 he published his first collection of poems, ''\u00c9posz Wagner maszkj\u00e1ban'' ''(Epic in the Mask of Wagner).'' That same year, he launched his first journal, entitled ''A Tett'' ''(The Action)'', which was soon censored and banned for being \"pacifist\". He was part of the intellectual movement that included the group of painters known as [[The Eight (Nyolcak)|The Eight]] whose work he supported in his journals. He started ''Ma'' (Today) in Budapest, and later published it from Vienna.\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919, he became a member of the special Writers Directorate. After fierce debates with the republic's leader, [[B\u00e9la Kun]], he distanced himself from [[Bolshevism]] whilst always remaining a leftist. He never distinguished between being a socially responsible individual and an artist: his art was part of his self-definition as a \"socialist man\".  After the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, he emigrated to Vienna. There he continued publishing his second journal, ''[[MA (journal)|MA]]'' (\"Today\" but also \"Magyar Aktivizmus\"= Hungarian Activism]<ref name=\"MS\">{{cite web |title=MA - Monoskop |url=https://monoskop.org/Ma |website=monoskop.org |publisher=Monoskop |accessdate=27 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref>). He also published an anthology, ''Buch neuer K\u00fcnstler'', a project in which [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]] was to help him by gathering material for him from [[Berlin]].\n\nHowever in May 1922 [[B\u00e9la Uitz]] and [[Alad\u00e1r Komj\u00e1t]] published the first issue of [[Egys\u00e9g]], a rival journal, critical of Kassak.<ref name=\"Botar\">{{cite journal |last1=Botar |first1=Oliver A.

He continued editing and publishing journals such as ''Munka'' ''(Work)'' (1927\u20131938) and ''Dokumentum'' ''(Document)'' (1927), both of which were independent leftist avant-garde journals.\n\nHis autobiography, ''Egy ember \u00e9lete'' ''(A Man's Life)'' was published in sections periodically in the Hungarian literary journal, ''[[Nyugat]],'' between 1923 and 1937. After he published it as a book, he was prosecuted because of its chapters concerning the Hungarian Soviet Republic.\n\nHe regularly published in leftist newspapers. From 1945 to 1947, he edited the journal ''Kort\u00e1rs'' ''(Contemporary),'' which closed when it was banned. In 1947 he returned to political duties, as the communists had taken over the Hungarian government. He was appointed as the head of the Social Democratic Party's Art Commission. In 1948 he became an MP. A year later he had to change seats in the Parliament, and later he had to resign, and finally retire because of the change of the political climate.\n\nIn 1953, Kass\u00e1k criticised the Party's cultural politics, and was expelled from the party. Because of this, he was not allowed to publish for years, until 1956, when he was elected to be a chair in the Writers Association, an influential organization of the era. From 1957 he became practically muted by the cultural censorship of the Party, and for the rest of his life was not allowed to travel, exhibit and publish. However even in his silence, he influenced a large number of artist both in Hungary and internationally. He died in Budapest on July 22, 1967.\n\n== Work ==\nKass\u00e1k is considered to be the main father figure of the literary Hungarian [[Avant-garde]], and one of the first poet/writer/artists from a working-class background.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} His views on historical avant-garde movements influenced the region's perception and artistic production. His journals ''Ma'' (\"Today\") and the ''Tett'' (\"The Deed\") were widely followed. He was heavily influenced by the international [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] movement and issued several manifestos: ''K\u00e9parchitekt\u00fara'' (\"Image Architecture\", 1922), ''Vissza a kaptaf\u00e1hoz'' (\"Back to the Basics\", 1923),  and ''A konstruktivizmusr\u00f3l'' (\"On Constructivism\", 1922).\n\nAs he is associated with more than one style or movement, most art historians refer him as an \"Activist\", a special label issued to express the socially engaged style of his artistic production. Functionality and social effectivity were the main characteristics of his works, which have to be implemented by the modern being in order to create a world of social equality.\n\nHis works include [[concrete poetry]], billboards, design, novels, and paintings, and were influenced by [[Expressionism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] tendencies.\n===K\u00e9parchitekt\u00fara===\nK\u00e9parchitekt\u00fara, or Image Architecture was first defined in pamphlet by Kass\u00e1k in late 1921.

A [[humanism|humanist]], he was a part of the transition between [[transcendentalism]] and [[literary realism|realism]], incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of [[free verse]].<ref name=Reynolds314/> His work was controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', which was described as obscene for its overt sensuality. Whitman's own life came under scrutiny for his presumed homosexuality.\n\nBorn in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]] on [[Long Island]], Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, and a government clerk. At age 11, he left formal schooling to go to work. As a child and through much of his career he resided in [[Brooklyn]]. Whitman's major work, ''Leaves of Grass'', was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American [[epic poetry|epic]]. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. During the [[American Civil War]], he went to Washington, D.C. and worked in hospitals caring for the wounded. His poetry often focused on both loss and healing. Two of his well known poems, \"[[O Captain! My Captain!]]\" and \"[[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd]]\", were written on the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. After a stroke towards the end of his life, Whitman moved to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral was a public event.<ref name=Loving480/><ref name=Reynolds589>Reynolds, 589</ref>\n\nWhitman's influence on poetry remains strong. Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe argued: \"You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without ''Leaves of Grass'' ... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him.\"<ref name=\"Reynolds, 4\">Reynolds, 4</ref> [[Modernism|Modernist]] poet [[Ezra Pound]] called Whitman \"America's poet ...

The second of nine children,<ref>Miller, 17</ref> he was immediately nicknamed \"Walt\" to distinguish him from his father.<ref name=Loving29>Loving, 29</ref> Walter Whitman Sr. named three of his seven sons after American leaders: [[Andrew Jackson]], [[George Washington]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The oldest was named Jesse and another boy died unnamed at the age of six months. The couple's sixth son, the youngest, was named Edward.<ref name=Loving29/> At age four, Whitman moved with his family from West Hills to [[Brooklyn]], living in a series of homes, in part due to bad investments.<ref>Loving, 30</ref> Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status.<ref>Reynolds, 24</ref> One happy moment that he later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] during a celebration in Brooklyn on July 4, 1825.<ref>Reynolds, 33\u201334</ref>\n\nAt age eleven Whitman concluded formal schooling.<ref>Loving, 32</ref> He then sought employment for further income for his family; he was an office boy for two lawyers and later was an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] and [[printer's devil]] for the weekly Long Island newspaper the ''Patriot'', edited by Samuel E. Clements.<ref>Reynolds, 44</ref> There, Whitman learned about the printing press and [[typesetting]].<ref>Kaplan, 74</ref> He may have written \"sentimental bits\" of filler material for occasional issues.<ref>Callow, 30</ref> Clements aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse of the [[Quaker]] minister [[Elias Hicks]] to create a plaster mold of his head.<ref>Callow, 29</ref> Clements left the ''Patriot'' shortly afterward, possibly as a result of the controversy.<ref>Loving, 34</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:Walt Whitman, age 28, 1848.png|thumb|upright|Whitman at age 28]]\nThe following summer Whitman worked for another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn.<ref name=Reynolds45>Reynolds, 45</ref> His family moved back to West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and took a job at the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] weekly newspaper the ''Long-Island Star''.<ref name=Reynolds45/> While at the ''Star'', Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances,<ref>Callow, 32</ref> and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the ''[[New-York Mirror]]''.<ref>Kaplan, 79</ref> At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the ''Star'' and Brooklyn.<ref>Kaplan, 77</ref> He moved to [[New York City]] to work as a [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]]<ref>Callow, 35</ref> though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where.<ref name=Kaplan81>Kaplan, 81</ref> He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district,<ref name=Kaplan81/> and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the [[Panic of 1837]].<ref>Loving, 36</ref> In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]].<ref>Callow, 36</ref> Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.<ref>Loving, 37</ref>\n\nAfter his teaching attempts, Whitman went back to Huntington, New York, to found his own newspaper, the ''[[Long Islander News|Long-Islander]]''. Whitman served as publisher, editor, pressman, and distributor and even provided home delivery. After ten months, he sold the publication to E. O. Crowell, whose first issue appeared on July 12, 1839.<ref name=Reynolds60>Reynolds, 60</ref> There are no known surviving copies of the ''Long-Islander'' published under Whitman.<ref>Loving, 38</ref> By the summer of 1839, he found a job as a typesetter in [[Jamaica, Queens]] with the ''Long Island Democrat'', edited by James J. Brenton.<ref name=Reynolds60/> He left shortly thereafter, and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841.<ref>Kaplan, 93\u201394</ref> One story, possibly apocryphal, tells of Whitman's being chased away from a teaching job in [[Southold, New York]], in 1840. After a local preacher called him a \"[[Sodomy|Sodomite]]\", Whitman was allegedly [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]]. Biographer [[Justin Kaplan]] notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter.<ref>Kaplan, 87</ref> Biographer [[Jerome Loving]] calls the incident a \"myth\".<ref>Loving, 514</ref> During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called \"Sun-Down Papers\u2014From the Desk of a Schoolmaster\", in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841. In these essays, he adopted a constructed persona, a technique he would employ throughout his career.<ref>Stacy, 25</ref>\n\nWhitman moved to New York City in May, initially working a low-level job at the ''New World'', working under [[Park Benjamin Sr.]] and [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]].<ref>Callow, 56</ref> He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the ''[[The New York Aurora|Aurora]]'' and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''.<ref>Stacy, 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Brooklyn Daily Eagle2.jpg|thumb|''Brooklyn Daily Eagle''{{'}}s Washington, D.C. bureau office, c. 1916]]\n\nHe also contributed freelance fiction and poetry throughout the 1840s.<ref>Reynolds, 83\u201384</ref> Whitman lost his position at the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' in 1848 after siding with the free-soil \"[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Barnburner]]\" wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper's owner, Isaac Van Anden, who belonged to the conservative, or \"[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Hunker]]\", wing of the party.<ref>Stacy, 87\u201391</ref> Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the [[Free Soil Party]], which was concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen moving into the newly colonised western territories.

Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref>Callow, 295</ref>\n\nThe Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia,<ref>Loving, 281</ref> and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of [[tuberculosis]] compounded by [[alcoholism]] on December 3.<ref>Kaplan, 293\u2013294</ref> That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum.<ref>Reynolds, 454</ref> Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] in the [[Department of the Interior]], thanks to his friend William Douglas O'Connor.

The fifty-cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet's nickname and increased his popularity.<ref>Reynolds, 456\u2013457</ref> Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of \"[[O Captain! My Captain!]]\", a relatively conventional poem on the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman's lifetime.<ref>Kaplan, 309</ref>\n\nPart of Whitman's role at the Attorney General's office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for Presidential [[pardon]]s. \"There are real characters among them\", he later wrote, \"and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary.\"<ref>Loving, 293</ref> In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher.<ref>Kaplan, 318\u2013319</ref> He hoped it would be its last edition.<ref name=\"Loving, 314\">Loving, 314</ref> In February 1868, ''Poems of Walt Whitman'' was published in England thanks to the influence of [[William Michael Rossetti]],<ref>Callow, 326</ref> with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved.<ref>Kaplan, 324</ref> The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer [[Anne Gilchrist (writer)|Anne Gilchrist]].<ref>Callow, 329</ref> Another edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident.<ref>Loving, 331</ref> As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872.<ref>Reynolds, 464</ref> He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother, who was now nearly eighty and struggling with [[arthritis]].<ref>Kaplan, 340</ref> He also traveled and was invited to [[Dartmouth College]] to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.<ref>Loving, 341</ref>\n\n===Health decline and death===\n[[File:WhitmanHouse-CamdenNJ1.jpg|thumb|left|Whitman spent his last years at his home in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. Today, it is open to the public as the [[Walt Whitman House]].]]\nAfter suffering a paralytic [[stroke]] in early 1873, Whitman was induced to move from Washington to the home of his brother\u2014George Washington Whitman, an engineer\u2014at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey. His mother, having fallen ill, was also there and died that same year in May. Both events were difficult for Whitman and left him depressed. He remained at his brother's home until buying his own in 1884.<ref>Miller, 33</ref> However, before purchasing his home, he spent the greatest period of his residence in Camden at his brother's home in Stevens Street. While in residence there he was very productive, publishing three versions of ''Leaves of Grass'' among other works. He was also last fully physically active in this house, receiving both [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Thomas Eakins]]. His other brother, Edward, an \"invalid\" since birth, lived in the house.\n\nWhen his brother and sister-in-law were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street [[Walt Whitman House|(now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard)]].<ref>Haas, Irvin.

During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis\u2014the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street.<ref>Loving, 432</ref> She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals.<ref>Reynolds, 548</ref> During this time, Whitman produced further editions of ''Leaves of Grass'' in 1876, 1881, and 1889.\n\nWhile in [[Southern New Jersey]], Whitman spent a good portion of his time in the then quite pastoral community of [[Laurel Springs, New Jersey|Laurel Springs]], between 1876 and 1884, converting one of the Stafford Farm buildings to his summer home. The restored summer home has been preserved as a museum by the local historical society. Part of his ''Leaves of Grass'' was written here, and in his ''Specimen Days'' he wrote of the spring, creek and lake. To him, Laurel Lake was \"the prettiest lake in: either America or Europe\".<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://westfieldnj.com/whs/history/Counties/CamdenCounty/laurelsprings.htm\n |title=Laurel Springs History\n |publisher=WestfieldNJ.com\n |author=1976 Bicentennial publication produced for the Borough of Laurel Springs.\n |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>\n\nAs the end of 1891 approached, he prepared a final edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', a version that has been nicknamed the \"Deathbed Edition\".

As a teenager, he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as \"thick\". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover.<ref>Henry Adams, Thomas Eakins; ''Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist'', p. 289</ref> Their photograph [pictured] is described as \"modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait\", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male\u2013male desire.<ref>Ruth L.

Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, \"You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image068.html?sort=photographer&order=ascending&page=1|title=Image 068 \u2013 The Walt Whitman Archive|work=whitmanarchive.org}}</ref>\n\nThere is also some evidence that Whitman may have had sexual relationships with women. He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress, Ellen Grey, in the spring of 1862, but it is not known whether it was also sexual.

Kummings, eds., ''Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia'' (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).</ref>\n\n===Nationalism===\nWalt Whitman is often described as America's national poet, creating an image of the United States for itself. \"Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, and the rest of the world in a subordinate position.\"<ref name=\"ijas.iaas.ie\">Nathanael O'Reilly, \"[http://ijas.iaas.ie/index.php/imagined-america-walt-whitmans-nationalism-in-the-first-edition-of-leaves-of-grass/ Imagined America: Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of 'Leaves of Grass{{'-}}]\", ''Irish Journal of American Studies''</ref> In his study, \"The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy\", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should look again at Whitman's nationalism: \"Whitman's seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States ... [are] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away\" (xv\u2013xvi). Nathanael O'Reilly in an essay on \"Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of ''Leaves of Grass''\" claims that \"Whitman's imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights.\"<ref name=\"ijas.iaas.ie\"/> Whitman's nationalism avoided issues concerning the treatment of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay \"Racial attitudes\", \"Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche.\" The authors concluded their essay with:<ref name=\"Racial Attitudes\"/>\n{{quote|Because of the radically democratic and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] aspects of his poetry, readers generally expect, and desire for, Whitman to be among the literary heroes that transcended the racist pressures that abounded in all spheres of public discourse during the nineteenth century. He did not, at least not consistently; nonetheless his poetry has been a model for democratic poets of all nations and races, right up to our own day. How Whitman could have been so prejudiced, and yet so effective in conveying an egalitarian and antiracist sensibility in his poetry, is a puzzle yet to be adequately addressed.}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n[[File:Walt Whitman, 1940.JPG|thumb|Whitman was honored on a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|'Famous Americans Series']] Postal issue, in 1940.]]\nWalt Whitman has been claimed as the first \"poet of democracy\" in the United States, a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character.

At age 11, he left formal schooling to go to work. As a child and through much of his career he resided in [[Brooklyn]]. Whitman's major work, ''Leaves of Grass'', was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American [[epic poetry|epic]]. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. During the [[American Civil War]], he went to Washington, D.C. and worked in hospitals caring for the wounded. His poetry often focused on both loss and healing. Two of his well known poems, \"[[O Captain! My Captain!]]\" and \"[[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd]]\", were written on the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]].

Crowell, whose first issue appeared on July 12, 1839.<ref name=Reynolds60>Reynolds, 60</ref> There are no known surviving copies of the ''Long-Islander'' published under Whitman.<ref>Loving, 38</ref> By the summer of 1839, he found a job as a typesetter in [[Jamaica, Queens]] with the ''Long Island Democrat'', edited by James J. Brenton.<ref name=Reynolds60/> He left shortly thereafter, and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841.<ref>Kaplan, 93\u201394</ref> One story, possibly apocryphal, tells of Whitman's being chased away from a teaching job in [[Southold, New York]], in 1840. After a local preacher called him a \"[[Sodomy|Sodomite]]\", Whitman was allegedly [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]]. Biographer [[Justin Kaplan]] notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter.<ref>Kaplan, 87</ref> Biographer [[Jerome Loving]] calls the incident a \"myth\".<ref>Loving, 514</ref> During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called \"Sun-Down Papers\u2014From the Desk of a Schoolmaster\", in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841. In these essays, he adopted a constructed persona, a technique he would employ throughout his career.<ref>Stacy, 25</ref>\n\nWhitman moved to New York City in May, initially working a low-level job at the ''New World'', working under [[Park Benjamin Sr.]] and [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]].<ref>Callow, 56</ref> He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the ''[[The New York Aurora|Aurora]]'' and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''.<ref>Stacy, 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Brooklyn Daily Eagle2.jpg|thumb|''Brooklyn Daily Eagle''{{'}}s Washington, D.C. bureau office, c. 1916]]\n\nHe also contributed freelance fiction and poetry throughout the 1840s.<ref>Reynolds, 83\u201384</ref> Whitman lost his position at the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' in 1848 after siding with the free-soil \"[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Barnburner]]\" wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper's owner, Isaac Van Anden, who belonged to the conservative, or \"[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Hunker]]\", wing of the party.<ref>Stacy, 87\u201391</ref> Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the [[Free Soil Party]], which was concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen moving into the newly colonised western territories.

Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it.<ref>Reynolds, 348</ref> In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems,<ref>Callow, 238</ref> in August 1856.<ref>Kaplan, 207</ref> ''Leaves of Grass'' was revised and re-released in 1860,<ref>Loving, 238</ref> again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].<ref>Reynolds, 363</ref>\n\nDuring the first publications of ''Leaves of Grass'', Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's ''Daily Times'' starting in May 1857.<ref>Callow, 225</ref> As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials.<ref>Reynolds, 368</ref> He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave.<ref>Loving, 228</ref> Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.<ref>Reynolds, 375</ref>\n\n===Civil War years===\n[[File:Walt Whitman - Brady-Handy restored.png|thumb|upright.1|Whitman as photographed by [[Mathew Brady]]]]\n[[File:Manuscript Whitman Broadway 1861.jpg|thumb|Walt Whitman's handwritten manuscript for \"Broadway, 1861\"]]\nAs the [[American Civil War]] was beginning, Whitman published his poem \"[[s:Leaves of Grass/Book XXI#Beat!

Chase]], Secretary of the Treasury, hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department. Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref>Callow, 295</ref>\n\nThe Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia,<ref>Loving, 281</ref> and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of [[tuberculosis]] compounded by [[alcoholism]] on December 3.<ref>Kaplan, 293\u2013294</ref> That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum.<ref>Reynolds, 454</ref> Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] in the [[Department of the Interior]], thanks to his friend William Douglas O'Connor. O'Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist and an editor at ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', had written to [[William Tod Otto]], Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], on Whitman's behalf.<ref name=Loving283>Loving, 283</ref> Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200.<ref name=Reynolds455>Reynolds, 455</ref> A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a [[furlough]] because of his poor health.<ref name=Loving283/> By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship<ref name=Reynolds455/> and published ''Drum-Taps''.<ref name=Loving290>Loving, 290</ref>\n\nEffective June 30, 1865, however, Whitman was fired from his job.<ref name=Loving290/> His dismissal came from the new Secretary of the Interior, former [[Iowa]] Senator [[James Harlan (senator)|James Harlan]].<ref name=Reynolds455/> Though Harlan dismissed several clerks who \"were seldom at their respective desks\", he may have fired Whitman on moral grounds after finding an 1860 edition of ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref>Loving, 291</ref> O'Connor protested until J. Hubley Ashton had Whitman transferred to the Attorney General's office on July 1.<ref>Kaplan, 304</ref> O'Connor, though, was still upset and vindicated Whitman by publishing a biased and exaggerated biographical study, ''The Good Gray Poet'', in January 1866. The fifty-cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet's nickname and increased his popularity.<ref>Reynolds, 456\u2013457</ref> Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of \"[[O Captain! My Captain!]]\", a relatively conventional poem on the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman's lifetime.<ref>Kaplan, 309</ref>\n\nPart of Whitman's role at the Attorney General's office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for Presidential [[pardon]]s. \"There are real characters among them\", he later wrote, \"and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary.\"<ref>Loving, 293</ref> In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher.<ref>Kaplan, 318\u2013319</ref> He hoped it would be its last edition.<ref name=\"Loving, 314\">Loving, 314</ref> In February 1868, ''Poems of Walt Whitman'' was published in England thanks to the influence of [[William Michael Rossetti]],<ref>Callow, 326</ref> with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved.<ref>Kaplan, 324</ref> The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer [[Anne Gilchrist (writer)|Anne Gilchrist]].<ref>Callow, 329</ref> Another edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident.<ref>Loving, 331</ref> As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872.<ref>Reynolds, 464</ref> He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother, who was now nearly eighty and struggling with [[arthritis]].<ref>Kaplan, 340</ref> He also traveled and was invited to [[Dartmouth College]] to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.<ref>Loving, 341</ref>\n\n===Health decline and death===\n[[File:WhitmanHouse-CamdenNJ1.jpg|thumb|left|Whitman spent his last years at his home in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. Today, it is open to the public as the [[Walt Whitman House]].]]\nAfter suffering a paralytic [[stroke]] in early 1873, Whitman was induced to move from Washington to the home of his brother\u2014George Washington Whitman, an engineer\u2014at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey. His mother, having fallen ill, was also there and died that same year in May. Both events were difficult for Whitman and left him depressed. He remained at his brother's home until buying his own in 1884.<ref>Miller, 33</ref> However, before purchasing his home, he spent the greatest period of his residence in Camden at his brother's home in Stevens Street. While in residence there he was very productive, publishing three versions of ''Leaves of Grass'' among other works. He was also last fully physically active in this house, receiving both [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Thomas Eakins]]. His other brother, Edward, an \"invalid\" since birth, lived in the house.\n\nWhen his brother and sister-in-law were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street [[Walt Whitman House|(now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard)]].<ref>Haas, Irvin.

Washington, D.C.: The Preservation Press, 1991: 141. {{ISBN|0-89133-180-8}}.</ref> First taken care of by tenants, he was completely bedridden for most of his time in Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis\u2014the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street.<ref>Loving, 432</ref> She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals.<ref>Reynolds, 548</ref> During this time, Whitman produced further editions of ''Leaves of Grass'' in 1876, 1881, and 1889.\n\nWhile in [[Southern New Jersey]], Whitman spent a good portion of his time in the then quite pastoral community of [[Laurel Springs, New Jersey|Laurel Springs]], between 1876 and 1884, converting one of the Stafford Farm buildings to his summer home. The restored summer home has been preserved as a museum by the local historical society. Part of his ''Leaves of Grass'' was written here, and in his ''Specimen Days'' he wrote of the spring, creek and lake. To him, Laurel Lake was \"the prettiest lake in: either America or Europe\".<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://westfieldnj.com/whs/history/Counties/CamdenCounty/laurelsprings.htm\n |title=Laurel Springs History\n |publisher=WestfieldNJ.com\n |author=1976 Bicentennial publication produced for the Borough of Laurel Springs.\n |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>\n\nAs the end of 1891 approached, he prepared a final edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', a version that has been nicknamed the \"Deathbed Edition\".

As a teenager, he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as \"thick\". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover.<ref>Henry Adams, Thomas Eakins; ''Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist'', p. 289</ref> Their photograph [pictured] is described as \"modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait\", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male\u2013male desire.<ref>Ruth L.

Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, \"You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image068.html?sort=photographer&order=ascending&page=1|title=Image 068 \u2013 The Walt Whitman Archive|work=whitmanarchive.org}}</ref>\n\nThere is also some evidence that Whitman may have had sexual relationships with women. He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress, Ellen Grey, in the spring of 1862, but it is not known whether it was also sexual.

LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., New York: Garland Publishing, 1998</ref> Whitman opposed the extension of slavery in the United States and supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]].<ref name=Reynolds117>Reynolds, 117</ref> At first he was opposed to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], believing the movement did more harm than good. In 1846, he wrote that the abolitionists had, in fact, slowed the advancement of their cause by their \"[[wikt:ultraism|ultraism]] and officiousness\".<ref>Loving, 110</ref> His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests of the nation as a whole above their own.<ref name=Reynolds117/> In 1856, in his unpublished ''The Eighteenth Presidency'', addressing the men of the South, he wrote \"you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you\". Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote<ref name=Reynolds473>Reynolds, 473</ref> and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature.<ref>Reynolds, 470</ref> George Hutchinson and David Drews have argued, without providing textual evidence from Whitman's own early writings or other sources, that what little that \"is known about the early development of Whitman's racial awareness suggests that he imbibed the prevailing white prejudices of his time and place, thinking of black people as servile, shiftless, ignorant, and given to stealing, although he would remember individual blacks of his youth in positive terms\".<ref name=\"Racial Attitudes\">[http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_44.html \"Racial Attitudes\"], George Hutchinson and David Drews.

[are] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away\" (xv\u2013xvi). Nathanael O'Reilly in an essay on \"Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of ''Leaves of Grass''\" claims that \"Whitman's imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights.\"<ref name=\"ijas.iaas.ie\"/> Whitman's nationalism avoided issues concerning the treatment of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay \"Racial attitudes\", \"Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche.\" The authors concluded their essay with:<ref name=\"Racial Attitudes\"/>\n{{quote|Because of the radically democratic and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] aspects of his poetry, readers generally expect, and desire for, Whitman to be among the literary heroes that transcended the racist pressures that abounded in all spheres of public discourse during the nineteenth century. He did not, at least not consistently; nonetheless his poetry has been a model for democratic poets of all nations and races, right up to our own day. How Whitman could have been so prejudiced, and yet so effective in conveying an egalitarian and antiracist sensibility in his poetry, is a puzzle yet to be adequately addressed.}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n[[File:Walt Whitman, 1940.JPG|thumb|Whitman was honored on a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|'Famous Americans Series']] Postal issue, in 1940.]]\nWalt Whitman has been claimed as the first \"poet of democracy\" in the United States, a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character.

His father was one of the eighteen [[hussar]]s who distinguished themselves in the [[battle of Kunersdorf]].\n\nGraduated from [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] and [[P\u00e9cs]], he applied for a civil service position in [[Buda]] but was unsuccessful. In 1792 he entered the Cistercian chapter house at [[Lilienfeld Abbey]], where he was ordained [[priest]] (1796). In quick succession he was steward, chancellor, [[prior]], [[abbot]], for a time, parish priest at [[T\u00fcrnitz]], and brought the monastery to prosperity.\n\nHe was appointed [[Bishop of Spi\u0161]] (1818), [[Patriarch of Venice]] and [[Primate of Dalmatia]] with his see in Venice (1820), and finally [[Archbishop of Eger]] (1827). He founded health resorts in [[Karlovy Vary]] and [[Gastein]] for sick soldiers, a seminary for country school teachers at [[Eger]], and donated 10,000 early [[Hungarian forint|florins]] toward the adornment of [[Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Apostle, Eger|Eger Cathedral]]. His collection of paintings forms the basis of the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. For these charitable gifts he was knighted by the emperor with the title of Fels\u00f6-E\u00f6r. In 1827 he was founded a [[string quartet]] in Eger by his noble music instruments, one of these the 1697's [[Stradivari]]'s violin, named Cecilia, newly discovered in 2011. He was known to the composer [[Franz Schubert]] who set two songs to his texts: D851 Das Heimweh and D852 Die Allmacht. Pyrker let it be known that he liked Schubert's D489 Der Wanderer, and was duly obliged with the dedication of Schubert's Opus 4.\n\n== Works ==\nPyrker wrote dramatic, epic, and lyric poetry. His first dramatic work, \"Historische Schauspiele\", appeared in 1810, and contained three five-act tragedies: \"Die Corvinen\", \"Karl der Kleine, K\u00f6nig von Ungarn\", and \"Zrinis Tod\". It was not considered worthy of discussion or criticism, and the various editions of his collected works do not contain the dramas.\n\nThe \"Tunisias\", an epic in twelve cantos, describing the conquest of Tunis by [[Emperor Charles V]], appeared in 1820, and there have been frequent later editions. A sketch of a \"Tunisias\" with striking resemblances was found in the textbooks of the Jesuit [[Jacob Masen]]. It is possible that the Jesuit's textbook (''Pal\u00e6stra eloquenti\u00e6'') was used at the time of Pyrker's youth. Another epic, \"Rudolphias\", glorifies [[Rudolph of Habsburg|Rudolph, the first King from the House of Habsburg]], and was printed in Vienna in 1824. [[Grillparzer]] dramatized the same material in his \"Ottokars Gl\u00fcck und Ende\", which has many similarities with the well-known \"Ode to Habsburg\" written by the Latin poet [[Nicola Avancini]], S.J., probably read in the schools at the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nPyrker also wrote several short stories: \"Die Perlen der heiligen Vorzeit\" (1821); \"Bilder aus dem Leben Jesu und der Apostel\" and \"Legenden der Heiligen auf alle Sonntage und Festtage des Jahres\" (1842). As a lyric poet Pyrker published only a few monographs, e. g. \"Lilienfelds Freude\", and \"Lieder der Sehnsucht nach den Alpen\" (1845).\n\n== References ==\n* [[G\u00f6deke|G\u00d6DEKE]], ''Grundriss der deutschen Dichtung''; \n* [[J.

{"title_page": "Types of democracy", "text_new": "{{democracy}}\n{{Basic Forms of government}}\n'''Types of [[democracy]]''' refers to pluralism of governing structures such as [[government]]s (local through to global) and other constructs like workplaces, families, community associations, and so forth. Types of democracy can cluster around values. For example, some like direct democracy, electronic democracy, participatory democracy, real democracy, deliberative democracy, and pure democracy strive to allow people to participate equally and directly in protest, discussion, decision-making, or other acts of politics. Different types of democracy - like representative democracy - strive for indirect participation as this procedural approach to collective \nself-governance is still widely considered the only means for the more or less stable democratic functioning of mass societies.<ref name=\"JHUPress\">Larry Jay Diamond, Marc F.

Types of democracy can cluster around values. For example, some like direct democracy, electronic democracy, participatory democracy, real democracy, deliberative democracy, and pure democracy strive to allow people to participate equally and directly in protest, discussion, decision-making, or other acts of politics. Different types of democracy - like representative democracy - strive for indirect participation as this procedural approach to collective \nself-governance is still widely considered the only means for the more or less stable democratic functioning of mass societies.<ref name=\"JHUPress\">Larry Jay Diamond, Marc F.

He was born in [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]]. The main theme of his poetry was love.\n\nHe studied at the Franciscan Gymnasium (now [[B\u00e9la III High School]]) in Baja between 1839 and 1845. T\u00f3th was the best student in his class.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He was a novice{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} for a short time, but then started to study law. He took part in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].\n\nAfter the failure of the revolution, he tried to raise national self-confidence and to cherish the ideals of the revolution. He remembered its heroes in his poetry. He became the [[sub-editor]] of [[Ign\u00e1c Nagy]]'s {{lang|hu|H\u00f6lgyfut\u00e1r}} (English: ''Ladies' Courier''). He was the accountable editor of it between 1856 and 1861.\n\nIn 1860, T\u00f3th launched a political newspaper, {{lang|hu|Bolond Miska}} (English: ''Crazy Michael''). From 1864 he was the editor of the {{lang|hu|F\u0151v\u00e1rosi Lapok}} (English: ''Metropolitan Pages''). His writing was regularly published, and his dramas were performed at the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|Hungarian National Theatre in Budapest]].\n\n[[Image:Baja2005 g027.jpg|left|thumb|100px|K\u00e1lm\u00e1n T\u00f3th Square, Baja|alt=A colour photograph of K\u00e1lm\u00e1n T\u00f3th's memorial, front centre, before it several wreaths and flowers, surrounded by evergreen trees, and in the background a light stone building with Georgian escarpment]].\nT\u00f3th was elected to be the parliamentary delegate of his home town in 1865. Through four sessions he fought for revolutionary ideas in the Parliament.
