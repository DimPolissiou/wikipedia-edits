Individuals described on camera being coerced to disclose their abuse history on stage in front of the church congregation to pass the programme, or being told that being gay was the work of the devil, whilst a staff member described being unqualified and untrained, and told to respond to serious incidents including self-harm with suggestions of prayer and scripture..<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel four news-UK|url=https://www.channel4.com/news/exclusive-investigation-uncovers-alleged-homophobia-and-untrained-staff-at-government-funded-charity}}</ref><ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/city-hearts-regulatory-compliance-case-conclusions/city-hearts-regulatory-compliance-case-conclusions</ref>\n\nFollowing the report, City Hearts appointed an independent investigator to conduct a review of the allegations which was submitted to the Charity Commission who opened a regulatory compliance case to assess governance and safeguarding at the charity.

It highlighted interviews with 'around 40 people who were cared for or worked for the City Hearts charity in Sheffield' who spoke of 'their concerns and claims of homophobia.' Individuals described on camera being coerced to disclose their abuse history on stage in front of the church congregation to pass the programme, or being told that being gay was the work of the devil, whilst a staff member described being unqualified and untrained, and told to respond to serious incidents including self-harm with suggestions of prayer and scripture..<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel four news-UK|url=https://www.channel4.com/news/exclusive-investigation-uncovers-alleged-homophobia-and-untrained-staff-at-government-funded-charity}}</ref><ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/city-hearts-regulatory-compliance-case-conclusions/city-hearts-regulatory-compliance-case-conclusions</ref>\n\nFollowing the report, City Hearts appointed an independent investigator to conduct a review of the allegations which was submitted to the Charity Commission who opened a regulatory compliance case to assess governance and safeguarding at the charity. In November 2019 the Charity Commission issued a statement to conclude that \"the allegations raised, whilst significant and concerning, were historic dating to 2011-2012 and there were no live risks; and the charity had acted appropriately in relation to the allegations by instructing a thorough independent investigation, reviewing their systems and putting in place their own action plan to address outstanding recommendations of the investigation.\" A full version of the report is available online to read as well as the response by City Hearts CEO.<ref>https://cityhearts.co.uk/statement-from-city-hearts-in-relation-to-charity-commission-case-report-november-2019</ref>\n\nHope City Church has been criticised for promoting the [[prosperity gospel]]; suggesting members should make sizable and recurrent offerings in addition to the [[tithe]] in return for financial breakthrough and blessings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shipoffools.com/mystery/2016/3075.html|title=Ship of Fools: The Mystery Worshipper|website=www.shipoffools.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Dave Gilpin ===\nIn September 2008, Senior Pastor Dave Gilpin faced criticism from an online Christian Podcast (Pirate Christian Radio) in a sermon review, labelling him as a \"Charlatan\".

On January 24, 2015, in Alvarado's home town of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], Rios punished Alvarado for 3 rounds before the referee stopped the fight prior to the start of the fourth.<ref>http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/11970707/brandon-rios-mike-alvarado-iii-set-jan-24-denver</ref>\n\n====R\u00edos vs. Bradley====\nOn November 7, 2015, Rios battled [[Timothy Bradley]] for the WBO Welterweight title at the Thomas & Mack Center in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. He was unsuccessful in doing so, losing every round of the fight in the process before referee Tony Weeks called an end to the bout at 2:48 of the ninth round, marking the first time R\u00edos had ever been stopped in his professional career.\n\nDuring the emotional post-fight interview, Rios announced his retirement, stating that although he loved the sport, his body was no longer acting the same and that both weight fluctuations and layoffs were affecting his performances. He has since gone on record to say that he would also like to spend more time with his family and close friends now as well.\n\n====Comeback====\nRios made a comeback to the ring against Aaron Herrera on June 11, 2017, with new trainer Ricky Funez, after splitting with longtime trainer Robert Garc\u00eda. Rios won by KO in the 7th round.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrandon married Victoria L\u00f3pez in August 2010 and has three children and two from a previous relationship.<ref>[http://www.secondsout.com/usa-boxing-news/usa-boxing-news/brandon-rios-celebrates-honeymoon-in-vegas SecondsOut Boxing News \u2013 USA Boxing News \u2013 Brandon Rios Celebrates Honeymoon in Vegas].

{"title_page": "History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 1635\u20131699", "text_new": "{{Dedham}}The '''history of [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], 1635\u20131699''', begins with the first settlers' arrival in 1635 and runs to the end of the 17th century. The originally settlers, who built their village on land the native people called Tiot, incorporated the plantation in 1636. The sought to build a community in which all would live out Christian love in their daily lives, and for a time did, but the Utopian impulse did not last. The system of government they devised was both \"a peculiar oligarchy\" and a \"a most peculiar democracy\". Most freemen could participate in Town Meeting, though they soon established a [[Board of Selectmen]]. Power and initiative ebbed and flowed between the two bodies.\n\nThe settlers then undertook the difficult task of establishing a church, drafting its doctrinal base, and selecting a minister. In early days nearly every resident was a member but, seeking a church of only \"visible saints\", membership declined over time. Though the \"[[half-way covenant]]\" was proposed in 1657 and endorsed by the minister, the congregation rejected it.\n\nPopulation grew from about 200 people in early days to around 700 by 1800, with land being distributed according to rank and family size. Though it was given out sparingly in general, lands were also awarded in return for service to the church and the community. The town remained insular during the early years, with the community remaining self contained. With a small population, a simple and agrarian economy, and the free distribution of large tracts of land, there was very little disparity in wealth.\n\nAs the town grew, new towns broke off from Dedham, beginning with [[Medfield, Massachusetts|Medfield]] in 1651. With the division and subdivision of so many communities, Dedham has been called the \"Mother of Towns.\" Of towns founded during the colonial era, Dedham is one of the few towns \"that has preserved extensive records of its earliest years\". This has enabled historians to date the [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] as the oldest tinder house in America and [[Mother Brook]] as the first man-made canal in America. It also establishes the [[Dedham Public Schools]] as the first public school in the country.\n\n==Utopian commune==\n\nLike its surrounding communities, Dedham's early culture was much like the English villages where its original settlers were born and small agricultural communities all over Europe.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=xiv}} A number of the customs and institutions in the town were direct transplants from contemporary English villages.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} However, as a settlement of English [[Puritans]] who escaped oppression to settle in the wilderness, \"Dedham was peculiarly American.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=xv}} \n\nIt was originally intended to be a [[Utopian]] society along the lines of the later [[Amana Colonies]], [[Oneida Community]], and [[Brook Farm]].{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=1}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=7}} In \"its first years, the town was more than a place to live; it was a spiritual community.\"{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=130}} Its distinctive characteristics created what has been described as a \"Christian Utopian Closed Corporate Community\":\n<blockquote>Christian because they saw Christian love as the force which would most completely unite their community. Utopian because theirs was a highly conscious attempt to build the most prefect possible community, as perfectly united, perfectly at peace, and perfectly ordered as man could arrange. Closed because its membership was selected while outsiders were treated with suspicion or rejected altogether. And Corporate because the commune demanded the loyalty of its members, offering in exchange privileges which could be obtained only through membership, not the least of which were peace and good order.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=16\u201317}}</blockquote>\n\nEach of the original settlers pledged to live out [[Christian love]] in their daily lives.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=5}} Each was also expected to be united in this love as it was designed to bring about a deep and abiding peace throughout the whole community.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=5}} Inquiries could also be made into the private lives of townsmen, and adjustments ordered when a resident's life was not as virtuous as the community felt it should be.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=15}} \n\nNone who were not committed to this ideal were to be admitted as townsmen and, if the need arose, they were to be expelled.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=5\u20136}} The commitment in the Covenant to allow only like-minded individuals to live within the town explains why \"church records show no instances of dissension, Quaker or Baptist expulsions, or witchcraft persecutions.\"<ref name=DHSCapsule/> The Covenant was intended to extend beyond the lifetimes if those who wrote it and to be binding upon all residents in perpetuity.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=7}} \n\nThe poor would be helped if they were residents of Dedham, but sent away if they were not.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=15}} In addition to paying taxes, each man was expected to labor on communal projects several days each month.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} Every year, six days were set aside to work on roads and each man was expected to work n four of them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=80}} Townsmen also took turns serving in a variety of low level offices, including [[Constables_in_the_United_States#Massachusetts|constable]], [[hog reeve]], or [[Fence Viewer|fence viewer]].{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} \n\nThis did not mean communism as and the settlers subscribed to the Puritan belief of a natural inequality among men as being divine providence.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=11}} Still, the relative economic equality kept social rank to a minimum and helped maintain social harmony.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=73\u201374}} Men could live their entire lives in this community among their equals and on their own land.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=74}} This was, according to one commentator, the \"[[City_upon_a_Hill#\"A_Model_of_Christian_Charity\"|plan of the society]] [John] Winthrop hoped to construct in Massachusetts was the plan of Dedham writ large.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} In 1729, however, the tax rolls stopped listing the names of the most prominent citizens first, as had been done by the rank conscious first settlers, and instead listed names alphabetically.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=144}}\n\n===Decline===\n\nThe Utopian impulse did not last, however, and \"the policies of perfection\" no longer dominated just 50 years after the establishment of the community.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=79}} By the 1640s the town began permitting residents to fence in their strips of land in the common field and, presumably, to grow whatever crop they wanted in it.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=81}} By reducing and eventually eliminating the common field system, it reduced the number of interactions each farmer had with his neighbors and made one less decision they had to make and employ in common.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} \n\nBy about 1660, not every newcomer to town was invited to sign the Covenant making them \"by implication [[second class citizen|second class citizens]]\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=81}} Laws that restricted the presence of strangers were rarely enforced after 1675 and disputes went to mediators with less frequency.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=84\u201385}}{{efn|During the early days of the settlement, the Selectmen voted to ask an Irishman and his wife, who were visiting friends, to leave town as soon as possible, presumably because they were Catholic.<ref name=graphic/>}} Eventually, as some men grew richer, they were able to hire substitutes to serve in their place on communal projects or to serve in office for them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=80}}\n\nAlso around this time evidence of the \"loving spirit\" proclaimed in the Covenant \"came to be conspicuous by [its] absence\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=85}} Records of open dissent began appearing, first about seating placements in the meetinghouse.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=85}} The number of yea and nay votes also began being recorded{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=85}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=124}} where previously decisions were made by consensus.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=39}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=54}} By 1686, much of the overt Utopian spirit the founders had instilled 50 years prior had been destroyed.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=85}} By the end of the first century, public disagreements seemed to be the rule rather than the exception{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=124}} and decisions were made by majority, not consensus.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=136}} \n\nThe Covenant was no longer enforced nor served as the guide for every decision by the time the town reached its 50th anniversary.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=89}} It lasted well into the second generation and was, according to one commentator, \"longer than anyone had a right to expect\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=90}} Still, the town remained small and slow growing, with little change to institutional structures or traditional views.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=89}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=91}}\n\nBy 1675, taxpayers paid more the county and colony than they did to the town, reflecting a growing importance of the regional bodies and the cost of the colony expanding westward.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=136}} After 1691, as the county grew more powerful, the town began more closely following the law lest they get fined.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=136}} Residents were also more likely to use the court system to settle disputes than they were to go use the arbitration method laid out in the covenant.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=137}}\n\n==Incorporation==\n\nIn 1635 there were rumors in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] that a war with the local [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] was impending and a fear arose that the few, small, coastal communities that existed were in danger of attack.<ref name=DHSCapsule/> This, in addition to the belief that the few towns that did exist were too close together, prompted the [[Massachusetts General Court]] to establish two new inland communities.<ref name=DHSCapsule/>\n\nTwelve men{{Efn|Including [[John Kingsbury]].<ref name=kingsbury/>}} petitioned the General Court for a tract of land south of the Charles River in 1635.{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} Those men, plus seven others, made a second petition in 1636 for additional land on both sides of the river.{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} These petitions were granted and within a few years a 200 square mile tract of rocky, hilly land was known as the Town of Dedham.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=94}} The grant from the colony gave them over \"two hundred square miles of virgin wilderness, complete with lakes, hills, forests, meadows, Indians, and a seemingly endless supply of rocks and wolves.\"<ref name=DHSCapsule/> \n\nThe original grant stretched from the southwestern border of what is today [[Boston]] but was then Roxbury and Dorchester to the [[Rhode Island]] and [[Plymouth Colony]] borders.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}}{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=5}} To the west were ungranted lands.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=5}} The less than 100 Indians who lived on the land sold it for a small sum.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}} Early settlers gave places names such as Dismal Swamp, Purgatory Brook, Satan's Kingdom, and Devil's Oven.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=11}}\n\nAt the same time Dedham was incorporated, the General Court established the Town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].<ref name=DHSCapsule/> Together they helped relieve the growing population pressure and to place communities between the larger, more established coastal towns and the Indians further west.<ref name=DHSCapsule/>\n\nThe settlers petitioned the General Court to incorporate the plantation into a town, and to free the town from all \"Countrey Charges\", or taxes, for four years and from all military exercises unless \"extraordinary occasion require it\".<ref name=EarlyRecords/>{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=3}} The General Court granted only a three-year reprieve from taxes.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=4}}\n\nThey also asked to \"distinguish our town by the name of Contentment\"<ref name=EarlyRecords/> but when the \"prosaic minds\" in the Court granted the petition on September 7, 1636 they decreed that the \"towne shall beare the name of Dedham.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}}{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=37}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=80}}{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=4}} The earliest records of the settlement, before the General Court settled on Dedham, all use the name Contentment.{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} Tradition holds that John Rodgers or [[John Dwight (died 1661)|John Dwight]], both signers of the petition seeking the establishment of the town, asked the Court to name it after their hometown in England of [[Dedham, Essex]].{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=5}}\n\nThe town was named for [[Dedham, Essex]], where some of the original inhabitants, including John Dwight, John Page and John Rogers had been born.{{sfn|Abbott|1903|pp=290\u2013297}}{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} \"Contentment\" eventually became the motto of the town. Many of the other yeomen settling the new Dedham in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] came from [[Suffolk]], in eastern England.<ref name=stgeorge/>\n\n==Landing and first settlement==\n\nThe [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] living in the area called the place Tiot, which means \"land surrounded by water\".<ref name=gazetteer/>{{efn|Tiot was later used to describe the village of South Dedham, today the separate town of [[Norwood, Massachusetts|Norwood]].<ref name=Norwood/>}} The colonial settlers met for the first time on August 18, 1636 in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] and immediately began building homes and planting fields in Dedham.\n\nDedham was settled in the summer of 1636 by \"about thirty families excised from the broad ranks of the English middle classes\", largely from Yorkshire and East Anglia.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}} Only five signers of the covenant were university graduates, but many more would be called upon to serve the town, the church, and the colony.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=11}}{{efn|Those five were [[John Allen (puritan)|John Allen]], [[Thomas Carter (minister)|Thomas Carter]], Timothy Dalton, [[Samuel Morse (Dedham)|Samuel Morse]], and [[Ralph Wheelock]].{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=11}}}} As [[Puritans]], they came to Massachusetts in order to live and worship as they pleased.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=11}} \n\nThey traveled up the [[Charles River]] from [[Roxbury, MA|Roxbury]] and [[Watertown, MA|Watertown]] in rough canoes carved from felled trees.{{sfn|Abbott|1903|pp=290\u2013297}} These original settlers, including [[Edward Alleyn (Massachusetts)|Edward Alleyn]], John Everard, [[John Gay (Dedham)|John Gay]] and John Ellis \"paddled up the narrow, deeply flowing stream impatiently turning curve after curve around [[Newton, Massachusetts|Nonantum]] until, emerging from the tall forest into the open, they saw in the sunset glow a golden river twisting back and forth through broad, rich meadows.\"{{sfn|Abbott|1903|pp=290\u2013297}} In search of the best land available to them they continued on but\n<blockquote>The river took many turns, so that it was a burden the continual turning about.{{nbsp}}... West, east, and north we turned on that same meadow and progressed none, so that I, rising in the boat, saw the river flowing just across a bit of grass, in a place where I knew we had passed through nigh an hour before. \"Moore,\" said Miles then to me, \"the river is like its Master, our good [[Charles I of England|King Charles]], of sainted memory, it promises overmuch, but gets you nowhere.\"{{sfn|Abbott|1903|pp=290\u2013297}}</blockquote>\n\nThey first landed where the river makes its \"great bend\",{{sfn|Abbott|1903|pp=290\u2013297}} near what is today Ames Street, and close by the [[Dedham Community House]] and the [[Allin Congregational Church]] in Dedham Square. The site is known as \"the Keye\", and in 1927 a stone bench and memorial plaque were installed on the site.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=18}}\n\nBy March 1637, with homes built and fields planted, the settlers moved to their new village.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=10}} The first town meeting held in Dedham was on March 23, 1636\u201337 and was attended by 15 men.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n==Government==\n\nFor the first fifty years of Dedham's existence, it enjoyed a stable, tranquil government.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=49}} The town elected a group of wealthy, experienced friends as Selectmen and then heeded their judgement.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=48\u201349}} It also adopted a clause in the covenant that mandated mediation, which supported stability of the society.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=49}} There was not so much a system of [[checks and balances]] so much as there was system where each individual voluntarily restrained himself.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=55}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} \n\nDue to its unique features it was both \"a peculiar [[oligarchy]]\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} in that only a few men were chosen for political office and \"a most peculiar [[democracy]]\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=49}} in that laws of [[suffrage]] changed frequently both to restrict and to expand the franchise. \n\n===Covenant===\n\n{{see also|List of signers of the Dedham Covenant}}\n\nWhile the first settlers were subject to the General Court, they had wide latitude to establish a local government as they saw fit.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}} The first public meeting of the plantation was held on August 18, 1636.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}}{{efn|Barber has the date as August 15, 1636{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}}}} A total of 18 men were present, and the town covenant was signed.{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} The covenant outlined both the social ideal they hoped to achieve and the policies and procedures they would use to reach it.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=5}} Eventually [[List of signers of the Dedham Covenant|125 men]] would ascribe their names to the document.<ref name=Covenant/>{{efn|In 1636, there were 30 signers. In 1637, there were 46. By 1656, 79 men put their names on the document.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=9}}}}\n\nAs the Covenant stipulated that \"for the better manifestation of our true resolution herein, every man so received into the town is to subscribe hereunto his name, thereby obliging both himself and his successors after him forever.\"<ref name=Covenant/> They swore they would \"in the fear and reverence of our Almighty God, mutually and severally promise amongst ourselves and each to profess and practice one truth according to that most perfect rule, the foundation whereof is ever lasting love.\"<ref name=Covenant/>\n\nThey also agreed that \"we shall by all means labor to keep off from us all such as are contrary minded, and receive only such unto us as may be probably of one heart with us, [and such] as that we either know or may well and truly be informed to walk in a peacable conversation with all meekness of spirit, [this] for the edification of each other in the knowledge and faith of the Lord Jesus{{nbsp}}...\"{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=38}} It was not to be a [[theocracy]], however, as colonial law prohibited clergy from serving as civil officers.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=23}} The church and the civil society were largely separate institutions.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=23}}\n\nBefore a man could join the community he underwent a public inquisition to determine his suitability.{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=38}} Every signer of the Covenant was required to tell all he knew of the other men and if a lie was uncovered the man who spoke it would be instantly excluded from town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}}\n\nWhile great effort was taken to ensure disagreements were resolved before they grew into disputes,{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=14}} the covenant also stipulated that differences would be submitted to between one and four other members of the town for resolution.<ref name=Covenant/>{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=6}} They \"eschew[ed] all appeals to law and submit[ted] all disputes between them to arbitration.{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=134}} This arbitration system was so successful there was no need for courts.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=12}}{{efn|The third paragraph of the Town Covenant stated \"that if at any time differences shall rise between parties of our said town, that then such party or parties shall presently refer all such differences unto some one, two or three others of our said society to be fully accorded and determined without any further delay, if it possibly may be.\"<ref name=Covenant/>{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=39}}}} The same system was used to resolve disputes with other towns.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=14}} \n\nIt was also expected that once a decision was made that all would abide by it with no further dissent or debate.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=7}} For the first fifty years of Dedham's existence, there were no prolonged disputes that were common in other communities.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=15}} They also agreed to pay their fair share for the common good.<ref name=Covenant/>\n\n===Town Meeting===\n\nThe [[town meeting]] \"was the original and protean vessel of local authority.

The meeting operated on a basis of consensus.{{sfn|Brown| Tager|2000|p=39}}\n\nEven when it did not fully exercise them, \"the power of the town meeting knew no limit.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=551}} The town meeting\n<blockquote>created principles to regulate taxation and land distribution; it bought land for town use and forbade the use of it forever to those who could not pay their share within a month; it decided the number of pines each family could cut from the swamp and which families could cover their house with clapboard. The men who went to that town meeting hammered out the abstract principles under which they would live and regulated the most minute details of their lives. The decisions they made then affected the lives of their children and grandchildren.{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=131}}</blockquote>\n\nJust as the selectmen did, they enacted bylaws, appointed special committees, and granted small favors to individual residents.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} It was typically the meeting to voted to accepted new residents to live within the town and appointed lower officers.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} Votes were generally not recorded and decisions were made by consensus.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=54}} \n\nIt was often the case that even after \"meetings [had] been agreed upon and times appointed accordingly\" many townsmen would still arrive late to the meeting and those who arrived promptly \"wasted much time to their great damage.\"{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=352}} To discourage tardiness the town set fines in 1636 of one shilling for arriving more than half an hour after the \"beating of the drum\" and two sixpence shilling if a member was completely absent. In 1637 those fines increased to twelve pence for being late and three shillings and four pence for not arriving at all.{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=352}}\n\nThe more wealthy a voter was, the more likely he would attend the meeting. However, \"even though no more than 58 men were eligible to come to the Dedham town meeting and to make the decisions for the town, even though the decisions to which they addressed themselves were vital to their existence, even though every inhabitant was required to live within one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of the meeting place, even though each absence from the meeting brought a fine, and even though the town crier personally visited the house of every latecomer half an hour after the meeting had begun, only 74 percent of those eligible actually showed up at the typical town meeting between 1636 and 1644.\"{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=131}}\n\n====Franchise====\n\nA colony law required all voters to be Church members until 1647, though it may not have been enforced.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} Even if it were, 70% of the men in town would have been eligible to participate.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} The law changed in 1647 and, as it was interpreted in Dedham, all men over 24 were eligible to vote.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}}\n\nThe colony added a new requirement that a man must own taxable property of at least 20 pounds in 1658, and increased that sum to 80 pounds in 1670.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} The 1658 requirement reduced the number of voters from 91 to 83 members, and the 1670 increase had a [[grandfather clause]] allowing all those who previously were qualified to keep the franchise.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} Those not covered, however, may have to wait until they were 40 until they had accumulated enough wealth to earn the right to vote.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=49}} \n\nFrom 1648 to 1670, 60% to 90% of men had the right to vote.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=129}} In 1686, only 25% of the taxpayers had an estate worth 80 pounds so, with those grandfathered in, only 50% of men could vote.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=49}} In 1691, the property requirement was lowered back to 20 pounds bringing the percentage of men eligible to vote up from 40% to 70%.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=128}}\n\nIn provincial elections, only church members could vote, limiting the share of men to 50% in 1662.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=49}} The number continued to fall from there.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=49}} While in many respects Dedham and Massachusetts society resembled England, the franchise was more widespread in the colony than it was in the mother country, as were the powers of local elected officials.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=56}} Regardless of whether or not they were able to vote, records indicate that all men were able to attend and speak.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=120}}\n\n===Selectmen===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible floatright\"\n!

damage and business is thereby nothing furthered.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=38}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=551}} In response, on May 3, 1639, seven [[selectmen]] were chosen \"by general consent\" and given \"full power to contrive, execute and perform all the business and affairs of this whole town.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=38}}{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=551}} The leaders they chose \"were men of proven ability who were known to hold the same values and to be seeking the same goals as their neighbors\" and they were \"invested with great authority\".<ref name=social/> The empowering of several selectmen to administer the affairs of the town was soon seen by the whole colony to have great value, and after the General Court approved of it, nearly all towns began choosing selectmen of their own.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=38}}\n\nSoon the selectmen \"enjoyed almost complete control over every aspect of local administration.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=40}} They met roughly 10 times a year for formal sessions, and more often in informal subcommittees.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=40}}{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} When the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was adopted and recognized boards of selectmen for the first time, they granted them additional powers including the power to lay out roads, supervise education, and exercise social control.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=551}}\n\nThey also served as a court, determining who had broken by-laws and issuing fines.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=40}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=551}} Almost all townsmen would have to appear before them at one point or another during the year to ask for a swap of land, to ask to remove firewood from the common lands, or for some other purpose.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=40}} In 1652 they were given responsibility for the school and held it until 1789 when a school committee was created.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=125}}\n\nIn theory, the selectmen shared the power to appoint men to positions with the Town Meeting but they retained \"a strong initiative\" to act on their own.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=41}} As the selectmen became more active, the Town Meeting became \"essentially passive. It lacked initiative, its veto was quiescent\", and its broad powers were not exercised.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} It was the selectmen who called for a gathering of the Town Meeting and they generally called very few.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=41}} The board also prepared the agenda for the meeting, which gave them a degree of control over it.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=41}} \n\nThe selectmen wrote most of the laws in the town and they levied taxes on their fellow townsmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=41}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=551}} They could also approve expenditures.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=551}} The selectmen were charged with deciding who sat where in the meetinghouse.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} When difficult problems arose, the selectmen would often appoint a special committee to look into the matter and report back.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=41}} \n\nIf a man served three terms and met with the satisfaction of the community, he tended to stay on the board for many years following.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=44}} In 1671, the board had 100 years of cumulative experience.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=126}} During early years, roughly one in three men would serve as selectman at some point during their lives but, by 1736, fewer than one in six would.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=133}} \n\n====Demographics====\n\nSelectmen were \"the most powerful men in town. As men, they were few in number, old, and relatively rich and [[Saint#Other_Protestantism|saints]] of the church.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} It was not required that a man be wealthy to serve, but it improved his chances of getting elected.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=43}} Even those who were among the wealthiest, however, still had lifestyles that were remarkably similar to those with less as the spectrum of wealth was narrow.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=44}} Throughout the 17th century the selectmen, \"particularly those elected again and again for ten or twenty years, owned considerably more land than the average citizen. Selectmen who served between 1640 and 1740 were almost always among the wealthiest 20 percent of the town.{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=133}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=43}} In any given year a majority of a particular board were among the richest 10%.\"{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=133}} \n\nMen who were not members of the church were still allowed to hold town office.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=32}} However, in light of the \"high rate of admissions, the townsmen may have assumed that [they] would be members soon enough.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=32}} A large majority of those who served were members, however.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=45}}\n\nThe men chosen to serve were consistently sent back to serve multiple year-long terms on the board.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} Between 1637 and 1639 there were 43 different men chosen as selectmen; they served on average eight terms each.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} In that time period there were 10 men who served an average of 20 terms each.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} They made up only 5% of the population but filled 60% of the seats on the Board.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} An additional 15 men served an average of 10 terms each, filling 30% of the seats.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=43}} These 15 usually left office only when they had an early death or they removed from town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} If a man served more than three terms he could usually count on returning for many more.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=44}} \n\nThe burdens of office could take up to a third of their time during busy seasons.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} They served without salary and came up through the ranks of lower offices.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} In return they became \"men of immense prestige\" and were frequently selected to serve in other high posts.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} During the 17th century, the selectmen were \"an artificial aristocracy\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}} Chances are either they or their fathers may have immigrated from England with slightly more wealth than average.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}} Some helped write the covenant or helped convince the General Court to incorporate the plantation as a town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}} Their status as an aristocrat rested upon their status as a leader of a Utopian community, however, not because they had immense wealth.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}}\n\n===Relationship between Town Meeting and Selectmen===\n====Early years====\n\nWhile the Meeting soon appointed selectmen to handle most of the town's affairs, it was the meeting that created the Board and the Meeting could just as easily dissolve it.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} However, \"its theoretical powers were for the most part symbolic\" and \"[f]ormal review of the acts and accounts of the executive was sporadic and at best perfunctory.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}}{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=39}} \n\nAfter creation of the Board of Selectmen, meetings were generally called only twice a year and usually did not stray far from the agenda prepared for them by the selectmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} In fact, the Meeting would often refer issues to the Selectmen to act upon{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} or to \"prepare and ripen the answer\" to a difficult question.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} Town Meeting typically took on only routine business, such as the election of officers or setting the minister's salary, and left other business to the selectmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}}\n\nThough the Meeting gave \"full power\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=38}} to the Selectmen when they were first established, the Meeting periodically voted to either affirm, deny, or revise those powers.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} The Meeting would occasionally vote on the actions of the Selectmen, and choose to either approve or disapprove of them,{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} but never overturned a substantive decision made by the board.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} In practice, they existed as a legislative veto of the selectmen's power.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} In the exercise of legislative, appointive, financial, judicial, and administrative power, the selectmen were the superior of town meeting.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|pp=552-553}} \n\nIn 1660, the Meeting voted against a motion to give the current Selectmen the same powers the previous board had and, to underscore their disapproval, then voted the entire Board out of office.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} It was the only time an entire board of seven selectmen was voted out.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} After [[Edmund Andros]] was deposed as administrator of the [[Dominion of New England]] on April 18, 1689 following news that [[James II of England]] was [[Glorious Revolution|overthrown]], the people of Dedham rejected every selectman who served during Andros' rule.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=88}} Of the eight men who served from 1687 to 1689, only one would ever be returned to the board and he served only for a single year.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=88}} Five new men, all of whom supported the [[1689 Boston revolt]] and who had just a collective total of two years serving on the board, replaced those who had a total of 50 years service between them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=88}}\n\n====Town Meeting reasserts control====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;

In 1657, there was still 125,000 acres remaining to be distributed to settlers.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=39}} \n\nBetween 1656 and 1667, however, over 15,000 acres were allotted to townsmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} During the first 50 years of Dedham's existence, any man who lived there for 25 years could expect to receive between 50 and 500 acres, with 150 acres being the average.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} It was not a huge farmstead, but it afforded a degree of security to each family and allowed the next generation, including younger sons, to inherit enough land to have a successful farm of their own.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} It also made each farmer a potential [[Yeoman#United_States|yeoman]].{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} As early as 1690, much of the best land had already been claimed and a dividend in that year had to be canceled because the land was not worth the price of surveying.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=149}} \n\nFirst generation farmers could expect to pass on about 150 acres of land to their heirs.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=148}} Second generation farmers could expect to pass on that much or even more between their inheritances and the dividends awarded by the town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=148}} As the generations grew, third generation farms in the early 1700s were about 100 acres. By the end of the 1700s, farmers could expect to inherit only about 50 acres of land, a plot not large enough to support a family.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=149}}\n\n===Farming===\n\nExcept for the lots where homes were built, all the land cultivated was in a common field.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} A common tillage field of 200 was laid out in 1643 and each man was assigned a specific length of fence to build to enclose it.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} As there is no record of clearing the land, it was probably used previously by the native population.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}} He was also assigned a plot of land within the field to cultivate.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} Residents grew corn, beans, peas, and pumpkin.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} Later residents who acquired larger plots of land planted wheat, rye, barley, and oats.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}}\n\nOn what was then called Dedham Island (today [[Dedham,_Massachusetts#Geography|Riverdale]]) and along East Street were common feeding lands, or herd walks, for cattle, goats, and pigs.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}} Another pasture was leased from [[Israel Stoughton]] along the banks of the [[Neponset River]].{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}}\n\n===Insularity===\n\nMost of the original settlers and early arrivals made Dedham their home for the rest of their days.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=63}} Roughly a third of them left for other towns after being admitted to Dedham in the first two decades but that number fell in the following 100 years.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=63}} Less than two percent of men in the town arrived in any given year and less than one percent left.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=64}} Because of the low geographic mobility, the town became \"a self-contained social unit, almost hermetically sealed off from the rest of the world\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=64}} \n\nFrom 1648 to 1688 the number of family names in town decreased from 63 to 57.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} By this time a majority of residents could trace their ancestry back to one of 30 families who had been in Dedham since before 1648.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} This stability was a \"typical, persistent, and highly important feature of Dedham's history\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=64}} A century after settlement, immigration and emigration were still rare.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=139}} Of every 10 men born in Dedham between 1680 and 1700, eight would die there.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=139\u2013140}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=143}} Perhaps no more than 10% left voluntarily, and they were typically wealthier and better connected.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=143}}\n\nBoth the town and its inhabitants tried to avoid using the provincial court system.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} A man could expect to be involved in a civil suit no more than once in his life and criminal proceedings were virtually nonexistent.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} Land transactions in the 1600s were almost always between neighbors, or occasionally with someone in another town if the land in question was on the border.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}}\n\nWhile the settlers recognized the authority of the General Court{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=45}} they did not always follow its laws.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} Their taxes to the colony, which were usually half of what their assessment from the town, were always paid.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} \n\nShortly after the town was incorporated, in November 1636, a loophole was closed to ensure that those who were not committed to the same ideals were not admitted as townsmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}} The Town Meeting voted not to allow any land sales unless the buyer was already a resident of the town, or was approved by a majority of the other voters.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}} Those who violated the law would have all their land confiscated.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}} The next year, in 1637, a total of 46 house lots had been laid out and it was voted to temporarily stop admitting new residents.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}}{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}} As colonial law required all homes to be located close to one another, the town needed time to determine where new residents could be accommodated.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}}\n\nIn 1657, the growth of the town was further limited to descendants of those living there at the time.{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=39}} Newcomers could settle there, so long as they were like-minded, but they would have to buy their way into the community.{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=39}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=81}} Land was no longer freely available for those who wished to join.{{sfn|Brown |Tager|2000|p=39}}\n\nBy 1681, residents were supposed to inform the selectmen of any worker who was expected to stay in town for more than two weeks, though the law was largely ignored.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=288}}\n\n===Wealth===\n\nWith a small population, a simple and agrarian economy, and the free distribution of large tracts of land, there was very little disparity in wealth.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=44}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=72\u201373}} Early residents had largely the same lifestyle and standard of living.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} \n\nThe 5% of men who paid the highest taxes during early years only owned 15% of the property.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} In contrast, the wealthiest 5% of men in nearby Boston controlled 25% of that town's wealth.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} No nobles or gentlemen settled in the town and impoverished \"laborers\" were so rare in a town with free land were nearly nonexistent.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} Even those who were able to garner slightly more wealth still lived the same lifestyle as those with less, including working their own fields.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} \n\nIn the early days anyone who might be considered poor was likely to be a sick widow, an orphan, or \"an improvident walf-wit\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=73\u201374}} In 1690, the poorest 20% of the population owned about 10% of the property.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=151}}\n\nAt least 85% of the population were farmers or, as they called themselves, \"yeoman\" or \"husbandman\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=69}} There were also those who served the farmers, including millers, blacksmiths, or [[Cordwainer|cordwainers]].{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=69}} Like in the English countryside, they were largely subsistence farmers who grew enough for their families{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=69}} but did not specialize in any [[cash crops]] or particular animals.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=70}} \n\nThe first homes were all fairly similar, built with boards and stone fireplaces and chimneys.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} The hip roofs were covered with thatch.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} The first floor would have a living room and kitchen, and sleeping quarters could be reached by ladder in the garret above.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} One resident inventoried his belongings of the \"needful things as every planter doth, or ought to provide to go to New England:\" one iron pot, one kettle, one frying pan, one grid iron, two skillets, one spit, and wooden platters, dishes, spoons, and [[Trencher (tableware)|trenchers]].{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}}\n\nLater homes typically consisted of two to eight rooms with a few beds, chests, and chairs.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} Each person may own two changes of clothes plus a good suit or cloak, and a family may have a little silver or pewter.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} They typically would own a Bible, pots, pans, bowls, and bins.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} Outside of the house, in the barn or lean-to, would be agricultural tools and a few bushels of crops.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} For animals, one or two horses along with several cattle, pigs, and sheep were common.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n===Labor===\nSingle people, including adult children of residents, were not allowed to live alone unless they had sufficient resources to set up their own household with servants.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} Each year, one day was set aside to assign young adult to other households as subordinates.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} The practice was intended to both keep up the family labor system that underpinned the local economy, and was to prevent the \"sin and iniquity ... [that] are the companions and consequences of a solitary life.\"{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} \n\nThe family labor system also young adults in their family homes longer than they might otherwise have been. Town and colony policies kept the value of a child's labor very high.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=297-298}} Records show that children in Massachusetts Bay Colony whose fathers died early, leaving them an inheritance and thus the means to start their own households, married sooner than those whose parents lived longer.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=297}} Nearly two-thirds of orphaned children married before the age of 25, compared to less than half of those with two living parents.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=297}}\n\nA 1693 colonial law allowed for outside labor to come into towns without their employers having to post prohibitively expensive bonds for them.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} If they remained in town for longer than three months without being \"warned out\" by the selectmen, they could remain as an inhabitant.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} The colony raised the limit from three months to one year in 1700.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}}\n\nOnce warned out, an individual could be thrown out of town at any time or treated as a vagabond.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Some stayed after being warned out.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Others left on their own will or were thrown out.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Many, however, were never warned out, especially children.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}}\n\n====Servants====\nIn 1681, there were 28 servants serving in 22 of the 112 households in town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} Of them, all but four were children and 20 of the servants were white.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} There were ten boys, eight girls, two \"Negro boys,\" two \"Indian boys,\" one \"lad,\" and one \"English girl.\"{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} There was also one man, one \"Negro man,\" and two \"maids.\"{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} The servants in town, while they served in 20% of the households,{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} made up only 5% of the population.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=72}} Most of them soon became independent yeomen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=72}} \n\nThe importation of outside labor was rare, averaging about two people or families per year between 1650 and 1769.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} The selectmen allowed most, but not all, of the servants to stay for at least a year, but dictated the conditions by which they could stay.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} \n\nMany of the children who lived in Dedham as servants may have been taken in partly out of charity.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} After [[King Phillip's War]], there were a large number of orphaned children.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} With Dedham's [[History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 1635\u20131699#Relationship with native peoples|strong ties to Deerfield]], it is presumed that some of the children--white and Indian--were casualties of the war.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}}\n\nServants were expected to be treated as members of the family.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} Residents did not want an outsider to come in to work for a specific family and then become a charity case that had to be supported by the entire town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=291-292}} Some households were required to post a bond for their servants.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}}{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} When the selectmen ordered them to go, Thomas Clap was forced to post his saw mill as security in case either of his maid servants should pose a charge to the town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} \n\nUpon the first accounting of all outside servants in 1681, a bond of \u00a35 was usually set for white pre-pubescent children born in New England, \u00a310 for foreign-born or enslaved children, and \u00a320 for those old enough to bear children and create additional expenses for the town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} There was no charge for families who promised to dismiss their child servants before they hit puberty.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Those willing to adopt the children \"as their own\" did not have to pay a bond.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} White orphans of New England birth were cheaper because they could typically be expected to return to their home communities and families.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Native children and those of African descent were likely to be enslaved, and thus to remain in town as adults, and thus higher bonds were required.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} The expense of adult servants made them rare, and held only by the wealthiest families.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}}\n\nSelectmen also had the authority to take children out of homes and put them to work in other households.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} If a household did not pay their full taxes, or if a household was not deemed efficient enough, children could be removed and placed in the homes of richer men.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290-291}} The \"inconviencency and disorder\" in Johyn MacCintosh's family, for example, was the basis for the selectman's order to MacCintosh to put one of his sons out to serve another family.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=291}} When the father refused, the selectmen assigned the child to go to the home of [[Timothy Dwight (Massachusetts)|Timothy Dwight]].{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=291}}\n\n==Parishes, precincts, and new towns==\n\nAs the town's population grew greater and greater, residents began moving further away from the center of town. Until 1682 all Dedhamites had lived within {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of the meetinghouse<ref name=social/> and the trend towards people moving away began slowly.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} \n\nIn the 1670s, with each new dividend of land, farmers began taking shares close to their existing plots.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} This, along with special \"convience grants\" close by their existing fields, allowed townsmen to consolidate their holdings.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} A market for buying and selling land also emerged by which farmers would sell parcels further away from their main plots and buy land closer to them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} When this began happening, residents first started moving their barns closer to their fields and then their homes as well.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} By 1686, homes coalesced in several outlying areas, pulling their owners away from the day-to-day life of the village center.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=94}}\n\nAs the numbers further away grew they began to break off and form new towns beginning with [[Medfield, MA|Medfield]] in 1651 and followed by [[Needham, MA|Needham]] in 1711, [[Bellingham, MA|Bellingham]] in 1719 and [[Walpole, MA|Walpole]] in 1724. The separations were not without difficulty, however.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} When Medfield left there were disagreements about the responsibility for public debts and about land use.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} Wrentham settlers complained that those in the village center were keeping them in a state of colonial dependency before they incorporated as a separate community.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} After Walpole left, Dedham had just 25% of its original land area.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=147}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; \"\n!

buffer between the native peoples and the village of Dedham.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} Medfield and Wrentham, which broke away from Dedham, each suffered at least one Indian raid during the 17th century that would have otherwise struck the mother town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} \n\n===King Phillip===\nIn 1660, [[Timothy Dwight (Massachusetts)|Timoty Dwight]] and [[Richard Ellis (Massachusetts)|Richard Ellis]] negotiated as agents of the town with [[Metacomet|King Phillip]] for title to the land today known as [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]] in 1660.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} They purchased six square miles of land for 24 pounds, six shillings.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} In November 1669, Phillip offered to sell additional lands.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} Dwight and four others were appointed to negotiate with him again, provided Phillip could prove he, and not another [[sachem]], had the rights to the land.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}}\n\nDuring [[King Phillip's War]], men from Dedham went off to fight and several died.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=68}} Plymouth Colony governor [[Josiah Winslow]] and Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] rode from Boston to Dedham to take charge of the 450 soldiers assembling there and together departed on December 8, 1675 for the [[Great Swamp Fight]].<ref name=mayflower/> The [[Battle of Bloody Brook]] took place in is today Deerfield,{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=59}} on land granted to settlers by the colony in return for land taken for Eliot and his Christian Indians.\n\n===Praying Indians===\nIn the middle of the 17th century the Reverend [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and the \"[[praying Indian]]s\" won a lengthy court battle and were awarded the title to the 2,000 acres (8&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land in the town now known as [[Natick, MA|Natick]].<ref name=DHSCapsule/> The dispute, which lasted from 1651 to 1665 and flared up again sporadically in the years following, centered around the Indians' use of a tract of land along the Charles River.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} They claimed they had an agreement to use the land for farming with the Town Fathers, but Dedham officials objected.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}}\n\nEliot had converted many of the native people in the area to Christianity and taught them how to live a stable, agrarian life.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} He converted so many that the group needed a large portion of land on which they could grow their own crops.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} While the law was on the side of the town,{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=84}} Elliot made a moral argument that the group had a need for land of their own.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} \n\nThe case eventually went before the General Court who granted the land in question to the Indians and, in compensation for the land lost, gave another piece of land in what is today [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]] to the Dedham settlers.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=84}} The town's actions in the case were characterized by \"deceptions, retaliations, and lasting bitterness\" and they harassed their native neighbors with petty accusations event after the matter was settled.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=84}}\n\n==Other==\n\n===Cemetery===\n\nThe first portion of the [[Old Village Cemetery]] was set apart at the first recorded meeting of the settlers of Dedham on August 18, 1636, with land taken from Nicholas Phillips and Joseph Kingsbury.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=144}} The original boundaries were roughly Village Avenue on the north, St. Paul's Church in the east, land later added by Dr. Edward Stimson in the south, and the main driveway off Village Avenue in the west.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=145}} It remained the only cemetery in Dedham for nearly 250 years until [[Brookdale Cemetery]] was established.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=146}} \n\n===Early records===\n\nOf towns founded during the colonial era, Dedham is one of the few towns \"that has preserved extensive records of its earliest years\".{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=130}} They have been described as \"very full and perfect\".<ref name=gazetteer/> So detailed were the records that a map of the home lots of the first settlers can be drawn using only the descriptions in the book of grants.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} Many of the records come from [[Timothy Dwight (Massachusetts)|Timothy Dwight]], who served as town clerk for 10 years and selectman for 25.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=102}}\n\nIn 1681, the town voted to collect all deeds and other writings and store them in a box kept by Deacon [[John Aldis (Massachusetts)|John Aldis]] in order to better preserve them.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} The records included four deeds from Indians at [[Petumtuck]], one from

lost.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}}}}\n\n===Land and animals===\n\nWild animals were an issue, and the town placed a bounty on several of them. Upon producing an inch and a half of a rattlesnake, plus the rattle, the killer was entitled to six pence.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=12}} Other bounties were placed on wolves, which were frequently paid, as well as on wildcats.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=12}} In March 1639, 17-year-old John Dwight disappeared near Wigwam Pond, an area known to be particularly infested with wolves.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=12}} A 20 shilling bounty per bobcat was established in 1734, and the last person to claim it [[History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 1793\u20131999#Twentieth century|did so in 1957]].{{sfn|Parr|2009|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nIn 1654, Town Meeting voted to dig a 4000-foot ditch connecting the Charles River at either end of its great loop.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=18}} Doing so created an island, today the neighborhood of Riverdale, and allowed the \"Broad meadow\" that was then there to more easily drain away the flood waters that gathered every spring.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=18}}\n\n===Jonathan Fairbanks===\n\n{{main|Jonathan Fairbanks|Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)}}\n[[File:Fairbanks house dedham.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] is the oldest timber frame house in North America.]]\n\nIn 1637 [[Jonathan Fairbanks]] signed the town Covenant and was allotted {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of land to build [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|his home]], which today is the oldest house in North America.

With an elevation difference of {{convert|40|ft|m}} between the two, however, a canal connecting them would be swift-moving. In 1639 the town ordered that a 4000-foot ditch be dug between the two so that one third of the Charles' water would flow down what would become known as [[Mother Brook]] and into the Neponset. Abraham Shaw would begin construction of the first dam and mill on the Brook in 1641 and it would be completed by John Elderkin, who later built the first church in [[New London, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Abbott|1903|pp=290\u2013297}}\n\n===First public school===\n\n{{Main|Dedham Public Schools}}\n[[File:First school.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first taxpayer-funded public school in the United States was in Dedham.]]\n\nOn January 1, 1644, by unanimous vote, Dedham authorized the first U.S. taxpayer-funded [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]; \"the seed of American education\".<ref name=school/> Its first teacher, [[Ralph Wheelock|Rev.

The originally settlers, who built their village on land the native people called Tiot, incorporated the plantation in 1636. The sought to build a community in which all would live out Christian love in their daily lives, and for a time did, but the Utopian impulse did not last. The system of government they devised was both \"a peculiar oligarchy\" and a \"a most peculiar democracy\". Most freemen could participate in Town Meeting, though they soon established a [[Board of Selectmen]]. Power and initiative ebbed and flowed between the two bodies.\n\nThe settlers then undertook the difficult task of establishing a church, drafting its doctrinal base, and selecting a minister. In early days nearly every resident was a member but, seeking a church of only \"visible saints\", membership declined over time. Though the \"[[half-way covenant]]\" was proposed in 1657 and endorsed by the minister, the congregation rejected it.\n\nPopulation grew from about 200 people in early days to around 700 by 1800, with land being distributed according to rank and family size. Though it was given out sparingly in general, lands were also awarded in return for service to the church and the community. The town remained insular during the early years, with the community remaining self contained. With a small population, a simple and agrarian economy, and the free distribution of large tracts of land, there was very little disparity in wealth.\n\nAs the town grew, new towns broke off from Dedham, beginning with [[Medfield, Massachusetts|Medfield]] in 1651. With the division and subdivision of so many communities, Dedham has been called the \"Mother of Towns.\" Of towns founded during the colonial era, Dedham is one of the few towns \"that has preserved extensive records of its earliest years\". This has enabled historians to date the [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] as the oldest tinder house in America and [[Mother Brook]] as the first man-made canal in America. It also establishes the [[Dedham Public Schools]] as the first public school in the country.\n\n==Utopian commune==\n\nLike its surrounding communities, Dedham's early culture was much like the English villages where its original settlers were born and small agricultural communities all over Europe.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=xiv}} A number of the customs and institutions in the town were direct transplants from contemporary English villages.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} However, as a settlement of English [[Puritans]] who escaped oppression to settle in the wilderness, \"Dedham was peculiarly American.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=xv}} \n\nIt was originally intended to be a [[Utopian]] society along the lines of the later [[Amana Colonies]], [[Oneida Community]], and [[Brook Farm]].{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=1}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=7}} In \"its first years, the town was more than a place to live; it was a spiritual community.\"{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=130}} Its distinctive characteristics created what has been described as a \"Christian Utopian Closed Corporate Community\":\n<blockquote>Christian because they saw Christian love as the force which would most completely unite their community. Utopian because theirs was a highly conscious attempt to build the most prefect possible community, as perfectly united, perfectly at peace, and perfectly ordered as man could arrange. Closed because its membership was selected while outsiders were treated with suspicion or rejected altogether. And Corporate because the commune demanded the loyalty of its members, offering in exchange privileges which could be obtained only through membership, not the least of which were peace and good order.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=16\u201317}}</blockquote>\n\nEach of the original settlers pledged to live out [[Christian love]] in their daily lives.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=5}} Each was also expected to be united in this love as it was designed to bring about a deep and abiding peace throughout the whole community.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=5}} Inquiries could also be made into the private lives of townsmen, and adjustments ordered when a resident's life was not as virtuous as the community felt it should be.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=15}} \n\nNone who were not committed to this ideal were to be admitted as townsmen and, if the need arose, they were to be expelled.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=5\u20136}} The commitment in the Covenant to allow only like-minded individuals to live within the town explains why \"church records show no instances of dissension, Quaker or Baptist expulsions, or witchcraft persecutions.\"<ref name=DHSCapsule/> The Covenant was intended to extend beyond the lifetimes if those who wrote it and to be binding upon all residents in perpetuity.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=7}} \n\nThe poor would be helped if they were residents of Dedham, but sent away if they were not.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=15}} In addition to paying taxes, each man was expected to labor on communal projects several days each month.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} Every year, six days were set aside to work on roads and each man was expected to work n four of them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=80}} Townsmen also took turns serving in a variety of low level offices, including

to the Puritan belief of a natural inequality among men as being divine providence.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=11}} Still, the relative economic equality kept social rank to a minimum and helped maintain social harmony.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=73\u201374}} Men could live their entire lives in this community among their equals and on their own land.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=74}} This was, according to one commentator, the \"[[City_upon_a_Hill#\"A_Model_of_Christian_Charity\"|plan of the society]] [John] Winthrop hoped to construct in Massachusetts was the plan of Dedham writ large.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=16}} In 1729, however, the tax rolls stopped listing the names of the most prominent citizens first, as had been done by the rank conscious first settlers, and instead listed names alphabetically.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=144}}\n\n===Decline===\n\nThe Utopian impulse did not last, however, and \"the policies of perfection\" no longer dominated just 50 years after the establishment of the community.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=79}} By the 1640s the town began permitting residents to fence in their strips of land in the common field and, presumably, to grow whatever crop they wanted in it.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=81}} By reducing and eventually eliminating the common field system, it reduced the number of interactions each farmer had with his neighbors and made one less decision they had to make and employ in common.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} \n\nBy about 1660, not every newcomer to town was invited to sign the Covenant making them \"by implication [[second class citizen|second class citizens]]\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=81}} Laws that restricted the presence of strangers were rarely enforced after 1675 and disputes went to mediators with less frequency.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=84\u201385}}{{efn|During the early days of the settlement, the Selectmen voted to ask an Irishman and his wife, who were visiting friends, to leave town as soon as

in office for them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=80}}\n\nAlso around this time evidence of the \"loving spirit\" proclaimed in the Covenant \"came to be conspicuous by [its] absence\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=85}} Records of open dissent began appearing, first about seating placements in the meetinghouse.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=85}} The number of yea and nay votes also began

overt Utopian spirit the founders had instilled 50 years prior had been destroyed.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=85}} By the end of the first century, public disagreements seemed to be the rule rather than the exception{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=124}} and decisions were made by majority, not consensus.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=136}} \n\nThe Covenant was no longer enforced nor served as the guide for every decision by the time the town reached its 50th anniversary.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=89}} It lasted well into the second generation and was, according to one commentator, \"longer than anyone had a right to expect\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=90}} Still, the town remained small and slow growing, with little change to institutional structures or traditional views.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=89}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=91}}\n\nBy 1675, taxpayers paid more the county and colony than they did to the town, reflecting a growing importance of the regional bodies and the cost of the colony expanding westward.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=136}} After 1691, as the county grew more powerful, the town began more closely following the law lest they get fined.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=136}} Residents were also more likely to use the court system to settle disputes than they were to go use the arbitration method laid out in the covenant.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=137}}\n\n==Incorporation==\n\nIn 1635 there were rumors in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] that a war with the local [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] was impending and a fear arose that the few, small, coastal communities that existed were in danger of attack.<ref name=DHSCapsule/> This, in addition to the belief that the few towns that did exist were too close together, prompted the [[Massachusetts General Court]] to establish two new inland communities.<ref name=DHSCapsule/>\n\nTwelve men{{Efn|Including [[John Kingsbury]].<ref

additional land on both sides of the river.{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} These petitions were granted and within a few years a 200 square mile tract of rocky, hilly land was known as the Town of Dedham.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=94}} The grant from the colony gave them over \"two hundred square miles of virgin wilderness, complete with lakes, hills, forests, meadows,

Dorchester to the [[Rhode Island]] and [[Plymouth Colony]] borders.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}}{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=5}} To the west were ungranted lands.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=5}} The less than 100 Indians who lived on the land sold it for a small sum.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=4}} Early settlers gave places names such as Dismal Swamp, Purgatory Brook, Satan's Kingdom, and Devil's Oven.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=11}}\n\nAt the same time Dedham was incorporated, the General Court established the Town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].<ref name=DHSCapsule/> Together they helped relieve the growing population pressure and to place communities between the larger, more established coastal towns and the Indians further west.<ref name=DHSCapsule/>\n\nThe settlers petitioned the General Court to incorporate the plantation into a town, and to free the town from all \"Countrey Charges\", or taxes, for four years and from all military exercises unless \"extraordinary occasion require it\".<ref name=EarlyRecords/>{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=3}} The General Court granted only a three-year reprieve from taxes.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=4}}\n\nThey also asked to \"distinguish our town by the name of Contentment\"<ref name=EarlyRecords/> but when the \"prosaic minds\" in the Court granted the petition on September 7, 1636 they decreed that the \"towne shall beare the name of

asked the Court to name it after their hometown in England of [[Dedham, Essex]].{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=5}}\n\nThe town was named for [[Dedham, Essex]], where some of the original inhabitants, including John Dwight, John Page and John Rogers had been born.{{sfn|Abbott|1903|pp=290\u2013297}}{{sfn|Barber|1848|p=455}} \"Contentment\" eventually became the motto of the town.

they served on average eight terms each.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} In that time period there were 10 men who served an average of 20 terms each.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} They made up only 5% of the population but filled 60% of the seats on the Board.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} An additional 15 men served an average of 10 terms each, filling 30% of the seats.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=43}} These 15 usually left office only when they had an early death or they removed from town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=42}} If a man served more than three terms he could usually count on returning for many more.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=44}} \n\nThe burdens of office could take up to a third of their time during busy seasons.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} They served without salary and came up through the ranks of lower offices.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} In return they became \"men of immense prestige\" and were frequently selected to serve in other high posts.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=46}} During the 17th century, the selectmen were \"an artificial aristocracy\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}} Chances are either they or their fathers may have immigrated from England with slightly more wealth than average.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}} Some helped write the covenant or helped convince the General Court to incorporate the plantation as a town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}} Their status as an aristocrat rested upon their status as a leader of a Utopian community, however, not because they had immense wealth.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=130}}\n\n===Relationship between Town Meeting and Selectmen===\n====Early years====\n\nWhile the Meeting soon appointed selectmen to handle most of the town's affairs, it was the meeting that created the Board and the Meeting could just as easily dissolve it.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} However, \"its theoretical powers were for the most part symbolic\" and \"[f]ormal review of the acts and accounts of the executive was sporadic and at best perfunctory.\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}}{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=39}} \n\nAfter creation of the Board of Selectmen, meetings were generally called only twice a year and usually did not stray far from the agenda prepared for them by the selectmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} In fact, the Meeting would often refer issues to the Selectmen to act upon{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} or to \"prepare and ripen the answer\" to a difficult question.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} Town Meeting typically took on only routine business, such as the election of officers or setting the minister's salary, and left other business to the selectmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}}\n\nThough the Meeting gave \"full power\"{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=38}} to the Selectmen when they were first established, the Meeting periodically voted to either affirm, deny, or revise those powers.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}}{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} The Meeting would occasionally vote on the actions of the Selectmen, and choose to either approve or disapprove of them,{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} but never overturned a substantive decision made by the board.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} In practice, they existed as a legislative veto of the selectmen's power.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|p=552}} In the exercise of legislative, appointive, financial, judicial, and administrative power, the selectmen were the superior of town meeting.{{sfn|Lockridge|Kreider|1966|pp=552-553}} \n\nIn 1660, the Meeting voted against a motion to give the current Selectmen the same powers the previous board had and, to underscore their disapproval, then voted the entire Board out of office.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=47}} It was the only time an entire board of seven selectmen was voted out.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=48}} After [[Edmund Andros]] was deposed as administrator of the [[Dominion of New England]] on April 18, 1689 following news that [[James II of England]] was [[Glorious Revolution|overthrown]], the people of Dedham rejected every selectman who served during Andros' rule.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=88}} Of the eight men who served from 1687 to 1689, only one would ever be returned to the board and he served only for a single year.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=88}} Five new men, all of whom supported the [[1689 Boston revolt]] and who had just a collective total of two years serving on the board, replaced those who had a total of 50 years service between them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=88}}\n\n====Town Meeting reasserts control====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;

In 1657, there was still 125,000 acres remaining to be distributed to settlers.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=39}} \n\nBetween 1656 and 1667, however, over 15,000 acres were allotted to townsmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} During the first 50 years of Dedham's existence, any man who lived there for 25 years could expect to receive between 50 and 500 acres, with 150 acres being the average.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} It was not a huge farmstead, but it afforded a degree of security to each family and allowed the next generation, including younger sons, to inherit enough land to have a successful farm of their own.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} It also made each farmer a potential [[Yeoman#United_States|yeoman]].{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=71}} As early as 1690, much of the best land had already been claimed and a dividend in that year had to be canceled because the land was not worth the price of surveying.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=149}} \n\nFirst generation farmers could expect to pass on about 150 acres of land to their heirs.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=148}} Second generation farmers could expect to pass on that much or even more between their inheritances and the dividends awarded by the town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=148}} As the generations grew, third generation farms in the early 1700s were about 100 acres. By the end of the 1700s, farmers could expect to inherit only about 50 acres of land, a plot not large enough to support a family.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=149}}\n\n===Farming===\n\nExcept for the lots where homes were built, all the land cultivated was in a common field.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} A common tillage field of 200 was laid out in 1643 and each man was assigned a specific length of fence to build to enclose it.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} As there is no record of clearing the land, it was probably used previously by the native population.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}} He was also assigned a plot of land within the field to cultivate.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} Residents grew corn, beans, peas, and pumpkin.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} Later residents who acquired larger plots of land planted wheat, rye, barley, and oats.{{Sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}}\n\nOn what was then called Dedham Island (today [[Dedham,_Massachusetts#Geography|Riverdale]]) and along East Street were common feeding lands, or herd walks, for cattle, goats, and pigs.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}} Another pasture was leased from [[Israel Stoughton]] along the banks of the [[Neponset River]].{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}}\n\n===Insularity===\n\nMost of the original settlers and early arrivals made Dedham their home for the rest of their days.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=63}} Roughly a third of them left for other towns after being admitted to Dedham in the first two decades but that number fell in the following 100 years.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=63}} Less than two percent of men in the town arrived in any given year and less than one percent left.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=64}} Because of the low geographic mobility, the town became \"a self-contained social unit, almost hermetically sealed off from the rest of the world\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=64}} \n\nFrom 1648 to 1688 the number of family names in town decreased from 63 to 57.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} By this time a majority of residents could trace their ancestry back to one of 30 families who had been in Dedham since before 1648.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} This stability was a \"typical, persistent, and highly important feature of Dedham's history\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=64}} A century after settlement, immigration and emigration were still rare.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=139}} Of every 10 men born in Dedham between 1680 and 1700, eight would die there.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=139\u2013140}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=143}} Perhaps no more than 10% left voluntarily, and they were typically wealthier and better connected.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=143}}\n\nBoth the town and its inhabitants tried to avoid using the provincial court system.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} A man could expect to be involved in a civil suit no more than once in his life and criminal proceedings were virtually nonexistent.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} Land transactions in the 1600s were almost always between neighbors, or occasionally with someone in another town if the land in question was on the border.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}}\n\nWhile the settlers recognized the authority of the General Court{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=45}} they did not always follow its laws.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} Their taxes to the colony, which were usually half of what their assessment from the town, were always paid.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=65}} \n\nShortly after the town was incorporated, in November 1636, a loophole was closed to ensure that those who were not committed to the same ideals were not admitted as townsmen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}} The Town Meeting voted not to allow any land sales unless the buyer was already a resident of the town, or was approved by a majority of the other voters.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}} Those who violated the law would have all their land confiscated.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}} The next year, in 1637, a total of 46 house lots had been laid out and it was voted to temporarily stop admitting new residents.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=8}}{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}} As colonial law required all homes to be located close to one another, the town needed time to determine where new residents could be accommodated.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=13}}\n\nIn 1657, the growth of the town was further limited to descendants of those living there at the time.{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=39}} Newcomers could settle there, so long as they were like-minded, but they would have to buy their way into the community.{{sfn|Brown | Tager|2000|p=39}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=81}} Land was no longer freely available for those who wished to join.{{sfn|Brown |Tager|2000|p=39}}\n\nBy 1681, residents were supposed to inform the selectmen of any worker who was expected to stay in town for more than two weeks, though the law was largely ignored.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=288}}\n\n===Wealth===\n\nWith a small population, a simple and agrarian economy, and the free distribution of large tracts of land, there was very little disparity in wealth.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=44}}{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=72\u201373}} Early residents had largely the same lifestyle and standard of living.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} \n\nThe 5% of men who paid the highest taxes during early years only owned 15% of the property.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} In contrast, the wealthiest 5% of men in nearby Boston controlled 25% of that town's wealth.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} No nobles or gentlemen settled in the town and impoverished \"laborers\" were so rare in a town with free land were nearly nonexistent.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} Even those who were able to garner slightly more wealth still lived the same lifestyle as those with less, including working their own fields.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=73}} \n\nIn the early days anyone who might be considered poor was likely to be a sick widow, an orphan, or \"an improvident walf-wit\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=73\u201374}} In 1690, the poorest 20% of the population owned about 10% of the property.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=151}}\n\nAt least 85% of the population were farmers or, as they called themselves, \"yeoman\" or \"husbandman\".{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=69}} There were also those who served the farmers, including millers, blacksmiths, or [[Cordwainer|cordwainers]].{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=69}} Like in the English countryside, they were largely subsistence farmers who grew enough for their families{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=69}} but did not specialize in any [[cash crops]] or particular animals.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=70}} \n\nThe first homes were all fairly similar, built with boards and stone fireplaces and chimneys.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} The hip roofs were covered with thatch.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} The first floor would have a living room and kitchen, and sleeping quarters could be reached by ladder in the garret above.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} One resident inventoried his belongings of the \"needful things as every planter doth, or ought to provide to go to New England:\" one iron pot, one kettle, one frying pan, one grid iron, two skillets, one spit, and wooden platters, dishes, spoons, and [[Trencher (tableware)|trenchers]].{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}}\n\nLater homes typically consisted of two to eight rooms with a few beds, chests, and chairs.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} Each person may own two changes of clothes plus a good suit or cloak, and a family may have a little silver or pewter.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} They typically would own a Bible, pots, pans, bowls, and bins.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} Outside of the house, in the barn or lean-to, would be agricultural tools and a few bushels of crops.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}} For animals, one or two horses along with several cattle, pigs, and sheep were common.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n===Labor===\nSingle people, including adult children of residents, were not allowed to live alone unless they had sufficient resources to set up their own household with servants.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} Each year, one day was set aside to assign young adult to other households as subordinates.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} The practice was intended to both keep up the family labor system that underpinned the local economy, and was to prevent the \"sin and iniquity ... [that] are the companions and consequences of a solitary life.\"{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} \n\nThe family labor system also young adults in their family homes longer than they might otherwise have been. Town and colony policies kept the value of a child's labor very high.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=297-298}} Records show that children in Massachusetts Bay Colony whose fathers died early, leaving them an inheritance and thus the means to start their own households, married sooner than those whose parents lived longer.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=297}} Nearly two-thirds of orphaned children married before the age of 25, compared to less than half of those with two living parents.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=297}}\n\nA 1693 colonial law allowed for outside labor to come into towns without their employers having to post prohibitively expensive bonds for them.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} If they remained in town for longer than three months without being \"warned out\" by the selectmen, they could remain as an inhabitant.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} The colony raised the limit from three months to one year in 1700.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}}\n\nOnce warned out, an individual could be thrown out of town at any time or treated as a vagabond.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Some stayed after being warned out.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Others left on their own will or were thrown out.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Many, however, were never warned out, especially children.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}}\n\n====Servants====\nIn 1681, there were 28 servants serving in 22 of the 112 households in town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} Of them, all but four were children and 20 of the servants were white.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} There were ten boys, eight girls, two \"Negro boys,\" two \"Indian boys,\" one \"lad,\" and one \"English girl.\"{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} There was also one man, one \"Negro man,\" and two \"maids.\"{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} The servants in town, while they served in 20% of the households,{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} made up only 5% of the population.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=72}} Most of them soon became independent yeomen.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=72}} \n\nThe importation of outside labor was rare, averaging about two people or families per year between 1650 and 1769.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} The selectmen allowed most, but not all, of the servants to stay for at least a year, but dictated the conditions by which they could stay.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} \n\nMany of the children who lived in Dedham as servants may have been taken in partly out of charity.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} After [[King Phillip's War]], there were a large number of orphaned children.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}} With Dedham's [[History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 1635\u20131699#Relationship with native peoples|strong ties to Deerfield]], it is presumed that some of the children--white and Indian--were casualties of the war.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}}\n\nServants were expected to be treated as members of the family.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} Residents did not want an outsider to come in to work for a specific family and then become a charity case that had to be supported by the entire town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=291-292}} Some households were required to post a bond for their servants.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=289}}{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} When the selectmen ordered them to go, Thomas Clap was forced to post his saw mill as security in case either of his maid servants should pose a charge to the town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} \n\nUpon the first accounting of all outside servants in 1681, a bond of \u00a35 was usually set for white pre-pubescent children born in New England, \u00a310 for foreign-born or enslaved children, and \u00a320 for those old enough to bear children and create additional expenses for the town.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} There was no charge for families who promised to dismiss their child servants before they hit puberty.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Those willing to adopt the children \"as their own\" did not have to pay a bond.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=292}} White orphans of New England birth were cheaper because they could typically be expected to return to their home communities and families.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} Native children and those of African descent were likely to be enslaved, and thus to remain in town as adults, and thus higher bonds were required.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}} The expense of adult servants made them rare, and held only by the wealthiest families.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=293}}\n\nSelectmen also had the authority to take children out of homes and put them to work in other households.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290}} If a household did not pay their full taxes, or if a household was not deemed efficient enough, children could be removed and placed in the homes of richer men.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=290-291}} The \"inconviencency and disorder\" in Johyn MacCintosh's family, for example, was the basis for the selectman's order to MacCintosh to put one of his sons out to serve another family.{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=291}} When the father refused, the selectmen assigned the child to go to the home of [[Timothy Dwight (Massachusetts)|Timothy Dwight]].{{sfn|Levy|1997|p=291}}\n\n==Parishes, precincts, and new towns==\n\nAs the town's population grew greater and greater, residents began moving further away from the center of town. Until 1682 all Dedhamites had lived within {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of the meetinghouse<ref name=social/> and the trend towards people moving away began slowly.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} \n\nIn the 1670s, with each new dividend of land, farmers began taking shares close to their existing plots.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} This, along with special \"convience grants\" close by their existing fields, allowed townsmen to consolidate their holdings.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} A market for buying and selling land also emerged by which farmers would sell parcels further away from their main plots and buy land closer to them.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} When this began happening, residents first started moving their barns closer to their fields and then their homes as well.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=82}} By 1686, homes coalesced in several outlying areas, pulling their owners away from the day-to-day life of the village center.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=94}}\n\nAs the numbers further away grew they began to break off and form new towns beginning with [[Medfield, MA|Medfield]] in 1651 and followed by [[Needham, MA|Needham]] in 1711, [[Bellingham, MA|Bellingham]] in 1719 and [[Walpole, MA|Walpole]] in 1724. The separations were not without difficulty, however.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} When Medfield left there were disagreements about the responsibility for public debts and about land use.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} Wrentham settlers complained that those in the village center were keeping them in a state of colonial dependency before they incorporated as a separate community.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} After Walpole left, Dedham had just 25% of its original land area.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=147}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; \"\n!

buffer between the native peoples and the village of Dedham.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} Medfield and Wrentham, which broke away from Dedham, each suffered at least one Indian raid during the 17th century that would have otherwise struck the mother town.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=95}} \n\n===King Phillip===\nIn 1660, [[Timothy Dwight (Massachusetts)|Timoty Dwight]] and [[Richard Ellis (Massachusetts)|Richard Ellis]] negotiated as agents of the town with [[Metacomet|King Phillip]] for title to the land today known as [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]] in 1660.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} They purchased six square miles of land for 24 pounds, six shillings.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} In November 1669, Phillip offered to sell additional lands.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} Dwight and four others were appointed to negotiate with him again, provided Phillip could prove he, and not another [[sachem]], had the rights to the land.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}}\n\nDuring [[King Phillip's War]], men from Dedham went off to fight and several died.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=68}} Plymouth Colony governor [[Josiah Winslow]] and Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] rode from Boston to Dedham to take charge of the 450 soldiers assembling there and together departed on December 8, 1675 for the [[Great Swamp Fight]].<ref name=mayflower/> The [[Battle of Bloody Brook]] took place in is today Deerfield,{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=59}} on land granted to settlers by the colony in return for land taken for Eliot and his Christian Indians.\n\n===Praying Indians===\nIn the middle of the 17th century the Reverend [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and the \"[[praying Indian]]s\" won a lengthy court battle and were awarded the title to the 2,000 acres (8&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land in the town now known as [[Natick, MA|Natick]].<ref name=DHSCapsule/> The dispute, which lasted from 1651 to 1665 and flared up again sporadically in the years following, centered around the Indians' use of a tract of land along the Charles River.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} They claimed they had an agreement to use the land for farming with the Town Fathers, but Dedham officials objected.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}}\n\nEliot had converted many of the native people in the area to Christianity and taught them how to live a stable, agrarian life.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} He converted so many that the group needed a large portion of land on which they could grow their own crops.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} While the law was on the side of the town,{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=84}} Elliot made a moral argument that the group had a need for land of their own.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=83}} \n\nThe case eventually went before the General Court who granted the land in question to the Indians and, in compensation for the land lost, gave another piece of land in what is today [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]] to the Dedham settlers.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=84}} The town's actions in the case were characterized by \"deceptions, retaliations, and lasting bitterness\" and they harassed their native neighbors with petty accusations event after the matter was settled.{{sfn|Lockridge|1985|p=84}}\n\n==Other==\n\n===Cemetery===\n\nThe first portion of the [[Old Village Cemetery]] was set apart at the first recorded meeting of the settlers of Dedham on August 18, 1636, with land taken from Nicholas Phillips and Joseph Kingsbury.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=144}} The original boundaries were roughly Village Avenue on the north, St. Paul's Church in the east, land later added by Dr. Edward Stimson in the south, and the main driveway off Village Avenue in the west.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=145}} It remained the only cemetery in Dedham for nearly 250 years until [[Brookdale Cemetery]] was established.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=146}} \n\n===Early records===\n\nOf towns founded during the colonial era, Dedham is one of the few towns \"that has preserved extensive records of its earliest years\".{{sfn|Mansbridge|1980|p=130}} They have been described as \"very full and perfect\".<ref name=gazetteer/> So detailed were the records that a map of the home lots of the first settlers can be drawn using only the descriptions in the book of grants.{{sfn|Smith|1936|p=12}} Many of the records come from [[Timothy Dwight (Massachusetts)|Timothy Dwight]], who served as town clerk for 10 years and selectman for 25.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=102}}\n\nIn 1681, the town voted to collect all deeds and other writings and store them in a box kept by Deacon [[John Aldis (Massachusetts)|John Aldis]] in order to better preserve them.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}} The records included four deeds from Indians at [[Petumtuck]], one from [[Needham, Massachusetts#Early settlement|Chief Nehoiden]], one from Magus, and one deed and one receipt from [[Metacomet|King Phillip]].{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}}{{efn|These deeds have since been lost.{{sfn|Dwight|1874|p=103}}}}\n\n===Land and animals===\n\nWild animals were an issue, and the town placed a bounty on several of them. Upon producing an inch and a half of a rattlesnake, plus the rattle, the killer was entitled to six pence.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=12}} Other bounties were placed on wolves, which were frequently paid, as well as on wildcats.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=12}} In March 1639, 17-year-old John Dwight disappeared near Wigwam Pond, an area known to be particularly infested with wolves.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=12}} A 20 shilling bounty per bobcat was established in 1734, and the last person to claim it [[History of Dedham, Massachusetts, 1793\u20131999#Twentieth century|did so in 1957]].{{sfn|Parr|2009|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nIn 1654, Town Meeting voted to dig a 4000-foot ditch connecting the Charles River at either end of its great loop.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=18}} Doing so created an island, today the neighborhood of Riverdale, and allowed the \"Broad meadow\" that was then there to more easily drain away the flood waters that gathered every spring.{{sfn|Parr|2009|p=18}}\n\n===Jonathan Fairbanks===\n\n{{main|Jonathan Fairbanks|Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)}}\n[[File:Fairbanks house dedham.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] is the oldest timber frame house in North America.]]\n\nIn 1637 [[Jonathan Fairbanks]] signed the town Covenant and was allotted {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of land to build [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|his home]], which today is the oldest house in North America.

Mahayana (red arrow), Theravada (green arrow), and Tantric-Vajrayana (blue arrow).]]\n{{Buddhism}}\nThe '''history of Buddhism''' spans from the 6th century BCE to the present. [[Buddhism]] arose in the eastern part of [[Ancient India]], in and around the ancient Kingdom of [[Magadha]] (now in [[Bihar]], [[India]]), and is based on the teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama|Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]]. This makes it one of the oldest religions practiced today. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent through [[Central Asia|Central]], [[East Asia|East]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. At one time or another, it influenced most of the Asian continent. The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements, schisms, and schools, among them the [[Theravada|Therav\u0101da]], [[Mahayana|Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajray\u0101na]] traditions, with contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.\n\n==Life of the Buddha==\n[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|thumb|250px|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics around the lifetime of [[Gautama Buddha]] (563\u2013483 BCE), located mainly across the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plains]], there were also a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[Ancient India]].]]\n[[Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]] was the historical founder of [[Buddhism]]. The early sources state he was born in the small [[Shakya]] (Pali: Sakka) Republic, which was part of the [[Kosala]] realm of [[Janapada|ancient India]], now in modern-day [[Nepal]].<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 14\">Harvey, 2012, p. 14.</ref> He is thus also known as the ''Shakyamuni'' (literally: \"The sage of the Shakya clan\"). The republic was ruled by a council of household heads, and Gautama was born to one of these elites so that he described himself as a [[Kshatriya]] when talking to Brahmins.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 14\"/> The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] contain no continuous life of the Buddha, only later after 200 BCE were various \"biographies\" with much mythological embellishment written.<ref>Harvey, 2012, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> All texts agree however that Gautama renounced the householder life and lived as a [[\u015arama\u1e47a|sramana]] [[Asceticism|ascetic]] for some time studying under various teachers, before attaining [[nirvana]] (extinguishment) and [[bodhi]] (awakening) through meditation.\n\nFor the remaining 45 years of his life, he traveled the [[Gangetic Plain]] of central [[India]] (the region of the [[Ganges River|Ganges/Ganga river]] and its tributaries), teaching his doctrine to a diverse range of people from different [[Caste system in India|castes]] and initiating monks into his order. The Buddha sent his disciples to spread the teaching across India. He also initiated an order of nuns.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 24\">Harvey, 2012, p. 24.</ref> He urged his disciples to teach in the local language or dialects.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 25.</ref> He spent a lot of his time near the cities of [[Shravasti|S\u0101vatth\u012b]], [[Rajgir|R\u0101jagaha]] and [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] (Skt. \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b, R\u0101jagrha, V\u0101i\u015bal\u012b).<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 24\"/> By the time of his death at 80, he had thousands of followers.\n\nThe years following the death of the Buddha saw the emergence of many movements during the next 400 years: first the schools of [[Nikaya Buddhism]], of which only [[Theravada]] remains today, and then the formation of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]], pan-Buddhist sects based on the acceptance of new scriptures and the revision of older techniques.\n\nFollowers of Buddhism, called '''Buddhists''' in English, referred to themselves as ''Sakyan''-s or ''Sakyabhiksu'' in ancient India.<ref>''Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity'' by Richard Cohen. Routledge 1999. {{ISBN|0415544440}}. p. 33. \"Donors adopted Sakyamuni Buddha\u2019s family name to assert their legitimacy as his heirs, both institutionally and ideologically. To take the name of Sakya was to define oneself by one\u2019s affiliation with the buddha, somewhat like calling oneself a Buddhist today.</ref><ref>''Sakya or Buddhist Origins'' by Caroline Rhys Davids (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1931) p. 1. \"Put away the word \u201cBuddhism\u201d and think of your subject as \u201cSakya.\u201d This will at once place you for your perspective at a true point.   You are now concerned to learn less about 'Buddha' and 'Buddhism,' and more about him whom India has ever known as Sakya-muni, and about his men who, as their records admit, were spoken of as the Sakya-sons, or men of the Sakyas.\"</ref> Buddhist scholar Donald S. Lopez asserts they also used the term ''Bauddha'',<ref>'' Curators of the Buddha'' By Donald S. Lopez. University of Chicago Press. p. 7</ref> although scholar Richard Cohen asserts that that term was used only by outsiders to describe Buddhists.<ref>''Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity'' by Richard Cohen. Routledge 1999. {{ISBN|0415544440}}. p. 33. Bauddha is \"a secondary derivative of buddha, in which the vowel\u2019s lengthening indicates connection or relation. Things that are bauddha pertain to the buddha, just as things Saiva related to Siva and things Vaisnava belong to Visnu. ... baudda can be both adjectival and nominal; it can be used for doctrines spoken by the buddha, objects enjoyed by him, texts attributed to him, as well as individuals, communities, and societies that offer him reverence or accept ideologies certified through his name. Strictly speaking, Sakya is preferable to bauddha since the latter is not attested at Ajanta. In fact, as a collective noun, bauddha is an outsider\u2019s term. The bauddha did not call themselves this in India, though they did sometimes use the word adjectivally (e.g., as a possessive, the buddha's).\"</ref>\n\n===Buddhism Early Ages===\n{{Further|Early Buddhism}}\n[[File:Hutchinsonsstory00londuoft 0169.jpg|thumb|200px|The image, in the chapter on India in ''Hutchison's Story of the Nations'', depicting [[Ajatashatru]] visiting the Buddha to assuage his guilt.]]\nAfter the death of the Buddha, the Buddhist [[sangha]] (monastic community) remained centered on the Ganges valley, spreading gradually from its ancient heartland. The canonical sources record various councils, where the monastic [[Sangha]] recited and organized the orally transmitted collections of the Buddha's teachings and settled certain disciplinary problems within the community. Modern scholarship has questioned the accuracy and historicity of these traditional accounts.<ref>Berkwitz, Stephen C. South Asian Buddhism: A Survey, Routledge, 2012, p. 43.</ref>\n\nThe first Buddhist council is traditionally said to have been held just after Buddha's [[Parinirvana]], and presided over by [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa]], one of His most senior disciples, at R\u0101jag\u1e5bha (today's [[Rajgir]]) with the support of king [[Ajatashatru|Aj\u0101tha\u015batru]]. According to Charles Prebish, almost all scholars have questioned the historicity of this first council.<ref>Prebish, Charles S. Buddhism: A Person said to have caused the first schism of the Sangha into the [[Sthavira nik\u0101ya|Sthavira]] (Elders) and [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mahasamghika]] (Great Sangha). Most scholars agree that the schism was caused by disagreements over points of [[vinaya]] (monastic discipline).</ref><ref>Harvey, Peter (2013). ''An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History, and Practices (2nd ed.).'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pp. 88\u201390.</ref> Over time, these two monastic fraternities would further divide into various [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist Schools]]. The Sthaviras gave birth to a large number of influential schools including the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]], the [[Pudgalav\u0101da]] (also known as ''Vats\u012bputr\u012bya''), the [[Dharmaguptaka]]s and the [[Vibhajyav\u0101da]] ([[Theravada|Therav\u0101dins]] being descended from these). The [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mahasamghikas]] meanwhile also developed their own schools and doctrines early on, which can be seen in texts like the [[Mahavastu]], associated with the [[Lokottarav\u0101da]], or \u2018Transcendentalist\u2019 school, who might be the same as the [[Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika]]s or \"One-utterancers\".<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 98\">Harvey, 2012, p. 98.</ref> This school has been seen as foreshadowing certain [[Mahayana]] ideas, especially due to their view that all of Gautama Buddha's acts were \"transcendental\" or \"supramundane\", even those performed before his Buddhahood.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 98\"/>\n\nIn the third century BCE, some Buddhists began introducing new systematized teachings called [[Abhidharma]], based on previous lists or tables (''Matrka'') of main doctrinal topics.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 90\">Harvey, 2012, p. 90.</ref> Unlike the [[Nik\u0101ya|Nikayas]], which were prose [[Sutta Pitaka|sutras]] or discourses, the Abhidharma literature consisted of systematic doctrinal exposition and often differed across the Buddhist schools who disagreed on points of doctrine.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 90\"/> Abhidharma sought to analyze all experience into its ultimate constituents, phenomenal events or processes called ''dharmas''.\n[[File:War over the Buddha's Relics, South Gate, Stupa no. 1, Sanchi.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>[[Malla (Ancient India)|Mallas]] defending the city of [[Kusinagara]], as depicted at [[Sanchi]].

The edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and locations of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist [[proselytism]]: [[Antiochus II Theos]] of the [[Seleucid Kingdom]] (261\u2013246 BCE), [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy II Philadelphos]] of Egypt (285\u2013247 BCE), [[Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedonia (276\u2013239 BCE), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (288\u2013258 BCE) in [[Cyrenaica]] (modern [[Libya]]), and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander II]] (272\u2013255 BCE) in [[Epirus]] (modern Northwestern [[Greece]]). One of the edicts states:\n\n:\"The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400\u20139,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]]).\" ([[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of A\u015boka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).\n\nFurthermore, according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (XII) some of Ashoka's emissaries were Greek ([[Yona]]), particularly one named [[Dharmaraksita|Dhammarakkhita]].

Buddhist religious scriptures such as the [[Ashokavadana|A\u015bok\u0101vad\u0101na]] allege that Pushyamitra (an orthodox [[Brahmin]]) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith.

[[Buddhism]] arose in the eastern part of [[Ancient India]], in and around the ancient Kingdom of [[Magadha]] (now in [[Bihar]], [[India]]), and is based on the teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama|Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]]. This makes it one of the oldest religions practiced today. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent through [[Central Asia|Central]], [[East Asia|East]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. At one time or another, it influenced most of the Asian continent. The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements, schisms, and schools, among them the [[Theravada|Therav\u0101da]], [[Mahayana|Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajray\u0101na]] traditions, with contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.\n\n==Life of the Buddha==\n[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|thumb|250px|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics around the lifetime of [[Gautama Buddha]] (563\u2013483 BCE), located mainly across the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plains]], there were also a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[Ancient India]].]]\n[[Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]] was the historical founder of [[Buddhism]]. The early sources state he was born in the small [[Shakya]] (Pali: Sakka) Republic, which was part of the [[Kosala]] realm of [[Janapada|ancient India]], now in modern-day [[Nepal]].<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 14\">Harvey, 2012, p. 14.</ref> He is thus also known as the ''Shakyamuni'' (literally: \"The sage of the Shakya clan\"). The republic was ruled by a council of household heads, and Gautama was born to one of these elites so that he described himself as a [[Kshatriya]] when talking to Brahmins.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 14\"/> The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] contain no continuous life of the Buddha, only later after 200 BCE were various \"biographies\" with much mythological embellishment written.<ref>Harvey, 2012, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> All texts agree however that Gautama renounced the householder life and lived as a [[\u015arama\u1e47a|sramana]] [[Asceticism|ascetic]] for some time studying under various teachers, before attaining [[nirvana]] (extinguishment) and [[bodhi]] (awakening) through meditation.\n\nFor the remaining 45 years of his life, he traveled the [[Gangetic Plain]] of central [[India]] (the region of the [[Ganges River|Ganges/Ganga river]] and its tributaries), teaching his doctrine to a diverse range of people from different [[Caste system in India|castes]] and initiating monks into his order. The Buddha sent his disciples to spread the teaching across India. He also initiated an order of nuns.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 24\">Harvey, 2012, p. 24.</ref> He urged his disciples to teach in the local language or dialects.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 25.</ref> He spent a lot of his time near the cities of [[Shravasti|S\u0101vatth\u012b]], [[Rajgir|R\u0101jagaha]] and [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] (Skt. \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b, R\u0101jagrha, V\u0101i\u015bal\u012b).<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 24\"/> By the time of his death at 80, he had thousands of followers.\n\nThe years following the death of the Buddha saw the emergence of many movements during the next 400 years: first the schools of [[Nikaya Buddhism]], of which only [[Theravada]] remains today, and then the formation of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]], pan-Buddhist sects based on the acceptance of new scriptures and the revision of older techniques.\n\nFollowers of Buddhism, called '''Buddhists''' in English, referred to themselves as ''Sakyan''-s or ''Sakyabhiksu'' in ancient India.<ref>''Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity'' by Richard Cohen.

The canonical sources record various councils, where the monastic [[Sangha]] recited and organized the orally transmitted collections of the Buddha's teachings and settled certain disciplinary problems within the community.

The [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mahasamghikas]] meanwhile also developed their own schools and doctrines early on, which can be seen in texts like the [[Mahavastu]], associated with the [[Lokottarav\u0101da]], or \u2018Transcendentalist\u2019 school, who might be the same as the [[Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika]]s or \"One-utterancers\".<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 98\">Harvey, 2012, p. 98.</ref> This school has been seen as foreshadowing certain [[Mahayana]] ideas, especially due to their view that all of Gautama Buddha's acts were \"transcendental\" or \"supramundane\", even those performed before his Buddhahood.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 98\"/>\n\nIn the third century BCE, some Buddhists began introducing new systematized teachings called [[Abhidharma]], based on previous lists or tables (''Matrka'') of main doctrinal topics.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 90\">Harvey, 2012, p. 90.</ref> Unlike the [[Nik\u0101ya|Nikayas]], which were prose [[Sutta Pitaka|sutras]] or discourses, the Abhidharma literature consisted of systematic doctrinal exposition and often differed across the Buddhist schools who disagreed on points of doctrine.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 90\"/> Abhidharma sought to analyze all experience into its ultimate constituents, phenomenal events or processes called ''dharmas''.\n[[File:War over the Buddha's Relics, South Gate, Stupa no. 1, Sanchi.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>[[Malla (Ancient India)|Mallas]] defending the city of [[Kusinagara]], as depicted at [[Sanchi]].

The edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and locations of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist [[proselytism]]: [[Antiochus II Theos]] of the [[Seleucid Kingdom]] (261\u2013246 BCE), [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy II Philadelphos]] of Egypt (285\u2013247 BCE), [[Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedonia (276\u2013239 BCE), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (288\u2013258 BCE) in [[Cyrenaica]] (modern [[Libya]]), and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander II]] (272\u2013255 BCE) in [[Epirus]] (modern Northwestern [[Greece]]). One of the edicts states:\n\n:\"The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400\u20139,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]]).\" ([[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of A\u015boka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).\n\nFurthermore, according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (XII) some of Ashoka's emissaries were Greek ([[Yona]]), particularly one named [[Dharmaraksita|Dhammarakkhita]]. He also issued edicts in the Greek language as well as in Aramaic. One of them, found in Kandahar, advocates the adoption of \"piety\" (using the Greek term ''[[eusebeia]]'' for [[Dharma]]) to the Greek community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120201030234/http://www.afghanan.net/afghanistan/mauryans.htm ''History of Afghanistan'']</ref>\n\nIt is not clear how much these interactions may have been influential, but authors like [[Robert Linssen]] have commented that Buddhism may have influenced Western thought and religion at that time. Linssen points to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in [[Alexandria]] (mentioned by [[Clement of Alexandria]]), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] (possibly a deformation of the P\u0101li word \"[[Theravada|Therav\u0101da]]\"<ref>According to the linguist Zacharias P.

After assassinating King [[Brhadrata]] (last of the [[Mauryan]] rulers), military commander-in-chief [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] took the throne. Buddhist religious scriptures such as the [[Ashokavadana|A\u015bok\u0101vad\u0101na]] allege that Pushyamitra (an orthodox [[Brahmin]]) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhists wrote that he \"destroyed hundreds of monasteries and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks\":<ref>[[Divyavadana|Divy\u0101vad\u0101na]], pp. 429\u2013434</ref> 840,000 Buddhist [[stupa]]s which had been built by Ashoka were destroyed, and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk.<ref>Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, pp. 81 ff cited in Hars.407</ref>{{better source|date=March 2018}}\n\nModern historians, however, dispute this view in the light of literary and archaeological evidence. They opine that following Ashoka's sponsorship of Buddhism, it is possible that Buddhist institutions fell on harder times under the Shungas, but no evidence of active persecution has been noted.

Thapar stresses that Buddhist accounts are probably hyperbolic renditions of Pushyamitra's attack of the Mauryas, and merely reflect the desperate frustration of the Buddhist religious figures in the face of the possibly irreversible decline in the importance of their religion under the Shungas.<ref>Ashoka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 p. 200</ref>\n\nDuring the period, Buddhist monks deserted the [[Ganges]] valley, following either the northern road (''[[uttarapatha]]'') or the southern road (''dak\u1e63inapatha'').<ref>\"Gandhara\", Francine Tissot, p. 128: \"The monks, expelled from the Ganges valley, maybe by sectarian disputes, followed the northern road (Uttarapatha) or the northern road (Daksinapatha), which conducted them to the Northwest for some, and to the Occidental ocean for the others, with multiple artistic creations marking their respective roads\"</ref> Conversely, Buddhist artistic creation stopped in the old [[Magadha]] area, to reposition itself either in the northwest area of [[Gandhara|Gandh\u0101ra]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] or in the southeast around [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]].

Allegedly during the council there were altogether three hundred thousand verses and over nine million statements compiled, and it took twelve years to complete. The main fruit of this council was the compilation of the vast commentary known as the [[Mahavibhasa|Mah\u0101-Vibh\u0101sh\u0101]] (\"Great Exegesis\"), an extensive compendium and reference work on a portion of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din Abhidharma.<ref>Prebish, Charles S.

Although this change was probably effected without significant loss of integrity to the canon, this event was of particular significance since Sanskrit was the sacred language of [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in India, and was also being used by other thinkers, regardless of their specific religious or philosophical allegiance, thus enabling a far wider audience to gain access to Buddhist ideas and practices.\n[[File:SectarianBuddhistschools.png|300px|thumb|right|upright|Map of the major geographical centers of major Buddhist schools in South Asia, at around the time of [[Xuanzang]]'s visit in the seventh century.<br>* Red: non-Pudgalav\u0101da [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] school<br>* Orange: non-Dharmaguptaka [[Vibhajyav\u0101da]] schools<br>* Yellow: [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika]]<br>* Green: [[Pudgalav\u0101da]] (Green)<br>* Gray: [[Dharmaguptaka]]<br>]]\nAfter the fall of the Kushans, small kingdoms ruled the Gandharan region, and later the [[Hephthalite|Hephthalite White Huns]] conquered the area (circa 440s\u2013670).

R. Ambedkar]] (1891\u20131956), leader of the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]], who urged low caste Indian [[Dalit]]s to convert to Buddhism.\n\nIn [[Myanmar|Burma]], a central modern figure is [[King Mindon]] (r. 1853\u20131878), who presided over the [[Fifth Buddhist council|5th Buddhist council]] (1868\u201371) where different editions of the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] where cross-checked and a final version was inscribed on [[Tripi\u1e6daka tablets at Kuthodaw Pagoda|729 stone slabs, currently still the world's largest book]].<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 394.</ref> A new meditation movement arose, called the [[Vipassana movement]], beginning with figures such as [[Medawi]] (1728\u20131816), who was instrumental in the promotion of Buddhist meditation practices.<ref>Pranke, Patrick.

The Communists came to power in Laos in 1975.

The Communist [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376) led to the closing of all Buddhist monasteries and widespread destruction of Buddhist institutions. However, since 1977, there has been a general shift in the policy of the communist government, and Buddhist activity, both monastic and lay, has once again been renewed.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 409\u2013410</ref>\n\n[[Korean Buddhism]] suffered a series of setbacks during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)|Japanese invasions]], occupation, and also during the [[Korean War|Korean war]].

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] fled the country in 1959.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 414\">Harvey, 2012, p. 414.</ref> A [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan exile community]] was established in India, with its center at [[Dharamshala|Dharamsala]], which today contains many Buddhist monasteries. The 14th Dalai Lama has become one of the most popular Buddhist leaders in the world today.\n\nDuring the Red Guard period (1966\u201367), Chinese communists destroyed around 6,000 monasteries in Tibet along with their art and books, an attempt to wipe out the Tibetan Buddhist culture.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 414\"/> After 1980, Chinese repression of Tibetan Buddhism has decreased and the situation has improved with the reprinting of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan Canon]] and some artistic restoration.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 414\"/> In the nearby countries of [[Bhutan]], and Nepal, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Vajrayana Buddhism]] continues to flourish as a major religion.\n\nIn [[Mongolia]], which also has Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, Soviet dominance (between 1924\u20131990) saw much repression of Buddhism. However, Buddhism is now undergoing a revival in post-communist Mongolia, with more ordained monks and nuns, and 284 monasteries since 2009.<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 417\">Harvey, 2012, p. 417.</ref> More recent liberal attitudes towards religion has also benefited the Buddhists of [[Tuva]] and [[Buryatia]], as well as the Chinese region of [[Inner Mongolia]].<ref name=\"Harvey, 2012, p. 417\"/>\n\nAnother modern development was the founding of the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk Khanate]] in the 17th century with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as its main religion.

Sir Edwin Arnold's book-length poem ''[[The Light of Asia]]'' (1879), a life of the Buddha, was a successful early publication on Buddhism that led to much interest among English speaking middle classes.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 420.</ref> The work of western [[Buddhist studies|Buddhist scholars]] like [[Hermann Oldenberg]] (1854\u20131920), [[Thomas Rhys Davids|T.

Max M\u00fcller]] was also influential in introducing Buddhism to western audiences.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 422.</ref>\n\nThe late 19th century also saw the first-known modern western conversions to Buddhism, including leading Theosophists [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Helena Blavatsky]] in 1880 in Sri Lanka. The Theosophical Society was very influential in popularizing Indian religions in the west.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 421.</ref> The 19th century also saw the first western monastics such as [[U Dhammaloka]], [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Ananda Metteyya]] and the German [[Nyanatiloka|Ny\u0101natiloka Thera]] (1878\u20131956).\n\nAnother important element leading to the growth of Buddhism in the west was the large scale immigration of Chinese and Japanese to the United States and Canada in the late 19th century.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 424.</ref> Refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have also immigrated to west, beginning in 1975.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 426.</ref> Asian Buddhists such as [[D. T. Suzuki|DT Suzuki]], [[Hsuan Hua|Hs\u00fcan Hua]], [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and [[Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh]] were influential in teaching [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] in the West in the 20th century. [[Shunry\u016b Suzuki|Shunryu Suzuki]] opened the [[S\u014dt\u014d|Soto]] [[San Francisco Zen Center]] (1961) and the [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center|Tassajara Monastery]] (1967).<ref>Harvey, 2012, 432.</ref>\n\nThe [[Tibetan diaspora]] has also been active in promoting Tibetan Buddhism in the West. All of the four major Tibetan Buddhist schools have a presence and have attracted converts.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 437.</ref> Among its prominent exponents have been [[14th Dalai Lama|Lama Thubten Zopa]], [[Tarthang Tulku]] and [[Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa]].<ref>Harvey, 2012, 437\u2013438</ref> The number of its adherents is estimated to be between ten and twenty million.<ref>Adherents.com estimates twenty million for \"Lamaism (Vajrayana/Tibetan/Tantric).\" http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Buddhism {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803172321/http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html |date=2017-08-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe Theravada tradition has established various temples in the West, especially among immigrant communities in the US.

Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also referred to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cel.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also referred to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cel. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |taal=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.
