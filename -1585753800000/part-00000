E. Strzelecki - Gippsland\n\nThe township of [[Bass, Victoria|Bass]] was surveyed and colonised in the early 1860s.\n\nThe intensive colonisation of south Gippsland began late in the 1870s. A story of that process is told in, ''The land of the Lyre Bird'' (1920).<ref>''The land of the Lyre Bird: a story of early settlement in the Great South Forest of South Gippsland; being a description of the big scrub in its virgin state with its birds and animals, and of the adventures and hardships of its early explorers and prospectors also accounts by the settlers of clearing, settlement and development of the country'', Gordon & Gotch for the Committee of the South Gippsland Pioneers Association, Melbourne, 1920 (reprinted 1966).</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{stack|{{Regions of Gippsland}}}}\n[[Image:East Gippsland old growth 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|Old growth forests in [[East Gippsland]]]]\nGippsland is traditionally subdivided into four or five main sub{{endash}}regions or districts:\n*[[West Gippsland]] (roughly equivalent to the Shires of Cardinia and Baw Baw)\n*[[South Gippsland]] (Bass Coast and South Gippsland Shires)\n*the [[Latrobe Valley]] (Latrobe City and areas of Baw Baw to the north)\n*[[East Gippsland]] (Shires of Wellington and East Gippsland).\n*Sometimes a fifth region, [[Central Gippsland]] (corresponding approximately to the Shire of Wellington), is added to refer to the drier zone between the [[Gippsland Lakes]] and [[Yarram]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n[[File:VM 0267 Stratford - Avon River valley.jpg|thumb|On the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] near [[Stratford, Victoria|Stratford]]]]\nThe climate of Gippsland is temperate and generally humid, except in the central region around [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], where annual rainfall can be less than {{convert|600|mm|in}}. In the [[Strzelecki Ranges]] annual rainfall can be as high as {{convert|1500|mm|in}}, while on the high mountains of East Gippsland it probably reaches similar levels \u2013 much of it falling as [[snow]]. In lower levels east of the [[Snowy River]], mean annual rainfall is typically about {{convert|900|\u2013|950|mm|in}} and less variable than in the coastal districts of New South Wales. Mean maximum temperatures in lower areas range from {{convert|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in July. In the highlands of the [[Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau]] and the remote [[Errinundra National Park|Errinundra Plateau]], temperatures range from a maximum of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to a minimum of {{Convert|8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. However, in winter, mean minima in these areas can be as low as {{convert|-4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, leading to heavy snowfalls that often isolate the Errinundra Plateau between June and October.\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n{{See also|Energy in Victoria}}\n[[Image:Potato field through fence - Thorpdale.JPG|thumb|Potato farming in the [[Thorpdale, Victoria|Thorpdale]] region]]\nThe soils in Gippsland are generally very infertile, being profoundly deficient in [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]. Apart from frequently [[flood]]ed areas, they are classed as [[Spodosols]], [[Psamment]]s and [[Ultisols]]. Consequently, heavy fertilisation is required for agriculture or pastoral development. Despite this, parts of Gippsland have become highly productive dairying and vegetable-growing regions: the region supplies Melbourne with most of its needs in these commodities. A few alluvial soils (chiefly near the Snowy) have much better native fertility, and these have always been intensively cultivated. In the extreme northeast is a small section of the [[Monaro Tableland]] used for grazing [[cattle|beef cattle]].\n\nGippsland possesses very few deposits of [[metal]]lic [[mineral]]s ([[gold]] rushes in the nineteenth century around [[Foster, Victoria|Foster]], [[Buchan, Victoria|Buchan]] petered out quickly). However, the deep underground gold mines operated at Walhalla for a fifty-year period between 1863-1913. Gippsland has no deposits of major industrial nonmetallic minerals, but it does feature the world's largest [[brown coal]] deposits and, around Sale and offshore in the [[Bass Strait]], some of the largest deposits of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in Australia.\n\nLike the rest of Australia, the seas around Gippsland are of very low productivity as there is no [[upwelling]] due to the warm currents in the [[Tasman Sea]]. Nonetheless, towns such as [[Marlo, Victoria|Marlo]] and [[Mallacoota]] depended for a long time on the fishing of [[abalone]], whose [[shell (animal)|shells]] could fetch very high prices because of their use for [[pearl]]s and pearl inlays.\n\n== Administration ==\n\n=== Political representation ===\nFor [[Elections in Australia|Australian federal elections]] for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the electoral divisions of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/flinders.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Flinders (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> [[Division of McMillan|McMillan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/mcmillan.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of McMillan (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> and [[Division of Gippsland|Gippsland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/gippsland.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Gippsland (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region.

E. Strzelecki - Gippsland\n\nThe township of [[Bass, Victoria|Bass]] was surveyed and colonised in the early 1860s.\n\nThe intensive colonisation of south Gippsland began late in the 1870s. A story of that process is told in, ''The land of the Lyre Bird'' (1920).<ref>''The land of the Lyre Bird: a story of early settlement in the Great South Forest of South Gippsland; being a description of the big scrub in its virgin state with its birds and animals, and of the adventures and hardships of its early explorers and prospectors also accounts by the settlers of clearing, settlement and development of the country'', Gordon & Gotch for the Committee of the South Gippsland Pioneers Association, Melbourne, 1920 (reprinted 1966).</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{stack|{{Regions of Gippsland}}}}\n[[Image:East Gippsland old growth 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|Old growth forests in [[East Gippsland]]]]\nGippsland is traditionally subdivided into four or five main sub{{endash}}regions or districts:\n*[[West Gippsland]] (roughly equivalent to the Shires of Cardinia and Baw Baw)\n*[[South Gippsland]] (Bass Coast and South Gippsland Shires)\n*the [[Latrobe Valley]] (Latrobe City and areas of Baw Baw to the north)\n*[[East Gippsland]] (Shires of Wellington and East Gippsland).\n*Sometimes a fifth region, [[Central Gippsland]] (corresponding approximately to the Shire of Wellington), is added to refer to the drier zone between the [[Gippsland Lakes]] and [[Yarram]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n[[File:VM 0267 Stratford - Avon River valley.jpg|thumb|On the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] near [[Stratford, Victoria|Stratford]]]]\nThe climate of Gippsland is temperate and generally humid, except in the central region around [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], where annual rainfall can be less than {{convert|600|mm|in}}. In the [[Strzelecki Ranges]] annual rainfall can be as high as {{convert|1500|mm|in}}, while on the high mountains of East Gippsland it probably reaches similar levels \u2013 much of it falling as [[snow]]. In lower levels east of the [[Snowy River]], mean annual rainfall is typically about {{convert|900|\u2013|950|mm|in}} and less variable than in the coastal districts of New South Wales. Mean maximum temperatures in lower areas range from {{convert|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in July. In the highlands of the [[Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau]] and the remote [[Errinundra National Park|Errinundra Plateau]], temperatures range from a maximum of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to a minimum of {{Convert|8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. However, in winter, mean minima in these areas can be as low as {{convert|-4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, leading to heavy snowfalls that often isolate the Errinundra Plateau between June and October.\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\n{{See also|Energy in Victoria}}\n[[Image:Potato field through fence - Thorpdale.JPG|thumb|Potato farming in the [[Thorpdale, Victoria|Thorpdale]] region]]\nThe soils in Gippsland are generally very infertile, being profoundly deficient in [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]. Apart from frequently [[flood]]ed areas, they are classed as [[Spodosols]], [[Psamment]]s and [[Ultisols]]. Consequently, heavy fertilisation is required for agriculture or pastoral development. Despite this, parts of Gippsland have become highly productive dairying and vegetable-growing regions: the region supplies Melbourne with most of its needs in these commodities. A few alluvial soils (chiefly near the Snowy) have much better native fertility, and these have always been intensively cultivated. In the extreme northeast is a small section of the [[Monaro Tableland]] used for grazing [[cattle|beef cattle]].\n\nGippsland possesses very few deposits of [[metal]]lic [[mineral]]s ([[gold]] rushes in the nineteenth century around [[Foster, Victoria|Foster]], [[Buchan, Victoria|Buchan]] petered out quickly). However, the deep underground gold mines operated at Walhalla for a fifty-year period between 1863-1913. Gippsland has no deposits of major industrial nonmetallic minerals, but it does feature the world's largest [[brown coal]] deposits and, around Sale and offshore in the [[Bass Strait]], some of the largest deposits of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in Australia.\n\nLike the rest of Australia, the seas around Gippsland are of very low productivity as there is no [[upwelling]] due to the warm currents in the [[Tasman Sea]]. Nonetheless, towns such as [[Marlo, Victoria|Marlo]] and [[Mallacoota]] depended for a long time on the fishing of [[abalone]], whose [[shell (animal)|shells]] could fetch very high prices because of their use for [[pearl]]s and pearl inlays.\n\n== Administration ==\n\n=== Political representation ===\nFor [[Elections in Australia|Australian federal elections]] for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the electoral divisions of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/flinders.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Flinders (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> [[Division of McMillan|McMillan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/mcmillan.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of McMillan (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> and [[Division of Gippsland|Gippsland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/gippsland.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Gippsland (Vic)|work=Current federal electoral divisions|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region.

The {{convert|13530|ha|acre|adj=on}} national park is situated approximately {{convert|120|km}} east of [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] and {{convert|50|km}} north of the [[Latrobe Valley]]. The park contains the '''Baw-Baw Plateau''' and borders the [[Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort]].\n\nGeographically, the Baw-Baw Plateau is a [[plateau]] of several peaks that includes Mount Baw Baw, [[Mount St Gwinear]], Mount St Phillack, Mount Erica and Mount Whitelaw; all largely [[subalpine]] terrane outcrops of weathered [[granite]] boulders dot the plateau with [[alpine meadow]]s punctuated by stands of [[Eucalyptus pauciflora|snow-gum]]. Much of the slopes of the plateau within the national park form the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] for the [[Thomson River (Victoria)|Thomson River]] and the [[Thomson Dam|Thomson Reservoir]], and the [[Tanjil River|Tanjil]] and [[Tyers River|Tyers]] rivers.\n\n==History==\nThe traditional custodians of the land surrounding Baw Baw National Park are the [[Wurundjeri]] people of the [[Kulin Nation]].

Michael Usry was the subject of a police investigation that led to a court order requiring Ancestry.com to disclose the identity of a partial match to crime scene DNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/05/17/police-twice-targeted-wrong-men-brutal-killing-cigarette-butt-changed-everything/|title=Police twice targeted the wrong men for a brutal 1996 killing.

This DNA test proved that he was not a full match to the perpetrator.\n\n=== Privacy implications ===\n\n==== Direct-to-consumer companies ====\nThe free reign of open-source databases by investigators has initiated a debate over the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] implications of genealogy data. The Fourth Amendment states that a warrant is required in situations that violate an individual\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992|title=Constitute|website=www.constituteproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> Given the sensitivity of information within direct-to-consumer genealogy databases, particularly concerning medical traits, behavioral tendencies, ethnic background, and familial associations, courts have asserted that they are subject to protection under the Fourth Amendment.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Abrahamson|first=Claire|date=2018-2019|title=Guilt by Genetic Association: The Fourth Amendment and the Search of Private Genetic Databases by Law Enforcement|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flr87&id=2594&div=&collection=|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=87|pages=2539}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, direct-to-consumer companies do not promise complete protection of user data. 23andMe, a leading consumer genealogy company, states in its privacy policy that \u201c23andMe will preserve and disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to\u2026comply with legal or regulatory process\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.23andme.com/about/privacy/|title=DNA Genetic Testing & Analysis - 23andMe|last=23andMe|website=www.23andme.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn an effort to remain transparent to its consumers, 23andMe has a quarterly Transparency Report. This report identifies the number of government requests for user data in addition to the number of times data has been produced without the explicit consent of the individual(s) of interest. 23andMe claims to have never produced user data without consent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.23andme.com/transparency-report/|title=Transparency Report - 23andMe|last=23andMe|website=www.23andme.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> The other industry leader, [[Ancestry.com]], takes an analogous stance on the privacy of user data and similarly provides an annual transparency report.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency|title=Transparency|website=www.ancestry.com|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\nThe direct-to-consumer genealogy company [[Family Tree DNA|FamilyTreeDNA]] faced a backlash following an admission that they were working secretly with the FBI. This partnership was initiated in 2018 and had the goal of solving cold cases involving murder and rape.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/family-tree-dna-fbi.html|title=FamilyTreeDNA Admits to Sharing Genetic Data With F.B.I.|last=Haag|first=Matthew|date=2019-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Following scrutiny, FamilyTreeDNA\u2019s president Bennett Greenspan apologized for a lack of transparency, stating \u201cI am genuinely sorry for not having handled our communications with you as we should have\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Open-source databases ====\nPrivacy implications pertaining to open-source databases like GEDMatch are distinct from direct-to-consumer companies. As users voluntarily upload their genealogy profiles to GEDMatch, they forfeit their privacy to the data. The [[third-party doctrine]], originally established by the Supreme Court, states that a person \u201chas no legitimate expectation of privacy in information\u2026voluntarily turn[ed] over to third parties\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/|title=What You Need to Know about the Third-Party Doctrine|last=Villasenor|first=John|date=2013-12-30|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> However, following intense media attention after the arrest of the Golden State Killer, GEDMatch changed their terms of service to require individuals to opt into use of their profiles by third parties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/golden-state-killer-dna.html|title=Sooner or Later Your Cousin's DNA Is Going to Solve a Murder|last=Murphy|first=Heather|date=2019-04-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In effect, privacy rights were shifted back into the hands of the users.\n\n== Potential for reducing discrepancies in the FBI's CODIS System ==\nThe government\u2019s own [[Combined DNA Index System]] (CODIS) database is composed of forensic evidence assessible to local, state, and federal law enforcement officials. This database consists of genetic profiles of approximately 18 million different people, however these are limited to DNA samples from convicted felons and arrestees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet|title=CODIS and NDIS Fact Sheet|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> Data on the racial distribution of profiles suggests that 8.6% of the entire African American population is present in the database compared to only 2% of the white population.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn the other hand, genetic profiles from direct-to-consumer databases and GEDMatch consist of 75% white individuals from Northern European descent.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Erlich|first=Yaniv|last2=Shor|first2=Tal|last3=Pe\u2019er|first3=Itsik|last4=Carmi|first4=Shai|date=2018-11-09|title=Identity inference of genomic data using long-range familial searches|journal=Science|language=en|volume=362|issue=6415|pages=690\u2013694|doi=10.1126/science.aau4832|issn=0036-8075|pmid=30309907|bibcode=2018Sci...362..690E}}</ref> The vast overrepresentation of African American individuals within the CODIS database has rendered it relatively ineffective for solving serial murder and sexual assault cases, of which the majority of perpetrators are white. Based on data from 4,700 mass murderers, 57% of serial killers are white whereas only 29% are African American.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2018/08/14/serial-killers-a-terrifying-look-at-their-ordinary-lives/|title=New profile of serial killers debunks long-held myths|last=Samet|first=Mackenzie|last2=Salo|first2=Jackie|date=2018-08-14|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> The utilization of forensic genealogy, which relies heavily on databases like GEDMatch, would therefore help to reduce racial disparities in the current criminal justice system. \u00a0\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*\n\n[[Category:Genealogy]]\n[[Category:Forensic disciplines]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (3), replaced: 2 million \u2192 2\u00a0million (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_genealogy"}

Against the party line, he refused to take a commission, but advanced rapidly from anti-aircraft gunner to gunnery sergeant-major instructor and [[regimental sergeant major]], engaged in political work wherever he went \u2013 especially, from 1943 to 1946, in India.<ref name=jisc/>\n\nWhilst in India, Saville met Nehru and leaders of the Muslim League and his friendship with Indian communist students in Britain, all from establishment families, opened most anti-imperial doors, reinforced his own firm, but no longer uncritical, convictions.
