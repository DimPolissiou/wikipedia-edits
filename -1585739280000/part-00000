By influencing their feelings, the audience can be pushed to take an action, believe an argument, or respond in a certain way.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Ethos]] is an appeal based on the good character of the author. It involves persuading the audience that the author is credible and well-qualified, or possesses other desirable qualities that mean the author\u2019s arguments carry weight.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Kairos]] is an appeal to timing, such as whether the argument occurs at the right time and in the ideal surrounding context to be accepted. It has been argued to be the most important since no matter how logical, emotionally powerful and credible the argument, if the argument is made in an unsuitable context or environment, the audience will not be receptive to it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rife|first=Martine Courant|date=2010|title=Ethos, Pathos, Logos, Kairos: Using a Rhetorical Heuristic to Mediate Digital-Survey Recruitment Strategies|journal=IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication|volume=53|issue=3|pages=260\u2013277|doi=10.1109/TPC.2010.2052856|issn=1558-1500}}</ref>\n\nRhetorical devices can be used to facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of the use of rhetoric in any of the four above [[modes of persuasion]]. Rather than certain rhetorical devices falling under certain modes of persuasion, rhetorical devices are ''techniques'' authors, writers or speakers use to execute rhetorical appeals. Thus, they overlap with [[Figure of speech|figures of speech]], differing in that they are used specifically for persuasive purposes, and may involve how authors introduce and arrange arguments (see the section on [[Rhetorical device#Discourse level|discourse level devices]]) in addition to creative use of language. \n\n==Sonic devices==\nSonic devices depend on sound.\n\n=== Alliteration ===\n\n[[Alliteration]] is the repetition of the sound of an initial consonant or consonant cluster in subsequent syllables. It is one of the most well-known and effective rhetorical devices throughout literature and persuasive speeches.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n''From forth the fatal loins of these two foes,''\n<br>''A pair of star-cross\u2019d lovers take their life.'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] Prologue)\n\n''Small showers last long but sudden storms are short.'' ([[Richard II (play)|R2]] 2.1)\n\n=== Assonance ===\n[[Assonance]] is the repetition of similar vowel sounds across neighbouring words.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Harris, Robert A.|title=Writing with clarity and style : a guide to rhetorical devices for contemporary writers|date=2003|publisher=Pyrczak Pub|isbn=1-884585-48-5|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=|oclc=50825579}}</ref>\n\n''So keen and greedy to confound a man''. ([[The Merchant of Venice|MoV]] 3.2)\n\n''Blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 5.1) \n\n=== Consonance ===\n[[Consonance]] is the repetition of consonant sounds across words which have been deliberately chosen. It is different from alliteration as it can happen at any place in the word, not just the beginning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literarydevices.net/consonance/|title=Consonance - Examples and Definition of Consonance|date=2013-11-03|website=Literary Devices|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the following example, the ''k'' sound is repeated five times.\n\n''...with streaks of light,''\n<br>''And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels\u2026'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.3)\n\n=== Cacophony ===\n[[Cacophony]] refers to the use of unpleasant sounds, such as the [[Plosive|explosive consonants]] ''[[Voiceless velar stop|k]]'', ''[[Voiced velar stop|g]]'', ''[[Voiceless alveolar stop|t]]'', ''[[Voiced alveolar stop|d]]'', ''[[Voiceless bilabial stop|p]]'' and ''[[Voiced bilabial stop|b]]'', the [[Sibilant|hissing sounds]] ''[[Voiceless postalveolar fricative#Voiceless palato-alveolar fricative|sh]]'' and ''[[Voiceless alveolar fricative#Voiceless alveolar sibilant|s]]'', and also the [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] ''[[Voiceless postalveolar affricate|ch]]'' and ''[[Voiced postalveolar affricate|j]]'', in rapid succession in a line or passage, creating a harsh and discordant effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/cacophony/|title=Cacophony Examples and Definition|date=2015-08-14|website=Literary Devices|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n''Hear the loud alarum bells\u2013''\n<br>''Brazen bells!

When used colloquially, it is often accompanied by multiple [[exclamation mark]]s and in [[all caps]]. It is common in comic strips and some cartoons.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome examples include these: ''smek'', ''thwap'', ''kaboom'', ''ding-dong'', ''plop'', ''bang'' and ''pew''.\n\n== Word repetition ==\nWord repetition rhetorical devices operate via [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repeating]] words or phrases in various ways, usually for emphasis.\n\n=== Anadiplosis/Conduplicatio ===\n[[Anadiplosis]] involves repeating the last word(s) of one sentence, phrase or clause at or near the beginning of the next.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n''To die, to sleep;''\n<br>''To sleep, perchance to dream\u2026'' ([[Hamlet]] 3.1)\n\n''It is the stars,''\n<br>''The stars above us govern our conditions.'' ([[King Lear|Lear]] 4.3)\n\n[[Conduplicatio]] is similar, involving repeating a key word in subsequent clauses.\n\n''Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep!'' ([[Richard III (play)|R3]] 5.3)\n\n=== Anaphora/Epistrophe/Symploce/Epianalepsis ===\n[[Anaphora (rhetoric)|Anaphora]] is repeating the same word(s) at the ''beginning'' of successive sentences, phrases or clauses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''There\u2019s no trust,''\n<br>''No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,''\n<br>''All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.''

([[Richard II (play)|R2]] 4.1)\n\n[[Epistrophe]] is repeating the same word(s) at the ''end'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://examples.yourdictionary.com/epistrophe-examples.html|title=Epistrophe Examples|website=YourDictionary|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n''If you had known the virtue of the ring,''\n<br>''Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,''\n<br>''Or your own honour to contain the ring,''\n<br>''You would not then have parted with the ring.'' ([[The Merchant of Venice|MoV]] 5.1)\n\n[[Symploce]] is a simultaneous combination of both anaphora and epistrophe, but repeating different words at the start and end.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/symploce-rhetoric-1692013|title=Rhetorical Repetition: Symploce|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|date=2018-12-25|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n''That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?''\n<br>''That Angelo's a murderer; is't not strange?''\n<br>''That Angelo is an adulterous thief,''\n<br>''An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;''\n<br>''Is it not strange and strange?''

I'm waiting to tell you.''\n<br>HENRY HIGGINS: ''Pickering, this chap has a certain natural gift of rhetoric. Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild. 'I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.' Sentimental rhetoric! That's the Welsh strain in him. It also accounts for his mendacity and dishonesty.''  ([[George Bernard Shaw]], ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''[[Pygmalion (play)|)]]\n\n[[Epanalepsis]] repeats the same word(s) at the beginning and end.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n''Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!'' ([[Henry V (play)|H5]] 3.1)\n\n=== Epizeuxis/Antanaclasis ===\n[[Epizeuxis]] is simply repetition of the same word.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n''Words, words, words.'' ([[Hamlet]] 2.2)\n\n''O horror! Horror! Horror!'' ([[Macbeth]] 2.3)\n\nAntanaclasis is more witty, repeating the same word but in a different sense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literarydevices.net/antanaclasis/|title=Antanaclasis - Definition and Examples of Antanaclasis|date=2014-05-05|website=Literary Devices|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n''Put out the light, and then put out the light.''

([[Twelfth Night|12N]] 3.1)\n\n=== Diacope ===\n[[Diacope]] is the repetition of a word or phrase after an intervening word or clause. It can also be thought of as a reshaped [[epanalepsis]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n''Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:''\n<br>''The elements be kind to thee, and make''\n<br>''Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.'' ([[Antony and Cleopatra|A&C]] 3.2)\n\n== Word relation ==\nWord relation rhetorical devices operate via deliberate connections between words within a sentence.\n\n=== Zeugma ===\n[[Zeugma and syllepsis|Zeugma]] involves the linking of two or more words or phrases that occupy the same position in a sentence to another word or phrase in the same sentence. This can take advantage of the latter word having multiple meanings depending on context to create a clever use of language that can make the sentence and the claim thus advanced more eloquent and persuasive. \n\nIn the following examples, 2 nouns (as direct objects) are linked to the same verb which must then be interpreted in 2 different ways.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.reedsy.com/rhetorical-devices/|title=30 Rhetorical Devices \u2014 And How to Use Them|date=2019-01-11|website=Reedsy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n''He caught the train and a bad cold.''\n\n''This shirt attracts everything but men.''\n\n''I held my breath and the door for you.'' \n\nSimilarly, multiple subjects can be linked to the same verb.\n\n''Fred excelled at sports; Harvey at eating; Tom with girls.''\n\n''Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2)\n\n== Discourse level ==\nDiscourse level rhetorical devices rely on relations between phrases, clauses and sentences. Often they relate to how new arguments are introduced into the text or how previous arguments are emphasized. Examples include [[antanagoge]], [[apophasis]], [[aporia]], [[hypophora]], [[Metanoia (rhetoric)|metanoia]] and [[procatalepsis]].\n\n=== Amplification/Pleonasm ===\nAmplification involves repeating a word or expression while adding more detail, to emphasise what might otherwise be passed over.<ref name=\":4\" /> This allows one to call attention to and expand a point to ensure the reader realizes its importance or centrality in the discussion.\n\n''But this revolting boy, of course,''\n<br>''Was so unutterably vile,''\n<br>''So greedy, foul, and infantile''\n<br>''He left a most disgusting taste''\n<br>''Inside our mouths\u2026'' ([[Roald Dahl]], ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|)]]\n\n[[Pleonasm]] involves using more words than necessary to describe an idea. This creates emphasis and can introduce additional elements of meaning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literarydevices.net/pleonasm/|title=Pleonasm - Definition and Examples of Pleonasm|date=2014-02-14|website=Literary Devices|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n''I heard it with my own ears.''\n\n''Swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time, matter or other circumstance''. ([[Measure for Measure|Measure]] 4.2)\n\n=== Antanagoge ===\n[[Antanagoge]] involves \u2018placing a good point or benefit next to a fault criticism, or problem in order to reduce the impact or significance of the negative point\u2019.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm|title=A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices|last=Harris|first=Robert A.|date=2013|website=virtualsalt.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n''Within the infant rind of this weak flower''\n<br>''Poison hath residence, and medicine power.''

Craig; Thonssen, Lester (1948). \"Chapter 15 The Style of Public Address\". [https://www.questia.com/library/2465598/speech-criticism-the-development-of-standards-for Speech Criticism, the Development of Standards for Rhetorical Appraisal].

([[The Merchant of Venice|MoV]] 3.2)\n\nThis device has a number of effects that make it quite useful in politics. [[Donald Trump]], for instance, has been noted to frequently use [[apophasis]] when attacking his political opponents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rhetorical-device_n_56c358cbe4b0c3c55052b32b|title=He Would Never Say It, But This Is Donald Trump's Favorite Rhetorical Device|last=Bobic|first=Igor|date=16 February 2016|website=Huffington Post|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/11/politics/north-korea-trump-asia-trip/index.html|title=Trump sarcastically responds to Kim Jong Un|last=Karimi|first=Faith|date=11 November 2017|website=CNN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Aporia ===\n[[Aporia]] is the rhetorical expression of doubt.<ref name=\":3\" /> The most famous example of this is undoubtedly Hamlet\u2019s soliloquy, which begins:\n\n''To be or not to be, that is the question.'' ([[Hamlet]] 3.1)\n\nAnother example is in Antony\u2019s famous speech at Caesar\u2019s funeral, which includes examples such as:\n\n''Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept.'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2)\n\nWhen the rhetorical question posed is answered, this is also an instance of [[hypophora]]. \n\n=== Derision ===\nThis involves setting up an opposing position to ridicule without offering a counterargument<ref name=\":2\" />, such as:\n\n''You believe we should vote for him? I\u2019ve got a bridge to sell you.''\n\nNo reason for why one should not vote for him is given. It is merely implied that it would be gullible to do so.\n\n=== Enthymeme ===\n[[Syllogism]] which omits either one of the premises or the conclusion. The omitted part must be clearly understood by the reader.\n\n''Mark\u2019d ye his words? He would not take the crown;'' <br>''Therefore \u2018tis certain he was not ambitious.'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2; the premise implied is that any ambitious person would take the crown)\n\n=== Hyperbole ===\n[[Hyperbole]] is deliberate exaggeration.<ref name=\":3\" /> This can be for literary effect:\n\n''The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,''\n<br>''As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven''\n<br>''Would through the airy region stream so bright''\n<br>''That birds would sing and think it were not night'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.2)\n\n''His face was as the heavens...'' \n<br>''His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm''\n<br>''Crested the world... realms and islands were''\n<br>''As plates dropp'd from his pocket.'' ([[Antony and Cleopatra|A&C]] 5.2)\n\nOr for argumentative effect:\n\n''Her election to Parliament would be the worst thing to ever happen to this country!'' <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Hypophora ===\nThe use of [[hypophora]] is the technique whereby one asks a question and then proceeds to answer the question. This device is one of the most useful strategies in writing essays to inform or persuade a reader.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=McGuigan, Brendan|title=Rhetorical devices : a handbook and activities for student writers|others=Moliken, Paul,, Grudzina, Douglas|year=2011|isbn=978-1-58049-765-7|edition=Revised [edition]|location=Clayton, DE|oclc=816509713}}</ref> \n\n''Can honour set to a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? No. What is honour? A word. What is in that word honour? What is that honour? Air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died a' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. 'Tis insensible, then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it.'' ([[Henry IV, Part 1|1H4]] 5.1) \n\n=== Innuendo ===\nThis device indirectly implies an accusation without explicitly stating it.<ref name=\":2\" /> This can be combined with [[apophasis]].  \n\n''I know you aren\u2019t an alcoholic, but I did notice you\u2019ve replaced all the bottles in your liquor cabinet.''\n\n=== Metanoia ===\n[[Metanoia (rhetoric)|Metanoia]] qualifies a statement or by recalling or rejecting it in part or full, and then re-expressing it in a better, milder, or stronger way.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> A negative is often used to do the recalling.\n\n''All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows\u2026'' ([[Cymbeline]] 2.4)\n\n''He was the best of men - no, of all humanity.''\n\n=== Procatalepsis ===\nBy anticipating and answering a possible objection, [[procatalepsis]] allows an argument to continue while rebutting points opposing it. It is a relative of [[hypophora]]. Procatalepsis can be used strategically to show that concerns have been thought through.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n''\u2018All right!\u2019 you\u2019ll cry. \u2018All right!\u2019 you\u2019ll say,''\n<br>''\u2018But if we take the set away,''\n<br>''What shall we do to entertain''\n<br>''Our darling children?

This means the force of the description is less than what is expected, thus highlighting the irony or extreme nature of an event.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n''The war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage.'' (The ''[[Jewel Voice Broadcast]]'')\n\nBENVOLIO: ''What, art thou hurt?''\n<br>MERCUTIO: ''Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch''.

([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2; Antony attacks Brutus\u2019s character and that of his co-conspirators)\n\n=== Metaphor ===\n[[Metaphor]] connects two different things to one another. It is frequently invoked by the ''to be'' verb. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The use of metaphor in rhetoric is primarily to convey to the audience a new idea or meaning by linking it to an already familiar idea or meaning. \n\nIn the following example, Romeo compares Juliet to the sun, and this metaphor connecting Juliet to the sun shows that Romeo sees Juliet as being radiant and regards her as an essential being.\n\n''But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?''\n<br>''It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.2)\n\n=== Personification ===\n[[Personification]] is the representation of animals, inanimate objects and ideas as having human attributes.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the following example Romeo personifies love as being blind yet able to enamour someone.\n\n''Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,''\n''<br>Should without eyes see pathways to his will!'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 1.1)\n\n=== Simile ===\n[[Simile]] compares two different things that resemble each other in at least one way. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> It uses the ''as\u2026 as'' construction as compared to metaphor which is direct equivalence.\n\nIn the following example, the nurse compares Romeo\u2019s manners and behaviour to a lamb.\n\n''I\u2019ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.5)\n\nAnother example can be seen in a conversation between Emilia and Othello.\n\nOTHELLO: ''She was false as water''.\n<br>EMILIA: ''Thou art rash as fire,''\n<br>''To say that she was false. Oh, she was''\n<br>''heavenly true!''

By influencing their feelings, the audience can be pushed to take an action, believe an argument, or respond in a certain way.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Ethos]] is an appeal based on the good character of the author. It involves persuading the audience that the author is credible and well-qualified, or possesses other desirable qualities that mean the author\u2019s arguments carry weight.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Kairos]] is an appeal to timing, such as whether the argument occurs at the right time and in the ideal surrounding context to be accepted. It has been argued to be the most important since no matter how logical, emotionally powerful and credible the argument, if the argument is made in an unsuitable context or environment, the audience will not be receptive to it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rife|first=Martine Courant|date=2010|title=Ethos, Pathos, Logos, Kairos: Using a Rhetorical Heuristic to Mediate Digital-Survey Recruitment Strategies|journal=IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication|volume=53|issue=3|pages=260\u2013277|doi=10.1109/TPC.2010.2052856|issn=1558-1500}}</ref>\n\nRhetorical devices can be used to facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of the use of rhetoric in any of the four above [[modes of persuasion]]. Rather than certain rhetorical devices falling under certain modes of persuasion, rhetorical devices are ''techniques'' authors, writers or speakers use to execute rhetorical appeals. Thus, they overlap with [[Figure of speech|figures of speech]], differing in that they are used specifically for persuasive purposes, and may involve how authors introduce and arrange arguments (see the section on [[Rhetorical device#Discourse level|discourse level devices]]) in addition to creative use of language. \n\n==Sonic devices==\nSonic devices depend on sound.\n\n=== Alliteration ===\n\n[[Alliteration]] is the repetition of the sound of an initial consonant or consonant cluster in subsequent syllables. It is one of the most well-known and effective rhetorical devices throughout literature and persuasive speeches.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n''From forth the fatal loins of these two foes,''\n<br>''A pair of star-cross\u2019d lovers take their life.''

([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 5.1) \n\n=== Consonance ===\n[[Consonance]] is the repetition of consonant sounds across words which have been deliberately chosen. It is different from alliteration as it can happen at any place in the word, not just the beginning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literarydevices.net/consonance/|title=Consonance - Examples and Definition of Consonance|date=2013-11-03|website=Literary Devices|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the following example, the ''k'' sound is repeated five times.\n\n''...with streaks of light,''\n<br>''And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels\u2026'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.3)\n\n=== Cacophony ===\n[[Cacophony]] refers to the use of unpleasant sounds, such as the [[Plosive|explosive consonants]] ''[[Voiceless velar stop|k]]'', ''[[Voiced velar stop|g]]'', ''[[Voiceless alveolar stop|t]]'', ''[[Voiced alveolar stop|d]]'', ''[[Voiceless bilabial stop|p]]'' and ''[[Voiced bilabial stop|b]]'', the [[Sibilant|hissing sounds]] ''[[Voiceless postalveolar fricative#Voiceless palato-alveolar fricative|sh]]'' and ''[[Voiceless alveolar fricative#Voiceless alveolar sibilant|s]]'', and also the [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] ''[[Voiceless postalveolar affricate|ch]]'' and ''[[Voiced postalveolar affricate|j]]'', in rapid succession in a line or passage, creating a harsh and discordant effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/cacophony/|title=Cacophony Examples and Definition|date=2015-08-14|website=Literary Devices|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n''Hear the loud alarum bells\u2013''\n<br>''Brazen bells!

When used colloquially, it is often accompanied by multiple [[exclamation mark]]s and in [[all caps]]. It is common in comic strips and some cartoons.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome examples include these: ''smek'', ''thwap'', ''kaboom'', ''ding-dong'', ''plop'', ''bang'' and ''pew''.\n\n== Word repetition ==\nWord repetition rhetorical devices operate via [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repeating]] words or phrases in various ways, usually for emphasis.\n\n=== Anadiplosis/Conduplicatio ===\n[[Anadiplosis]] involves repeating the last word(s) of one sentence, phrase or clause at or near the beginning of the next.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n''To die, to sleep;''\n<br>''To sleep, perchance to dream\u2026'' ([[Hamlet]] 3.1)\n\n''It is the stars,''\n<br>''The stars above us govern our conditions.''

([[Richard III (play)|R3]] 5.3)\n\n=== Anaphora/Epistrophe/Symploce/Epianalepsis ===\n[[Anaphora (rhetoric)|Anaphora]] is repeating the same word(s) at the ''beginning'' of successive sentences, phrases or clauses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''There\u2019s no trust,''\n<br>''No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,''\n<br>''All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.''

([[Richard II (play)|R2]] 4.1)\n\n[[Epistrophe]] is repeating the same word(s) at the ''end'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://examples.yourdictionary.com/epistrophe-examples.html|title=Epistrophe Examples|website=YourDictionary|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n''If you had known the virtue of the ring,''\n<br>''Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,''\n<br>''Or your own honour to contain the ring,''\n<br>''You would not then have parted with the ring.'' ([[The Merchant of Venice|MoV]] 5.1)\n\n[[Symploce]] is a simultaneous combination of both anaphora and epistrophe, but repeating different words at the start and end.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/symploce-rhetoric-1692013|title=Rhetorical Repetition: Symploce|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|date=2018-12-25|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n''That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?''\n<br>''That Angelo's a murderer; is't not strange?''\n<br>''That Angelo is an adulterous thief,''\n<br>''An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;''\n<br>''Is it not strange and strange?''

I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.' Sentimental rhetoric! That's the Welsh strain in him. It also accounts for his mendacity and dishonesty.''  ([[George Bernard Shaw]], ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''[[Pygmalion (play)|)]]\n\n[[Epanalepsis]] repeats the same word(s) at the beginning and end.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n''Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!'' ([[Henry V (play)|H5]] 3.1)\n\n=== Epizeuxis/Antanaclasis ===\n[[Epizeuxis]] is simply repetition of the same word.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n''Words, words, words.'' ([[Hamlet]] 2.2)\n\n''O horror! Horror! Horror!'' ([[Macbeth]] 2.3)\n\nAntanaclasis is more witty, repeating the same word but in a different sense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literarydevices.net/antanaclasis/|title=Antanaclasis - Definition and Examples of Antanaclasis|date=2014-05-05|website=Literary Devices|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n''Put out the light, and then put out the light.'' ([[Othello]] 5.2; first referring to extinguishing the candle, then referring to killing Desdemona.)\n\nVIOLA: ''Dost thou live by thy labour?''\n<br> CLOWN: ''No, sir, I live by the church.'' ([[Twelfth Night|12N]] 3.1)\n\n=== Diacope ===\n[[Diacope]] is the repetition of a word or phrase after an intervening word or clause. It can also be thought of as a reshaped [[epanalepsis]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n''Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:''\n<br>''The elements be kind to thee, and make''\n<br>''Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.'' ([[Antony and Cleopatra|A&C]] 3.2)\n\n== Word relation ==\nWord relation rhetorical devices operate via deliberate connections between words within a sentence.\n\n=== Zeugma ===\n[[Zeugma and syllepsis|Zeugma]] involves the linking of two or more words or phrases that occupy the same position in a sentence to another word or phrase in the same sentence. This can take advantage of the latter word having multiple meanings depending on context to create a clever use of language that can make the sentence and the claim thus advanced more eloquent and persuasive. \n\nIn the following examples, 2 nouns (as direct objects) are linked to the same verb which must then be interpreted in 2 different ways.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.reedsy.com/rhetorical-devices/|title=30 Rhetorical Devices \u2014 And How to Use Them|date=2019-01-11|website=Reedsy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n''He caught the train and a bad cold.''\n\n''This shirt attracts everything but men.''\n\n''I held my breath and the door for you.'' \n\nSimilarly, multiple subjects can be linked to the same verb.\n\n''Fred excelled at sports; Harvey at eating; Tom with girls.''\n\n''Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2)\n\n== Discourse level ==\nDiscourse level rhetorical devices rely on relations between phrases, clauses and sentences. Often they relate to how new arguments are introduced into the text or how previous arguments are emphasized. Examples include [[antanagoge]], [[apophasis]], [[aporia]], [[hypophora]], [[Metanoia (rhetoric)|metanoia]] and [[procatalepsis]].\n\n=== Amplification/Pleonasm ===\nAmplification involves repeating a word or expression while adding more detail, to emphasise what might otherwise be passed over.<ref name=\":4\" /> This allows one to call attention to and expand a point to ensure the reader realizes its importance or centrality in the discussion.\n\n''But this revolting boy, of course,''\n<br>''Was so unutterably vile,''\n<br>''So greedy, foul, and infantile''\n<br>''He left a most disgusting taste''\n<br>''Inside our mouths\u2026'' ([[Roald Dahl]], ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|)]]\n\n[[Pleonasm]] involves using more words than necessary to describe an idea. This creates emphasis and can introduce additional elements of meaning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literarydevices.net/pleonasm/|title=Pleonasm - Definition and Examples of Pleonasm|date=2014-02-14|website=Literary Devices|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n''I heard it with my own ears.''\n\n''Swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time, matter or other circumstance''. ([[Measure for Measure|Measure]] 4.2)\n\n=== Antanagoge ===\n[[Antanagoge]] involves \u2018placing a good point or benefit next to a fault criticism, or problem in order to reduce the impact or significance of the negative point\u2019.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm|title=A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices|last=Harris|first=Robert A.|date=2013|website=virtualsalt.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n''Within the infant rind of this weak flower''\n<br>''Poison hath residence, and medicine power.''

Craig; Thonssen, Lester (1948). \"Chapter 15 The Style of Public Address\". [https://www.questia.com/library/2465598/speech-criticism-the-development-of-standards-for Speech Criticism, the Development of Standards for Rhetorical Appraisal].

([[The Merchant of Venice|MoV]] 3.2)\n\nThis device has a number of effects that make it quite useful in politics. [[Donald Trump]], for instance, has been noted to frequently use [[apophasis]] when attacking his political opponents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rhetorical-device_n_56c358cbe4b0c3c55052b32b|title=He Would Never Say It, But This Is Donald Trump's Favorite Rhetorical Device|last=Bobic|first=Igor|date=16 February 2016|website=Huffington Post|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/11/politics/north-korea-trump-asia-trip/index.html|title=Trump sarcastically responds to Kim Jong Un|last=Karimi|first=Faith|date=11 November 2017|website=CNN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Aporia ===\n[[Aporia]] is the rhetorical expression of doubt.<ref name=\":3\" /> The most famous example of this is undoubtedly Hamlet\u2019s soliloquy, which begins:\n\n''To be or not to be, that is the question.'' ([[Hamlet]] 3.1)\n\nAnother example is in Antony\u2019s famous speech at Caesar\u2019s funeral, which includes examples such as:\n\n''Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept.'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2)\n\nWhen the rhetorical question posed is answered, this is also an instance of [[hypophora]]. \n\n=== Derision ===\nThis involves setting up an opposing position to ridicule without offering a counterargument<ref name=\":2\" />, such as:\n\n''You believe we should vote for him? I\u2019ve got a bridge to sell you.''\n\nNo reason for why one should not vote for him is given. It is merely implied that it would be gullible to do so.\n\n=== Hyperbole ===\n[[Hyperbole]] is deliberate exaggeration.<ref name=\":3\" /> This can be for literary effect:\n\n''The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,''\n<br>''As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven''\n<br>''Would through the airy region stream so bright''\n<br>''That birds would sing and think it were not night'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.2)\n\n''His face was as the heavens...'' \n<br>''His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm''\n<br>''Crested the world... realms and islands were''\n<br>''As plates dropp'd from his pocket.'' ([[Antony and Cleopatra|A&C]] 5.2)\n\nOr for argumentative effect:\n\n''Her election to Parliament would be the worst thing to ever happen to this country!'' <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Hypophora ===\nThe use of [[hypophora]] is the technique whereby one asks a question and then proceeds to answer the question. This device is one of the most useful strategies in writing essays to inform or persuade a reader.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=McGuigan, Brendan|title=Rhetorical devices : a handbook and activities for student writers|others=Moliken, Paul,, Grudzina, Douglas|year=2011|isbn=978-1-58049-765-7|edition=Revised [edition]|location=Clayton, DE|oclc=816509713}}</ref> \n\n''Can honour set to a leg?

Who hath it? He that died a' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. 'Tis insensible, then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it.'' ([[Henry IV, Part 1|1H4]] 5.1) \n\n=== Innuendo ===\nThis device indirectly implies an accusation without explicitly stating it.<ref name=\":2\" /> This can be combined with [[apophasis]].  \n\n''I know you aren\u2019t an alcoholic, but I did notice you\u2019ve replaced all the bottles in your liquor cabinet.''\n\n=== Metanoia ===\n[[Metanoia (rhetoric)|Metanoia]] qualifies a statement or by recalling or rejecting it in part or full, and then re-expressing it in a better, milder, or stronger way.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> A negative is often used to do the recalling.\n\n''All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows\u2026'' ([[Cymbeline]] 2.4)\n\n''He was the best of men - no, of all humanity.''\n\n=== Procatalepsis ===\nBy anticipating and answering a possible objection, [[procatalepsis]] allows an argument to continue while rebutting points opposing it. It is a relative of [[hypophora]]. Procatalepsis can be used strategically to show that concerns have been thought through.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n''\u2018All right!\u2019 you\u2019ll cry. \u2018All right!\u2019 you\u2019ll say,''\n<br>''\u2018But if we take the set away,''\n<br>''What shall we do to entertain''\n<br>''Our darling children?

This means the force of the description is less than what is expected, thus highlighting the irony or extreme nature of an event.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n''The war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage.'' (The ''[[Jewel Voice Broadcast]]'')\n\nBENVOLIO: ''What, art thou hurt?''\n<br>MERCUTIO: ''Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch''. ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 3.1; Mercutio dies of his wounds shortly after.)\n\nThe captain\u2019s announcement onboard [[British Airways Flight 9]] has been described as \u2018a masterpiece of understatement\u2019<ref>[[Macarthur Job|Job]], Macarthur (1994).

The omitted part must be clearly understood by the reader.\n\n''Mark\u2019d ye his words? He would not take the crown;''\n\n''Therefore \u2018tis certain he was not ambitious.'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2; the premise implied is that any ambitious person would take the crown)\n\n=== Irony ===\n[[Irony]] is the figure of speech where the words of a speaker intends to express a meaning that is directly opposite of the said words.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n''Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest -''\n<br>''For Brutus is an honourable man;''\n<br>''So are they all, all honourable men -''\n<br>''Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.''\n<br>''He was my friend, faithful and just to me:''\n<br>''But Brutus says he was ambitious;''\n<br>''And Brutus is an honourable man.'' ([[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] 3.2; Antony attacks Brutus\u2019s character and that of his co-conspirators)\n\n=== Metaphor ===\n[[Metaphor]] connects two different things to one another. It is frequently invoked by the ''to be'' verb. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The use of metaphor in rhetoric is primarily to convey to the audience a new idea or meaning by linking it to an already familiar idea or meaning. \n\nIn the following example, Romeo compares Juliet to the sun, and this metaphor connecting Juliet to the sun shows that Romeo sees Juliet as being radiant and regards her as an essential being.\n\n''But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?''\n<br>''It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.2)\n\n=== Personification ===\n[[Personification]] is the representation of animals, inanimate objects and ideas as having human attributes.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the following example Romeo personifies love as being blind yet able to enamour someone.\n\n''Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,''\n''<br>Should without eyes see pathways to his will!'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 1.1)\n\n=== Simile ===\n[[Simile]] compares two different things that resemble each other in at least one way. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> It uses the ''as\u2026 as'' construction as compared to metaphor which is direct equivalence.\n\nIn the following example, the nurse compares Romeo\u2019s manners and behaviour to a lamb.\n\n''I\u2019ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.'' ([[Romeo and Juliet|R&J]] 2.5)\n\nAnother example can be seen in a conversation between Emilia and Othello.\n\nOTHELLO: ''She was false as water''.\n<br>EMILIA: ''Thou art rash as fire,''\n<br>''To say that she was false. Oh, she was''\n<br>''heavenly true!''
