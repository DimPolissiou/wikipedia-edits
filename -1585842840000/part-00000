While the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia falls within the Art Nouveau period, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] points out that, along with [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, Gaud\u00ed carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration.<ref name=Pevsner/>\n\n===Plan===\nWhile never intended to be a [[cathedral]] (seat of a bishop), the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia was planned from the outset to be a cathedral-sized building.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as [[Burgos Cathedral]], [[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]] and [[Seville Cathedral]]. In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an [[ambulatory]] with a [[chevet]] of seven [[apsidal]] chapels, a multitude of steeples and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of this church has an unusual feature: a covered passage or [[cloister]] which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the [[narthex]] of each of its three portals. With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar's crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaud\u00ed's design or its deviations from traditional church architecture.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  There are no exact [[right angle]]s to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|last2=Handy|first2=Amy|title=The Annotated Arch: A Crash Course in the History of Architecture|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rdiFhC6XOWwC|accessdate=26 October 2018|volume=2|date=11 April 2001|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=9780740710247|page=112}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaud\u00ed|first1=Antoni |last2=Cuito|first2=Aurora |last3=Montes|first3=Cristina |title=Gaud\u00ed|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f90NukJl5cIC|accessdate=26 October 2018|year=2002|publisher=A.

The spire height will follow Gaud\u00ed's intention, which according to the report will work with the existing foundation.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe Evangelists' spires will be surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull ([[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]]), a winged man ([[Matthew the Apostle|Saint Matthew]]), an eagle ([[John the Evangelist|Saint John]]), and a winged lion ([[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]]).

The Nativity Fa\u00e7ade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaud\u00ed influence. The Passion fa\u00e7ade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the steeples, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the [[Christian cross|Cross]]. These controversial designs are the work of [[Josep Maria Subirachs]]. The Glory fa\u00e7ade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the [[Seven deadly sins]] and the [[Seven heavenly virtues]].\n\n====Nativity Fa\u00e7ade====\n[[File:Die Geburtsfassade der Sagrada Familia im Detail.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the choir of angel children]]\n\nConstructed between 1894 and 1930, the Nativity fa\u00e7ade was the first fa\u00e7ade to be completed. Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaud\u00ed's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the fa\u00e7ade, and are symbolic of change.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The [[Tree of Life]] rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity. Four steeples complete the fa\u00e7ade and are each dedicated to a Saint ([[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], [[Barnabas]], [[Jude the Apostle]], and [[Simon the Zealot]]).\n\nOriginally, Gaud\u00ed intended for this fa\u00e7ade to be [[polychrome]]d, for each [[archivolt]] to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.<ref>{{cite book | last = Berg\u00f3s i Mass\u00f3 | first = Joan | title = Gaud\u00ed, l'home i l'obra | year = 1999 | publisher=Ed.

He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this fa\u00e7ade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Fa\u00e7ade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it.<ref>{{cite book | last = Barral i Altet | first = Xavier | title = Art de Catalunya.

Dedicated to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his [[crucifixion]], the fa\u00e7ade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaud\u00ed for future architects and sculptors. The steeples were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the fa\u00e7ade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaud\u00ed intended for this fa\u00e7ade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to \"break\" arcs and \"cut\" columns, and to use the effect of [[chiaroscuro]] (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.\n\nFacing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Fa\u00e7ade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble [[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]] trunks. Above there is a pyramidal [[pediment]], made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four steeples is dedicated to an apostle ([[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]]) and, like the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.\n\nThe scenes sculpted into the fa\u00e7ade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an ''S'' form and reproduce the stations of the Cross ([[Via Crucis]] of Christ).<ref name=\"gimeno\">{{cite book | last = G\u00f3mez Gimeno | first = Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 | title = La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia | year = 2006 | publisher=Mundo Flip Ediciones | isbn = 84-933983-4-9 |pages=86\u201387}}</ref> The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the [[Last Supper]], [[Kiss of Judas]], [[Ecce homo]], and the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]]. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes [[The Three Marys]], Saint [[Longinus]], [[Saint Veronica]], and a [[hollow-face illusion]] of Christ on the [[Veil of Veronica]]. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the [[Resurrection of Christ]] can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the steeples of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the [[Ascension of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html |title=La Sagrada Familia abrir\u00e1 al culto en 2008, seg\u00fan sus responsables |trans-title=The Sagrada Familia opens for worship in 2008, according to its leaders |date=2 June 2005 | agency=Europa Press |language=Spanish| publisher=Mundinteractivos, SA |work=El Mundo| accessdate=7 July 2010 }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html&hl=en&langpair=auto|en&tbb=1&ie=ISO-8859-1 English tr.])</ref>\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade contains a [[magic square]] based on<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://blog.sagradafamilia.org/en/divulgation/the-magic-square-the-passion-facade-keys-to-understanding-it/\n |title=The magic square on the Passion fa\u00e7ade: keys to understanding it\n |author=<!--Not stated-->\n |date=7 February 2018\n |website=Blog Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\n |publisher=\n |access-date=7 December 2018\n |quote= }}</ref> the magic square in the 1514 print [[Melencolia I]].

Aware that he would not live long enough to see this fa\u00e7ade completed, Gaud\u00ed made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were base for the development of the design for the fa\u00e7ade.

The central nave vaults reach {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} while the side nave vaults reach {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a 7.5{{nbsp}}metre (25&nbsp;ft) grid. However, the columns of the [[apse]], resting on del Villar's foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. Gaud\u00ed intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse; thus the graduated increase in vault loft.\n\nThere are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view down into the crypt below.\n\nThe columns of the interior are a unique Gaud\u00ed design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counter-clockwise).\n\nEssentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration.\n\n====Organ====\nIn 2010 an [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard.\n\nTo overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church's architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8000 pipes when completed.<ref>Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat, [http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903070257/http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf |date=3 September 2011 }} {{in lang|ca}}</ref>\n\n===Geometric details===\n{{Further|Mathematics and art}}\n\n[[File:AlphaOmega.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alpha and Omega]] carving at Sagrada Fam\u00edlia entrance]]\n\nThe steeples on the Nativity fa\u00e7ade are crowned with [[Mathematics and art|geometrically shaped]] tops that are reminiscent of [[Cubism]] (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of [[Art Nouveau]], but Gaud\u00ed's unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization.\n\nGaud\u00ed used [[hyperboloid structure]]s in later designs of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (more obviously after 1914). However, there are a few places on the nativity fa\u00e7ade\u2014a design not equated with Gaud\u00ed's [[ruled surface|ruled-surface]] design\u2014where the [[hyperboloid]] crops up. For example, all around the scene with the pelican, there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures).

The steeples are decorated with words such as \"Hosanna\", \"Excelsis\", and \"Sanctus\"; the great doors of the Passion fa\u00e7ade reproduce excerpts of the [[Passion of Jesus]] from the New Testament in various languages, mainly [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; and the Glory fa\u00e7ade is to be decorated with the words from the [[Apostles' Creed]], while its main door reproduce the entire [[Lord's Prayer]] in Catalan, surrounded by multiple variations of \"Give us this day our daily bread\" in other languages. The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ's life. The Nativity Fa\u00e7ade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory fa\u00e7ade is dedicated to his glory period. The Passion fa\u00e7ade is symbolic of his suffering. The apse steeple bears Latin text of [[Hail Mary]]. All in all, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is symbolic of the lifetime of Christ.\n\nAreas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match.\n\n===Burials===\n*Josep Maria Bocabella\n*[[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]\n\n==Appraisal==\nThe art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaud\u00ed's buildings as growing \"like [[Sugarloaf|sugar loaves]] and anthills\" and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly \"bad taste\" but handled with vitality and \"ruthless audacity\".<ref name=Pevsner>[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Penguin Books, (1963), pp. 394\u20135</ref>\n\nThe building's design itself has been polarizing.

In 1883, when Villar resigned,<ref name= UNESCO/> Gaud\u00ed took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and curvilinear [[Art Nouveau]] forms.

In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an [[ambulatory]] with a [[chevet]] of seven [[apsidal]] chapels, a multitude of steeples and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of this church has an unusual feature: a covered passage or [[cloister]] which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the [[narthex]] of each of its three portals.

The Nativity Fa\u00e7ade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaud\u00ed influence. The Passion fa\u00e7ade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the steeples, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the [[Christian cross|Cross]]. These controversial designs are the work of [[Josep Maria Subirachs]]. The Glory fa\u00e7ade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the [[Seven deadly sins]] and the [[Seven heavenly virtues]].\n\n====Nativity Fa\u00e7ade====\n[[File:Die Geburtsfassade der Sagrada Familia im Detail.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the choir of angel children]]\n\nConstructed between 1894 and 1930, the Nativity fa\u00e7ade was the first fa\u00e7ade to be completed. Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaud\u00ed's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the fa\u00e7ade, and are symbolic of change.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The [[Tree of Life]] rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity. Four steeples complete the fa\u00e7ade and are each dedicated to a Saint ([[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], [[Barnabas]], [[Jude the Apostle]], and [[Simon the Zealot]]).\n\nOriginally, Gaud\u00ed intended for this fa\u00e7ade to be [[polychrome]]d, for each [[archivolt]] to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.<ref>{{cite book | last = Berg\u00f3s i Mass\u00f3 | first = Joan | title = Gaud\u00ed, l'home i l'obra | year = 1999 | publisher=Ed.

He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this fa\u00e7ade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Fa\u00e7ade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it.<ref>{{cite book | last = Barral i Altet | first = Xavier | title = Art de Catalunya.

Dedicated to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his [[crucifixion]], the fa\u00e7ade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaud\u00ed for future architects and sculptors. The steeples were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the fa\u00e7ade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaud\u00ed intended for this fa\u00e7ade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to \"break\" arcs and \"cut\" columns, and to use the effect of [[chiaroscuro]] (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.\n\nFacing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Fa\u00e7ade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble [[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]] trunks. Above there is a pyramidal [[pediment]], made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four steeples is dedicated to an apostle ([[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]]) and, like the Nativity Fa\u00e7ade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.\n\nThe scenes sculpted into the fa\u00e7ade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an ''S'' form and reproduce the stations of the Cross ([[Via Crucis]] of Christ).<ref name=\"gimeno\">{{cite book | last = G\u00f3mez Gimeno | first = Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 | title = La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia | year = 2006 | publisher=Mundo Flip Ediciones | isbn = 84-933983-4-9 |pages=86\u201387}}</ref> The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the [[Last Supper]], [[Kiss of Judas]], [[Ecce homo]], and the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]]. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes [[The Three Marys]], Saint [[Longinus]], [[Saint Veronica]], and a [[hollow-face illusion]] of Christ on the [[Veil of Veronica]]. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the [[Resurrection of Christ]] can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the steeples of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the [[Ascension of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html |title=La Sagrada Familia abrir\u00e1 al culto en 2008, seg\u00fan sus responsables |trans-title=The Sagrada Familia opens for worship in 2008, according to its leaders |date=2 June 2005 | agency=Europa Press |language=Spanish| publisher=Mundinteractivos, SA |work=El Mundo| accessdate=7 July 2010 }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html&hl=en&langpair=auto|en&tbb=1&ie=ISO-8859-1 English tr.])</ref>\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade contains a [[magic square]] based on<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://blog.sagradafamilia.org/en/divulgation/the-magic-square-the-passion-facade-keys-to-understanding-it/\n |title=The magic square on the Passion fa\u00e7ade: keys to understanding it\n |author=<!--Not stated-->\n |date=7 February 2018\n |website=Blog Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\n |publisher=\n |access-date=7 December 2018\n |quote= }}</ref> the magic square in the 1514 print [[Melencolia I]].

Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while [[Hell]] is left for those who deviate from God's will. Aware that he would not live long enough to see this fa\u00e7ade completed, Gaud\u00ed made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were base for the development of the design for the fa\u00e7ade.

Inscribed with the [[Lord's prayer]], these central doors are inscribed with the words \"Give us our daily bread\" in fifty different languages.  The handles of the door are the letters \"A\" and \"G\" that form the initials of Antoni Gaud\u00ed within the phrase \"lead us not into temptation\".\n\n===Interior===\n{{For|definitions of the architectural terms|Cathedral floorplan}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Interior of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\" widths=\"210\" heights=\"210\" mode=\"packed-hover\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Sagrada Fam\u00edlia interior north east.jpg|Standing in the transept and looking northeast (2011)\nFile:Sagrada Familia nave roof detail.jpg|Detail of the roof in the nave.

The central nave vaults reach {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} while the side nave vaults reach {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a 7.5{{nbsp}}metre (25&nbsp;ft) grid. However, the columns of the [[apse]], resting on del Villar's foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. Gaud\u00ed intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse; thus the graduated increase in vault loft.\n\nThere are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view down into the crypt below.\n\nThe columns of the interior are a unique Gaud\u00ed design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counter-clockwise).\n\nEssentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration.\n\n====Organ====\nIn 2010 an [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard.\n\nTo overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church's architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8000 pipes when completed.<ref>Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat, [http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903070257/http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf |date=3 September 2011 }} {{in lang|ca}}</ref>\n\n===Geometric details===\n{{Further|Mathematics and art}}\n\n[[File:AlphaOmega.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alpha and Omega]] carving at Sagrada Fam\u00edlia entrance]]\n\nThe steeples on the Nativity fa\u00e7ade are crowned with [[Mathematics and art|geometrically shaped]] tops that are reminiscent of [[Cubism]] (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of [[Art Nouveau]], but Gaud\u00ed's unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization.\n\nGaud\u00ed used [[hyperboloid structure]]s in later designs of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (more obviously after 1914). However, there are a few places on the nativity fa\u00e7ade\u2014a design not equated with Gaud\u00ed's [[ruled surface|ruled-surface]] design\u2014where the [[hyperboloid]] crops up. For example, all around the scene with the pelican, there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures). There is a hyperboloid adding structural stability to the cypress tree (by connecting it to the bridge). And finally, the \"bishop's mitre\" spires are capped with hyperboloid structures.<ref name=\"BDM\">{{cite journal |first1=M. C. |last1=Burry |first2=J. R. |last2=Burry |first3=G.

The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ's life. The Nativity Fa\u00e7ade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory fa\u00e7ade is dedicated to his glory period. The Passion fa\u00e7ade is symbolic of his suffering. The apse steeple bears Latin text of [[Hail Mary]]. All in all, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is symbolic of the lifetime of Christ.\n\nAreas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match.\n\n===Burials===\n*Josep Maria Bocabella\n*[[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]\n\n==Appraisal==\nThe art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaud\u00ed's buildings as growing \"like [[Sugarloaf|sugar loaves]] and anthills\" and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly \"bad taste\" but handled with vitality and \"ruthless audacity\".<ref name=Pevsner>[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Penguin Books, (1963), pp. 394\u20135</ref>\n\nThe building's design itself has been polarizing.

It is understood that H protein resides in this area but experimental evidence has not verified its exact location.  Once inside the host bacterium, replication of the [+] ssDNA genome proceeds via [[negative sense DNA]] intermediate.  This is done as the phage genome supercoils and the secondary structure formed by such supercoiling attracts a [[primosome]] protein complex.  This translocates once around the genome and synthesizes a [-]ssDNA from the positive original genome. [+]ssDNA genomes to package into viruses are created from this by a rolling circle mechanism.  This is the mechanism by which the double stranded supercoiled genome is nicked on the positive strand by a virus-encoded A protein, also attracting a bacterial [[DNA polymerase]] (DNAP) to the site of cleavage.  DNAP uses the negative strand as a template to make positive sense DNA.  As it translocates around the genome it displaces the outer strand of already-synthesised DNA, which is immediately coated by [[SSBP]] proteins.  The A protein cleaves the complete genome every time it recognises the origin sequence.\n\nAs D protein is the most abundant gene transcript, it is the most protein in the viral procapsid.  Similarly, gene transcripts for F, J, and G are more abundant than for H as the [[stoichiometry]] for these structural proteins is 5:5:5:1. The primosomes are protein complexes which attach/bind the enzyme [[helicase]] on the template. Primosomes gives RNA primers for DNA synthesis to strands.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Evolution===\nIt has been used as a [[model organism]] in many evolution experiments,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wichman HA, Brown CJ | title = Experimental evolution of viruses: Microviridae as a model system | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This translocates once around the genome and synthesizes a [-]ssDNA from the positive original genome. [+]ssDNA genomes to package into viruses are created from this by a rolling circle mechanism.  This is the mechanism by which the double stranded supercoiled genome is nicked on the positive strand by a virus-encoded A protein, also attracting a bacterial [[DNA polymerase]] (DNAP) to the site of cleavage.  DNAP uses the negative strand as a template to make positive sense DNA.  As it translocates around the genome it displaces the outer strand of already-synthesised DNA, which is immediately coated by [[SSBP]] proteins.  The A protein cleaves the complete genome every time it recognises the origin sequence.\n\nAs D protein is the most abundant gene transcript, it is the most protein in the viral procapsid.  Similarly, gene transcripts for F, J, and G are more abundant than for H as the [[stoichiometry]] for these structural proteins is 5:5:5:1. The primosomes are protein complexes which attach/bind the enzyme [[helicase]] on the template. Primosomes gives RNA primers for DNA synthesis to strands.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Evolution===\nIt has been used as a [[model organism]] in many evolution experiments,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wichman HA, Brown CJ | title = Experimental evolution of viruses: Microviridae as a model system | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

For example, the opening introduction in ''The Book of Marvels'' to \"emperors and kings, dukes and marquises\" was lifted straight out of an [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian romance]] Rustichello had written several years earlier, and the account of the second meeting between Polo and Kublai Khan at the latter's court is almost the same as that of the arrival of [[Tristan]] at the court of [[King Arthur]] at [[Camelot]] in that same book.<ref>Latham, Ronald \"Introduction\" pp. 7\u201320 from ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', London: Folio Society, 1958 pp. 11\u201312.</ref> Latham believed that many elements of the book, such as legends of the Middle East and mentions of exotic marvels, may have been the work of Rustichello who was giving what medieval European readers expected to find in a travel book.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Latham, Ronald \"Introduction\" pp. 7\u201320 from ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', London: Folio Society, 1958 p. 12.</ref>\n\n=== Role of the Dominican Order ===\n\nApparently, from the very beginning Marco's story aroused contrasting reactions, as it was received by some with a certain disbelief. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican father]] [[Francesco Pipino]] was the author of a translation into Latin,  ''Iter Marci Pauli Veneti'' in 1302, just a few years after Marco's return to Venice. Francesco Pipino solemnly affirmed the truthfulness of the book and defined Marco as a \"prudent, honoured and faithful man\".<ref name=\"Rinaldo Fulin 1924, p. 255\">[Rinaldo Fulin, Archivio Veneto, 1924, p. 255]</ref>\nIn his writings, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican brother]]  Jacopo d'Acqui explains why his contemporaries were skeptical about the content of the book. He also relates that before dying, Marco Polo insisted that \"he had told only a half of the things he had seen\".<ref name=\"Rinaldo Fulin 1924, p. 255\"/>\n\nAccording to some recent research of the Italian scholar Antonio Montefusco, the very close relationship that Marco Polo cultivated with members of the [[Dominican Order]] in Venice suggests that local fathers collaborated with him for a Latin version of the book, which means that Rustichello's text was translated into Latin for a precise will of the Order.<ref name=\"unive.it\"/>\n\nSince Dominican fathers had among their [[Christian mission|missions]] that of evangelizing foreign peoples (cf. the role of Dominican missionaries in China<ref>[https://books.google.at/books?id=e7xWAAAAcAAJ&dq=domenicani+missionari&hl=it&source=gbs_navlinks_s Natalis Alexandre, 1699, Apologia de'padri domenicani missionarii della China]</ref> and in the Indies<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Jb6aUU-a0u0C <!-- quote=domenicani missionari. --> Giovanni Michele, 1696 Galleria de'Sommi Pontefici, patriarchi, arcivescovi, e vescovi dell'ordine de'Predicatori, vol.2, p. 5]</ref>), it is reasonable to think that they considered Marco's book as a trustworthy piece of information for [[Mission (station)|missions]] in the East.

Polo had at times refuted the 'marvelous' fables and legends given in other European accounts, and despite some exaggerations and errors, Polo's accounts have relatively few of the descriptions of irrational marvels. In many cases where present (mostly given in the first part before he reached China, such as mentions of Christian miracles), he made a clear distinction that they are what he had heard rather than what he had seen.  It is also largely free of the gross errors found in other accounts such as those given by the Moroccan traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] who had confused the [[Yellow River]] with the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and other waterways, and believed that [[porcelain]] was made from coal.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Marco Polo's China: A Venetian in the Realm of Khubilai Khan |first= Stephen G. |last=Haw |pages=66\u201367 |publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-27542-7|year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nModern studies have further shown that details given in Marco Polo's book, such as the currencies used, salt productions and revenues, are accurate and unique. Such detailed descriptions are not found in other non-Chinese sources, and their accuracy is supported by archaeological evidence as well as Chinese records compiled after Polo had left China. His accounts are therefore unlikely to have been obtained second hand.<ref name=\"vogel\"/> Other accounts have also been verified; for example, when visiting [[Zhenjiang]] in [[Jiangsu]], China, Marco Polo noted that a large number of [[Christian church]]es had been built there.

Mario Eusebi, p. 162]\n}}\n\nThis sentence in ''The Book of Marvels'' was interpreted as Marco Polo was \"the governor\" of the city of \"Yangiu\" [[Yangzhou]] for three years, and later of [[Hangzhou]]. This claim has raised some controversy. According to [[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]]  no Chinese source mentions him as either a friend of the Emperor or as the governor of Yangzhou \u2013 indeed no Chinese source mentions Marco Polo at all.<ref name=\"Morgan, D page 223\">Morgan, D.O. \"Marco Polo in China\u2014Or Not\" 221\u2013225 from ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', Volume 6, Issue # 2 July 1996 p. 223.</ref> In fact, in the 1960s the German historian [[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Herbert Franke]] noted that all occurrences of Po-lo or Bolod (an [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] word meaning \"steel\") in Yuan texts were names of people of Mongol or Turkic extraction.<ref name=\"franke\"/>\n\nHowever, in the 2010s the Chinese scholar [[Peng Hai]] identified Marco Polo with a certain \"Boluo\", a courtier of the emperor, who is mentioned in the [[History of Yuan|Yuanshi]] (\"History of Yuan\") since he was arrested in 1274 by an imperial dignitary named Saman. The accusation was that Boluo had walked on the same side of the road as a female courtesan, in contravention of the order for men and women to walk on opposite sides of the road inside the city.<ref>Peng, Hai, 2010, \"Makeboluolaihuashishi\", Beijing : Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, {{ISBN|9787500492214}}</ref> According to the \"Yuanshi\" records, Boluo was released at the request of the emperor himself, and was then transferred to the region of Ningxia, in the northeast of present-day China, in the spring of 1275. The date could correspond to the first mission marco Polo speaks of.<ref>Giulio Busi, \"Marco Polo. Viaggio ai confini del Medioevo\", Collezione Le Scie. Nuova serie, Milano, Mondadori, 2018, {{ISBN|978-88-0470-292-4}}, \u00a7 \"Boluo, il funzionario invisibile\"</ref>\n\nIf this identification is correct, there is a record about Marco Polo in Chinese sources. These conjectures seem to be supported by the fact that in addition to the imperial dignitary Saman (the one who had arrested the official named \"Boluo\"), the documents mention his brother, Xiangwei. According to sources, Saman died shortly after the incident, while Xiangwei was transferred to Yangzhou in 1282-1283. Marco Polo reports that he was moved to Hangzhou the following year, in 1284. It has been supposed that these displacements are due to the intention to avoid further conflicts between the two.<ref name=\"Busi\">[[Giulio Busi]], \"Marco Polo.

However, some records prove he was not the first nor the only one. In his book, Marco mentions an official named \"Mar Sarchis\" who probably was a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] [[bishop]], and he says he founded two Christian churches in the region of \"Caigiu\". This official is actually mentioned in the local gazette ''Zhishun Zhenjian zhi'' under the name \"Ma Xuelijisi\" and the qualification of \"General of Third Class\". Always in the gazette, it is said Ma Xuelijsi was an assistant supervisor in the province of Zhenjiang for three years, and that during this time he founded two Christian churches.<ref>[https://books.google.at/books?id=HIR1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22Ma+Xuelijisi%22&source=bl&ots=UMg7_KXI_Q&sig=ACfU3U1g-z2UxmniZi47vYmfOhHjw-TjMw&hl=it&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU7Nm5tu3mAhVCx4sKHeCqCOIQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Ma%20Xuelijisi%22&f=false Yearbook of Chinese Theology 2018 p. 137]</ref><ref name=\"Vogel\">{{cite book |author=Hans Ulrich Vogel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ydo_9TEmuVQC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1 |title=Marco Polo Was in China: New Evidence from Currencies, Salts and Revenues|publisher=  Brill |year= 2012|isbn= 978-90-04-23193-1|page=358}}</ref><ref name=\"Busi\" /> In fact, it is a well-documented fact that [[Kublai Khan]] trusted foreigners more than Chinese subjects in internal affairs.<ref name=\"Vogel:2\">{{cite book |author=Hans Ulrich Vogel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ydo_9TEmuVQC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1 |title=Marco Polo Was in China: New Evidence from Currencies, Salts and Revenues|publisher=  Brill |year= 2012|isbn= 978-90-04-23193-1|page=69}}</ref><ref name=\"Busi\" />\n\n[[Stephen G.

In fact, Polo does not even imply that he had led 1,000 personnel. Haw points out that Polo himself appears to state only that he had been an emissary of the khan, in a position with some esteem. According to Haw, this is a reasonable claim if Polo was, for example, a ''[[keshig]]'' \u2013 a member of the imperial guard by the same name, which included as many as 14,000 individuals at the time.<ref name=\"haw 2006 173\"/> \n\nHaw explains how the earliest [[manuscript]]s of Polo's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou, with some stating he was just a simple resident, others stating he was a governor, and [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio|Ramusio's manuscript]] claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else, yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan.<ref>Stephen G.

For example, Sinologist [[Francis Woodman Cleaves]] noted that Polo's account of the voyage of the princess [[K\u00f6k\u00f6chin]] from China to Persia to marry the \u012al-kh\u0101n in 1293 has been confirmed by a passage in the 15th-century Chinese work ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'' and by the Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in his work ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]''.  However neither of these accounts mentions Polo or indeed any European as part of the bridal party,<ref name=\"cleaves\">{{cite journal |jstor=2718743|author=Francis Woodman Cleaves|title=A Chinese Source Bearing on Marco Polo's Departure from China and a Persian Source on his Arrival in Persia|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies| volume=36|date= 1976|pages=181\u2013203|doi=10.2307/2718743}}</ref> and Wood used the lack of mention of Polo in these works as an example of Polo's \"retelling of a well-known tale\".  Morgan, in Polo's defence, noted that even the princess herself was not mentioned in the Chinese source, and that it would have been surprising if Polo had been mentioned by Rashid-al-Din.<ref name=\"Morgan, D page 224\" /> Historian [[Igor de Rachewiltz]] strongly criticised Wood's arguments in his review of her book.<ref name=\"Rachewiltz 1997 pp. 34\">Igor de Rachewiltz, \"Marco Polo Went to China,\" ''Zentralasiatische Studien'' 27 (1997), pp. 34\u201392</ref> Rachewiltz argued that Marco Polo's account in fact allows the Persian and Chinese sources to be reconciled \u2013 by relaying the information that two of the three envoys sent (mentioned in the Chinese source and whose names accord with those given by Polo) had died during the voyage, it explains why only the third who survived, Coja/Khoja, was mentioned by Rash\u00ecd al-D\u00ecn. Polo had therefore completed the story by providing information not found in either source. He also noted that the only Persian source that mentions the princess was not completed until 1310\u201311, therefore Marco Polo could not have learned the information from any Persian book.  According to de Rachewiltz, the concordance of Polo's detailed account of the princess with other independent sources that gave only incomplete information is proof of the veracity of Polo's story and his presence in China.<ref name=\"Rachewiltz 1997 pp. 34\"/>\n\n===Assessments===\nMorgan writes that since much of what ''The Book of Marvels'' has to say about China is \"demonstrably correct\",  any claim that Polo did not go to China \"creates far more problems than it solves\", therefore the \"balance of probabilities\" strongly suggests that Polo really did go to China, even if he exaggerated somewhat his importance in China.<ref>Morgan, D.O. \"Marco Polo in China\u2014Or Not\" 221\u2013225 from ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', Volume 6, Issue # 2 July 1996 pages 225.</ref> Haw dismisses the various anachronistic criticisms of Polo's accounts that started in the 17th century, and highlights Polo's accuracy in great part of his accounts, for example on the lay of the land such as the [[Grand Canal of China]].<ref>Stephen G.

For example, the opening introduction in ''The Book of Marvels'' to \"emperors and kings, dukes and marquises\" was lifted straight out of an [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian romance]] Rustichello had written several years earlier, and the account of the second meeting between Polo and Kublai Khan at the latter's court is almost the same as that of the arrival of [[Tristan]] at the court of [[King Arthur]] at [[Camelot]] in that same book.<ref>Latham, Ronald \"Introduction\" pp. 7\u201320 from ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', London: Folio Society, 1958 pp. 11\u201312.</ref> Latham believed that many elements of the book, such as legends of the Middle East and mentions of exotic marvels, may have been the work of Rustichello who was giving what medieval European readers expected to find in a travel book.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Latham, Ronald \"Introduction\" pp. 7\u201320 from ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', London: Folio Society, 1958 p. 12.</ref>\n\n=== Role of the Dominican Order ===\n\nApparently, from the very beginning Marco's story aroused contrasting reactions, as it was received by some with a certain disbelief. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican father]] [[Francesco Pipino]] was the author of a translation into Latin,  '''Iter Marci Pauli Veneti''' in 1302, just a few years after Marco's return to Venice. Francesco Pipino solemnly affirmed the truthfulness of the book and defined Marco as a \"prudent, honoured and faithful man\".<ref name=\"Rinaldo Fulin 1924, p. 255\">[Rinaldo Fulin, Archivio Veneto, 1924, p. 255]</ref>\nIn his writings, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican brother]]  Jacopo d'Acqui explains why his contemporaries were skeptical about the content of the book. He also relates that before dying, Marco Polo insisted that \"he had told only a half of the things he had seen\".<ref name=\"Rinaldo Fulin 1924, p. 255\"/>\n\nAccording to some recent research of the Italian scholar Antonio Montefusco, the very close relationship that Marco Polo cultivated with members of the [[Dominican Order]] in Venice suggests that local fathers collaborated with him for a Latin version of the book, which means that Rustichello's text was translated into Latin for a precise will of the Order.<ref name=\"unive.it\"/>\n\nSince Dominican fathers had among their missions that of evangelizing foreign peoples (cf. the role of Dominican missionaries in China<ref>[https://books.google.at/books?id=e7xWAAAAcAAJ&dq=domenicani+missionari&hl=it&source=gbs_navlinks_s Natalis Alexandre, 1699, Apologia de'padri domenicani missionarii della China]</ref> and in the Indies<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Jb6aUU-a0u0C <!-- quote=domenicani missionari. --> Giovanni Michele, 1696 Galleria de'Sommi Pontefici, patriarchi, arcivescovi, e vescovi dell'ordine de'Predicatori, vol.2, p. 5]</ref>), it is reasonable to think that they considered Marco's book as a trustworthy piece of information for missions in the East.

Polo had at times refuted the 'marvelous' fables and legends given in other European accounts, and despite some exaggerations and errors, Polo's accounts have relatively few of the descriptions of irrational marvels. In many cases where present (mostly given in the first part before he reached China, such as mentions of Christian miracles), he made a clear distinction that they are what he had heard rather than what he had seen.  It is also largely free of the gross errors found in other accounts such as those given by the Moroccan traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] who had confused the [[Yellow River]] with the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and other waterways, and believed that porcelain was made from coal.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Marco Polo's China: A Venetian in the Realm of Khubilai Khan |first= Stephen G. |last=Haw |pages=66\u201367 |publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-27542-7|year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nModern studies have further shown that details given in Marco Polo's book, such as the currencies used, salt productions and revenues, are accurate and unique. Such detailed descriptions are not found in other non-Chinese sources, and their accuracy is supported by archaeological evidence as well as Chinese records compiled after Polo had left China. His accounts are therefore unlikely to have been obtained second hand.<ref name=\"vogel\"/> Other accounts have also been verified; for example, when visiting [[Zhenjiang]] in [[Jiangsu]], China, Marco Polo noted that a large number of [[Christian church]]es had been built there.

Mario Eusebi, p. 162]\n}}\n\nThis sentence in ''The Book of Marvels'' was interpreted as Marco Polo was \"the governor\" of the city of \"Yangiu\" [[Yangzhou]] for three years, and later of [[Hangzhou]]. This claim has raised some controversy. According to [[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]]  no Chinese source mentions him as either a friend of the Emperor or as the governor of Yangzhou \u2013 indeed no Chinese source mentions Marco Polo at all.<ref name=\"Morgan, D page 223\">Morgan, D.O. \"Marco Polo in China\u2014Or Not\" 221\u2013225 from ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', Volume 6, Issue # 2 July 1996 p. 223.</ref> In fact, in the 1960s the German historian [[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Herbert Franke]] noted that all occurrences of Po-lo or Bolod (an [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] word meaning \"steel\") in Yuan texts were names of people of Mongol or Turkic extraction.<ref name=\"franke\"/>\n\nHowever, in the 2010s the Chinese scholar [[Peng Hai]] identified Marco Polo with a certain \"Boluo\", a courtier of the emperor, who is mentioned in the [[History of Yuan|Yuanshi]] (\"History of Yuan\") since he was arrested in 1274 by an imperial dignitary named Saman. The accusation was that Boluo had walked on the same side of the road as a female courtesan, in contravention of the order for men and women to walk on opposite sides of the road inside the city.<ref>Peng, Hai, 2010, \"Makeboluolaihuashishi\", Beijing : Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, {{ISBN|9787500492214}}</ref> According to the \"Yuanshi\" records, Boluo was released at the request of the emperor himself, and was then transferred to the region of Ningxia, in the northeast of present-day China, in the spring of 1275. The date could correspond to the first mission marco Polo speaks of.<ref>Giulio Busi, \"Marco Polo. Viaggio ai confini del Medioevo\", Collezione Le Scie. Nuova serie, Milano, Mondadori, 2018, {{ISBN|978-88-0470-292-4}}, \u00a7 \"Boluo, il funzionario invisibile\"</ref>\n\nIf this identification is correct, there is a record about Marco Polo in Chinese sources. These conjectures seem to be supported by the fact that in addition to the imperial dignitary Saman (the one who had arrested the official named \"Boluo\"), the documents mention his brother, Xiangwei. According to sources, Saman died shortly after the incident, while Xiangwei was transferred to Yangzhou in 1282-1283. Marco Polo reports that he was moved to Hangzhou the following year, in 1284. It has been supposed that these displacements are due to the intention to avoid further conflicts between the two.<ref name=\"Busi\">[[Giulio Busi]], \"Marco Polo.

However, some records prove he was not the first nor the only one. In his book, Marco mentions an official named \"Mar Sarchis\" who probably was a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] [[bishop]], and he says he founded two Christian churches in the region of \"Caigiu\". This official is actually mentioned in the local gazette ''Zhishun Zhenjian zhi'' under the name \"Ma Xuelijisi\" and the qualification of \"General of Third Class\". Always in the gazette, it is said Ma Xuelijsi was an assistant supervisor in the province of Zhenjiang for three years, and that during this time he founded two Christian churches.<ref>[https://books.google.at/books?id=HIR1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22Ma+Xuelijisi%22&source=bl&ots=UMg7_KXI_Q&sig=ACfU3U1g-z2UxmniZi47vYmfOhHjw-TjMw&hl=it&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU7Nm5tu3mAhVCx4sKHeCqCOIQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Ma%20Xuelijisi%22&f=false Yearbook of Chinese Theology 2018 p. 137]</ref><ref name=\"Vogel\">{{cite book |author=Hans Ulrich Vogel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ydo_9TEmuVQC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1 |title=Marco Polo Was in China: New Evidence from Currencies, Salts and Revenues|publisher=  Brill |year= 2012|isbn= 978-90-04-23193-1|page=358}}</ref><ref name=\"Busi\" /> In fact, it is a well-documented fact that [[Kublai Khan]] trusted foreigners more than Chinese subjects in internal affairs.<ref name=\"Vogel:2\">{{cite book |author=Hans Ulrich Vogel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ydo_9TEmuVQC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1 |title=Marco Polo Was in China: New Evidence from Currencies, Salts and Revenues|publisher=  Brill |year= 2012|isbn= 978-90-04-23193-1|page=69}}</ref><ref name=\"Busi\" />\n\n[[Stephen G.

Haw (2006), ''Marco Polo's China: a Venetian in the Realm of Kublai Khan'', London & New York: Routledge, p. 173, {{ISBN|0-415-34850-1}}.</ref> He points out that Polo never claimed to hold high rank, such as a ''[[darughachi]]'', who led a ''[[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]'' \u2013 a unit that was normally 10,000 strong. In fact, Polo does not even imply that he had led 1,000 personnel. Haw points out that Polo himself appears to state only that he had been an emissary of the khan, in a position with some esteem. According to Haw, this is a reasonable claim if Polo was, for example, a ''[[keshig]]'' \u2013 a member of the imperial guard by the same name, which included as many as 14,000 individuals at the time.<ref name=\"haw 2006 173\"/> \n\nHaw explains how the earliest [[manuscript]]s of Polo's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou, with some stating he was just a simple resident, others stating he was a governor, and [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio|Ramusio's manuscript]] claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else, yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan.<ref>Stephen G.

For example, Sinologist [[Francis Woodman Cleaves]] noted that Polo's account of the voyage of the princess [[K\u00f6k\u00f6chin]] from China to Persia to marry the \u012al-kh\u0101n in 1293 has been confirmed by a passage in the 15th-century Chinese work ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'' and by the Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in his work ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]''.  However neither of these accounts mentions Polo or indeed any European as part of the bridal party,<ref name=\"cleaves\">{{cite journal |jstor=2718743|author=Francis Woodman Cleaves|title=A Chinese Source Bearing on Marco Polo's Departure from China and a Persian Source on his Arrival in Persia|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies| volume=36|date= 1976|pages=181\u2013203|doi=10.2307/2718743}}</ref> and Wood used the lack of mention of Polo in these works as an example of Polo's \"retelling of a well-known tale\".  Morgan, in Polo's defence, noted that even the princess herself was not mentioned in the Chinese source, and that it would have been surprising if Polo had been mentioned by Rashid-al-Din.<ref name=\"Morgan, D page 224\" /> Historian [[Igor de Rachewiltz]] strongly criticised Wood's arguments in his review of her book.<ref name=\"Rachewiltz 1997 pp. 34\">Igor de Rachewiltz, \"Marco Polo Went to China,\" ''Zentralasiatische Studien'' 27 (1997), pp. 34\u201392</ref> Rachewiltz argued that Marco Polo's account in fact allows the Persian and Chinese sources to be reconciled \u2013 by relaying the information that two of the three envoys sent (mentioned in the Chinese source and whose names accord with those given by Polo) had died during the voyage, it explains why only the third who survived, Coja/Khoja, was mentioned by Rash\u00ecd al-D\u00ecn. Polo had therefore completed the story by providing information not found in either source. He also noted that the only Persian source that mentions the princess was not completed until 1310\u201311, therefore Marco Polo could not have learned the information from any Persian book.

For instance, did Polo exert \"political authority\" (''seignora'') in Yangzhou or merely \"sojourn\" (''sejourna'') there.
