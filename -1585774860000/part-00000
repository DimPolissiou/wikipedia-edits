Many witnesses intended to [[boycott]] the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly-produced report\u2014completed within 10 weeks (on 10 April) and published within 11 weeks (on 19 April)\u2014supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation regularly involved the use of lead-based [[solder]].{{refn|group=n|The contamination discovered upon victim William Nash was solely discovered upon his right hand, whereas Nash had been left-handed.

Found to have 'deliberately disobeyed' his superior Brigadier Patrick MacLellan's orders by sending Support Company into the Bogside (and without informing MacLellan).<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Major [[Ted Loden]]: Commander in charge of soldiers, following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Cleared of misconduct; Saville cited in the report that Loden \"neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" /> The inquiry found that Loden could not be held responsible for claims (whether malicious or not) by some of the individual soldiers that they had received fire from snipers.\n*Captain [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]]: Second in command of 1 Para on the day of Bloody Sunday. Cleared of sinister actions following Jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told Major Loden on why they had fired. This list became known as the \"Loden List of Engagements\" which played a role in the Army's initial explanations. While the inquiry found the compiling of the list was 'far from ideal', Jackson's explanations were accepted based on the list not containing the names of soldiers and the number of times they fired.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]]: Commander of land forces and set the British strategy to oversee the civil march in Derry. Cleared of any fault, but his selection of 1 Para, and in particular his selection of Colonel Wilford to be in control of arresting rioters, was found to be disconcerting, specifically as \"1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Brigadier Pat MacLellan: Operational commander of the day. Cleared of any wrongdoing as he was under the impression that Wilford would follow orders by arresting rioters and then returning to base, and could not be blamed for Wilford's actions.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Major Michael Steele: With MacLellan in the operations room and in charge of passing on the orders of the day.

Many witnesses intended to [[boycott]] the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly-produced report\u2014completed within 10 weeks (on 10 April) and published within 11 weeks (on 19 April)\u2014supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation regularly involved the use of lead-based [[solder]].{{refn|group=n|The contamination discovered upon victim William Nash was solely discovered upon his right hand, whereas Nash had been left-handed.

Cleared of sinister actions following Jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told Major Loden on why they had fired. This list became known as the \"Loden List of Engagements\" which played a role in the Army's initial explanations.

Cleared of any fault, but his selection of 1 Para, and in particular his selection of Colonel Wilford to be in control of arresting rioters, was found to be disconcerting, specifically as \"1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Brigadier Pat MacLellan: Operational commander of the day.
