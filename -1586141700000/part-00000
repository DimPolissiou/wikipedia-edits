The album was produced by [[John Goodmanson]] and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at [[Reciprocal Recording|John and Stu's Place]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. ''Dig Me Out'' marked the debut of [[Janet Weiss]], who is the band's longest-serving drummer. The music on the record was influenced by traditional [[rock and roll]] bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival. The album cover is an homage to [[The Kinks]]' 1965 album ''[[The Kink Kontroversy]]''.\n\nTwo singles were released in support of the album: \"One More Hour\" and \"Little Babies\". The title track \"Dig Me Out\" peaked at number six on the [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997 without being released as a single. The album was acclaimed by [[music journalism|music critics]], who praised the album's energy and [[feminism|feminist]] lyrics. Retrospectively, ''Dig Me Out'' is considered the band's breakthrough record and is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it No. 272 on its list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n''Dig Me Out'' is the follow-up to [[Sleater-Kinney]]'s highly acclaimed second album ''[[Call the Doctor]]'', released in 1996 by the [[queercore]] independent record label [[Chainsaw Records]]. ''Call the Doctor'' confirmed the band's reputation as one of the major musical acts from the [[Pacific Northwest]], rebelling against [[gender roles]], [[consumerism]], and [[indie rock]]'s male-dominated hierarchy.<ref name=\"Allmusic biography\"/><ref name=\"Salon heroes\"/> After the release of ''Call the Doctor'', drummer [[Janet Weiss]] of [[Quasi]] joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, [[Lora Macfarlane]], and Toni Gogin.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 3\"/> Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer [[John Goodmanson]].<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through [[Kill Rock Stars]], another independent record label which singer and guitarist [[Corin Tucker]] thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that ''Call the Doctor'' only took four days to record while ''Dig Me Out'' was recorded over the period of eight days.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 5\"/>\n\n''Dig Me Out'' was written in nearly two months and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at [[Reciprocal Recording|John and Stu's Place]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name=\"RS Hot-Rockin' Beats\"/><ref name=\"DMO Booklet\"/> During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist [[Carrie Brownstein]] involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: \"We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 3\"/> Goodmanson also noted that the fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> He explained: \"The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nMusically, ''Dig Me Out'' was considered rockier than its predecessor. Weiss' drumming style was influenced by traditional [[rock and roll]] bands such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Kinks]], as well as numerous [[blues rock]] musicians such as [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Billy Boy Arnold]], and [[Bessie Smith]], among others.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> Both Tucker and Brownstein remarked that Weiss became an essential part of the band's sound. According to Tucker, \"Musically, she's completed our band. She's become the bottom end and the solidness that we've really wanted for our songwriting\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> In addition to playing drums, Weiss provides [[Clapping|hand claps]] and [[tambourine]] in \"Turn It On\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> ''Dig Me Out'' also contains more guitar and vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein than ''Call the Doctor''.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 4\"/> As Brownstein explains, \"If you were to separate our guitar parts I don't necessarily think they would fully stand on their own. Our songs [...] aren't really complete until the other person has put their part over it, and their vocals\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 4\"/>\n\nThe lyrical themes on ''Dig Me Out'' deal with issues of heartbreak and survival.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 1\"/> The song \"One More Hour\" is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship.<ref name=\"Romantic relationship\"/> Before the release of the album, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' published a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission.<ref name=\"RS Hot-Rockin' Beats\"/> Brownstein felt that \"it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at ''Spin'', really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held ''Spin'' responsible for that.\"<ref name=\"RS Hot-Rockin' Beats\"/> The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'' noted that \"one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 3\"/> In her 2015 memoir ''[[Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl]]'', Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on ''Dig Me Out'' are about either her or Tucker's future husband, [[Lance Bangs]].<ref name=\"memoir\"/>\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Dig Me Out'' also features songs that show frustration with [[sexism]] and [[gender stereotypes]].<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> \"Little Babies\" is a protest against the traditional maternity role, while the title song \"Dig Me Out\" exposes a woman in a dominant role.<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> The album's title was inspired by the fact that the band had to literally dig out the recording studio after a heavy snowstorm that took place in Winter 1996 in Seattle.<ref name=\"The Register-Guard\"/> Musically, the song \"Words and Guitar\" was said to \"[leap] and [skit] with the just-released repression of early [[Talking Heads]]\",<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> while \"Dance Song '97\" was said to \"sport [[Devo]]-esque keyboards of a distinctly '80s vintage\".<ref name=\"RS review\"/> Jenn Pelly of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' described \"Heart Factory\" as a song that \"roars over synthetic emotions of the ''[[Prozac Nation]]''.\"<ref name=\"Start Together review\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Dig Me Out'' was released on April 8, 1997, by Kill Rock Stars.<ref name=\"S-K KRS\"/> The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album ''[[The Kink Kontroversy]]''.<ref name=\"Salon heroes\"/> The layouts are identical, with the exception that The Kinks had a fourth member and thus a fourth portrait lining the top. Sleater-Kinney substituted their own portraits and their own guitars.<ref name=\"Salon heroes\"/> As a fan of The Kinks, Weiss explained that the cover suggested that Sleater-Kinney could be an example of a \"revered\" rock band.<ref name=\"Salon heroes\"/> When ''Dig Me Out'' was released, the band went on a tour to promote the album; a performance of \"Words and Guitar\" at [[El Rey Theatre]], [[Los Angeles]] is featured in the documentary film ''Songs for Cassavetes'' by Justin Mitchell.<ref name=\"tour\"/> As of July 1999, the album had sold 64,000 copies in the U.S. according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].<ref name=\"1999 sales\"/> As of February 2015, ''Dig Me Out'' had sold 130,000 copies.<ref name=\"2015 sales\"/>\n\nTwo songs from the album, \"One More Hour\" and \"Little Babies\", were released as singles by [[Matador Records]] on June 1, 1998, and September 7, 1998, respectively.<ref name=\"Allmusic single 1\"/><ref name=\"Allmusic single 2\"/> The first single features the song \"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone\" from ''Call the Doctor'' as the B-side, while the second single features \"I'm Not Waiting\", also from their previous album.<ref name=\"Allmusic single 1\"/><ref name=\"Allmusic single 2\"/> The compact disc version of \"One More Hour\" includes a third song, \"Don't Think You Wanna\", which was originally released on the band's debut album ''[[Sleater-Kinney (album)|Sleater-Kinney]]''.<ref name=\"Allmusic single 1\"/> The song \"Dig Me Out\" peaked at number six on the [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997 without being released as a single.<ref name=\"KEXP Album Chart\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic review\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Larkin review\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3score = B+<ref name=\"EW review\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''\n| rev4score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref name=\"LAT review\"/>\n| rev5 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev5score = 8/10<ref name=\"NME review\"/>\n| rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6score = 9.3/10<ref name=\"Start Together review\"/>\n| rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev7score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RS review\"/>\n| rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RS 2004\"/>\n| rev9 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev9Score = 9/10<ref name=\"Spin review\"/>\n| rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev10score = A<ref name=\"Christgau review\"/>\n}}\n\nUpon release, ''Dig Me Out'' received substantial acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]]. Randall Roberts, writing for ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'', described the album as a \"hum of life wholly transcending gender and genre, filled with the kind of excitement and singular voice that made punk rock glorious in its infancy [...] ''Dig Me Out'' is a monster\".<ref name=\"CMJ review\"/> Sara Scribner of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised Tucker's emotional vocal delivery, writing that \"she's obsessed with finding honest emotions within the cold machinery of the human heart.\"<ref name=\"LAT review\"/> [[Ann Powers]] stated similar pros and highlighted Brownstein's energetic guitar playing, noting that the band \"now [delivers] the punch their words describe.\"<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> She also gave high marks to the album's [[feminism|feminist]] lyrics, commenting \"If [Sleater-Kinney] wanna be our [[Simone de Beauvoir]], ''Dig Me Out'' proves they're up to it.\"<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> Similarly, Matt Diehl of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that, \"while the [[Spice Girls]] prattle on about '[[girl power]]', Sleater-Kinney remain the real socket for that energy\".<ref name=\"RS review\"/>\n\n[[AllMusic]] reviewer Jason Ankeny credited the band for expanding their musical boundaries with a more confident and mature sound.<ref name=\"Allmusic review\"/> Wook Kim of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised Tucker and Brownstein's \"interlocking\" vocals and called the record a \"fine example of state-of-the-art punk\".<ref name=\"EW review\"/> In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', critic [[Robert Christgau]] praised the union and teamwork of the band, stating that \"they're so confident of their ability to please that they just can't stop. And this confidence is collective: Corin and Carrie chorus-trade like the two-headed girl, dashing and high-stepping around on Janet Weiss's shoulders. What a ride\".<ref name=\"Christgau review\"/> ''Dig Me Out'' appeared at No. 4 in ''The Village Voice''{{'}}s [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll for 1997.<ref name=\"Pazz & Jop\"/> In the poll's accompanying essay, Christgau referred to the album as one of his \"favorite albums of the year, easy\", alongside those by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Yo La Tengo]], and [[Arto Lindsay]].<ref name=\"No Next Big Thing\"/> Similarly, ''Spin'' journalists placed the album at No. 3 in their list of Top 20 Albums of the Year.<ref name=\"Spin Best of 1997\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nRetrospectively, ''Dig Me Out'' is considered Sleater-Kinney's breakthrough album.<ref name=\"Salon heroes\"/> According to [[About.com]]'s Anthony Carew, the record took the band \"from the cult corner of the Pacific Northwest to international acclaim\".<ref name=\"About review\"/> Writing for Nooga.com, Joshua Pickard stated that the album \"was a revelation for both its clever use of punk principles and for its breakdown of social assumptions.\"<ref name=\"Nooga article\"/> With the album, Pickard felt that Sleater-Kinney \"succeeded in reshaping what was considered possible for punk rock\", and that the album transformed the band into \"an institution of rebellion and proponents of a musical insurgency. And they never compromised on their ideas of what music could and should be.\"<ref name=\"Nooga article\"/>\n\n''Dig Me Out'' is frequently included on several publications' best album lists.

Rock Stars]]. The album was produced by [[John Goodmanson]] and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at [[Reciprocal Recording|John and Stu's Place]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. ''Dig Me Out'' marked the debut of [[Janet Weiss]], who is the band's longest-serving drummer. The music on the record was influenced by traditional [[rock and roll]] bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival. The album cover is an homage to [[The Kinks]]' 1965 album ''[[The Kink Kontroversy]]''.\n\nTwo singles were released in support of the album: \"One More Hour\" and \"Little Babies\". The title track \"Dig Me Out\" peaked at number six on the [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997 without being released as a single. The album was acclaimed by [[music journalism|music critics]], who praised the album's energy and [[feminism|feminist]] lyrics. Retrospectively, ''Dig Me Out'' is considered the band's breakthrough record and is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it No. 272 on its list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n''Dig Me Out'' is the follow-up to [[Sleater-Kinney]]'s highly acclaimed second album ''[[Call the Doctor]]'', released in 1996 by the [[queercore]] independent record label [[Chainsaw Records]]. ''Call the Doctor'' confirmed the band's reputation as one of the major musical acts from the [[Pacific Northwest]], rebelling against [[gender roles]], [[consumerism]], and [[indie rock]]'s male-dominated hierarchy.<ref name=\"Allmusic biography\"/><ref name=\"Salon heroes\"/> After the release of ''Call the Doctor'', drummer [[Janet Weiss]] of [[Quasi]] joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, [[Lora Macfarlane]], and Toni Gogin.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 3\"/> Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer [[John Goodmanson]].<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through [[Kill Rock Stars]], another independent record label which singer and guitarist [[Corin Tucker]] thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that ''Call the Doctor'' only took four days to record while ''Dig Me Out'' was recorded over the period of eight days.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 5\"/>\n\n''Dig Me Out'' was written in nearly two months and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at [[Reciprocal Recording|John and Stu's Place]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name=\"RS Hot-Rockin' Beats\"/><ref name=\"DMO Booklet\"/> During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist [[Carrie Brownstein]] involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: \"We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 3\"/> Goodmanson also noted that the fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> He explained: \"The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nMusically, ''Dig Me Out'' was considered rockier than its predecessor. Weiss' drumming style was influenced by traditional [[rock and roll]] bands such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Kinks]], as well as numerous [[blues rock]] musicians such as [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Billy Boy Arnold]], and [[Bessie Smith]], among others.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> Both Tucker and Brownstein remarked that Weiss became an essential part of the band's sound. According to Tucker, \"Musically, she's completed our band. She's become the bottom end and the solidness that we've really wanted for our songwriting\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> In addition to playing drums, Weiss provides [[Clapping|hand claps]] and [[tambourine]] in \"Turn It On\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 2\"/> ''Dig Me Out'' also contains more guitar and vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein than ''Call the Doctor''.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 4\"/> As Brownstein explains, \"If you were to separate our guitar parts I don't necessarily think they would fully stand on their own. Our songs [...] aren't really complete until the other person has put their part over it, and their vocals\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 4\"/>\n\nThe lyrical themes on ''Dig Me Out'' deal with issues of heartbreak and survival.<ref name=\"Addicted interview 1\"/> The song \"One More Hour\" is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship.<ref name=\"Romantic relationship\"/> Before the release of the album, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' published a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission.<ref name=\"RS Hot-Rockin' Beats\"/> Brownstein felt that \"it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at ''Spin'', really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held ''Spin'' responsible for that.\"<ref name=\"RS Hot-Rockin' Beats\"/> The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'' noted that \"one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation\".<ref name=\"Addicted interview 3\"/> In her 2015 memoir ''[[Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl]]'', Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on ''Dig Me Out'' are about either her or Tucker's future husband, [[Lance Bangs]].<ref name=\"memoir\"/>\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Dig Me Out'' also features songs that show frustration with [[sexism]] and [[gender stereotypes]].<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> \"Little Babies\" is a protest against the traditional maternity role, while the title song \"Dig Me Out\" exposes a woman in a dominant role.<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> The album's title was inspired by the fact that the band had to literally dig out the recording studio after a heavy snowstorm that took place in Winter 1996 in Seattle.<ref name=\"The Register-Guard\"/> Musically, the song \"Words and Guitar\" was said to \"[leap] and [skit] with the just-released repression of early [[Talking Heads]]\",<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> while \"Dance Song '97\" was said to \"sport [[Devo]]-esque keyboards of a distinctly '80s vintage\".<ref name=\"RS review\"/> Jenn Pelly of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' described \"Heart Factory\" as a song that \"roars over synthetic emotions of the ''[[Prozac Nation]]''.\"<ref name=\"Start Together review\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Dig Me Out'' was released on April 8, 1997, by Kill Rock Stars.<ref name=\"S-K KRS\"/> The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album ''[[The Kink Kontroversy]]''.<ref name=\"Salon heroes\"/> The layouts are identical, with the exception that The Kinks had a fourth member and thus a fourth portrait lining the top.

In the south-west of the country, it straddles the [[Dreisam]] river, at the foot of the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schlossberg]]. Historically, the city has acted as the hub of the [[Breisgau]] region on the western edge of the [[Black Forest]] in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]]. A famous old German university town, and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg|archiepiscopal]] seat, Freiburg was incorporated in the early twelfth century and developed into a major commercial, intellectual, and ecclesiastical center of the upper Rhine region. The city is known for its medieval [[Freiburg Minster|minster]] and Renaissance [[University of Freiburg|university]], as well as for its high standard of living and advanced environmental practices. The city is situated in the heart of the major [[Baden (wine region)|Baden wine-growing region]] and serves as the primary tourist entry point to the scenic beauty of the Black Forest. According to meteorological statistics, the city is the sunniest and warmest in Germany, and held the all-time German temperature record of {{convert|40.2|\u00b0C|1}} from 2003 to 2015.<ref>Website for the German Agricultural Society: Baden (accessed on January 1, 2008).{{cite web |url=http://www.wein.de/1462.0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030082816/http://www.wein.de/1462.0.html |archivedate=2007-10-30 }}</ref><ref>[[Temperature extremes]]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Freiburg}}\n{{Freiburg im Breisgau graphical timeline}}\nFreiburg was founded by Konrad and Duke Berthold III of [[Duchy of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] in 1120 as a free market town;<ref name=\"frhist\">\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1143537_l2/index.html\n |title       = Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau: History\n |publisher   = www.freiburg.de (Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau)\n |accessdate  = 2009-04-11\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227225808/http://freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1143537_l2/index.html\n |archivedate = 2009-02-27\n}}, also Arnold, Benjamin ''German Knighthood 1050\u20131300'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985) p. 123.</ref> hence its name, which translates to \"free (or independent) town\". ''Frei'' means \"free\", and ''Burg,'' like the modern English word \"[[borough]]\", was used in those days for an incorporated city or town, usually one with some degree of autonomy.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=borough|title=borough|work=American Heritage Dictionary|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|accessdate=13 September 2019}}</ref> The German word ''Burg'' also means \"a fortified town\", as in [[Hamburg]]. Thus, it is likely that the name of this place means a \"fortified town of free citizens\".\n\nThis town was strategically located at a junction of trade routes between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[North Sea]] regions, and the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. In 1200, Freiburg's population numbered approximately 6,000 people. At about that time, under the rule of [[Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen|Bertold V]], the last duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the city began construction of its [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]] cathedral on the site of an older parish church.<ref name=\"frhist\"/> Begun in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style, it was continued and completed 1513 for the most part as a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] edifice. In 1218, when Bertold V died, then Egino V von Urach, the count of [[County of Urach|Urach]] assumed the title of [[Counts of Freiburg|Freiburg's count]] as Egino I von Freiburg.<ref name=\"frhist\"/> The city council did not trust the new nobles and wrote down its established rights in a document. At the end of the thirteenth century there was a feud between the citizens of Freiburg and their lord, Count Egino II of Freiburg. Egino II raised taxes and sought to limit the citizens' freedom, after which the Freiburgers used catapults to destroy the count's castle atop the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schlo\u00dfberg]], a hill that overlooks the city center. The furious count called on his brother-in-law the Bishop of [[Bishopric of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Conrad de Lichtenberg|Konradius von Lichtenberg]], for help. The bishop responded by marching with his army to Freiburg.\n\n{{wide image|Freiburg_Schlossbergturm_Panorama_2010.jpg|1800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of Freiburg, seen from Schlossberg, [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]] can be seen in the center.}}\n{{Historical populations|1385|9000|1620|10000|1871|24668|1900|61504|1910|83324|1919|87946|1925|90475|1933|99122|1939|110110|1950|109717|1961|145016|1970|162222|1987|178672|2011|209628|2017|229636|align=right|footnote=source:<ref>[[:de:Einwohnerentwicklung von Freiburg im Breisgau|Link]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}}}\n[[File:Neues Rathaus (Freiburg) 4029.jpg|left|thumb|Freiburg City Hall ''([[Rathaus]])'']]\nAccording to an old Freiburg legend, a butcher named Hauri stabbed the Bishop of Strasbourg to death on 29 July 1299. It was a [[Pyrrhic victory]], since henceforth the citizens of Freiburg had to pay an annual expiation of 300 marks in silver to the count of Freiburg until 1368. In 1366 the counts of Freiburg made another failed attempt to occupy the city during a night raid. Eventually the citizens were fed up with their lords, and in 1368 Freiburg purchased its independence from them. The city turned itself over to the protection of the [[Habsburgs]], who allowed the city to retain a large measure of freedom. Most of the nobles of the city died in the [[battle of Sempach]] (1386). The [[patricianship|patrician]] family Schnewlin took control of the city until the guildsmen revolted. The guilds became more powerful than the patricians by 1389.\n\nThe silver mines in Mount Schauinsland provided an important source of capital for Freiburg. This silver made Freiburg one of the richest cities in Europe, and in 1327 Freiburg minted its own coin, the ''Rappenpfennig''. In 1377 the cities of Freiburg, [[Basel]], [[Colmar]], and [[Breisach]] entered into a monetary alliance known as the ''Genossenschaft des Rappenpfennigs'' (Rappenpfennig Collective). This alliance facilitated commerce among the cities and lasted until the end of the sixteenth century. There were 8,000\u20139,000 people living in Freiburg between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and 30 churches and monasteries. At the end of the fourteenth century the veins of silver were dwindling, and by 1460 only approximately 6,000 people still lived within Freiburg's [[Defensive wall|city walls]].\n\nA university city, Freiburg evolved from its focus on mining to become a cultural centre for the arts and sciences. It was also a commercial center. The end of the [[Middle Ages]] and the dawn of the [[Renaissance]] was a time of both advances and tragedy for Freiburg.\n\nIn 1457, [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albrecht VI]], Regent of [[Further Austria]], established [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t]], one of Germany's oldest universities. In 1498, Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] held a [[Reichstag (disambiguation)|Reichstag]] in Freiburg. In 1520, the city ratified a set of legal reforms, widely considered the most progressive of the time. The aim was to find a balance between city traditions and old [[Roman Law]]. The reforms were well received, especially the sections dealing with civil process law, punishment, and the city's constitution.\n\n[[File:Freiburg from above.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]] medieval cathedral]]\nIn 1520, Freiburg decided not to take part in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and became an important centre for [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] on the [[Upper Rhine]]. [[Erasmus]] moved here after [[Basel]] accepted the Reformation.\n\nIn 1536, a strong and persistent belief in [[witchcraft]] led to the city's first [[witch-hunt]]. The need to find a scapegoat for calamities such as the [[Black Plague]], which claimed 2,000 area residents (25% of the city population) in 1564, led to an escalation in witch-hunting that reached its peak in 1599. A plaque on the old city wall marks the spot where burnings were carried out.\n\nThe seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries were turbulent times for Freiburg. At the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]] there were 10,000\u201314,000 citizens in Freiburg; by its end only 2,000 remained. During this war and other conflicts, the city belonged at various times to the [[Austrians]], the [[France|French]], the [[Sweden|Swedes]], the [[Spain|Spaniards]], and various members of the [[German Confederation]]. Between 1648 and 1805, when the city was not under French occupation it was the administrative headquarters of [[Further Austria]], the Habsburg territories in the southwest of Germany. In 1805, the city, together with the [[Breisgau]] and [[Ortenau]] areas, became part of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]].\n\nIn 1827, when the [[Archdiocese of Freiburg]] was founded, Freiburg became the seat of a [[Catholic]] archbishop.\n\n[[File:Martinstor (Freiburg im Breisgau) jm10177.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Martinstor]], one of the original city [[City gate|gates]] in Freiburg]] \nOn 22 October 1940, the [[Nazi]] [[Gauleiter]] of Baden, [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]], ordered the deportation of all of Baden's and 350 of Freiburg's [[Jewish]] population. They were deported to [[Camp Gurs]] in the south of France, where many died. On 18 July 1942, the remaining Baden and Freiburg Jews were transferred to [[Auschwitz]] in Nazi-occupied Poland, where almost all were murdered.<ref>Spector, Shmuel and Wigoder, Geoffrey, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish life Before and During the Holocaust'', [[New York University Press]] 2001. See [http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/freiburg_synagoge_a.htm Die Synagoge in Freiburg im Breisgau].</ref> A living memorial has been created in the form of the 'footprint' in marble on the site of the city's original [[synagogue]], which was burned down by the Nazi Germans on 9 November 1938, during the [[pogrom]] known as ''[[Kristallnacht]]''. The memorial is a children's paddling pool and contains a bronze plaque commemorating the original building and the Jewish community which perished. The pavements of Freiburg carry memorials to individual victims, in the form of [[Stolperstein|brass plates]] outside their former residences.\n\nFreiburg was heavily bombed during [[World War II]]. In [[Bombing of Freiburg on 10 May 1940|May 1940]], aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] mistakenly dropped approximately 60 bombs on Freiburg near the railway station, killing 57 people.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Robinson\n | first = Derek\n | authorlink =Derek Robinson (novelist)\n | coauthors =\n | title = Invasion 1940\n | publisher = Constable & Robinson\n | year = 2005\n | location = London\n | pages = 31\u201332\n | url =\n | doi =\n | isbn = 1-84529-151-4 }}</ref> On 27 November 1944, a raid by more than 300 [[bomber]]s of [[RAF Bomber Command]] ([[Operation Tigerfish]]) destroyed a large portion of the city centre, with the notable exception of the ''M\u00fcnster'', which was only lightly damaged. After the war, the city was rebuilt on its medieval plan.\n\nIt was occupied by the [[French Army]] on 21 April 1945, and Freiburg was soon allotted to the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|French Zone of Occupation]]. In December 1945 Freiburg became the seat of government for the German state [[South Baden|Badenia]], which was merged into [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952. The [[French Army]] maintained a presence in Freiburg until 1991, when the last French Army division left the city, and left Germany.\n\nOn the site of the former French Army base, a new neighborhood for 5,000 people, [[Vauban (Freiburg)|Vauban]], was begun in the late 1990s as a \"sustainable model district\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Solar power provides electricity to many of the households in this small community.\n\n==Points of interest==\nBecause of its scenic beauty, relatively warm and sunny climate, and easy access to the Black Forest, Freiburg is a hub for regional [[tourism]]. In 2010, Freiburg was voted as the Academy of Urbanism's European City of the Year in recognition of the exemplary [[sustainable urbanism]] it has implemented over the past several decades.\n\nThe longest [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] run in Germany, which is {{convert|3.6|km|mi}} long, runs from G\u00fcnterstal up to a nearby mountain called ''[[Schauinsland]]''.\n\nThe city has an unusual system of gutters (called ''[[Freiburg B\u00e4chle]]'') that run throughout its centre. These ''B\u00e4chle'', once used to provide water to fight fires and feed livestock, are constantly flowing with water diverted from the [[Dreisam]]. They were never intended to be used for sewage, and even in the Middle Ages such use could lead to harsh penalties. During the summer, the running water provides natural cooling of the air, and offers a pleasant gurgling sound. It is said that if one accidentally falls or steps into a ''B\u00e4chle'', they will marry a Freiburger, or 'Bobbele'. \n\nThe B\u00e4chle are now seen as a place to play and to cool off. It is a common summer sight to see people sitting on the ground with feet in the B\u00e4chle, embracing the cool flow of water while enjoying cool treats and talking with friends and family. Freiburg's youngest residents and visitors also enjoy these unique streams. During the summer, children of all ages enjoy floating small boats, called \"Freiburger B\u00e4chleboote,\" in the B\u00e4chle. These small wooden boats are attached to a string, allowing users to pull the boats all around the city through the B\u00e4chle. \n\n[[File:Friburgo Ruscelli nel Centro -- Freiburg with the city center streams.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Freiburg B\u00e4chle|B\u00e4chle]]]]\nThe ''Augustinerplatz'' is one of the central squares in the old city. Formerly the location of an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Augustinian Monastery, Freiburg|monastery]] that became the [[Augustiner Museum]] in 1921, it is now a popular social space for Freiburg's younger residents. It has a number of restaurants and bars, including the local brewery 'Feierling', which has a [[Biergarten]]. On warm summer nights, hundreds of students gather here.\n\nAt the centre of the [[Old City of Freiburg|old city]] is the [[Minster Square (Freiburg im Breisgau)|M\u00fcnsterplatz]] or Cathedral Square, Freiburg's [[List of city squares by size|largest square]]. A farmers market is held here every day except Sundays. This is the site of Freiburg's [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Minster (cathedral)|minster]] [[cathedral]] constructed of red sandstone, built between 1200 and 1530 and noted for its towering spire.\n\n[[File:Historisches Kaufhaus Freiburg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Historical Merchants' Hall of 1520\u201321]]\nThe [[Historical Merchants' Hall (Freiburg)|Historical Merchants' Hall]] (''Historisches Kaufhaus''), is a [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] building on the south side of Freiburg's ''M\u00fcnsterplatz''. Built between 1520 and 1530, it was once the center of the financial life of the region. Its fa\u00e7ade is decorated with statues and the [[coat of arms]] of four [[Habsburg]] emperors.\n\nThe ''Altes Rathaus'', or old city hall, was completed in 1559 and has a painted fa\u00e7ade. The ''Platz der alten Synagoge'' \"Old Synagogue Square\" is one of the more important squares on the outskirts of the historic old city. The square was the location of a synagogue until it was destroyed on {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}} in 1938. [[Zum Roten B\u00e4ren]], the oldest hotel in Germany, is located along ''Oberlinden'' near the [[Swabia]]n Gate.\n\nThe ''[[Siegesdenkmal]]'', or victory monument, is a monument to the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. It is situated at the northern edge of the historic city center of Freiburg, and was built by Karl Friedrich Moest. In everyday language of people living in Freiburg, it serves as an orientation marker or as a meeting place.\n\nTo the east of the city centre, the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schlossberg]] hill provides extensive views over the city and surrounding region. The castle (Schloss) from which the hill takes its name was demolished in the 1740s, and only ruins remain. Schlossberg retained its importance to the city, however, and 150 years ago the city leaders opened up walks and views to make the mountain available to the public. Today, the [[Schlossbergbahn (Freiburg)|Schlossbergbahn]] [[funicular|funicular railway]] connects the city centre to the hill.<ref name=sbb>{{cite web | url = http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1204575/index.html | publisher = Stadt Freiburg | title = Erlebniswelt Schlossberg | trans-title = Experience Schlossberg | language = German | accessdate = 2011-02-13 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110405115733/http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1204575/index.html | archivedate = 2011-04-05 }}</ref>\n\nOther museums in the city include the [[Archaeology Colombischl\u00f6ssle Museum]].\n\n=== List of major sights ===\n* [[Arboretum Freiburg-G\u00fcnterstal]], an arboretum in the suburb of G\u00fcnterstal\n* [[Freiburg Botanic Garden]]\n* [[University of Freiburg]]\n* [[University Library Freiburg]], the newly renovated library features a modern design \n* [[The Whale House]], which, in [[Dario Argento]]'s 1977 horror film ''[[Suspiria]]'', served as the Dance Academy, the film's central location\n* [[Augustiner Museum]]\n* [[Freiburg Munster]]\n* [[Schauinsland]]\n* [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)]]\n* [[Colombischl\u00f6ssle Archeological Museum]]\n* [[Green Spaces in Freiburg]]\n* [[Vauban, Freiburg]], a sustainable eco-community\n* [[Cobblestone mosaics (Freiburg im Breisgau)]]\n\n==Geography==\nFreiburg is bordered by the Black Forest mountains [[Ro\u00dfkopf (Breisgau)|Rosskopf]] and Bromberg to the east, Sch\u00f6nberg and Tuniberg to the south, with the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg)|Kaiserstuhl]] hill region to the west.\n\n===Climate===\n[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] classifies its climate as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (Cfb). However, it is close to being [[humid subtropical]] (Cfa) due to the mean temperatures in July and August just under 22 \u00b0C.  Marine features are limited however, as a result of its vast distance from oceans and seas. As a result, summers have a significant [[humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] influence as the inland air heats up. Thus July and August are, along with [[Karlsruhe]], the warmest within Germany. Winters are moderate but usually with frequent frosts. However, more year-round rain occurs than in the Rhine plateau because of the closeness to the Black Forest. The city is close to the Kaiserstuhl, a range of hills of volcanic origin located a few miles away which is one of the warmest places in Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area.\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Freiburg 2015\u20132020, sunshine 2015\u20132020, extremes 1949\u2013present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C= 18.8\n|Feb

Home to some of the greatest minds of the [[western culture|West]], including such eminent figures as [[Johann Eck]], [[Max Weber]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], it is one of Europe's top research and teaching institutions.\n\nFreiburg also plays host to various other educational and research institutes, such as the Freiburg University of Education, the [[Protestant University for Applied Sciences Freiburg]], [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Freiburg|Freiburg Music Academy]], the [[Catholic University of Applied Sciences Freiburg]], the International University of Cooperative Education IUCE, three [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck institutes]], and five [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer institutes]].\n\nThe city is home to the [[Institute for the International Education of Students|IES Abroad]] European Union program, which allows students to study the development and activities of the [[European Union|EU]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iesabroad.org/IES/Programs/EuropeanUnion/EuropeanUnion/europeanUnion.html|title=European Union|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lawyer Freiburg |url=http://www.pohl-sitzler.de/ |accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[DFG / LFA Freiburg]], a French-German high school established by the 1963 [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty]], is in the city.\n\n==Religion==\n\n'''Christianity'''\n\nFreiburg belonged to Austria until 1805 and because of this stayed Catholic, even though surrounding villages like [[Haslach (Freiburg)|Haslach]], Opfingen, Tiengen, and the surrounding land ruled by the [[Margrave of Baden]] turned Protestant as a result of the Reformation. The city was part of the [[Diocese of Konstanz]] until 1821. That same year, Freiburg became an [[episcopal see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg]]. Due to a dispute between the government of Baden and the [[Holy See]], the [[Archbishop of Freiburg|archbishop]] officially took office in 1827.\n[[File:Freiburger-muenster.png|thumb|250px|right|The Freiburger Minster: one of Freiburg's most famous landmarks]]\n\nThe borders of the archdiocese correspond with the borders of the former [[State of Baden|province of Baden]] and the former Margraviate of Hohenzollern. The cathedral, in which the Bishop resides, is [[Freiburg Minster]]. Also part of the [[ecclesiastical province]] of Freiburg are the [[suffragan diocese]]s of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Mainz]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]. Until 1929 the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Limburg]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda|Fulda]] also belonged to this ecclesiastical province. The Archbishop of Freiburg holds the title of metropolitan and the German headquarters of the [[Caritas Internationalis|Caritas International]] is in Freiburg.\n\n[[Saint George]] (the flag of Freiburg has the cross of George), [[Lambert of Maastricht]] and the catacomb saint, [[Alexander of Bergamo|Alexander]], are the patron saints of Freiburg. Many works of art depicting these saints are in the Freiburg Minster, on the Minster square, just as in the museums and archives of the city, including some by [[Hans Baldung Grien]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] and [[Gregorius Sickinger]].\n\nIn 1805, with the attack of Breisgau on the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] by a Catholic ruler, many Protestants moved into the city. Since 2007, any Protestants who are not part of a \u2018free church\u2019 belong to the newly founded deanery of Freiburg as part of the parish of S\u00fcdbaden which in itself is a part of the Landeskirche Baden.\n\nThe seat of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Baden]], a free Lutheran church, is situated in Freiburg. There are multiple other free Protestant churches: e.g. the Calvary Chapel or Chrischona International. An old congregation has existed in Freiburg since the late 1900s, which utilizes the old monastery church of the Ursulines in the black monastery at the border of the old city center. The Catholic Church of St. Maria Schutz has been made available for Masses by Greek, Serbian, Russian and Rumanian Orthodox congregations.\n\n'''Judaism'''\n\n[[Jews]] are said to have lived in the city before 1230, but it was only after 1230 that they supposedly founded an official community in the Webergasse (a small street within the city center). The counts of Freiburg bought the lucrative [[Schutzjude]], which means that all personal information on Jews living in Freiburg was directly sent to [[Konrad II]] and his co-reigning son Friedrich. The two issued a comprising letter promising safety and liberty to all local Jews on 12 October 1338. It lost all value shortly after, however, on 1 January 1349. Even though the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] had not yet broken out in the city, Jews were accused of having spread it and taken into custody. All Jewish people with the exception of pregnant women were burned alive on 31 January 1349. The remaining children were forced to be baptized. This pogrom left Jews very hesitant to settle in the city again. In 1401 the city council decreed a regulation to ban all Jews from Freiburg (orig. Middle High German dialect: \u201cdaz dekein Jude ze Friburg niemmerme sin sol\u201d[27]. This was also officially reaffirmed by King Sigismund with a ban for life (orig. German: \u201cEwige Vertreibung\u201d) in 1424. It was only in 1809 that Jews were once again allowed permanent residence within the city. They subsequently founded a Jewish community in 1836.\n\nAt the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the synagogue, built in 1870, was set afire. Numerous shops and apartments of Jewish citizens of Freiburg were devastated and plundered by National Socialists without the intervention of police or fire department. Male, wealthy, Jewish citizens were kidnapped and taken to [[concentration camps]] (in [[Buchenwald]] and [[Dachau]]) where they were subjected to forced labor or executed and their money and property stolen. On October 22, 1940 the remaining Jews of Baden and Pfalz were deported to [[Gurs internment camp|Camp de Gurs]] in southern France. One among many collecting points was Annaplatz. So-called '[[Stolpersteine]]', tiles with names and dates on them, commemorate the victims of the prosecution of Jews during the Nazi-Era in the city's cobble. Journalist K\u00e4the Vordtriede of the [[Volkswacht (Freiburg)|Volkswacht]] even received two Stolpersteine to commemorate her life. The first one was inserted into the ground in front of the Vordtriede-Haus Freiburg in 2006 and the second one in front of the Basler Hof, the regional authorities, in spring 2013. This was also the seat of the [[Gestapo]] until 1941, where unrelenting people were cruelly interrogated, held prisoner or at worst{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} deported. The only solutions were flight or emigration. The [[Werner Vordtriede|Vordtriede family]], however, was lucky and escaped in time.\n\n==Transport==\n\n[[File:Combino Freiburg.jpg|thumb|230px|Freiburg VAG tram|left]]\nFreiburg has an extensive [[Auto-free zone|pedestrian zone]] in the city centre where no motor cars are allowed. Freiburg also has an excellent public transport system, operated by the city-owned [[Freiburger Verkehrs AG|VAG Freiburg]]. The backbone of the system is the [[Trams in Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg tramway network]], supplemented by feeder [[bus]]es. The tram network is so popular as the low fares allow for unlimited transport in the city and surrounding area. Furthermore, any ticket for a concert sports or other event is also valid for use on public transport. The tram network is so vast that 70% of the population live within 500m of a tram stop with a tram every 8 mins.\n\nFreiburg is on the main [[Mannheim\u2013Karlsruhe\u2013Basle railway|Frankfurt am Main \u2013 Basel railway line]], with frequent and fast long-distance passenger services from the [[Freiburg Hauptbahnhof]] to major German and other European cities. Other railway lines run east into the [[Black Forest]] and west to [[Breisach]] and are served by the [[Breisgau S-Bahn]]. The line to Breisach is the remaining stub of the [[Freiburg\u2013Colmar railway|Freiburg\u2013Colmar international railway]], severed in 1945 when the railway bridge over the [[Rhine]] at Breisach was destroyed, and was never replaced.\n\nThe city also is served by the [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] [[Frankfurt am Main]] \u2013 [[Basel]] motorway.\n\nFreiburg is served by [[EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg]] in France, close to the borders of both Germany and Switzerland, {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} south of Freiburg. Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airport ([[Baden Airpark]]) is approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} north of Freiburg and is also served by several airlines. The nearest larger international airports include Stuttgart ({{convert|200|km|abbr=on}}), Frankfurt/Main ({{convert|260|km|abbr=on}}), and Munich ({{convert|430|km|abbr=on}}). The nearby [[Flugplatz Freiburg]], a small airfield in the [[Messe Freiburg|Messe, Freiburg]] district, lacks commercial service but is used for private aviation.\n\nCar share websites such as Mitfahrgelegenheit are commonly used among Freiburg residents, since they are considered relatively safe.\n\nThe investment in transport has resulted in a large increase in both cycle, pedestrian and public transport usage with projections of car journeys accounting for 29% of journey times.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Badenova-Stadion 2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schwarzwald-Stadion]] is the home ground of [[Bundesliga]] club [[SC Freiburg]]]]\n\nFreiburg is home to football teams [[SC Freiburg]], which plays at the [[Schwarzwald-Stadion]] and is represented in the 1. or [[2. Bundesliga]] since 1978, and [[Freiburger FC]], German championship winner of 1907. In 2016, SC Freiburg got promoted to the highest league for the fifth time in its club history. The club became generally known in Germany for its steady staffing policy. [[Achim Stocker]] was president of the club from 1972 until his death in 2009. Longtime coach was [[Volker Finke]] (1991-2007), to whose initiative the football school of the club goes back. In 2004, SC Freiburg celebrated its 100th anniversary. Since December 2011, the coach is [[Christian Streich]]. The women's team of SC Freiburg plays in the first Women's Bundesliga.\n\nFreiburg also has the [[EHC Freiburg]] [[ice hockey]] team, which plays at the Franz-Siegel Halle. In the season 2003/2004 the EHC Freiburg (the wolves) played in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]], the highest German ice hockey league. Currently, season 2018/19, they play in the second league ([[DEL2]]).\n\nAdditionally, there is the RC Freiburg Rugby union team, which competes in the [[2.

In the south-west of the country, it straddles the [[Dreisam]] river, at the foot of the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schlossberg]]. Historically, the city has acted as the hub of the [[Breisgau]] region on the western edge of the [[Black Forest]] in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]]. A famous old German university town, and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg|archiepiscopal]] seat, Freiburg was incorporated in the early twelfth century and developed into a major commercial, intellectual, and ecclesiastical center of the upper Rhine region. The city is known for its medieval [[Freiburg Minster|minster]] and Renaissance [[University of Freiburg|university]], as well as for its high standard of living and advanced environmental practices. The city is situated in the heart of the major [[Baden (wine region)|Baden wine-growing region]] and serves as the primary tourist entry point to the scenic beauty of the Black Forest. According to meteorological statistics, the city is the sunniest and warmest in Germany, and held the all-time German temperature record of {{convert|40.2|\u00b0C|1}} from 2003 to 2015.<ref>Website for the German Agricultural Society: Baden (accessed on January 1, 2008).{{cite web |url=http://www.wein.de/1462.0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030082816/http://www.wein.de/1462.0.html |archivedate=2007-10-30 }}</ref><ref>[[Temperature extremes]]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Freiburg}}\n{{Freiburg im Breisgau graphical timeline}}\nFreiburg was founded by Konrad and Duke Berthold III of [[Duchy of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] in 1120 as a free market town;<ref name=\"frhist\">\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1143537_l2/index.html\n |title       = Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau: History\n |publisher   = www.freiburg.de (Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau)\n |accessdate  = 2009-04-11\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227225808/http://freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1143537_l2/index.html\n |archivedate = 2009-02-27\n}}, also Arnold, Benjamin ''German Knighthood 1050\u20131300'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985) p. 123.</ref> hence its name, which translates to \"free (or independent) town\". ''Frei'' means \"free\", and ''Burg,'' like the modern English word \"[[borough]]\", was used in those days for an incorporated city or town, usually one with some degree of autonomy.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=borough|title=borough|work=American Heritage Dictionary|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|accessdate=13 September 2019}}</ref> The German word ''Burg'' also means \"a fortified town\", as in [[Hamburg]]. Thus, it is likely that the name of this place means a \"fortified town of free citizens\".\n\nThis town was strategically located at a junction of trade routes between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[North Sea]] regions, and the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. In 1200, Freiburg's population numbered approximately 6,000 people. At about that time, under the rule of [[Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen|Bertold V]], the last duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the city began construction of its [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]] cathedral on the site of an older parish church.<ref name=\"frhist\"/> Begun in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style, it was continued and completed 1513 for the most part as a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] edifice. In 1218, when Bertold V died, then Egino V von Urach, the count of [[County of Urach|Urach]] assumed the title of [[Counts of Freiburg|Freiburg's count]] as Egino I von Freiburg.<ref name=\"frhist\"/> The city council did not trust the new nobles and wrote down its established rights in a document. At the end of the thirteenth century there was a feud between the citizens of Freiburg and their lord, Count Egino II of Freiburg. Egino II raised taxes and sought to limit the citizens' freedom, after which the Freiburgers used catapults to destroy the count's castle atop the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schlo\u00dfberg]], a hill that overlooks the city center. The furious count called on his brother-in-law the Bishop of [[Bishopric of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Conrad de Lichtenberg|Konradius von Lichtenberg]], for help. The bishop responded by marching with his army to Freiburg.\n\n{{wide image|Freiburg_Schlossbergturm_Panorama_2010.jpg|1800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of Freiburg, seen from Schlossberg, [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]] can be seen in the center.}}\n{{Historical populations|1385|9000|1620|10000|1871|24668|1900|61504|1910|83324|1919|87946|1925|90475|1933|99122|1939|110110|1950|109717|1961|145016|1970|162222|1987|178672|2011|209628|2017|229636|align=right|footnote=source:<ref>[[:de:Einwohnerentwicklung von Freiburg im Breisgau|Link]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}}}\n[[File:Neues Rathaus (Freiburg) 4029.jpg|left|thumb|Freiburg City Hall ''([[Rathaus]])'']]\nAccording to an old Freiburg legend, a butcher named Hauri stabbed the Bishop of Strasbourg to death on 29 July 1299. It was a [[Pyrrhic victory]], since henceforth the citizens of Freiburg had to pay an annual expiation of 300 marks in silver to the count of Freiburg until 1368. In 1366 the counts of Freiburg made another failed attempt to occupy the city during a night raid. Eventually the citizens were fed up with their lords, and in 1368 Freiburg purchased its independence from them. The city turned itself over to the protection of the [[Habsburgs]], who allowed the city to retain a large measure of freedom. Most of the nobles of the city died in the [[battle of Sempach]] (1386). The [[patricianship|patrician]] family Schnewlin took control of the city until the guildsmen revolted. The guilds became more powerful than the patricians by 1389.\n\nThe silver mines in Mount Schauinsland provided an important source of capital for Freiburg. This silver made Freiburg one of the richest cities in Europe, and in 1327 Freiburg minted its own coin, the ''Rappenpfennig''. In 1377 the cities of Freiburg, [[Basel]], [[Colmar]], and [[Breisach]] entered into a monetary alliance known as the ''Genossenschaft des Rappenpfennigs'' (Rappenpfennig Collective). This alliance facilitated commerce among the cities and lasted until the end of the sixteenth century. There were 8,000\u20139,000 people living in Freiburg between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and 30 churches and monasteries. At the end of the fourteenth century the veins of silver were dwindling, and by 1460 only approximately 6,000 people still lived within Freiburg's [[Defensive wall|city walls]].\n\nA university city, Freiburg evolved from its focus on mining to become a cultural centre for the arts and sciences. It was also a commercial center. The end of the [[Middle Ages]] and the dawn of the [[Renaissance]] was a time of both advances and tragedy for Freiburg.\n\nIn 1457, [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albrecht VI]], Regent of [[Further Austria]], established [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t]], one of Germany's oldest universities. In 1498, Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] held a [[Reichstag (disambiguation)|Reichstag]] in Freiburg. In 1520, the city ratified a set of legal reforms, widely considered the most progressive of the time. The aim was to find a balance between city traditions and old [[Roman Law]]. The reforms were well received, especially the sections dealing with civil process law, punishment, and the city's constitution.\n\n[[File:Freiburg from above.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]] medieval cathedral]]\nIn 1520, Freiburg decided not to take part in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and became an important centre for [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] on the [[Upper Rhine]]. [[Erasmus]] moved here after [[Basel]] accepted the Reformation.\n\nIn 1536, a strong and persistent belief in [[witchcraft]] led to the city's first [[witch-hunt]]. The need to find a scapegoat for calamities such as the [[Black Plague]], which claimed 2,000 area residents (25% of the city population) in 1564, led to an escalation in witch-hunting that reached its peak in 1599. A plaque on the old city wall marks the spot where burnings were carried out.\n\nThe seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries were turbulent times for Freiburg. At the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]] there were 10,000\u201314,000 citizens in Freiburg; by its end only 2,000 remained. During this war and other conflicts, the city belonged at various times to the [[Austrians]], the [[France|French]], the [[Sweden|Swedes]], the [[Spain|Spaniards]], and various members of the [[German Confederation]]. Between 1648 and 1805, when the city was not under French occupation it was the administrative headquarters of [[Further Austria]], the Habsburg territories in the southwest of Germany. In 1805, the city, together with the [[Breisgau]] and [[Ortenau]] areas, became part of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]].\n\nIn 1827, when the [[Archdiocese of Freiburg]] was founded, Freiburg became the seat of a [[Catholic]] archbishop.\n\n[[File:Martinstor (Freiburg im Breisgau) jm10177.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Martinstor]], one of the original city [[City gate|gates]] in Freiburg]] \nOn 22 October 1940, the [[Nazi]] [[Gauleiter]] of Baden, [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]], ordered the deportation of all of Baden's and 350 of Freiburg's [[Jewish]] population. They were deported to [[Camp Gurs]] in the south of France, where many died. On 18 July 1942, the remaining Baden and Freiburg Jews were transferred to [[Auschwitz]] in Nazi-occupied Poland, where almost all were murdered.<ref>Spector, Shmuel and Wigoder, Geoffrey, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish life Before and During the Holocaust'', [[New York University Press]] 2001.

The memorial is a children's paddling pool and contains a bronze plaque commemorating the original building and the Jewish community which perished. The pavements of Freiburg carry memorials to individual victims, in the form of [[Stolperstein|brass plates]] outside their former residences.\n\nFreiburg was heavily bombed during [[World War II]]. In [[Bombing of Freiburg on 10 May 1940|May 1940]], aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] mistakenly dropped approximately 60 bombs on Freiburg near the railway station, killing 57 people.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Robinson\n | first = Derek\n | authorlink =Derek Robinson (novelist)\n | coauthors =\n | title = Invasion 1940\n | publisher = Constable & Robinson\n | year = 2005\n | location = London\n | pages = 31\u201332\n | url =\n | doi =\n | isbn = 1-84529-151-4 }}</ref> On 27 November 1944, a raid by more than 300 [[bomber]]s of [[RAF Bomber Command]] ([[Operation Tigerfish]]) destroyed a large portion of the city centre, with the notable exception of the ''M\u00fcnster'', which was only lightly damaged. After the war, the city was rebuilt on its medieval plan.\n\nIt was occupied by the [[French Army]] on 21 April 1945, and Freiburg was soon allotted to the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|French Zone of Occupation]]. In December 1945 Freiburg became the seat of government for the German state [[South Baden|Badenia]], which was merged into [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952. The [[French Army]] maintained a presence in Freiburg until 1991, when the last French Army division left the city, and left Germany.\n\nOn the site of the former French Army base, a new neighborhood for 5,000 people, [[Vauban (Freiburg)|Vauban]], was begun in the late 1990s as a \"sustainable model district\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Solar power provides electricity to many of the households in this small community.\n\n==Points of interest==\nBecause of its scenic beauty, relatively warm and sunny climate, and easy access to the Black Forest, Freiburg is a hub for regional [[tourism]]. In 2010, Freiburg was voted as the Academy of Urbanism's European City of the Year in recognition of the exemplary [[sustainable urbanism]] it has implemented over the past several decades.\n\nThe longest [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] run in Germany, which is {{convert|3.6|km|mi}} long, runs from G\u00fcnterstal up to a nearby mountain called ''[[Schauinsland]]''.\n\nThe city has an unusual system of gutters (called ''[[Freiburg B\u00e4chle]]'') that run throughout its centre. These ''B\u00e4chle'', once used to provide water to fight fires and feed livestock, are constantly flowing with water diverted from the [[Dreisam]]. They were never intended to be used for sewage, and even in the Middle Ages such use could lead to harsh penalties. During the summer, the running water provides natural cooling of the air, and offers a pleasant gurgling sound. It is said that if one accidentally falls or steps into a ''B\u00e4chle'', they will marry a Freiburger, or 'Bobbele'.\n\n[[File:Friburgo Ruscelli nel Centro -- Freiburg with the city center streams.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Freiburg B\u00e4chle|B\u00e4chle]]]]\nThe ''Augustinerplatz'' is one of the central squares in the old city. Formerly the location of an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Augustinian Monastery, Freiburg|monastery]] that became the [[Augustiner Museum]] in 1921, it is now a popular social space for Freiburg's younger residents. It has a number of restaurants and bars, including the local brewery 'Feierling', which has a [[Biergarten]]. On warm summer nights, hundreds of students gather here.\n\nAt the centre of the [[Old City of Freiburg|old city]] is the [[Minster Square (Freiburg im Breisgau)|M\u00fcnsterplatz]] or Cathedral Square, Freiburg's [[List of city squares by size|largest square]]. A farmers market is held here every day except Sundays. This is the site of Freiburg's [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Minster (cathedral)|minster]] [[cathedral]] constructed of red sandstone, built between 1200 and 1530 and noted for its towering spire.\n\n[[File:Historisches Kaufhaus Freiburg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Historical Merchants' Hall of 1520\u201321]]\nThe [[Historical Merchants' Hall (Freiburg)|Historical Merchants' Hall]] (''Historisches Kaufhaus''), is a [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] building on the south side of Freiburg's ''M\u00fcnsterplatz''. Built between 1520 and 1530, it was once the center of the financial life of the region. Its fa\u00e7ade is decorated with statues and the [[coat of arms]] of four [[Habsburg]] emperors.\n\nThe ''Altes Rathaus'', or old city hall, was completed in 1559 and has a painted fa\u00e7ade. The ''Platz der alten Synagoge'' \"Old Synagogue Square\" is one of the more important squares on the outskirts of the historic old city. The square was the location of a synagogue until it was destroyed on {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}} in 1938. [[Zum Roten B\u00e4ren]], the oldest hotel in Germany, is located along ''Oberlinden'' near the [[Swabia]]n Gate.\n\nThe ''[[Siegesdenkmal]]'', or victory monument, is a monument to the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. It is situated at the northern edge of the historic city center of Freiburg, and was built by Karl Friedrich Moest. In everyday language of people living in Freiburg, it serves as an orientation marker or as a meeting place.\n\nTo the east of the city centre, the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schlossberg]] hill provides extensive views over the city and surrounding region. The castle (Schloss) from which the hill takes its name was demolished in the 1740s, and only ruins remain. Schlossberg retained its importance to the city, however, and 150 years ago the city leaders opened up walks and views to make the mountain available to the public. Today, the [[Schlossbergbahn (Freiburg)|Schlossbergbahn]] [[funicular|funicular railway]] connects the city centre to the hill.<ref name=sbb>{{cite web | url = http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1204575/index.html | publisher = Stadt Freiburg | title = Erlebniswelt Schlossberg | trans-title = Experience Schlossberg | language = German | accessdate = 2011-02-13 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110405115733/http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1204575/index.html | archivedate = 2011-04-05 }}</ref>\n\nOther museums in the city include the [[Archaeology Colombischl\u00f6ssle Museum]].\n\n=== List of major sights ===\n* [[Arboretum Freiburg-G\u00fcnterstal]], an arboretum in the suburb of G\u00fcnterstal\n* [[Freiburg Botanic Garden]]\n* [[University of Freiburg]]\n* [[University Library Freiburg]], the newly renovated library features a modern design \n* [[The Whale House]], which, in [[Dario Argento]]'s 1977 horror film ''[[Suspiria]]'', served as the Dance Academy, the film's central location\n* [[Augustiner Museum]]\n* [[Freiburg Munster]]\n* [[Schauinsland]]\n* [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)]]\n* [[Colombischl\u00f6ssle Archeological Museum]]\n* [[Green Spaces in Freiburg]]\n* [[Vauban, Freiburg]], a sustainable eco-community\n* [[Cobblestone mosaics (Freiburg im Breisgau)]]\n\n==Geography==\nFreiburg is bordered by the Black Forest mountains [[Ro\u00dfkopf (Breisgau)|Rosskopf]] and Bromberg to the east, Sch\u00f6nberg and Tuniberg to the south, with the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg)|Kaiserstuhl]] hill region to the west.\n\n===Climate===\n[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] classifies its climate as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (Cfb). However, it is close to being [[humid subtropical]] (Cfa) due to the mean temperatures in July and August just under 22 \u00b0C.  Marine features are limited however, as a result of its vast distance from oceans and seas. As a result, summers have a significant [[humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] influence as the inland air heats up. Thus July and August are, along with [[Karlsruhe]], the warmest within Germany. Winters are moderate but usually with frequent frosts. However, more year-round rain occurs than in the Rhine plateau because of the closeness to the Black Forest. The city is close to the Kaiserstuhl, a range of hills of volcanic origin located a few miles away which is one of the warmest places in Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area.\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Freiburg 2015\u20132020, sunshine 2015\u20132020, extremes 1949\u2013present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C= 18.8\n|Feb

Home to some of the greatest minds of the [[western culture|West]], including such eminent figures as [[Johann Eck]], [[Max Weber]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], it is one of Europe's top research and teaching institutions.\n\nFreiburg also plays host to various other educational and research institutes, such as the Freiburg University of Education, the [[Protestant University for Applied Sciences Freiburg]], [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Freiburg|Freiburg Music Academy]], the [[Catholic University of Applied Sciences Freiburg]], the International University of Cooperative Education IUCE, three [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck institutes]], and five [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer institutes]].\n\nThe city is home to the [[Institute for the International Education of Students|IES Abroad]] European Union program, which allows students to study the development and activities of the [[European Union|EU]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iesabroad.org/IES/Programs/EuropeanUnion/EuropeanUnion/europeanUnion.html|title=European Union|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lawyer Freiburg |url=http://www.pohl-sitzler.de/ |accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[DFG / LFA Freiburg]], a French-German high school established by the 1963 [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty]], is in the city.\n\n==Religion==\n\n'''Christianity'''\n\nFreiburg belonged to Austria until 1805 and because of this stayed Catholic, even though surrounding villages like [[Haslach (Freiburg)|Haslach]], Opfingen, Tiengen, and the surrounding land ruled by the [[Margrave of Baden]] turned Protestant as a result of the Reformation. The city was part of the [[Diocese of Konstanz]] until 1821. That same year, Freiburg became an [[episcopal see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg]]. Due to a dispute between the government of Baden and the [[Holy See]], the [[Archbishop of Freiburg|archbishop]] officially took office in 1827.\n[[File:Freiburger-muenster.png|thumb|250px|right|The Freiburger Minster: one of Freiburg's most famous landmarks]]\n\nThe borders of the archdiocese correspond with the borders of the former [[State of Baden|province of Baden]] and the former Margraviate of Hohenzollern. The cathedral, in which the Bishop resides, is [[Freiburg Minster]]. Also part of the [[ecclesiastical province]] of Freiburg are the [[suffragan diocese]]s of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Mainz]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]. Until 1929 the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Limburg]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda|Fulda]] also belonged to this ecclesiastical province. The Archbishop of Freiburg holds the title of metropolitan and the German headquarters of the [[Caritas Internationalis|Caritas International]] is in Freiburg.\n\n[[Saint George]] (the flag of Freiburg has the cross of George), [[Lambert of Maastricht]] and the catacomb saint, [[Alexander of Bergamo|Alexander]], are the patron saints of Freiburg. Many works of art depicting these saints are in the Freiburg Minster, on the Minster square, just as in the museums and archives of the city, including some by [[Hans Baldung Grien]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] and [[Gregorius Sickinger]].\n\nIn 1805, with the attack of Breisgau on the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] by a Catholic ruler, many Protestants moved into the city. Since 2007, any Protestants who are not part of a \u2018free church\u2019 belong to the newly founded deanery of Freiburg as part of the parish of S\u00fcdbaden which in itself is a part of the Landeskirche Baden.\n\nThe seat of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Baden]], a free Lutheran church, is situated in Freiburg. There are multiple other free Protestant churches: e.g. the Calvary Chapel or Chrischona International. An old congregation has existed in Freiburg since the late 1900s, which utilizes the old monastery church of the Ursulines in the black monastery at the border of the old city center. The Catholic Church of St. Maria Schutz has been made available for Masses by Greek, Serbian, Russian and Rumanian Orthodox congregations.\n\n'''Judaism'''\n\n[[Jews]] are said to have lived in the city before 1230, but it was only after 1230 that they supposedly founded an official community in the Webergasse (a small street within the city center). The counts of Freiburg bought the lucrative [[Schutzjude]], which means that all personal information on Jews living in Freiburg was directly sent to [[Konrad II]] and his co-reigning son Friedrich. The two issued a comprising letter promising safety and liberty to all local Jews on 12 October 1338. It lost all value shortly after, however, on 1 January 1349. Even though the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] had not yet broken out in the city, Jews were accused of having spread it and taken into custody. All Jewish people with the exception of pregnant women were burned alive on 31 January 1349. The remaining children were forced to be baptized. This pogrom left Jews very hesitant to settle in the city again. In 1401 the city council decreed a regulation to ban all Jews from Freiburg (orig. Middle High German dialect: \u201cdaz dekein Jude ze Friburg niemmerme sin sol\u201d[27]. This was also officially reaffirmed by King Sigismund with a ban for life (orig. German: \u201cEwige Vertreibung\u201d) in 1424. It was only in 1809 that Jews were once again allowed permanent residence within the city. They subsequently founded a Jewish community in 1836.\n\nAt the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the synagogue, built in 1870, was set afire. Numerous shops and apartments of Jewish citizens of Freiburg were devastated and plundered by National Socialists without the intervention of police or fire department. Male, wealthy, Jewish citizens were kidnapped and taken to [[concentration camps]] (in [[Buchenwald]] and [[Dachau]]) where they were subjected to forced labor or executed and their money and property stolen. On October 22, 1940 the remaining Jews of Baden and Pfalz were deported to [[Gurs internment camp|Camp de Gurs]] in southern France. One among many collecting points was Annaplatz. So-called '[[Stolpersteine]]', tiles with names and dates on them, commemorate the victims of the prosecution of Jews during the Nazi-Era in the city's cobble. Journalist K\u00e4the Vordtriede of the [[Volkswacht (Freiburg)|Volkswacht]] even received two Stolpersteine to commemorate her life. The first one was inserted into the ground in front of the Vordtriede-Haus Freiburg in 2006 and the second one in front of the Basler Hof, the regional authorities, in spring 2013. This was also the seat of the [[Gestapo]] until 1941, where unrelenting people were cruelly interrogated, held prisoner or at worst{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} deported. The only solutions were flight or emigration. The [[Werner Vordtriede|Vordtriede family]], however, was lucky and escaped in time.\n\n==Transport==\n\n[[File:Combino Freiburg.jpg|thumb|230px|Freiburg VAG tram|left]]\nFreiburg has an extensive [[Auto-free zone|pedestrian zone]] in the city centre where no motor cars are allowed. Freiburg also has an excellent public transport system, operated by the city-owned [[Freiburger Verkehrs AG|VAG Freiburg]]. The backbone of the system is the [[Trams in Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg tramway network]], supplemented by feeder [[bus]]es. The tram network is so popular as the low fares allow for unlimited transport in the city and surrounding area. Furthermore, any ticket for a concert sports or other event is also valid for use on public transport. The tram network is so vast that 70% of the population live within 500m of a tram stop with a tram every 8 mins.\n\nFreiburg is on the main [[Mannheim\u2013Karlsruhe\u2013Basle railway|Frankfurt am Main \u2013 Basel railway line]], with frequent and fast long-distance passenger services from the [[Freiburg Hauptbahnhof]] to major German and other European cities. Other railway lines run east into the [[Black Forest]] and west to [[Breisach]] and are served by the [[Breisgau S-Bahn]]. The line to Breisach is the remaining stub of the [[Freiburg\u2013Colmar railway|Freiburg\u2013Colmar international railway]], severed in 1945 when the railway bridge over the [[Rhine]] at Breisach was destroyed, and was never replaced.\n\nThe city also is served by the [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] [[Frankfurt am Main]] \u2013 [[Basel]] motorway.\n\nFreiburg is served by [[EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg]] in France, close to the borders of both Germany and Switzerland, {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} south of Freiburg. Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airport ([[Baden Airpark]]) is approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} north of Freiburg and is also served by several airlines. The nearest larger international airports include Stuttgart ({{convert|200|km|abbr=on}}), Frankfurt/Main ({{convert|260|km|abbr=on}}), and Munich ({{convert|430|km|abbr=on}}). The nearby [[Flugplatz Freiburg]], a small airfield in the [[Messe Freiburg|Messe, Freiburg]] district, lacks commercial service but is used for private aviation.\n\nCar share websites such as Mitfahrgelegenheit are commonly used among Freiburg residents, since they are considered relatively safe.\n\nThe investment in transport has resulted in a large increase in both cycle, pedestrian and public transport usage with projections of car journeys accounting for 29% of journey times.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Badenova-Stadion 2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schwarzwald-Stadion]] is the home ground of [[Bundesliga]] club [[SC Freiburg]]]]\n\nFreiburg is home to football teams [[SC Freiburg]], which plays at the [[Schwarzwald-Stadion]] and is represented in the 1. or [[2. Bundesliga]] since 1978, and [[Freiburger FC]], German championship winner of 1907. In 2016, SC Freiburg got promoted to the highest league for the fifth time in its club history. The club became generally known in Germany for its steady staffing policy. [[Achim Stocker]] was president of the club from 1972 until his death in 2009. Longtime coach was [[Volker Finke]] (1991-2007), to whose initiative the football school of the club goes back. In 2004, SC Freiburg celebrated its 100th anniversary. Since December 2011, the coach is [[Christian Streich]]. The women's team of SC Freiburg plays in the first Women's Bundesliga.\n\nFreiburg also has the [[EHC Freiburg]] [[ice hockey]] team, which plays at the Franz-Siegel Halle. In the season 2003/2004 the EHC Freiburg (the wolves) played in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]], the highest German ice hockey league. Currently, season 2018/19, they play in the second league ([[DEL2]]).\n\nAdditionally, there is the RC Freiburg Rugby union team, which competes in the [[2. Rugby-Bundesliga|second Bundesliga South (Baden Wurttemberg)]]. The home ground of the club, the only rugby sports field in the wider area, is located in March-Hugstetten.\n\nThen, there is the volleyball men's team of the [[Freiburger Turnerschaft von 1844|FT 1844 Freiburg]], which plays in the second Bundesliga since 2001 and the handball women's team of the HSG Freiburg, which plays in the 3rd Women's Handball League.\n\nFreiburg is represented in the first women's basketball league by the Eisv\u00f6gel (Kingfisher) USC Freiburg. In the season 2005/2006, the Kingfishers took second place after the end of the second round, in the season 2006/2007 it was the fourth place. The men's team of the USC played in the 2009/10 season in the [[ProA]] (2nd Bundesliga). The Freiburg men's team played their last first-division season in 1998/1999. Currently, season 2018/19, the men's team plays in the Oberliga and the women's team in the regional league.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1984, the [[ADAC Schauinsland Races|Schauinsland Races]] took place on an old logging track. The course is still used periodically for [[European Hill Climb Championship]]s.\n\n== Press ==\n[[Badische Zeitung]] is the main local daily paper, covering the Black Forest region.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\n===Twin towns, sister cities===\nFreiburg is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Besan\u00e7on]], France; since 1959\n*{{flagicon|AUT}} [[Innsbruck]], Austria; since 1963\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Padua]], Italy; since 1967\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Guildford]], England; since 1979\n||\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin; since 1987\n*{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Matsuyama]], Japan; since 1988\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Lviv]], Ukraine; since 1989\n||\n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Granada]], Spain; since 1991\n*{{flagicon|IRN}} [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], Iran; since 2000\n*{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Suwon]], South Korea; since 2015\n|}\n\n[[Iran]]ian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s controversial comments, which included questioning the dimension of the [[Holocaust]], have sparked discussions concerning Freiburg's relationship with [[Isfahan]].

The cross also appears on the city's flag, which dates from about 1368, and is identical to that of [[Flag of England|England]], which has the same patron.\n\nThe city also has a [[seal (emblem)|seal]] that can be seen in a few places in the inner city. It is a stylized depiction of the fa\u00e7ade of the ''Wasserschl\u00f6ssle,'' a castle-like waterworks facility built into a hill that overlooks the residential district of [[Wiehre]].  The seal depicts a three-towered red castle on a white background, with green-clad trumpeters atop the two outer towers.

The rules themselves have evolved directly from the [[First indoor hockey game|first organized indoor ice hockey game]] in Montreal in 1875, updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917, when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules. The NHL's rules are the basis for rules governing [[List of ice hockey leagues#Minor professional|most professional]] and [[Canadian Hockey League|major junior ice hockey leagues]] in North America. Infractions of the rules, such as [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]] and [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]], lead to a stoppage of play and subsequent [[face-off]]s, while more serious infractions leading to penalties to the offending teams. The league also determines the specifications for playing equipment used in its games.\n\nThe league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game. The penalty shot was adopted from the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score. For the 2005\u201306 season, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the \"offside pass\" or \"two-line pass\" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] was completed on the offensive side of the centre line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player.<ref name=\"newoffside\">{{Cite news|title=Relaunching the Game |author=CBC sports |publisher=CBC.com |date=July 22, 2005 |accessdate=June 10, 2006 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516050646/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |archivedate=May 16, 2006 }}</ref> Furthermore, the league reinstated the \"tag-up offside\" which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone.<ref name=\"newoffside\" /> The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring,<ref name=\"newoffside\" /> which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the [[neutral zone trap]]. Since 2005, when a team is guilty of [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing the puck]] they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following [[face-off]] (except to replace an injured player or re-install a [[extra attacker|pulled goaltender]]).<ref name=\"icing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514155000/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |title=Icing |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |year=2005 }}</ref> Since 2013, the league has used ''hybrid icing'', where a [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesman|linesman]] stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face-off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to. This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck.<ref name=\"icing\" />\n\nThe league's rules differ from the rules of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), as used in tournaments such as the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]], which were themselves derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early 20th century.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}} In the NHL, [[Fighting in ice hockey|fighting]] leads to ''major penalties'' while IIHF rules, and most amateur rules, call for the ejection of fighting players.<ref name=\"major\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423154838/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |title=Major penalties |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=June 8, 2006 |year=2005 }}</ref><ref name=\"fighting_iihf\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |title=Ice Hockey Essentials \u2013 International vs. NHL |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |year=2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060221192349/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |archivedate = February 21, 2006}}</ref> Usually, a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus [[short-handed]] for the duration of the penalty,<ref name=\"minor\" /> but if the penalties are coincidental, for example when two players fight, both teams remain at full strength.

Players are banned from [[gambling]] and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players. The league and the Players' Association agreed to a stringent anti-doping policy in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. The policy provides for a twenty-game suspension for a first positive test, a sixty-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023064426/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 2005 |title=NHL unveils new drug testing policy |date=September 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |first=Scott |last=Laurie |publisher=CTV }}</ref>\n\n==Season structure==\n{{Main|Season structure of the NHL}}\n{{See also|List of NHL seasons}}\nThe National Hockey League season is divided into a preseason (September and early October), a regular season (from early October through early to mid April) and a postseason (the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]).\n\nTeams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in July and participate in prospect tournaments, full games that do not feature any veterans, in September. Full training camps begin in mid-to-late September, including a preseason consisting of six to eight [[exhibition game]]s. Split squad games, in which parts of a team's regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.\n\nDuring the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. In the regular season, each team plays 82 games: 41 games each of home and road. Eastern teams play 28 games in their own geographic division\u2014four against each of their seven other divisional opponents\u2014and 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents\u2014three games against every team in the other division of its conference.

In the Stanley Cup Final, the team with the most points during the regular season has home-ice advantage.\n\n==Entry Draft==\n{{Main|NHL Entry Draft}}\n\nThe annual NHL Entry Draft consists of a seven-round off-season [[Draft (sports)|draft]] held in late June. Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth (currently Fairmont) Hotel in Montreal. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 15 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non-division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs, then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals. Conference finalists receive the 28th and 29th picks depending on total points, with the Stanley Cup runner-up given the 30th pick and the Stanley Cup champions the 31st pick.\n\n==Trophies and awards==\n{{Main|List of National Hockey League awards}}\n\n===Teams===\n[[File:Hhof stanley cup.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stanley Cup]], on display at the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], is awarded annually to the league champion.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:1em; float:right\"\n|+ '''Stanley Cup championships'''<br /><small>[[List of defunct NHL teams|Defunct teams]] not included.</small>\n!

The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league. Since the formation of the league in 1917, they have 25 NHL championships (three between 1917 and 1925 when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition, twenty-two since 1926 after the Stanley Cup became the NHL's championship trophy). They also lead all teams with 24 [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup championships]] (one as an NHA team, twenty-three as an NHL team). Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]], who have three more.\n\nThe longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955\u201356 to 1959\u201360.<ref name=\"list_stanley_cup\">{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Winners |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm |first=Jamie |last=Fitzpatrick |publisher=about.com |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |year=2006}}</ref> The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all-time.<ref name=\"greatest team\">{{cite web|title=The 10 greatest teams |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/greatteams.html |publisher=ESPN |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=June 26, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships, most recently in 1967. The Detroit Red Wings, with 11 Stanley Cup championships, are the most successful American franchise.\n\nThe same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup, much like its Canadian Football League [[Grey Cup|counterpart]], is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], [[Larry O'Brien Trophy]], and [[World Series Trophy|Commissioner's Trophy]], which have new ones made every year for that year's champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.\n\n===Players===\nThere are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] for the goal-scoring leader, and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for the [[goaltender]](s) for the team with the fewest goals against them.\n\nThe other player trophies are voted on by the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]] or the team general managers.<ref name=\"awards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/info/nhl-awards-trophies |title=NHL trophies|website=National Hockey League |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref> These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded. The most prestigious individual award is the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] which is awarded annually to the [[Most Valuable Player]]; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The [[Vezina Trophy]] is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top defenceman, the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.\n\n[[File:Hockey Hall of Fame.JPG|thumb|The [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[Downtown Toronto]]]]\nIn addition to the regular season awards, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the [[Jack Adams Award]] as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association. The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards, and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony.<ref name=\"awards\" />\n\nPlayers, coaches, officials, and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].

Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]] of the Soviet Bloc, political/ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared, leading to a large influx of players mostly from Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia into the NHL.

NBCUniversal holds exclusive rights to Wednesday night games, all games televised by the NBC network, and every game in the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning in the second round. Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks, with other games shown on [[CNBC]], [[USA Network]], [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]].\n\nAs in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team's home market, and are subject to [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] outside of them. These broadcasters include [[regional sports network]] chains. Certain national telecasts on NBCSN are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect the local broadcaster.\n\n===NHL Network===\n{{main|NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network (Canada)}}\n\nThe league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. Its signature show is ''[[NHL Tonight]]''. The NHL Network also airs live games, but primarily simulcasts of one of the team's regional broadcasters. \nThe U.S. version simulcasts selected regular season games nationally that are not aired by NBC Sports, as well as be used as an overflow channel during the playoffs.\n\n===Out-of-market packages===\nThe NHL operates two subscription-based services allowing access to live, out-of-market games.

Most of these competitions were arranged by the NHL or NHLPA. The first international club competition was held in [[Super Series '76|1976]], with eight NHL teams playing against the [[Soviet Championship League]]'s [[HC CSKA Moscow]], and [[Krylya Sovetov Moscow]]. Between 1976 and 1991, the NHL, and the Soviet Championship League would hold a number of exhibition games between the two leagues known as the [[Super Series]]. No NHL club had played a Russian-based club from the end of the Super Series in 1991 to 2008, when the New York Rangers faced [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] in the [[2008 Victoria Cup]].\n\nIn addition to the Russian clubs, NHL clubs had participated in a number of international club exhibitions and competitions with various European-based clubs. The first exhibition game to feature an NHL team against a European-based team (aside from clubs based in the former Soviet Union) was in December 1977, when the New York Rangers faced [[HC Kladno|Poldi Kladno]] of the [[Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League]]. In the 2000s the NHL had organized four [[NHL Challenge]] series between NHL, and European clubs. From 2007 to 2011, the NHL organized exhibition games prior to the beginning of the season, known as the NHL Premiere, between NHL clubs and teams from a number of European leagues. The [[List of international games played by NHL teams#2018 NHL Global Series|2018 NHL Global Series]] was the last NHL-organized club competition involving European teams. NHL clubs have also participated in IIHF-organized club tournaments. The most recent IIHF-organized event including an NHL club was the [[2009 Victoria Cup]], between the Swiss [[National League A]]'s [[ZSC Lions]], and the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2014, during the quadrennial [[Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic]] years, the NHL suspended its all-star game and expanded the traditional all-star break to allow NHL players to represent their countries in the Olympic ice hockey tournament; starting 2018, because the All-Star game is held in late January, there would be no Olympic break. Conversely, the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] are held every May at the same time as the Stanley Cup playoffs. Thus, NHL players generally only join their respective country's team in the World Championships if their respective NHL team has been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention, or did not make the playoffs.\n\nIn 2007, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) formalized the \"[[Triple Gold Club]]\", the group of players and coaches who have won an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship gold medal, and the Stanley Cup.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Winner of three-team tourney to get Victoria Cup|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2863711|date=May 8, 2007|accessdate=February 9, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref name=\"expands\">{{cite web|title=Triple Gold Club expands to 22 |url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |website=International Ice Hockey Federation |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=February 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218074948/http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |archivedate=February 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PR & Media Activities|url=http://www.iihf.com/100-years/100-years-of-ice-hockey/pr-media-activities.html|website=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=February 8, 2009}}</ref> The term had first entered popular use following the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], which saw the addition of the first Canadian members.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Welcome to the Triple Gold Club: Blake, Sakic, Shanahan: New members to elite club: Olympics, worlds, Stanley Cup|work=[[National Post]]|author=Barnes, Don|date=February 25, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Triple Gold Club awaits Canadian trio|author=Scanlan, Wayne|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=February 24, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Skating a fine line|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/2002GamesColumnistsPreGames/buffery_dec26-sun.html|last=Buffery|first=Steve|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=December 26, 2001|accessdate=February 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAs well as participating in the above international club competitions, the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association organizes the [[World Cup of Hockey]].

The game has since become an annual staple of the NHL schedule. This, along with the transition to a national \"Game of the Week\" and an annual \"Hockey Day in America\" regional coverage, all televised on NBC, has helped increase the NHL's regular season television viewership in the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These improvements led NBC and the cable channel [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] to sign a ten-year broadcast deal, paying US$200&nbsp;million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights; the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels.\n\nThis television contract has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL.

The rules themselves have evolved directly from the [[First indoor hockey game|first organized indoor ice hockey game]] in Montreal in 1875, updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917, when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules. The NHL's rules are the basis for rules governing [[List of ice hockey leagues#Minor professional|most professional]] and [[Canadian Hockey League|major junior ice hockey leagues]] in North America. Infractions of the rules, such as [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]] and [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]], lead to a stoppage of play and subsequent [[face-off]]s, while more serious infractions leading to penalties to the offending teams. The league also determines the specifications for playing equipment used in its games.\n\nThe league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game. The penalty shot was adopted from the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score. For the 2005\u201306 season, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the \"offside pass\" or \"two-line pass\" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] was completed on the offensive side of the centre line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player.<ref name=\"newoffside\">{{Cite news|title=Relaunching the Game |author=CBC sports |publisher=CBC.com |date=July 22, 2005 |accessdate=June 10, 2006 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516050646/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |archivedate=May 16, 2006 }}</ref> Furthermore, the league reinstated the \"tag-up offside\" which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone.<ref name=\"newoffside\" /> The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring,<ref name=\"newoffside\" /> which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the [[neutral zone trap]].

Players are banned from [[gambling]] and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players. The league and the Players' Association agreed to a stringent anti-doping policy in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. The policy provides for a twenty-game suspension for a first positive test, a sixty-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023064426/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 2005 |title=NHL unveils new drug testing policy |date=September 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |first=Scott |last=Laurie |publisher=CTV }}</ref>\n\n==Season structure==\n{{Main|Season structure of the NHL}}\n{{See also|List of NHL seasons}}\nThe National Hockey League season is divided into a preseason (September and early October), a regular season (from early October through early to mid April) and a postseason (the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]).\n\nTeams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in July and participate in prospect tournaments, full games that do not feature any veterans, in September. Full training camps begin in mid-to-late September, including a preseason consisting of six to eight [[exhibition game]]s. Split squad games, in which parts of a team's regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.\n\nDuring the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. In the regular season, each team plays 82 games: 41 games each of home and road. Eastern teams play 28 games in their own geographic division\u2014four against each of their seven other divisional opponents\u2014and 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents\u2014three games against every team in the other division of its conference. Western teams play 26 or 29 games in their own geographic division\u2014four or five against each of their six or seven other divisional opponents\u2014and 21 or 24 games against the six or seven remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents\u2014three games against every team in the other division of its conference, with one cross-division intra-conference match-up occurring in four games.

Two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in overtime or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion, and the league's overall leader is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].\n\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion.

Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth (currently Fairmont) Hotel in Montreal. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 15 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non-division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs, then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals. Conference finalists receive the 28th and 29th picks depending on total points, with the Stanley Cup runner-up given the 30th pick and the Stanley Cup champions the 31st pick.\n\n==Trophies and awards==\n{{Main|List of National Hockey League awards}}\n\n===Teams===\n[[File:Hhof stanley cup.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stanley Cup]], on display at the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], is awarded annually to the league champion.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:1em; float:right\"\n|+ '''Stanley Cup championships'''<br /><small>[[List of defunct NHL teams|Defunct teams]] not included.</small>\n!

The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league. Since the formation of the league in 1917, they have 25 NHL championships (three between 1917 and 1925 when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition, twenty-two since 1926 after the Stanley Cup became the NHL's championship trophy). They also lead all teams with 24 [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup championships]] (one as an NHA team, twenty-three as an NHL team). Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]], who have three more.\n\nThe longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955\u201356 to 1959\u201360.<ref name=\"list_stanley_cup\">{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Winners |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm |first=Jamie |last=Fitzpatrick |publisher=about.com |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |year=2006}}</ref> The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all-time.<ref name=\"greatest team\">{{cite web|title=The 10 greatest teams |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/greatteams.html |publisher=ESPN |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=June 26, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships, most recently in 1967. The Detroit Red Wings, with 11 Stanley Cup championships, are the most successful American franchise.\n\nThe same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup, much like its Canadian Football League [[Grey Cup|counterpart]], is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], [[Larry O'Brien Trophy]], and [[World Series Trophy|Commissioner's Trophy]], which have new ones made every year for that year's champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.\n\n===Players===\nThere are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] for the goal-scoring leader, and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for the [[goaltender]](s) for the team with the fewest goals against them.\n\nThe other player trophies are voted on by the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]] or the team general managers.<ref name=\"awards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/info/nhl-awards-trophies |title=NHL trophies|website=National Hockey League |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref> These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded. The most prestigious individual award is the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] which is awarded annually to the [[Most Valuable Player]]; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The [[Vezina Trophy]] is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top defenceman, the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.\n\n[[File:Hockey Hall of Fame.JPG|thumb|The [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[Downtown Toronto]]]]\nIn addition to the regular season awards, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs.

Most of these competitions were arranged by the NHL or NHLPA. The first international club competition was held in [[Super Series '76|1976]], with eight NHL teams playing against the [[Soviet Championship League]]'s [[HC CSKA Moscow]], and [[Krylya Sovetov Moscow]]. Between 1976 and 1991, the NHL, and the Soviet Championship League would hold a number of exhibition games between the two leagues known as the [[Super Series]]. No NHL club had played a Russian-based club from the end of the Super Series in 1991 to 2008, when the New York Rangers faced [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] in the [[2008 Victoria Cup]].\n\nIn addition to the Russian clubs, NHL clubs had participated in a number of international club exhibitions and competitions with various European-based clubs. The first exhibition game to feature an NHL team against a European-based team (aside from clubs based in the former Soviet Union) was in December 1977, when the New York Rangers faced [[HC Kladno|Poldi Kladno]] of the [[Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League]]. In the 2000s the NHL had organized four [[NHL Challenge]] series between NHL, and European clubs. From 2007 to 2011, the NHL organized exhibition games prior to the beginning of the season, known as the NHL Premiere, between NHL clubs and teams from a number of European leagues. The [[List of international games played by NHL teams#2018 NHL Global Series|2018 NHL Global Series]] was the last NHL-organized club competition involving European teams. NHL clubs have also participated in IIHF-organized club tournaments. The most recent IIHF-organized event including an NHL club was the [[2009 Victoria Cup]], between the Swiss [[National League A]]'s [[ZSC Lions]], and the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2014, during the quadrennial [[Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic]] years, the NHL suspended its all-star game and expanded the traditional all-star break to allow NHL players to represent their countries in the Olympic ice hockey tournament; starting 2018, because the All-Star game is held in late January, there would be no Olympic break. Conversely, the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] are held every May at the same time as the Stanley Cup playoffs. Thus, NHL players generally only join their respective country's team in the World Championships if their respective NHL team has been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention, or did not make the playoffs.\n\nIn 2007, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) formalized the \"[[Triple Gold Club]]\", the group of players and coaches who have won an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship gold medal, and the Stanley Cup.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Winner of three-team tourney to get Victoria Cup|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2863711|date=May 8, 2007|accessdate=February 9, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref name=\"expands\">{{cite web|title=Triple Gold Club expands to 22 |url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |website=International Ice Hockey Federation |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=February 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218074948/http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |archivedate=February 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PR & Media Activities|url=http://www.iihf.com/100-years/100-years-of-ice-hockey/pr-media-activities.html|website=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=February 8, 2009}}</ref> The term had first entered popular use following the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], which saw the addition of the first Canadian members.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Welcome to the Triple Gold Club: Blake, Sakic, Shanahan: New members to elite club: Olympics, worlds, Stanley Cup|work=[[National Post]]|author=Barnes, Don|date=February 25, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Triple Gold Club awaits Canadian trio|author=Scanlan, Wayne|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=February 24, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Skating a fine line|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/2002GamesColumnistsPreGames/buffery_dec26-sun.html|last=Buffery|first=Steve|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=December 26, 2001|accessdate=February 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAs well as participating in the above international club competitions, the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association organizes the [[World Cup of Hockey]].

The game has since become an annual staple of the NHL schedule. This, along with the transition to a national \"Game of the Week\" and an annual \"Hockey Day in America\" regional coverage, all televised on NBC, has helped increase the NHL's regular season television viewership in the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These improvements led NBC and the cable channel [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] to sign a ten-year broadcast deal, paying US$200&nbsp;million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights; the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels.\n\nThis television contract has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL.
