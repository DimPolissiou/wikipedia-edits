It was the standard [[ink]] formulation used in [[Europe]] for the fourteen-hundred year period between the 5th and 19th centuries, remained in widespread use well into the 20th century, and is still sold today.\n\n==Preparation and use==\n[[Image:Eisengallustinte Essenzen I und II und Tinte.jpg|thumb|Homemade ink. On left, a solution of iron (from nails) and [[vinegar]]. On right, oak extraction. The two are mixed immediately prior to use to produce the ink, centre.]]\nThe ink was traditionally prepared by adding some [[iron(II) sulfate]] ([[iron|Fe]][[sulfur|S]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub>) to a solution of [[tannic acid]], but any iron ion donor can be used. The [[Tannic acid#Quercitannic and gallotannic acids|gallotannic acid]] was usually extracted from [[Oak apple|oak galls]] or [[gall]]s of other trees, hence the name. [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] or [[hydrolysis]] of the extract releases [[glucose]] and [[gallic acid]],{{clarify|reason=Good sources needed to clarify use of tannic, gallotannic and gallic acid|date=April 2017}} which yields a darker purple-black ink, due to the formation of iron gallate.\n\nThe fermented extract was combined with the iron(II) sulfate. After filtering, the resulting pale-grey solution had a binder added to it (most commonly [[gum arabic]]) and was used to write on [[paper]] or [[parchment]]. A well-prepared ink would gradually darken to an intense purplish black. The resulting marks would adhere firmly to the parchment or [[vellum]], and (unlike [[india ink]] or other formulas) could not be erased by rubbing or washing. The marks could only be erased by scraping a thin layer off the writing surface.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flemay|first1=Marie|title=Iron Gall Ink|url=https://travelingscriptorium.library.yale.edu/2013/03/21/iron-gall-ink/|website=Traveling Scriptorium|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Chemistry ==\n[[Image:Eisengallustinte selbstgemacht schriftbild.jpg|thumb|Homemade iron gall ink in use, displaying the delayed darkening of the ink]]\n[[Image:InkErosion.jpg|thumb|Ink corrosion: iron gall ink causes paper and parchment to disintegrate]]\n\nBy mixing tannin with iron sulfate, a water-soluble [[ferrous]] tannate complex is formed. Because of its solubility, the ink is able to penetrate the paper surface, making it difficult to erase. When exposed to air, it converts to a [[ferric]] tannate, which is a darker [[pigment]]. This product is not water-soluble, contributing to its permanence as a writing ink.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://irongallink.org/igi_indexedde.html |title=Iron gall ink \u2013 Chemistry |first=Elmer |last=Eusman |year=1998 |website=The Iron Gall Ink Website}}</ref>\n\nThe darkening process of the ink is due to the [[oxidation]] of the iron ions from ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) state by atmospheric [[oxygen]]. For that reason, the liquid ink needs to be stored in a well-stoppered bottle, and often becomes unusable after a time. The ferric ions react with the tannic acid or some derived compound (possibly [[gallic acid]] or [[pyrogallol]]) to form a [[polymer]]ic [[organometallic compound]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fruen|first=Lois|year=2002|chapter=Iron Gall Ink|title=The Real World of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-7872-9677-3|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing|chapter-url=http://www.realscience.breckschool.org/upper/fruen/files/Enrichmentarticles/files/IronGallInk/IronGallInk.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430005823/http://www.realscience.breckschool.org/upper/fruen/files/Enrichmentarticles/files/IronGallInk/IronGallInk.html|archive-date=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile a very effective ink, the formula was less than ideal. Iron gall ink is acidic.  Depending on the writing surface being used iron gall ink can have unsightly \"ghost writing\" on the obverse face of the writing surface (most commonly parchment or paper). Ultimately it may eat holes through the surface it was on. This is accelerated by high temperature and humidity.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Kinetics of accelerated degradation of historic iron gall ink-containing paper |last1=Liu |first1=Yun |last2= Cigi\u0107 |first2=Irena Kralj |last3=Strli\u010da |first3=Matija |year=2017 |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |volume=142 |pages=255\u2013262 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.07.010 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1568107/1/1-s2.0-S0141391017302008-main.pdf }}</ref>  However, manuscripts written with it such as the [[Book of Magical Charms]] have survived hundreds of years without damaging the paper on which it was used.<ref>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-newberry-magic-20171024-story.html|title=Newberry Library's 'Book of Magical Charms' is the 'stuff of nightmares'|author=Christopher Borrelli|date=30 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest recipes for oak gall ink come from [[Pliny the Elder]], and are vague at best.  Many famous and important manuscripts have been written using ferrous oak gall ink, including the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], the oldest, most complete [[Bible]] currently known to exist, thought to be written in the middle of the fourth century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mazzarino|first=Sara|title=Report on the different inks used in Codex Sinaiticus and assessment of their condition|url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_ink.aspx|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref> Due to the ease of making iron gall ink and its quality of permanence and water resistance this ink became the favored one for scribes in the European corridor as well as around the Mediterranean Sea.  Surviving manuscripts from the [[Middle Ages]] as well as the [[Renaissance]] bear this out as the vast majority are written using iron gall ink, the balance being written using lamp black or [[carbon black]] inks.  Many drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were made with iron gall ink.<ref>White, Susan D. (2006). ''Draw Like Da Vinci''. London: Cassell Illustrated, pp.18-19, {{ISBN|9781844034444}}.</ref> Laws were enacted in Great Britain and France specifying the content of iron gall ink for all royal and legal records to ensure permanence in this time period as well.\n\nThe popularity of iron gall ink traveled around the world during the colonization period and beyond.  The [[United States Postal Service]] had its own official recipe that was to be used in all post office branches for the use of their customers.  It was not until the invention of chemically-produced inks and writing fluids in the latter half of the 20th century that iron gall ink fell from common use.\n\n== Wane ==\nThe permanence and water-resistance of the iron and gall-nut formula made it the standard writing ink in Europe for over 1,400 years, and in America after European colonisation. Its use and production started to decline only in the 20th century, when other waterproof formulas (better suited for writing on paper) became available.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Today, iron gall ink is manufactured by a small number of companies and used by fountain pen enthusiasts and artists, but has fewer administrative applications.\n\n== Fountain pens ==\n[[File:Lamy Fountain pen writing samples.jpg|thumb|Fountain pen writing samples written with blue-black Ecclesiastical Stationery Supplies Registrars Ink iron gall\u2013based ink used in the United Kingdom for official documents]]\n[[File:Nachf\u00fclleisengallustinte Pelikan 0.5 Liter (G\u00fcnther Wagner).JPG|thumb|Iron gall ink for fountain pens, refill bottle, 0.5 litre, ''circa'' 1950s with storage container]]\n[[File:Heiratsurkunde aus dem Jahre 1952.JPG|thumb|German marriage certificate issued on 6 December 1952 in [[Landshut]] signed with iron gall ink by the civil registry servant]]\n\nTraditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens are not suitable for [[fountain pen]]s which operate on the principle of [[capillary action]]. Ferro-gallic deposit accumulation in the feed system can clog the small ink passages in fountain pen feeds. Further, very acidic traditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens can corrode metal pen parts (a phenomenon known as [[redox|redox reaction]]/[[corrosion|flash corrosion]]). These phenomena can destroy the functionality of fountain pens.\n\nInstead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for fountain pens, such as blue-black bottled inks by [[Lamy]] (discontinued in 2012), [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] (discontinued in 2012), Chesterfield Archival Vault (discontinued in 2016), Diamine Registrar's Ink, Ecclesiastical Stationery Supplies Registrars Ink, Hero 232, and Organics Studios Aristotle Iron Gall.<ref>[https://gdoc.pub/doc/1po8jfMHv-Uz_ioZ9-2DQzASb1FNs-RSfmkkR4GaZ23g#heading=h.vydniszftb1n LIST OF IRON-GALL-BASED FOUNTAIN PEN INKS, compiled by T.

Medeiros]</ref>\n\nThese modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro-gallic compounds and are also more likely to have a formulation which is [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometrically]] optimised. Historical inks often contained excess acid which was not consumed in the oxidation of the ferro-gallic compounds. Modern formulations also tend to use [[hydrochloric acid]] whereas many historical inks used [[sulfuric acid]]. Hydrochloric acid is a gas in solution, which will evaporate. As a result, modern fountain pen iron gall inks are less likely to damage paper than historical inks and are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still cause problems if left in a pen for a long period. Manufacturers or retailers of modern iron gall inks intended for fountain pens sometimes advise a more thorough than usual cleaning regimen \u2013 which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water \u2013 to avoid clogging or corrosion on delicate pen parts. For more thoroughly cleaning iron gall ink out of a fountain pen, sequential flushes of the pen with water, diluted vinegar or citric acid (to flush out residual iron gall compounds), water, diluted ammonia (if needed to flush out residual colour dye stains), then finally water are often recommended.\n\nThe colour [[dye]] in these modern iron gall formulas functions as a temporary colourant to make these inks clearly visible whilst writing. The ferro-gallic compounds through a gradual oxidation process cause an observable gradual colour change to grey/black whilst these inks completely dry and makes the writing waterproof. The colour-changing property of the ink also depends on the [[paper chemicals|properties]] of the used paper. In general, the darkening process will progress more quickly and visibly on papers containing relatively high [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching agent residues]].\n\nThough not in mainstream 21st-century use like dye-based [[fountain pen ink]]s, modern iron gall inks are still used in fountain pens where permanence is required. In the United Kingdom the use of special blue-black archival quality Registrars' Ink containing ferro-gallic compounds is required in [[register office]]s for official documents such as [[birth certificate]]s, [[marriage certificate]]s, [[death certificate]]s and on clergy rolls and ships' [[logbook]]s.<ref>[http://www.registrarsink.co.uk/about.html Registrars' Ink]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog11b.shtml Henry 'Inky' Stephens \u2013 the inventor of blue-black ink (Stephens Blue-Black Registrar's Ink) at BBC Radio 4]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408482/APsGuideFebruary15final.pdf A Guide for Authorised Persons, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2012, Last Updated: February 2015, Registration stock, 1.18, Page 5]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408375/GuidebookClergyFeb15final.pdf Guidebook for The Clergy, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2011, Last Updated: February 2015, Ink, 1.9, Page 7]</ref><br>\nIn Germany the use of special blue or black ''urkunden- oder dokumentenechte Tinte'' or documentary use permanent inks is required in ''notariellen Urkunden'' ([[Civil law notary]] [[legal instrument]]s).<ref>[http://www.bnotk.de/Notar/Berufsrecht/DONot.php Dienstordnung f\u00fcr Notarinnen und Notare (DONot), Abschnitt Herstellung der notariellen Urkunden \u00a7 29 {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n\n=== German regulation for ''Urkundentinte'' inks (1933) ===\n* In a litre of ink there must be at least 27&nbsp;g of tannic acid and gallic acid, and at least 4&nbsp;g of iron content.

It was the standard [[ink]] formulation used in [[Europe]] for the fourteen-hundred year period between the 5th and 19th centuries, remained in widespread use well into the 20th century, and is still sold today.\n\n==Preparation and use==\n[[Image:Eisengallustinte Essenzen I und II und Tinte.jpg|thumb|Homemade ink. On left, a solution of iron (from nails) and [[vinegar]]. On right, oak extraction. The two are mixed immediately prior to use to produce the ink, centre.]]\nThe ink was traditionally prepared by adding some [[iron(II) sulfate]] ([[iron|Fe]][[sulfur|S]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub>) to a solution of [[tannic acid]], but any iron ion donor can be used. The [[Tannic acid#Quercitannic and gallotannic acids|gallotannic acid]] was usually extracted from [[Oak apple|oak galls]] or [[gall]]s of other trees, hence the name. [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] or [[hydrolysis]] of the extract releases [[glucose]] and [[gallic acid]],{{clarify|reason=Good sources needed to clarify use of tannic, gallotannic and gallic acid|date=April 2017}} which yields a darker purple-black ink, due to the formation of iron gallate.\n\nThe fermented extract was combined with the iron(II) sulfate. After filtering, the resulting pale-grey solution had a binder added to it (most commonly [[gum arabic]]) and was used to write on [[paper]] or [[parchment]]. A well-prepared ink would gradually darken to an intense purplish black. The resulting marks would adhere firmly to the parchment or [[vellum]], and (unlike [[india ink]] or other formulas) could not be erased by rubbing or washing. The marks could only be erased by scraping a thin layer off the writing surface.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flemay|first1=Marie|title=Iron Gall Ink|url=https://travelingscriptorium.library.yale.edu/2013/03/21/iron-gall-ink/|website=Traveling Scriptorium|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Chemistry ==\n[[Image:Eisengallustinte selbstgemacht schriftbild.jpg|thumb|Homemade iron gall ink in use, displaying the delayed darkening of the ink]]\n[[Image:InkErosion.jpg|thumb|Ink corrosion: iron gall ink causes paper and parchment to disintegrate]]\n\nBy mixing tannin with iron sulfate, a water-soluble [[ferrous]] tannate complex is formed. Because of its solubility, the ink is able to penetrate the paper surface, making it difficult to erase. When exposed to air, it converts to a [[ferric]] tannate, which is a darker [[pigment]]. This product is not water-soluble, contributing to its permanence as a writing ink.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://irongallink.org/igi_indexedde.html |title=Iron gall ink \u2013 Chemistry |first=Elmer |last=Eusman |year=1998 |website=The Iron Gall Ink Website}}</ref>\n\nThe darkening process of the ink is due to the [[oxidation]] of the iron ions from ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) state by atmospheric [[oxygen]]. For that reason, the liquid ink needs to be stored in a well-stoppered bottle, and often becomes unusable after a time. The ferric ions react with the tannic acid or some derived compound (possibly [[gallic acid]] or [[pyrogallol]]) to form a [[polymer]]ic [[organometallic compound]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fruen|first=Lois|year=2002|chapter=Iron Gall Ink|title=The Real World of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-7872-9677-3|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing|chapter-url=http://www.realscience.breckschool.org/upper/fruen/files/Enrichmentarticles/files/IronGallInk/IronGallInk.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430005823/http://www.realscience.breckschool.org/upper/fruen/files/Enrichmentarticles/files/IronGallInk/IronGallInk.html|archive-date=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile a very effective ink, the formula was less than ideal. Iron gall ink is acidic.  Depending on the writing surface being used iron gall ink can have unsightly \"ghost writing\" on the obverse face of the writing surface (most commonly parchment or paper). Ultimately it may eat holes through the surface it was on. This is accelerated by high temperature and humidity.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Kinetics of accelerated degradation of historic iron gall ink-containing paper |last1=Liu |first1=Yun |last2= Cigi\u0107 |first2=Irena Kralj |last3=Strli\u010da |first3=Matija |year=2017 |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |volume=142 |pages=255\u2013262 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.07.010 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1568107/1/1-s2.0-S0141391017302008-main.pdf }}</ref>  However, manuscripts written with it such as the [[Book of Magical Charms]] have survived hundreds of years without damaging the paper on which it was used.<ref>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-newberry-magic-20171024-story.html|title=Newberry Library's 'Book of Magical Charms' is the 'stuff of nightmares'|author=Christopher Borrelli|date=30 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest recipes for oak gall ink come from [[Pliny the Elder]], and are vague at best.  Many famous and important manuscripts have been written using ferrous oak gall ink, including the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], the oldest, most complete [[Bible]] currently known to exist, thought to be written in the middle of the fourth century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mazzarino|first=Sara|title=Report on the different inks used in Codex Sinaiticus and assessment of their condition|url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_ink.aspx|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref> Due to the ease of making iron gall ink and its quality of permanence and water resistance this ink became the favored one for scribes in the European corridor as well as around the Mediterranean Sea.  Surviving manuscripts from the [[Middle Ages]] as well as the [[Renaissance]] bear this out as the vast majority are written using iron gall ink, the balance being written using lamp black or [[carbon black]] inks.  Many drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were made with iron gall ink.<ref>White, Susan D. (2006). ''Draw Like Da Vinci''. London: Cassell Illustrated, pp.18-19, {{ISBN|9781844034444}}.</ref> Laws were enacted in Great Britain and France specifying the content of iron gall ink for all royal and legal records to ensure permanence in this time period as well.\n\nThe popularity of iron gall ink traveled around the world during the colonization period and beyond.  The [[United States Postal Service]] had its own official recipe that was to be used in all post office branches for the use of their customers.  It was not until the invention of chemically-produced inks and writing fluids in the latter half of the 20th century that iron gall ink fell from common use.\n\n== Wane ==\nThe permanence and water-resistance of the iron and gall-nut formula made it the standard writing ink in Europe for over 1,400 years, and in America after European colonisation. Its use and production started to decline only in the 20th century, when other waterproof formulas (better suited for writing on paper) became available.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Today, iron gall ink is manufactured by a small number of companies and used by fountain pen enthusiasts and artists, but has fewer administrative applications.\n\n== Fountain pens ==\n[[File:Lamy Fountain pen writing samples.jpg|thumb|Fountain pen writing samples written with blue-black Ecclesiastical Stationery Supplies Registrars Ink iron gall\u2013based ink used in the United Kingdom for official documents]]\n[[File:Nachf\u00fclleisengallustinte Pelikan 0.5 Liter (G\u00fcnther Wagner).JPG|thumb|Iron gall ink for fountain pens, refill bottle, 0.5 litre, ''circa'' 1950s with storage container]]\n[[File:Heiratsurkunde aus dem Jahre 1952.JPG|thumb|German marriage certificate issued on 6 December 1952 in [[Landshut]] signed with iron gall ink by the civil registry servant]]\n\nTraditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens are not suitable for [[fountain pen]]s which operate on the principle of [[capillary action]]. Ferro-gallic deposit accumulation in the feed system can clog the small ink passages in fountain pen feeds. Further, very acidic traditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens can corrode metal pen parts (a phenomenon known as [[redox|redox reaction]]/[[corrosion|flash corrosion]]). These phenomena can destroy the functionality of fountain pens.\n\nInstead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for fountain pens, such as blue-black bottled inks by [[Lamy]] (discontinued in 2012), [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] (discontinued in 2012), Chesterfield Archival Vault (discontinued in 2016), Diamine Registrar's Ink, Ecclesiastical Stationery Supplies Registrars Ink, Hero 232, and Organics Studios Aristotle Iron Gall.<ref>[https://gdoc.pub/doc/1po8jfMHv-Uz_ioZ9-2DQzASb1FNs-RSfmkkR4GaZ23g#heading=h.vydniszftb1n LIST OF IRON-GALL-BASED FOUNTAIN PEN INKS, compiled by T.

Medeiros]</ref>\n\nThese modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro-gallic compounds and are also more likely to have a formulation which is [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometrically]] optimised. Historical inks often contained excess acid which was not consumed in the oxidation of the ferro-gallic compounds. Modern formulations also tend to use [[hydrochloric acid]] whereas many historical inks used [[sulfuric acid]]. Hydrochloric acid is a gas in solution, which will evaporate. As a result, modern fountain pen iron gall inks are less likely to damage paper than historical inks and are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still cause problems if left in a pen for a long period. Manufacturers or retailers of modern iron gall inks intended for fountain pens sometimes advise a more thorough than usual cleaning regimen \u2013 which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water \u2013 to avoid clogging or corrosion on delicate pen parts. For more thoroughly cleaning iron gall ink out of a fountain pen, sequential flushes of the pen with water, diluted vinegar or citric acid (to flush out residual iron gall compounds), water, diluted ammonia (if needed to flush out residual colour dye stains), then finally water are often recommended.\n\nThe colour [[dye]] in these modern iron gall formulas functions as a temporary colourant to make these inks clearly visible whilst writing. The ferro-gallic compounds through a gradual oxidation process cause an observable gradual colour change to grey/black whilst these inks completely dry and makes the writing waterproof. The colour-changing property of the ink also depends on the [[paper chemicals|properties]] of the used paper. In general, the darkening process will progress more quickly and visibly on papers containing relatively high [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching agent residues]].\n\nThough not in mainstream 21st-century use like dye-based [[fountain pen ink]]s, modern iron gall inks are still used in fountain pens where permanence is required. In the United Kingdom the use of special blue-black archival quality Registrars' Ink containing ferro-gallic compounds is required in [[register office]]s for official documents such as [[birth certificate]]s, [[marriage certificate]]s, [[death certificate]]s and on clergy rolls and ships' [[logbook]]s.<ref>[http://www.registrarsink.co.uk/about.html Registrars' Ink]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog11b.shtml Henry 'Inky' Stephens \u2013 the inventor of blue-black ink (Stephens Blue-Black Registrar's Ink) at BBC Radio 4]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408482/APsGuideFebruary15final.pdf A Guide for Authorised Persons, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2012, Last Updated: February 2015, Registration stock, 1.18, Page 5]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408375/GuidebookClergyFeb15final.pdf Guidebook for The Clergy, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2011, Last Updated: February 2015, Ink, 1.9, Page 7]</ref><br>\nIn Germany the use of special blue or black ''urkunden- oder dokumentenechte Tinte'' or documentary use permanent inks is required in ''notariellen Urkunden'' ([[Civil law notary]] [[legal instrument]]s).<ref>[http://www.bnotk.de/Notar/Berufsrecht/DONot.php Dienstordnung f\u00fcr Notarinnen und Notare (DONot), Abschnitt Herstellung der notariellen Urkunden \u00a7 29 {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n\n=== German regulation for ''Urkundentinte'' inks (1933) ===\n* In a litre of ink there must be at least 27&nbsp;g of tannic acid and gallic acid, and at least 4&nbsp;g of iron content.

Her work includes photography of the Orkney, [[Shetland]], and [[Faroe Islands]].\n\n== Personal Life ==\nGunnie Morberg was born in [[Gothenburg]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new biographical dictionary of Scottish women|publisher=|others=Ewan, Elizabeth|year=|isbn=978-1-4744-3629-8|location=Edinburgh|pages=322|oclc=1057237368}}</ref>. Her father \u00c5ke Moberg was an accountant and her mother Margot Lundblad was an amateur painter. Gunnie left school at the age at the age of 16 in order to pursue artistic photography. \n\nShe began by working at a photographer's studio in Gothenburg but moved to Edinburgh, Scotland a year later. In Edinburgh, she worked as an au pair and studied pottery at the [[Edinburgh College of Art]], where she met Californian artist [[Tam MacPhail]]. They married in January 1961<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12448550.gunnie-moberg/|title=Gunnie Moberg|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> and had four sons. They initially settled in Argyll but later on, moved to Orkney in 1976<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/collection-artist/tam-macphail/|title=Tam MacPhail \u2013 Collection Database|website=Kettle's Yard|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>, after Gunnie Moberg's visit in 1975. \n\nHer husband ran a bookshop in [[Stromness]] called 'Stromness Books & Prints', which published her first photography book in 1979. Between 1977 and 1979, the [[St Magnus Festival]] and the [[Pier Arts Centre]] were established. The St Magnus Festival appointed her photographer in residence, a role that she held for nearly thirty years.\n\nHer popularity as a photographer grew through the years, but she turned to paint in her later years. She passed away at the age of 66 in Stromness.\n\n== Artistic Work ==\nMorberg's first publication was ''[[Stone Built]]'' in 1979. In this book, the photographer collected 18 aerial pictures she took across Orkney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunniemobergarchive.wordpress.com/publications/stone-built/|title=Stone Built|date=2014-07-17|website=The Gunnie Moberg Archive|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>. She subsequently published a number of photographic books, her main subject being the landscapes of the North Atlantic.\n\nIn 1986 Moberg started a collaboration with the poet [[George Mackay Brown]]. Together, they published five books in which Moberg's photographs interweaved with George Mackay Brown's poetry. She also collaborated with the Norwegian author [[Liv Kj\u00f8rsvik Schei]].

Her work includes photography of the Orkney, [[Shetland]], and [[Faroe Islands]].\n\n== Personal Life ==\nGunnie Morberg was born in [[Gothenburg]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new biographical dictionary of Scottish women|publisher=|others=Ewan, Elizabeth|year=|isbn=978-1-4744-3629-8|location=Edinburgh|pages=322|oclc=1057237368}}</ref>. Her father \u00c5ke Moberg was an accountant and her mother Margot Lundblad was an amateur painter. Gunnie's desire to develop photographic skills caused her to leave school at the age of 16. \n\nShe started working at a photographer's studio but moved to Edinburgh a year later. In Edinburgh, she worked as an au pair and studied pottery at the [[Edinburgh College of Art]], where she met Californian artist [[Tam MacPhail]]. They married in January 1961<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12448550.gunnie-moberg/|title=Gunnie Moberg|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> and had four sons. They initially settled in Argyll but later on, moved to Orkney in 1976<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/collection-artist/tam-macphail/|title=Tam MacPhail \u2013 Collection Database|website=Kettle's Yard|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>, after Gunnie Moberg's visit in 1975. \n\nHer husband ran a bookshop in [[Stromness]] called 'Stromness Books & Prints', which published her first photography book in 1979. Between 1977 and 1979, the [[St Magnus Festival]] and the [[Pier Arts Centre]] were established. The St Magnus Festival appointed her photographer in residence, a role that she held for nearly thirty years.\n\nHer popularity as a photographer grew through the years, but she turned to paint in her later years. She passed away at the age of 66 in Stromness.\n\n== Artistic Work ==\nMorberg's first publication was ''[[Stone Built]]'' in 1979. In this book, the photographer collected 18 aerial pictures she took across Orkney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunniemobergarchive.wordpress.com/publications/stone-built/|title=Stone Built|date=2014-07-17|website=The Gunnie Moberg Archive|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>. She subsequently published a number of photographic books, her main subject being the landscapes of the North Atlantic.\n\nIn 1986 Moberg started a collaboration with the poet [[George Mackay Brown]]. Together, they published five books in which Moberg's photographs interweaved with George Mackay Brown's poetry. She also collaborated with the Norwegian author [[Liv Kj\u00f8rsvik Schei]]. This collaboration gave birth to ''The Orkney Story'' (1985) and ''The Shetland Story'' (1988).\n\n== Publications ==\n* 1979: ''Stone Built''. Stormness Books & Prints\n* 1985: ''The Orkney Story''.

Some agricultural [[byproduct]]s fed to animals may be considered unsavory by human consumers.\n\n==Common plants specifically grown for fodder==\n[[File:Round hay bale at dawn02.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Round [[hay]] bales]]\n[[File:Newton of Cawdor stack of bales - geograph.org.uk - 545290.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Newton of Cawdor stack of bales, sweet-smelling fodder stored for winter]]\n[[File:African boy transporting fodder by bicycle edit.jpg|thumb|250px|Cut green fodder being transported to cattle in [[Tanzania]]]]\n\n* [[Alfalfa]] (lucerne)\n* [[Barley]]\n* [[Lemna minor|Common duckweed]]<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330586208_Valorization_of_agricultural_wastewater_streams_into_an_alternative_protein_source_duckweed Valorization of agricultural wastewater streams into an alternative protein source duckweed.]</ref>\n* [[Birdsfoot trefoil]]\n* ''[[Brassica]]'' spp.\n** [[Kale]]\n** [[Rapeseed]] (canola)\n** [[Rutabaga]] (swede)\n** [[Turnip]]\n* [[Clover]]\n** [[Trifolium hybridum|Alsike clover]]\n** [[Red clover]]\n** [[Subterranean clover]]\n** [[White clover]]\n* [[Grass]]\n** [[Bermuda grass]]\n** [[Bromus|Brome]]\n** [[Arrhenatherum|False oat grass]]\n** [[Festuca|Fescue]]\n** [[Danthonia|Heath grass]]\n** [[Meadow]] grasses (from naturally mixed grassland swards)\n** [[Orchard grass]]\n** [[Ryegrass]]\n** [[Timothy-grass]]\n* Corn ([[maize]])\n* [[Millet]]\n* [[Oat]]s\n* [[Sorghum]]\n* [[Soybean]]s\n* [[Tree]]s ([[pollarding|pollard]] tree shoots for \"tree-hay\")\n* [[Wheat]]\n\n==Types of fodder==\n\n* [[Biochar#Stock_fodder|Biochar]] for cattle<ref name=\"abc.net.au-2019-10-18-beetles-charcoal\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2019-10-18/wa-farmer-uses-beetles-and-charcoal-to-combat-climate-change/11613846\n | title =Poo-eating beetles and charcoal used by WA farmer to combat climate change\n | last =Daly\n | first =Jon\n | date =18 October 2019\n | website =ABC.net.au\n | publisher =Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n | quote =Mr Pow said his innovative farming system could help livestock producers become more profitable while helping to address the impact of climate change. }}</ref>\n* [[Bran]]\n* Conserved forage plants: [[hay]] and [[silage]]\n* [[Compound feed]] and [[premixes]], often called pellets, nuts or (cattle) cake\n* Crop residues: [[stover]], [[copra]], [[straw]], [[chaff]], [[sugar beet]] waste\n* [[Fish meal]]\n* Freshly cut [[grass]] and other forage plants\n* Grass/lawn clipping waste<ref>{{cite book |title=All Flesh Is Grass |last=Logsdon |first=Gene |publisher=Swallow Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8040-1069-2 |location=Ohio University |at=Chapter 20}}</ref>\n* Green [[maize]] \n* Green [[sorghum]] * [[Horse gram]] \n* Leaves from certain species of trees <ref>{{cite web |url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Outputs/Forestry/DFID_impact_case_study_Fodder_trees_FINAL%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927051732/http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Outputs/Forestry/DFID_impact_case_study_Fodder_trees_FINAL%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-27 }}</ref>\n* [[Meat and bone meal]] (now illegal in cattle and sheep feeds in many areas due to risk of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]])\n* [[Molasses]]\n* Native green grass \n* Oilseed press cake ([[cottonseed]], [[safflower]], [[sunflower]], [[soybean]], [[peanut|peanut or groundnut]])\n* [[Oligosaccharide]]s\n* [[Insects as feed|Processed insects]] (i.e. processed [[Maggot farming|maggots]]<ref>[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/food-of-larvae AgriProtein using food and abattoir waste to farm maggots]</ref>)\n* [[Seaweed]]\n* [[Seed]]s and [[grain]]s, either whole or prepared by crushing, milling, etc.\n* [[Single cell protein]]<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3292921 Single cell protein as food and feed.]</ref>([[Solein|can also be made from atmospheric CO2]])\n* Sprouted grains and legumes\n* [[Yeast extract]] (brewer's yeast residue)\n\n==Health concerns==\nIn the past, [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE or \"mad cow disease\") spread through the inclusion of ruminant [[meat and bone meal]] in [[cattle]] feed due to [[prion]] contamination.

The centerpiece of the device was a Sol\u2013Gel Faraday rotor, consisting in several rods of a dispersion of [[Austenite|\u03b3]]-[[Iron(III) oxide|Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]] [[Nanoparticle|nanoparticles]] (less than 15 nm in size) suspended in an amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] lattice. These rods were stacked inside a [[Polarimetry|polarimetric]] dome (itself being composed of several layers of [[Polarizer|polarizers]]) responsible of directing light beams produced by a [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] towards the rods longitudinally. When the light propagated inside the rods along their axis, the magnetic field created by the austenite nanoparticles would interact with it causing the rotation of the polarizers. This rotation would be perceived as change in the intensity of the light measured by four [[Photodiode|photodiodes]] allocated new to the exiting end of each rod. The data collected by the photodetectors would then be processed in the OBDH which was capable of providing accurate readings (up to 10 [[Tesla (unit)|nT]]) on both the satellite's attitude and the value of the geomagnetic field.\n\nThe usage of the silica / \u03b3-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite was driven by the search of a material capable of providing good mechanical properties with a high degree of [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], high [[Verdet constant]] and [[superparamagnetism]] in order to avoid remnant [[magnetism]] and facilitate measuring the intensity of the light.\n\nIn addition, it contained several coils designed to compensate possible variations of Verdet constant due to changes in temperature or [[wavelength]] inside the sensor. And a stabilized power source for the LED. Both subsystems were also used when calibrating the sensor midflight. The device had a diameter of 20 mm and less than 5 mm in thickness with a total weight of 200 g with less than 2 W of power consumption. \n\nIts conception was the result of more than 7 years of joint research between the ''Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid'' (ICMM subdivision of the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) and INTA.

The latter was archived by measuring voltage (0-10 V) induced in the cells as it was directly proportional to the sunlight incidence. The cells were strategically allocated in two groups of three along the outermost edges and the signals contrasted to give a precise location for the Sun (up to 5\u00ba of [[nutation]] angle error).\n\nSince both types of cell shared the same [[input/output]] channels, they could not be operated simultaneously, however, an automated conditioning system ensured the best cells were selected at any given time.\n\n=== Optical Wireless Links for intra-Satellite===\n[[File:Photodiode-closeup.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a photodiode.]]\nRefereed to as OWLS, the internal communication system was developed in conjunction with ESA to test the possibilities of diffuse infrared communications and BER (Bit Error Rate) monitoring in spacial applications.

The latter was archived by measuring voltage (0-10 V) induced in the cells as it was directly proportional to the sunlight incidence. The cells were strategically allocated in two groups of three along the outermost edges and the signals contrasted to give a precise location for the Sun (up to 5\u00ba of [[nutation]] angle error).\n\nSince both types of cell shared the same [[input/output]] channels, they could not be operated simultaneously, however, an automated conditioning system ensured the best cells were selected at any given time.\n\n=== Optical Wireless Links for intra-Satellite===\n[[File:Photodiode-closeup.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a photodiode.]]\nRefereed to as OWLS, the internal communication system was developed in conjunction with ESA to test the possibilities of diffuse infrared communications and BER (Bit Error Rate) monitoring in spacial applications.

It combined infrared communication with a redundant wire connection in order to compare results when the readings were computed by the processing unit allowing, in addition to asses the performance of the OWLS, to measure the occurrence of SETs (Single Event Transients), that's to say momentary glitches in the output voltage of a circuit caused by ions passing through sensitive nodes in the circuit, in the optical detectors due to incidence protons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050210087.pdf|title=Single Event Transients in Linear Integrated Circuits|last=Buchner, Stephen & McMorrow, Dale|first=|date=2005|website=NASA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe wireless linking system was constructed  in a [[Wavelength-division multiple access|WDMA (Wavelength Division Multiple Access)]] architecture.With the receiving photodiode offering a sensitivity value of 700 nW/cm<sup>2</sup> with a sensing area of 25 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 1.5 MHz bandwidth.

Its size was determined by the signal value. An additional line was added to simulate a zero on the sensor, thus giving, by comparison, the number an nature of the pulses resulted from undesired SETs interacting with the system.

To archive this, pulses of data were sent from optical emitters towards the inner walls of the satellite, and the diffused light collected by a receiver. When the transmission was over, the OBC compared the data received to the calculations of the BER.\n\nThe whole experiment was carried in a separated [[Frequency-division multiple access|FDMA (Frequency-Division Multiple-Access)]] capable channel (4 MHz), equipped with [[Amplitude-shift keying|ASK]]. It was also possible to control from ground and, to a certain extend, filter interferes in the data rate of 100 and 100 kbits/s.\n== See also ==\n\n* \n\n* [[Nanosat-1B]]\n* [[Communications satellite]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />{{Space program of Spain}}{{Orbital launches in 2004}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2004]]\n[[Category:Satellites of Spain]]\n[[Category:Communications satellites in low Earth orbit]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by Ariane rockets]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosat_01"}

Transportation to The United States of America was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called ''hulks'' as places of temporary confinement.<ref>DouglasHay,  \"Crime and justice in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century England.\" ''Crime and Justice'' 2 (1980): 45-84.</ref><ref>Phillip Thurmond Smith,  ''Policing Victorian London: political policing, public order, and the London Metropolitan Police'' (1985).</ref>\n\nThe most notable reformer was [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published ''The State of the Prisons'' in 1777.<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}\n</ref> He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], takes its name from John Howard.\n\nThe [[Penitentiary Act]] which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.<ref>Simon Devereaux, \"The making of the Penitentiary Act, 1775\u20131779.\" ''Historical Journal'' 42.2 (1999): 405-433.</ref>\n\n===Early 19th century===\nQuakers such as [[Elizabeth Fry]] continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did [[Charles Dickens]] in his novels ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' and ''[[Little Dorrit (novel)|Little Dorrit]]'' about the [[Marshalsea]].<ref>Robert Alan Cooper, \"Jeremy Bentham, Elizabeth Fry, and English Prison Reform.\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 42.4 (1981): 675-690.</ref> [[Samuel Romilly]] managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the [[Panopticon]] for the design of prisons and the use of the [[treadwheel]] as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=97}}</ref> Robert Peel's [[Gaols Act 1823]] attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the [[Prison Act 1877]].\n\nThe American [[separate system]] attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1816 and [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville prison]] in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and [[Joshua Jebb]] set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year.<ref>Eric Stockdale, \"The Rise of Joshua Jebb, 1837-1850.\" ''British Journal of Criminology'' 16 (1976): 164+.</ref>\n\n===1860-1914 ===\nThe main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel [[Edmund Frederick du Cane]], was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1952|p=46}}</ref> In 1877 he encouraged [[Disraeli]]'s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=153}}</ref> By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.\n\nThe British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The [[Prison Act 1898]] enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The [[Probation of Offenders Act 1907]] introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for the transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir [[Evelyn Ruggles-Brise]]. the chair of the Prison Commission.<ref>R.C.K. Ensor. ''England 1870-1914'' (1937) pp 520-21.</ref><ref>J. W.

Biographer [[Paul Addison]] says. \"More than any other Home Secretary of the 20th century, Churchill was the prisoner's friend. He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh.\u201d He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, especially those imprisoned for their delay in paying fines, or for debts.

He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called ''[[Borstal]]'' after the village in [[Kent]] which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when [[Alexander Paterson (penologist)|Alexander Paterson]] became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the [[Public school (UK)|English Public school]]: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a ''[[housemaster]]''. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the Second World War when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself.  Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including [[open prison]]s and housemasters, renamed ''assistant governors'' and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=157\u2013161}}</ref>\n\n===Recent===\nEarly in 2004, it was announced that the Prison Service would be integrated into a new [[National Offender Management Service]] later in the year.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n{{as of|2008}}, rationalisation of the prison management system is underway with the advent of the [[Titan Prison]] concept.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nSix new reform prisons are to be built with prison governors in charge of operation and budget.

Below these were the ranks of principal officer (rank badge{{snd}}two [[Bath star]]s) and senior officer (rank badge{{snd}}single Bath star). However, as a reorganisation in the 1980s, termed \"A Fresh Start\", saw these chief officer ranks abolished, and their role taken by junior grade [[prison governor]]s.\n\nFrom 2000 onwards, as part of a process to increase accountability within the prison service, all operational officers have been assigned a 3-digit unique identification number, worn on all items of uniform (typically as an embroidered [[epaulette]]) along with the 2-digit LIDS identification code of the specific prison or institution. From 2010 onwards, attempts were made to replace the principal officer rank with non-uniformed junior managers (developing prison service managers - DPSM), although this process was neither entirely successful nor fully implemented. Further restructuring in 2013, known as \"Fair & Sustainable\", saw the remaining historic ranks and rank insignia phased out in favour of a new structure, and simple stripes on uniform epaulettes to indicate grades.\n\n===Uniforms===\nPrison officers wear a white shirt and black tie, black trousers, black boots, black 'woolly-pully' jumper or black soft shell fleece-jacket.<ref>https://prisonandprobationjobs.gov.uk/prison-officer/life-as-a-prison-officer/</ref> Stab vests may be worn.

Each such team is, in many instances, led by a supervising officer. There will be an overall manager of the wing with the title of custodial manager. Custodial managers will have direct management of the wing and the line management of the officers and supervising officers\n\n{{UK Prison Service rank insignia}}\n\n===Specialist roles===\nIn addition to uniformed officers carrying out security and custodial roles, a number of specialist functions exist within every prison. Some are assigned to uniformed specialist officers, while others are carried out by non-uniformed support staff.\n\nBefore the \"Fresh Start\" initiative there were more uniformed specialist officer roles, including dog handlers, works officers, hospital officers, catering officers, physical education officers, and officer instructors. Today the uniformed Specialist Officer roles include dog handlers (DH), works officers (W), and healthcare officers (H) who are the successors of the former hospital officers. The roles of the former catering officers, PE officers, and officer instructors are today taken by non-uniformed caterers, PE instructors, and educational/vocational instructors.<ref name=\"working\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-prison-service/about/recruitment#catering-building-and-allied-trades|title=Working for HMPS|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> Other key non-uniformed roles within the staff of a prison include chaplains, psychologists, and administrators.<ref name=\"working\"/>\n\n==Private prisons==\nThe Prison Service does not manage all prisons within England and Wales. Currently there are eleven  prisons that have been designed, constructed, managed and financed (so-called DCMF prisons) privately. In addition, three  prisons that were built with public money are managed by private companies under contract. During 2012 one further prison opened under private sector management: [[HMP Oakwood]] (Featherstone 2), built by the public sector. Private prisons are subject to scrutiny by [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons]] in a similar manner to prisons run by the public Prison Service.\n\n==Ban on industrial action==\nQuestions were raised about the POA's status in the 1990s. In 1994, a legal decision determined that it was illegal to induce prison officers to take industrial action - a law which had applied to police officers since 1919 - meaning that the POA could not call strike action amongst its members. New labour legislation introduced by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government in 1992 laid down that the POA could no longer be a trade union. This was reversed in the ''Criminal Justice and Public Order Act'' of 1994, but prison officers were still denied the right to take industrial action. This right was restored in 2004 to prison officers in the public sector in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], but not in [[Northern Ireland]] or to prison custody officers in the private sector.\n\nOn 29 August 2007, the POA started a 24-hour walkout of prisons, picketing establishments asking prison officers not to attend work for their shift. This was the first ever national strike action taken by the POA. The POA reported that 90% of its members (27,000) went on strike that day.\n\nIn January 2008, the [[Home Secretary]] announced that the government was to introduce legislation to remove the right for Prison Officers in [[England and Wales]] to take [[strike action]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7175503.stm |date=7 January 2008 |title=Ministers seek prison strike ban |work=BBC News|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> In November 2016, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] approved a Government request to stop industrial action taking place.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/15/uk-prison-officers-stage-protest-over-health-and-safety-fears |date=15 November 2016 |title=High court orders prison officers to end protest and go back to work |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2016|last1=Editor |first1=Alan Travis Home Affairs }}</ref> In July 2017 the Government won a High Court bid to obtain a permanent ban on industrial action by prison officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/government-wins-court-bid-to-ban-prison-officer-strikes-10953690|title=Government wins High Court bid to ban prison officer strikes|publisher=Sky UK}}</ref>\n\n==Independent Monitoring Board==\nEvery prison and immigration removal centre has an [[Independent Monitoring Board]] (IMB), formerly known as a ''Board of Visitors''.

The Service, Blunkett said, will be \"a new body to provide end-to-end management of all offenders\".\n\nOn 1 April 2008, NOMS was reorganised as part of a shake-up in the Ministry of Justice.  The headquarters and regional structures of NOMS and HMPS were merged into a single HQ structure with Phil Wheatly as Director General of NOMS.  This brings HMPS and the [[National Probation Service]] under a single headquarters structure for the first time ever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/noms-agency-framework.htm |title=National Offender Management Service |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 2011, NOMS was merged with the wider MoJ (HMCTS etc.) to form one organisation. Although HMCTS and NOMS are working under different terms and conditions, they are now managed together and HR is dealt with by one Shared Service centre. A review of terms and conditions for all MoJ staff, including NOMS, is currently in progress with view to bringing all staff terms and conditions across NOMS and HMCTS in line.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|England|Wales}}\nHer Majesty's prison service collection is held at the [[Galleries of Justice Museum]] in Nottingham.\n\n* [[HM Prison]]\n* [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons]]\n* [[Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution]]\n* [[List of United Kingdom prisons]]\n* [[Northern Ireland Prison Service]]\n* [[OASys]]\n* [[Prison Reform Trust]]\n* [[Prison categories (UK)|Prison categories in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Scottish Prison Service]]\n* [[Temporary licence]]\n* [[United Kingdom prison population]]\n* [[Young offender]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmps/index.htm HM Prison Service]\u2014[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-prison-service Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040115043812/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/n_story.asp?item_id=756 Press release from Home Office about re-organisation]\n* [http://www.birminghamprisonofficer.posterous.com Prison Officer blog]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160106115756/http://www.higherlearningatwork.org/portfolio/from-skills-for-life-to-higher-learning Prison Officer learning program]\n\n{{UK home nations law enforcement agencies (non-police)}}\n{{Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)}}\n{{Prisons in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Law enforcement agencies of England and Wales]]\n[[Category:Penal system in England| ]]\n[[Category:Prison and correctional agencies]]\n[[Category:Penal system in Wales| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Clive House - 70 Petty France, London, SW1H 9EX.JPG|thumb|Clive House, the current head office of HM Prison Service, the same building as [[HM Prison and Probation Service]].]]\n[[File:Cleland House.jpg|thumb|Cleland House (now demolished), the former head office of HM Prison Service]]\n'''Her Majesty's Prison Service''' (HMPS) is a part of [[Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service]] (formerly the National Offender Management Service), which is the part of [[Her Majesty's Government]] charged with managing most of the [[prison]]s within [[England and Wales]].

Transportation to The United States of America was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called ''hulks'' as places of temporary confinement.<ref>DouglasHay,  \"Crime and justice in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century England.\" ''Crime and Justice'' 2 (1980): 45-84.</ref><ref>Phillip Thurmond Smith,  ''Policing Victorian London: political policing, public order, and the London Metropolitan Police'' (1985).</ref>\n\nThe most notable reformer was [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published ''The State of the Prisons'' in 1777.<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}\n</ref> He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], takes its name from John Howard.\n\nThe [[Penitentiary Act]] which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.<ref>Simon Devereaux, \"The making of the Penitentiary Act, 1775\u20131779.\" ''Historical Journal'' 42.2 (1999): 405-433.</ref>\n\n===Early 19th century===\nQuakers such as [[Elizabeth Fry]] continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did [[Charles Dickens]] in his novels ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' and ''[[Little Dorrit (novel)|Little Dorrit]]'' about the [[Marshalsea]].<ref>Robert Alan Cooper, \"Jeremy Bentham, Elizabeth Fry, and English Prison Reform.\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 42.4 (1981): 675-690.</ref> [[Samuel Romilly]] managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the [[Panopticon]] for the design of prisons and the use of the [[treadwheel]] as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=97}}</ref> Robert Peel's [[Gaols Act 1823]] attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the [[Prison Act 1877]].\n\nThe American [[separate system]] attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1816 and [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville prison]] in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and [[Joshua Jebb]] set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year.<ref>Eric Stockdale, \"The Rise of Joshua Jebb, 1837-1850.\" ''British Journal of Criminology'' 16 (1976): 164+.</ref>\n\n===1860-1914 ===\nThe main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel [[Edmund Frederick du Cane]], was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1952|p=46}}</ref> In 1877 he encouraged [[Disraeli]]'s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895.

The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The [[Prison Act 1898]] enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The [[Probation of Offenders Act 1907]] introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for the transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir [[Evelyn Ruggles-Brise]]. the chair of the Prison Commission.<ref>R.C.K. Ensor. ''England 1870-1914'' (1937) pp 520-21.</ref><ref>J. W.

He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh.\u201d He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, especially those imprisoned for their delay in paying fines, or for debts.

He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called ''[[Borstal]]'' after the village in [[Kent]] which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when [[Alexander Paterson (penologist)|Alexander Paterson]] became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the [[Public school (UK)|English Public school]]: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a ''[[housemaster]]''. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the Second World War when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself.  Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including [[open prison]]s and housemasters, renamed ''assistant governors'' and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=157\u2013161}}</ref>\n\n===Recent===\nEarly in 2004, it was announced that the Prison Service would be integrated into a new [[National Offender Management Service]] later in the year.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n{{as of|2008}}, rationalisation of the prison management system is underway with the advent of the [[Titan Prison]] concept.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nSix new reform prisons are to be built with prison governors in charge of operation and budget.

A 2015 announcement from the government agreed that old prisons are more expensive to run and often unsuitable in design, such as having \"dark corners which too often facilitate violence and drug-taking.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prison-building-revolution-announced-by-chancellor-and-justic e-secretary|title=Prison building revolution announced by Chancellor and Justice Secretary|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\n==Prison officers==\n===Recent development===\nHistorically, uniformed prison staff were under the supervision of a small number of very senior and experienced officers who held one of three chief officer ranks. Below these were the ranks of principal officer (rank badge{{snd}}two [[Bath star]]s) and senior officer (rank badge{{snd}}single Bath star). However, as a reorganisation in the 1980s, termed \"A Fresh Start\", saw these chief officer ranks abolished, and their role taken by junior grade [[prison governor]]s.\n\nFrom 2000 onwards, as part of a process to increase accountability within the prison service, all operational officers have been assigned a 3-digit unique identification number, worn on all items of uniform (typically as an embroidered [[epaulette]]) along with the 2-digit LIDS identification code of the specific prison or institution. From 2010 onwards, attempts were made to replace the principal officer rank with non-uniformed junior managers (developing prison service managers - DPSM), although this process was neither entirely successful nor fully implemented. Further restructuring in 2013, known as \"Fair & Sustainable\", saw the remaining historic ranks and rank insignia phased out in favour of a new structure, and simple stripes on uniform epaulettes to indicate grades.\n\n===Uniforms===\nPrison officers wear a white shirt and black tie, black trousers, black boots, black 'woolly-pully' jumper or black soft shell fleece-jacket.<ref>https://prisonandprobationjobs.gov.uk/prison-officer/life-as-a-prison-officer/</ref> Stab vests may be worn. Prison Officers working in the Juvenile or Immigration Detention estate wear a \u2018soft uniform\u2019 consisting of a polo shirt opposed to white shirt with black tie.<ref>https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2013/05/31/07/april.jpg</ref>\nFor formal occasions, a dark tunic with whistle chain is worn with a peaked cap and tie for men and bowler cap and open collar for women. Black gloves and shoes are worn, as are any medal ribbons and medals that have been awarded.<ref>https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=420x1024:format=jpg/path/s19c3ceecf7274a06/image/i63c68878f1358346/version/1444918502/image.jpg</ref><ref>https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=460x1024:format=jpg/path/s19c3ceecf7274a06/image/i4c81f4fb5022e987/version/1448211233/image.jpg</ref> Rank is worn on epaulettes and on the shoulders of uniforms.\n\n===Powers and structure===\nPublic sector prison officers (historically known as warders) have \"all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of a [[constable]]\" whilst acting as such.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/52/section/8 |title=Prison Act 1952 (Section 8) |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |year=2015 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the system is flexible in operation, most prison officers work in small teams, either assigned to a specific duty, or providing one shift of staff for the supervision of a particular [[Wing (building)|wing]] within a prison. Each such team is, in many instances, led by a supervising officer. There will be an overall manager of the wing with the title of custodial manager. Custodial managers will have direct management of the wing and the line management of the officers and supervising officers\n\n{{UK Prison Service rank insignia}}\n\n===Specialist roles===\nIn addition to uniformed officers carrying out security and custodial roles, a number of specialist functions exist within every prison. Some are assigned to uniformed specialist officers, while others are carried out by non-uniformed support staff.\n\nBefore the \"Fresh Start\" initiative there were more uniformed specialist officer roles, including dog handlers, works officers, hospital officers, catering officers, physical education officers, and officer instructors. Today the uniformed Specialist Officer roles include dog handlers (DH), works officers (W), and healthcare officers (H) who are the successors of the former hospital officers. The roles of the former catering officers, PE officers, and officer instructors are today taken by non-uniformed caterers, PE instructors, and educational/vocational instructors.<ref name=\"working\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-prison-service/about/recruitment#catering-building-and-allied-trades|title=Working for HMPS|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> Other key non-uniformed roles within the staff of a prison include chaplains, psychologists, and administrators.<ref name=\"working\"/>\n\n==Private prisons==\nThe Prison Service does not manage all prisons within England and Wales. Currently there are eleven  prisons that have been designed, constructed, managed and financed (so-called DCMF prisons) privately. In addition, three  prisons that were built with public money are managed by private companies under contract. During 2012 one further prison opened under private sector management: [[HMP Oakwood]] (Featherstone 2), built by the public sector. Private prisons are subject to scrutiny by [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons]] in a similar manner to prisons run by the public Prison Service.\n\n==Ban on industrial action==\nQuestions were raised about the POA's status in the 1990s. In 1994, a legal decision determined that it was illegal to induce prison officers to take industrial action - a law which had applied to police officers since 1919 - meaning that the POA could not call strike action amongst its members. New labour legislation introduced by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government in 1992 laid down that the POA could no longer be a trade union. This was reversed in the ''Criminal Justice and Public Order Act'' of 1994, but prison officers were still denied the right to take industrial action. This right was restored in 2004 to prison officers in the public sector in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], but not in [[Northern Ireland]] or to prison custody officers in the private sector.\n\nOn 29 August 2007, the POA started a 24-hour walkout of prisons, picketing establishments asking prison officers not to attend work for their shift. This was the first ever national strike action taken by the POA. The POA reported that 90% of its members (27,000) went on strike that day.\n\nIn January 2008, the [[Home Secretary]] announced that the government was to introduce legislation to remove the right for Prison Officers in [[England and Wales]] to take [[strike action]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7175503.stm |date=7 January 2008 |title=Ministers seek prison strike ban |work=BBC News|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> In November 2016, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] approved a Government request to stop industrial action taking place.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/15/uk-prison-officers-stage-protest-over-health-and-safety-fears |date=15 November 2016 |title=High court orders prison officers to end protest and go back to work |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2016|last1=Editor |first1=Alan Travis Home Affairs }}</ref> In July 2017 the Government won a High Court bid to obtain a permanent ban on industrial action by prison officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/government-wins-court-bid-to-ban-prison-officer-strikes-10953690|title=Government wins High Court bid to ban prison officer strikes|publisher=Sky UK}}</ref>\n\n==Independent Monitoring Board==\nEvery prison and immigration removal centre has an [[Independent Monitoring Board]] (IMB), formerly known as a ''Board of Visitors''. Members of the IMB, who are volunteers, are appointed by the Home Secretary and act as 'watchdogs' for both the Minister of Prisons and the general public, to ensure that proper standards of care and decency are maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.imb.org.uk/ |title=Independent Monitoring Boards |work=imb.org.uk |year=2015 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> An analysis of the reporting of IMBs found that while there may be some problems with their training and undertaking of duties, their monitoring and surveillance of the detention estate can be more than symbolic and may further the humane and just treatment of the state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A.|date=2017-02-01|title=Accountability and Oversight of State Functions|journal=SAGE Open|volume=7|issue=1|pages=215824401769079|doi=10.1177/2158244017690792|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==HMPS in the National Offender Management Service==\nOn 6 January 2004, then Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]] announced that the Prison Service, together with the [[National Probation Service]], is to be integrated into a new [[National Offender Management Service]].  The Service, Blunkett said, will be \"a new body to provide end-to-end management of all offenders\".\n\nOn 1 April 2008, NOMS was reorganised as part of a shake-up in the Ministry of Justice.  The headquarters and regional structures of NOMS and HMPS were merged into a single HQ structure with Phil Wheatly as Director General of NOMS.  This brings HMPS and the [[National Probation Service]] under a single headquarters structure for the first time ever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/noms-agency-framework.htm |title=National Offender Management Service |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 2011, NOMS was merged with the wider MoJ (HMCTS etc.) to form one organisation. Although HMCTS and NOMS are working under different terms and conditions, they are now managed together and HR is dealt with by one Shared Service centre. A review of terms and conditions for all MoJ staff, including NOMS, is currently in progress with view to bringing all staff terms and conditions across NOMS and HMCTS in line.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|England|Wales}}\nHer Majesty's prison service collection is held at the [[Galleries of Justice Museum]] in Nottingham.\n\n* [[HM Prison]]\n* [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons]]\n* [[Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution]]\n* [[List of United Kingdom prisons]]\n* [[Northern Ireland Prison Service]]\n* [[OASys]]\n* [[Prison Reform Trust]]\n* [[Prison categories (UK)|Prison categories in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Scottish Prison Service]]\n* [[Temporary licence]]\n* [[United Kingdom prison population]]\n* [[Young offender]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmps/index.htm HM Prison Service]\u2014[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-prison-service Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040115043812/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/n_story.asp?item_id=756 Press release from Home Office about re-organisation]\n* [http://www.birminghamprisonofficer.posterous.com Prison Officer blog]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160106115756/http://www.higherlearningatwork.org/portfolio/from-skills-for-life-to-higher-learning Prison Officer learning program]\n\n{{UK home nations law enforcement agencies (non-police)}}\n{{Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)}}\n{{Prisons in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Law enforcement agencies of England and Wales]]\n[[Category:Penal system in England| ]]\n[[Category:Prison and correctional agencies]]\n[[Category:Penal system in Wales| ]]\n", "name_user": "Itchy crackus", "label": "safe", "comment": "New prison", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Prison_Service"}

Donaldson]], the final book of the first trilogy of [[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]] series. It is followed by ''[[The Wounded Land]]'', which begins the second trilogy.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBack in his own \"real\" world, Thomas Covenant is devastated by the loss of Elena, though he still maintains to himself that his experience in the Land was all just a dream. Tormented by this unanswerable paradox, he neglects his physical condition; he stops taking his medications and fails to treat his head wound, allowing his dormant [[leprosy]] to once again become active.\n\nWandering in the woods outside of his home town, he comes upon a lost little girl suffering from a [[rattlesnake]] bite. At this point he is once again summoned to the Land, this time by the desperate High Lord Mhoram, who is in need of aid. Covenant finds that seven years have gone by since [[the Illearth War]], and Lord Foul is preparing for his final assault on the people of the Land. Foul has enslaved the tormented spirit of former High Lord Elena, who now wields the Staff of Law in the service of evil. The Lords have lost their most loyal defenders, the ageless Bloodguard, and the Land has been cast into a perpetual winter. Furthermore, Lord Foul has rebuilt his army, which, under the command of the third Giant-Raver Satansfist, now besieges the Lords' mountain-fortress of Revelstone. As a last resort, the Lords have decided to call upon Covenant, in the hope that he will be able to use the wild magic power of his white gold ring to repel the siege and save the Land from total destruction.\n\nCovenant, however, demands that Mhoram release the summons in order to allow him to save the girl's life in the \"real\" world. Mhoram assents. Covenant does manage to save the girl, but at the cost of being poisoned by the rattlesnake venom he has sucked out of her. In this state and with the knowledge that the girl is safe, he accepts another summoning.\n\nCovenant finds himself once again at Kevin's Watch, the place to which Lord Foul transported him at the time of his first summoning by Drool Rockworm. This time he has been brought to the Land by the joint efforts of Triock, jilted lover of Lena (whom Covenant raped on his first trip to the Land resulting in the birth of Elena) and the Giant Saltheart Foamfollower, his boon companion from the quest for the Staff of Law and one of the last two surviving Giants. Descending from the mountain and travelling east with Triock and Foamfollower in search of Lord Foul's demesne, Covenant is horrified to witness the depredations caused by Foul and his servants. South of the Plains of Ra, Covenant finds that his old bodyguard Bannor has joined with the Ramen in an attempt to protect the Ranyhyn, the intelligent, free horses who formerly served the Bloodguard as mounts. Covenant convinces the Ramen to take the Ranyhyn south to safety; Bannor, though no longer sustained by the power of his Vow, accompanies him on his journey east.\n<!-- [needs a lot more filled in right here] -->\nKidnapped by Ravers, Covenant confronts Elena and uses the power of his white gold ring to dismiss her ghost, although this results in the destruction of the Staff of Law. Bannor declines to follow Covenant further, although he accepts the metal heels of the Staff for safekeeping and eventual return to the Lords. Meanwhile Lord Mhoram, after a protracted battle, is able to break the siege of Revelstone and kill Satansfist.\n\nAfterwards, Covenant and Foamfollower journey to Ridjeck Thome, the very heart of Lord Foul's dominion, where they succeed in defeating Foul; this act also repairs much of the havoc caused by Elena's breaking of the Law of Death. Covenant, who has finally gained full comprehension of and control over the power of the wild magic, uses it to destroy the Illearth Stone: in the final cataclysm Foamfollower is killed and so, seemingly, is Covenant.\n\nHowever, his consciousness remains, and while in a state somewhere between being and non-existence, he is spoken to in the darkness by the voice of the old beggar from the beginning of the first book, who is in fact the [[creator deity|Creator]] of the Land. The Creator thanks Covenant for saving his creation and asks him what reward he might accept.

Donaldson]], the final book of the first trilogy of [[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]] series. It is followed by ''[[The Wounded Land]]'', which begins the second trilogy.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBack in his own \"real\" world, Thomas Covenant is devastated by the loss of Elena, though he still maintains to himself that his experience in the Land was all just a dream. Tormented by this unanswerable paradox, he neglects his physical condition; he stops taking his medications and fails to treat his head wound, allowing his dormant [[leprosy]] to once again become active.\n\nWandering in the woods outside of his home town, he comes upon a lost little girl suffering from a [[rattlesnake]] bite. At this point he is once again summoned to the Land, this time by the desperate High Lord Mhoram, who is in need of aid. Covenant finds that seven years have gone by since [[the Illearth War]], and Lord Foul is preparing for his final assault on the people of the Land. Foul has enslaved the tormented spirit of former High Lord Elena, who now wields the Staff of Law in the service of evil. The Lords have lost their most loyal defenders, the semi-immortal Bloodguard, and the Land has been cast into a perpetual winter. Furthermore, Lord Foul has rebuilt his army, which, under the command of the third Giant-Raver Satansfist, now besieges the Lords' mountain-fortress of Revelstone. As a last resort, the Lords have decided to call upon Covenant, in the hope that he will be able to use the wild magic power of his white gold ring to repel the siege and save the Land from total destruction.\n\nCovenant, however, demands that Mhoram release the summons in order to allow him to save the girl's life in the \"real\" world. Mhoram assents. Covenant does manage to save the girl, but at the cost of being poisoned by the rattlesnake venom he has sucked out of her. In this state and with the knowledge that the girl is safe, he accepts another summoning.\n\nCovenant finds himself once again at Kevin's Watch, the place to which Lord Foul transported him at the time of his first summoning by Drool Rockworm. This time he has been brought to the Land by the joint efforts of Triock, jilted lover of Lena (whom Covenant raped on his first trip to the Land resulting in the birth of Elena) and the Giant Saltheart Foamfollower, his boon companion from the quest for the Staff of Law and one of the last two surviving Giants. Descending from the mountain and travelling east with Triock and Foamfollower in search of Lord Foul's demesne, Covenant is horrified to witness the depredations caused by Foul and his servants. South of the Plains of Ra, Covenant finds that his old bodyguard Bannor has joined with the Ramen in an attempt to protect the Ranyhyn, the intelligent, free horses who formerly served the Bloodguard as mounts. Covenant convinces the Ramen to take the Ranyhyn south to safety; Bannor, though no longer sustained by the power of his Vow, accompanies him on his journey east.\n<!-- [needs a lot more filled in right here] -->\nKidnapped by Ravers, Covenant confronts Elena and uses the power of his white gold ring to dismiss her ghost, although this results in the destruction of the Staff of Law. Bannor declines to follow Covenant further, although he accepts the metal heels of the Staff for safekeeping and eventual return to the Lords. Meanwhile Lord Mhoram, after a protracted battle, is able to break the siege of Revelstone and kill Satansfist.\n\nAfterwards, Covenant and Foamfollower journey to Ridjeck Thome, the very heart of Lord Foul's dominion, where they succeed in defeating Foul; this act also repairs much of the havoc caused by Elena's breaking of the Law of Death. Covenant, who has finally gained full comprehension of and control over the power of the wild magic, uses it to destroy the Illearth Stone: in the final cataclysm Foamfollower is killed and so, seemingly, is Covenant.\n\nHowever, his consciousness remains, and while in a state somewhere between being and non-existence, he is spoken to in the darkness by the voice of the old beggar from the beginning of the first book, who is in fact the [[creator deity|Creator]] of the Land. The Creator thanks Covenant for saving his creation and asks him what reward he might accept. Excitedly, Covenant asks the Creator to save Foamfollower, but the Creator regretfully tells Covenant \"in a tone of ineffable rue\" that even he cannot undo something that has already occurred: otherwise the Arch of Time, the fundamental structure underlying the Land's universe, will be destroyed. The Creator explains that this restriction, in fact, is what prevented him from dealing with Foul directly: he had to act through a proxy, Covenant, and even after causing Covenant to be transported to the Land, the Creator did not interfere with Covenant's freedom of will in any way. The decision to \"save or damn\" the Land was Covenant's own.\n\nThe Creator then tells Covenant that he has a choice: either he can remain in the Land in full health, or he can be returned to life in his own world, where he otherwise would have died from an allergic reaction to the anti-venom treatment applied to his unconscious body. Covenant, still unwilling to fully accept the Land, chooses the latter and awakes in his hospital bed, weakened from his physical trauma, still afflicted with his disease, but happy to be alive, and secure in the knowledge that he had not failed the Land.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://theland.antgear.com/glossary.html Glossary of terms from the First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever]\n\n{{Stephen R.
