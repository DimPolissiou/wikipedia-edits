The pre-[[Reformation]] [[Diocese of Galloway]], held to have been founded by [[St Ninian]] in the fifth century, had broken allegiance with [[Rome]] in 1560, and disappeared in 1689. The territory of the modern diocese incorporates,  the local authority areas of [[Dumfries and Galloway]], [[South Ayrshire]], [[East Ayrshire]] and parts of [[North Ayrshire]], ([[The Cumbraes|Cumbrae]]). The bishop's [[cathedra]] is at [[Ayr Cathedral|St Margaret's Cathedral]], [[Ayr, Scotland|Ayr]].\n\nThe diocese was re-established by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 4 March 1878, with its cathedral in [[Dumfries]] and its territory covering the sparse and rural counties of [[Dumfriesshire]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], [[Wigtownshire]] and parts of [[Ayrshire]].  Following the reorganisation of the [[Archdiocese of Glasgow]] in 1947, parishes to the north of Galloway were transferred to it from Glasgow, creating a significant population centre for the first time around the town of Ayr. In response to this development Bishop McGee moved his residence from Dumfries to Ayr and, following a catastrophic fire at St Andrew's Cathedral in May 1962, it was decided that the [[Good Shepherd Cathedral, Ayr|Good Shepherd Church, Ayr]] should also become the diocesan cathedral.<ref>{{Cite

Lhasa, West Burma, Sikuleh, southwest Sumatra, West Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo broke off during the Late Triassic-Late Jurassic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalfe|1999|pp=15-16}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Carboniferous and Permian, Baltica first collided with Kazakhstania and Siberia, then North China with Mongolia and Siberia. By the middle Carboniferous, however, South China had already been in contact with North China long enough to allow floral exchange between the two continents. The Cimmerian blocks rifted from Gondwana in the Late Carboniferous.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\nIn the early Permian, the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened behind the Cimmerian terranes (Sibumasu, Qiantang, Lhasa) and, in the late Carboniferous, the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean closed in front. The eastern branch of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, however, remained opened while Siberia was added to Laurussia and Gondwana collided with Laurasia.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\n\nWhen the eastern Palaeo-Tethys closed 250\u2013230&nbsp;Mya, a series of Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Sibumasu, Indochina, South China, Qiantang, and Lhasa&nbsp;\u2013 formed a separate southern Asian continent.  This continent collided 240\u2013220&nbsp;Mya with a northern continent&nbsp;\u2013 North China, Qinling, Qilian, Qaidam, Alex, and Tarim&nbsp;\u2013 along the Central China orogen to form a combined East Asian continent.  The northern margins of the northern continent collided with Baltica and Siberia 310\u2013250&nbsp;Ma, and thus the formation of the East Asian continent marked Pangaea at its greatest extent.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\nBy this time, the rifting of western Pangaea had already begun.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nPangaea split in two as the [[Tethys Seaway]] opened between Gondwana and Laurasia in the Late Jurassic.  As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

East Antarctica was the highest ground within Pangaea and produced sediments that were transported across eastern Gondwana but never reached Laurasia.  During the Palaeozoic, c. 30\u201340% of the Laurasia but only 10\u201320% of Gondwana was covered by shallow marine water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|loc=Differences Between Gondwana and Laurasia in Pangea, pp. 127, 130}}</ref>\n\n===Asian blocks===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 400 | align = right | perrow = 2\n | image1 = Geology of Asia 450.Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Geology of Asia 350Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Geology of Asia 300Ma.jpg\n | image4 = Geology of Asia 200Ma.jpg\n | footer = Journey of the Asian blocks from Gondwana to Laurasia 450, 350, 300, and 200 Mya.<br />View centred on 0\u00b0S,105\u00b0E.\n}}\nDuring the assembly of Pangaea Laurasia grew as continental blocks broke off Gondwana's northern margin; pulled by old closing oceans in front of them and pulled by new opening oceans behind them.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\">{{Harvnb|Zhao|Wang|Huang|Dong|2018||loc=Closure of Paleo-Tethys Ocean and assembly of Pangea with East Asian blocks, pp. 14-16}}</ref>\nDuring the Neoproterozoic-Early Paleozoic break-up of Rodinia the opening of the Proto-Tethys Ocean split the Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Tarim, Qaidam, Alex, North China, and South China&nbsp;\u2013 from the northern shores of Gondwana (north of Australia in modern coordinates) and the closure of the same ocean reassembled them along the same shores 500\u2013460&nbsp;Mya resulting in Gondwana at its largest extent.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal-closure\" />\n\nThe break-up of Rodinia also resulted in the opening of the long-lived Paleo-Asian Ocean between Baltica and Siberia in the north and Tarim and North China in the south.

By the middle Carboniferous, however, South China had already been in contact with North China long enough to allow floral exchange between the two continents. The Cimmerian blocks rifted from Gondwana in the Late Carboniferous.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\nIn the early Permian, the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened behind the Cimmerian terranes (Sibumasu, Qiantang, Lhasa) and, in the late Carboniferous, the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean closed in front. The eastern branch of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, however, remained opened while Siberia was added to Laurussia and Gondwana collided with Laurasia.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\n\nWhen the eastern Palaeo-Tethys closed 250\u2013230&nbsp;Mya, a series of Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Sibumasu, Indochina, South China, Qiantang, and Lhasa&nbsp;\u2013 formed a separate southern Asian continent.

The northern margins of the northern continent collided with Baltica and Siberia 310\u2013250&nbsp;Ma, and thus the formation of the East Asian continent marked Pangaea at its greatest extent.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\nBy this time, the rifting of western Pangaea had already begun.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nPangaea split in two as the [[Tethys Seaway]] opened between Gondwana and Laurasia in the Late Jurassic.  As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia.

It is based on [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]].  It allows EEA citizens and their family members to live and work in the UK without explicit permission.  Although Swiss citizens are covered by a separate [[Switzerland and the European Union|bilateral agreement]] they are treated basically the same as EEA nationals.  Family members may need a special entry clearance (the [[European Economic Area Family Permit|EEA family permit]]) to enter the UK.\n\n==Legal context==\nThe basis of the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006 is Directive 2004/38/EC.  Member states are bound by the [[Treaty establishing the European Community|EC treaties]] to implement [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] into national law.  However, a significant amount of case law (or precedents), many of them predating the directive, and the historical development (see [[Freedom of movement for workers]]) must also be taken into account to correctly interpret EU law.  Still, ambiguities in the Directive and misinterpretation by the member states exist<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/news/intro/doc/com_2008_840_en.pdf\n|title=Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of Member States\n|date=12 December 2008\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|format=PDF\n}}</ref>\n<ref>\nPress release for the commission report {{cite web\n|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1922&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en\n|title=Free movement and residence rights of EU citizens and their families: the Commission assesses application by Member States\n|date=10 December 2008\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|format=PDF}}\n</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipex.eu/ipex/cms/home/Documents/doc_COM20090313FIN\n|title=COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL on guidance for better transposition and application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States\n|date=2 July 2009\n|accessdate=2009-07-12\n}}</ref> which may require further clarification through national courts and the [[European Court of Justice]].\n\n==Terminology and applications==\nThe EEA Regulations define a number of terms in addition to the terms in the Directive 2004/38.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|+ Terminology\n! EEA Regulations !! Directive 2004/38 !! Meaning\n|-\n| [[European Economic Area Family Permit]]\n| visa\n| entry clearance for non-EEA citizens\n|-\n| extended family members\n| beneficiaries\n| other family members or dependants, partners in a durable relationship\n|}\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|+ Applications\n!

A person outside of this definition (especially unmarried partners) may fall under the category extended family member.  These include dependents of the EU citizens, members of the household, and a partner in a \"durable relationship\".  While the Directive 2004/38 requires member states to \"facilitate entry\" for extended family members, the details are not defined.  The Directive does not seem to grant any rights to extended family members.\n\nIn the EEA Regulations, the acceptance of extended family members is not explicit. UK regulations have specific criteria for extended family members, including unmarried and same sex partners. Once an extended family member has been issued with an EEA family permit, Residence Card or Residence Certificate, they are regarded under UK regulations as family members.\n\n==Accession states==\n\nWorkers from recent member states have the right to move to the UK, but their access to the labour market is limited.  The details are defined in the [[Worker Registration Scheme]] (WRS).  Nationals of [[A8 countries]] will cease to be subject to the Worker Registration scheme and may benefit from free movement under the directive once 12 months employment with a single employer has been completed.  The transitional WRS scheme [[Freedom of movement for workers#Free movement rights of nationals of new member states|became obsolete in 2011]] when A8 national workers will have the same rights as all other EEA nationals.\n\n==Completeness==\n\nThe implementation is reasonably complete, although there are areas where the Directive has not been fully implemented. One example is a failure to correctly implement the [[Surinder Singh route|Surinder Singh]] ruling of the European Court of Justice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yeo|first1=Colin|title=EU to investigate UK interpretation of Surinder Singh|url=https://www.freemovement.org.uk/eu-to-investigate-uk-interpretation-of-surinder-singh/|website=Free Movement: updates and commentary on immigration and asylum law|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue with the UK implementation of the Directive is that the UK has kept national immigration law (the \"Immigration Rules\") separate from the implementation of the European law (the \"EEA Regulations\").  While it is possible to switch from the UK law to the European law, this does reset the clock for acquiring permanent residence.  The legal situation of extended family members during this switch is uncertain, because they have to conform to both laws.  Switching from European law to UK law is possible only after the EEA citizen became settled in the UK. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The EEA national is considered settled when having attained permanent residence.\n\n==Implementation issues==\n{{Multiple issues|section = y|\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\nBy far the biggest implementation issue is the long processing time for the issue of residence cards (EEA2 applications).  This can take 6 months or longer (current processing times as at January 2009 are up to a year according to the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ web site]).  During this time it is very difficult for the family member to start working, to open a bank account, to register with a doctor or to travel.  This issue is created and aggravated by a combination of several seemingly harmless infringements.  These infringements are:\n\n* The initial visa (EEA family permit) is valid for only 6 months (reduced in 2006 from previously 12 months).\n* The processing of the EEA2 application (which is required to be completed within 6 months) often takes longer than 6 months.\n* During this time the passport of both the EEA citizen and the family member is held by the Home Office.\n* While it is possible to request the passport back without cancelling the application, the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/contact/contactspage/contactcentres/ current web page] does not mention this (unlike the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702084524/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/applying/returnofpassports previous one]).\n\nAnd without the passport life can be difficult for a foreigner, because the passport is required in many situations.  Even if the passport is received back, family members often encounter difficulties because of the short validity of the EEA family permit.  For example, a GP may refuse to register the family member because the visa is not valid for another 6 months (which is not correct, but nevertheless common).\n\nMost of these problems are aggravated by the way that the certificate of application (the acknowledgment of the application) is issued.\n\n* The certificate of application (which is required to be issued immediately) is sent very slowly.\n* The certificate of application is a generic letter without reference to the concrete case.\n* The certificate of application does not grant the right to enter the UK.\n\nThe obvious solution would be issue a temporary visa with the right to work immediately, and to send the residence card once the application is completed.  A self-help option is to keep the passports and only include a copy in the application.  According to individual reports the Home Office will request the passport once the application is ready for processing, and then the residence card is issued reasonably quickly.\n\nThere are further issues, but they have a comparatively small effect.  The application forms (EEA1, EEA2, EEA3, EEA4, and VAF5) are overly complicated, ask for a good amount of unnecessary information, and ask for many more documents to be included than legally necessary under the directive.  For example, the application for a residence card as the family member of an EEA national requires that the EEA national's employer stamps the application form and provides a letter confirming the EEA national's employment. Until March 2009 applications launched by family members from outside of the EEA are judged against the national immigration rules despite the ECJ's ruling in [[Metock case]] that the imposition of a requirement for prior lawful residence is unlawful under EU law.  There are also issues for spouses that are separate but not yet divorced.\n\nIn May 2009 further regulations relating EEA applications were laid before parliament.  These regulations introduced proscribed forms for requests of EEA residence documentation.  The regulations allow the Home Office to decline to consider a request for residence documentation if the proscribed form is incorrectly completed or the individual requests documentation without using an application form.

It is based on [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]].  It allows EEA citizens and their family members to live and work in the UK without explicit permission.  Although Swiss citizens are covered by a separate [[Switzerland and the European Union|bilateral agreement]] they are treated basically the same as EEA nationals.  Family members may need a special entry clearance (the [[European Economic Area Family Permit|EEA family permit]]) to enter the UK.\n\n==Legal context==\nThe basis of the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006 is Directive 2004/38/EC.  Member states are bound by the [[Treaty establishing the European Community|EC treaties]] to implement [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] into national law.  However, a significant amount of case law (or precedents), many of them predating the directive, and the historical development (see [[Freedom of movement for workers]]) must also be taken into account to correctly interpret EU law.  Still, ambiguities in the Directive and misinterpretation by the member states exist<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/news/intro/doc/com_2008_840_en.pdf\n|title=Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of Member States\n|date=12 December 2008\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|format=PDF\n}}</ref>\n<ref>\nPress release for the commission report {{cite web\n|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1922&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en\n|title=Free movement and residence rights of EU citizens and their families: the Commission assesses application by Member States\n|date=10 December 2008\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|format=PDF}}\n</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipex.eu/ipex/cms/home/Documents/doc_COM20090313FIN\n|title=COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL on guidance for better transposition and application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States\n|date=2 July 2009\n|accessdate=2009-07-12\n}}</ref> which may require further clarification through national courts and the [[European Court of Justice]].\n\n==Terminology and applications==\nThe EEA Regulations define a number of terms in addition to the terms in the Directive 2004/38.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|+ Terminology\n! EEA Regulations !! Directive 2004/38 !! Meaning\n|-\n| [[European Economic Area Family Permit]]\n| visa\n| entry clearance for non-EEA citizens\n|-\n| extended family members\n| beneficiaries\n| other family members or dependants, partners in a durable relationship\n|}\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|+ Applications\n!

A person outside of this definition (especially unmarried partners) may fall under the category extended family member.  These include dependents of the EU citizens, members of the household, and a partner in a \"durable relationship\".  While the Directive 2004/38 requires member states to \"facilitate entry\" for extended family members, the details are not defined.  The Directive does not seem to grant any rights to extended family members.\n\nIn the EEA Regulations, the acceptance of extended family members is not explicit. UK regulations have specific criteria for extended family members, including unmarried and same sex partners. Once an extended family member has been issued with an EEA family permit, Residence Card or Residence Certificate, they are regarded under UK regulations as family members.\n\n==Accession states==\n\nWorkers from recent member states have the right to move to the UK, but their access to the labour market is limited.  The details are defined in the [[Worker Registration Scheme]] (WRS).  Nationals of [[A8 countries]] will cease to be subject to the Worker Registration scheme and may benefit from free movement under the directive once 12 months employment with a single employer has been completed.  The transitional WRS scheme [[Freedom of movement for workers#Free movement rights of nationals of new member states|became obsolete in 2011]] when A8 national workers will have the same rights as all other EEA nationals.\n\n==Completeness==\n\nThe implementation is reasonably complete, although there are areas where the Directive has not been fully implemented. One example is a failure to correctly implement the [[Surinder Singh route|Surinder Singh]] ruling of the European Court of Justice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yeo|first1=Colin|title=EU to investigate UK interpretation of Surinder Singh|url=https://www.freemovement.org.uk/eu-to-investigate-uk-interpretation-of-surinder-singh/|website=Free Movement: updates and commentary on immigration and asylum law|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue with the UK implementation of the Directive is that the UK has kept national immigration law (the \"Immigration Rules\") separate from the implementation of the European law (the \"EEA Regulations\").  While it is possible to switch from the UK law to the European law, this does reset the clock for acquiring permanent residence.  The legal situation of extended family members during this switch is uncertain, because they have to conform to both laws.  Switching from European law to UK law is possible only after the EEA citizen became settled in the UK. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The EEA national is considered settled when having attained permanent residence.\n\n==Implementation issues==\n{{Multiple issues|section = y|\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\nBy far the biggest implementation issue is the long processing time for the issue of residence cards (EEA2 applications).  This can take 6 months or longer (current processing times as at January 2009 are up to a year according to the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ web site]).  During this time it is very difficult for the family member to start working, to open a bank account, to register with a doctor or to travel.  This issue is created and aggravated by a combination of several seemingly harmless infringements.  These infringements are:\n\n* The initial visa (EEA family permit) is valid for only 6 months (reduced in 2006 from previously 12 months).\n* The processing of the EEA2 application (which is required to be completed within 6 months) often takes longer than 6 months.\n* During this time the passport of both the EEA citizen and the family member is held by the Home Office.\n* While it is possible to request the passport back without cancelling the application, the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/contact/contactspage/contactcentres/ current web page] does not mention this (unlike the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702084524/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/applying/returnofpassports previous one]).\n\nAnd without the passport life can be difficult for a foreigner, because the passport is required in many situations.  Even if the passport is received back, family members often encounter difficulties because of the short validity of the EEA family permit.  For example, a GP may refuse to register the family member because the visa is not valid for another 6 months (which is not correct, but nevertheless common).\n\nMost of these problems are aggravated by the way that the certificate of application (the acknowledgment of the application) is issued.\n\n* The certificate of application (which is required to be issued immediately) is sent very slowly.\n* The certificate of application is a generic letter without reference to the concrete case.\n* The certificate of application does not grant the right to enter the UK.\n\nThe obvious solution would be issue a temporary visa with the right to work immediately, and to send the residence card once the application is completed.  A self-help option is to keep the passports and only include a copy in the application.  According to individual reports the Home Office will request the passport once the application is ready for processing, and then the residence card is issued reasonably quickly.\n\nThere are further issues, but they have a comparatively small effect.  The application forms (EEA1, EEA2, EEA3, EEA4, and VAF5) are overly complicated, ask for a good amount of unnecessary information, and ask for many more documents to be included than legally necessary under the directive.  For example, the application for a residence card as the family member of an EEA national requires that the EEA national's employer stamps the application form and provides a letter confirming the EEA national's employment. Until March 2009 applications launched by family members from outside of the EEA are judged against the national immigration rules despite the ECJ's ruling in [[Metock case]] that the imposition of a requirement for prior lawful residence is unlawful under EU law.  There are also issues for spouses that are separate but not yet divorced.\n\nIn May 2009 further regulations relating EEA applications were laid before parliament.  These regulations introduced proscribed forms for requests of EEA residence documentation.  The regulations allow the Home Office to decline to consider a request for residence documentation if the proscribed form is incorrectly completed or the individual requests documentation without using an application form.  This move has brought criticism from immigration law practitioners who argue that the imposition of a proscribed form is unlawful under Directive 2004/38.\n\nIt is possible to enter the UK even without an EEA Family Permit, using an article 10 residence card,<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card</ref> but immigration officers are often not aware of this option, and personal reports are discouraging.\n\nCommunicating with the Home Office is usually difficult.  The advice given on the web page is also often inconclusive, incomplete or leaving out essential rights of the applicant (see [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ applying]).
