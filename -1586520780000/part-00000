Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is called to help the police but one of the suspects kills himself. Upon investigating further, Karan learns the suspects received money and VHS tapes containing a terrorist's message. Also, one of the suspects talks repeatedly about 9/11, which is decoded as an attack on India on the day of Diwali. Further learning the recordings were shot by a camera in London, Karan decides to go undercover along with Bhavana Reddy, who assisted him on his [[Commando 2|previous mission]]. Posing as a married couple, they arrive in London where Mallika Sood, a British Intelligence officer picks them up and takes them to their work station where another agent named Armaan Akhtar assists them. On the other hand, the British Muslim terrorist Buraq Ansari forces his son Abeer to watch him killing a man, due to which Abeer's mother and Buraq's ex wife Zahira wants to contact the police but is threatened by Buraq. Learning two Indian agent  have arrived in London possibly to capture him, Buraq enlists the help of his agents to track them while Karan and his team go through the same process to track Buraq's agents. While pursuing a suspect, Karan meets Zahira and Abeer, and soon gets involved in a bike chase with the suspect, resulting in the latter's accidental death. Karan retrieves his phone and answers Buraq's call, further telling him he would soon visit the dead suspect's house. Karan and team arrive at the house, but outside it are stopped by Buraq's goons. A fight breaks out, resulting in Karan getting thrown out of the house by an explosion. The video goes viral, and so does Bhavana's tweet supporting Karan. \n\nIt is soon revealed to be a part of Karan's plan when he releases a video of himself challenging Buraq without disclosing his identity. When Buraq's DNA matches with that of a murder suspect, Karan and his team rush to Buraq's restaurant but find him gone. Realizing he would have gone to pick up his son from school, Karan arrives there and challenges him before the latter disappears. Back in Mumbai, the two suspects are reformed by a Muslim saint. Buraq is unwilling to let go of his son and soon finds himself exposed when Karan holds a press conference with Abeer and Zahira. While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n== Cast==\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* Abhilash Chaudhary as Taimur Khan\n* Manuj Sharma as Subhan\n* Raghav Dheer as Umar\n* Prashant Jha as Usman\n* Mark Bennington as Alvin\n* Atharva Vishwakarma as Abeer\n* R.

Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is called to help the police but one of the suspects kills himself. Upon investigating further, Karan learns the suspects received money and VHS tapes containing a terrorist's message. Also, one of the suspects talks repeatedly about 9/11, which is decoded as an attack on India on the day of Diwali. Further learning the recordings were shot by a camera in London, Karan decides to go undercover along with Bhavana Reddy, who assisted him on his [[Commando 2|previous mission]]. Posing as a married couple, they arrive in London where Mallika Sood, a British Intelligence officer picks them up and takes them to their work station where another agent named Armaan Akhtar assists them. On the other hand, the British Muslim terrorist Buraq Ansari forces his son Abeer to watch him killing a man, due to which Abeer's mother and Buraq's ex wife Zahira wants to contact the police but is threatened by Buraq. Learning two Indian agent  have arrived in London possibly to capture him, Buraq enlists the help of his agents to track them while Karan and his team go through the same process to track Buraq's agents. While pursuing a suspect, Karan meets Zahira and Abeer, and soon gets involved in a bike chase with the suspect, resulting in the latter's accidental death. Karan retrieves his phone and answers Buraq's call, further telling him he would soon visit the dead suspect's house. Karan and team arrive at the house, but outside it are stopped by Buraq's goons. A fight breaks out, resulting in Karan getting thrown out of the house by an explosion. The video goes viral, and so does Bhavana's tweet supporting Karan. \n\nIt is soon revealed to be a part of Karan's plan when he releases a video of himself challenging Buraq without disclosing his identity. When Buraq's DNA matches with that of a murder suspect, Karan and his team rush to Buraq's restaurant but find him gone. Realizing he would have gone to pick up his son from school, Karan arrives there and challenges him before the latter disappears. Back in Mumbai, the two suspects are reformed by a Muslim saint. Buraq is unwilling to let go of his son and soon finds himself exposed when Karan holds a press conference with Abeer and Zahira. While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n== Cast==\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* Abhilash Chaudhary as Taimur Khan\n* Manuj Sharma as Subhan\n* Raghav Dheer as Umar\n* Prashant Jha as Usman\n* Mark Bennington as Alvin\n* Atharva Vishwakarma as Abeer\n* R.

Meston recorded the pre-contact population of Aboriginal people as 600\u20131,000, but by 1891 none remained on the Island and only four lived on the mainland.<ref name=tuttcaboolture/>\n\n=== Joondaburri lifestyle ===\nThe comparatively rich coastal country allowed permanent residence. Natural resources of land and sea were abundant and harvested according to the seasons. Winter mullet schooled from May to July. Dolphins were trained to herd the fish into waiting nets and spears.  Winter was the best season for bream, followed by tailor in September and October. In summer mud crabs and oysters were plentiful and dugong were hunted. Summer whiting and flathead were speared or netted. Bungwall Fern was gathered for its starchy roots all year round.  Kangaroo, eels and carpet snakes were rich in protein and fat. The dominant shellfish used as food was the oyster known today as the [[Sydney Rock Oyster]] known locally as tibir, at that time growing naturally on the seabeds.  The oyster middens, many metres thick, were plundered by early settlers for lime. A significant midden site, now lost, was located not far from Bongaree jetty. It contained discarded shells, marsupial bones and stone tools. The biggest of the oyster middens was at White Patch, where dugong were also plentiful. The [[Plebidonax deltoides|Ugari (pipi)]] on the coastal beaches was also eaten.<ref>Joondaburrie lifestyle, permanent display, [[Bribie Island Seaside Museum]], 2010, [[Moreton Bay Regional Council]]</ref>\n\n=== James Cook, 1770 ===\nLieutenant [[James Cook]] sighted the [[Glass House Mountains (Queensland)|Glass House Mountains]] west of the Island on Thursday 17 May 1770 while sailing up the east coast of Australia in [[HM Bark Endeavour]]. He called these hills the Glass Houses as the reflections and the shape of the hills reminded him of the glass manufacturing houses back in England. [[James Cook]] named the area Glass House Bay and was the first European to name this stretch of water.\n\n===Matthew Flinders, 1799===\nOn 16 July 1799 Captain Matthew Flinders left Glass House Bay about {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} east of the shore in the ''Norfolk''. He sailed south-west between Moreton Island and the mainland parallel to the southern shore of Bribie Island until spotting an opening in the low western shore. He anchored at 8:15am and transferred with a small crew and [[Bungaree|Bongaree]] to a smaller craft. He landed on Bribie Island unaware that it wasn't the mainland and met a small group of Aborigines who had gathered on the beach. Although Bongaree didn't speak the same dialect as the local aborigines the meeting was peaceful until one attempted to remove Flinders' hat. Flinders refused and the Europeans and Bongaree returned to their boat. As they left the man who had tried to remove Flinders' hat threw a spear that missed the small boat and crew. Flinders fired his musket at the men on shore and wounded the man who had thrown the spear. The Aborigines fled the beach. Flinders named the southern shore and site of the confrontation ''Point Skirmish''.<ref name=hatpoint>John St Pierre in Royal Historical Society of Queensland, John Kerr (editor), 2001, ''Flinders in Moreton Bay: A Bicentenary Review 1799-1999'', Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Queensland.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Science, Voyages, and Encounters in Oceania, 1511\u20131850|last=Douglas|first=Bronwen|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2014|isbn=9781137305886|location=|pages=118}}</ref>  There is an area on the modern map marked Skirmish Point but should not be confused with the actual place of the incident which is known as South Point.\n\nFlinders needed to repair leaks in his boat and pulled it ashore some {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} north of the area he had the incident with the locals for those repairs.

Meston recorded the pre-contact population of Aboriginal people as 600\u20131,000, but by 1891 none remained on the Island and only four lived on the mainland.<ref name=tuttcaboolture/>\n\n=== Joondaburri lifestyle ===\nThe comparatively rich coastal country allowed permanent residence. Natural resources of land and sea were abundant and harvested according to the seasons. Winter mullet schooled from May to July. Dolphins were trained to herd the fish into waiting nets and spears.  Winter was the best season for bream, followed by tailor in September and October. In summer mud crabs and oysters were plentiful and dugong were hunted. Summer whiting and flathead were speared or netted. Bungwall Fern was gathered for its starchy roots all year round.  Kangaroo, eels and carpet snakes were rich in protein and fat. The dominant shellfish used as food was the oyster known today as the [[Sydney Rock Oyster]] known locally as tibir, at that time growing naturally on the seabeds.  The oyster middens, many metres thick, were plundered by early settlers for lime. A significant midden site, now lost, was located not far from Bongaree jetty. It contained discarded shells, marsupial bones and stone tools. The biggest of the oyster middens was at White Patch, where dugong were also plentiful. The [[Plebidonax deltoides|Ugari (pipi)]] on the coastal beaches was also eaten.<ref>Joondaburrie lifestyle, permanent display, [[Bribie Island Seaside Museum]], 2010, [[Moreton Bay Regional Council]]</ref>\n\n=== James Cook, 1770 ===\nLieutenant [[James Cook]] sighted the [[Glass House Mountains (Queensland)|Glass House Mountains]] west of the Island on Thursday 17 May 1770 while sailing up the east coast of Australia in [[HM Bark Endeavour]]. He called these hills the Glass Houses as the reflections and the shape of the hills reminded him of the glass manufacturing houses back in England. [[James Cook]] named the area Glass House Bay and was the first European to name this stretch of water.\n\n===Matthew Flinders, 1799===\nOn 16 July 1799 Captain Matthew Flinders left Glass House Bay about {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} east of the shore in the ''Norfolk''. He sailed south-west between Moreton Island and the mainland parallel to the southern shore of Bribie Island until spotting an opening in the low western shore. He anchored at 8:15am and transferred with a small crew and [[Bungaree|Bongaree]] to a smaller craft. He landed on Bribie Island unaware that it wasn't the mainland and met a small group of Aborigines who had gathered on the beach. Although Bongaree didn't speak the same dialect as the local aborigines the meeting was peaceful until one attempted to remove Flinders' hat. Flinders refused and the Europeans and Bongaree returned to their boat. As they left the man who had tried to remove Flinders' hat threw a spear that missed the small boat and crew. Flinders fired his musket at the men on shore and wounded the man who had thrown the spear. The Aborigines fled the beach. Flinders named the southern shore and site of the confrontation ''Point Skirmish''.<ref name=hatpoint>John St Pierre in Royal Historical Society of Queensland, John Kerr (editor), 2001, ''Flinders in Moreton Bay: A Bicentenary Review 1799-1999'', Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Queensland.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Science, Voyages, and Encounters in Oceania, 1511\u20131850|last=Douglas|first=Bronwen|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2014|isbn=9781137305886|location=|pages=118}}</ref>  There is an area on the modern map marked Skirmish Point but should not be confused with the actual place of the incident which is known as South Point.\n\nFlinders needed to repair leaks in his boat and pulled it ashore some {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} north of the area he had the incident with the locals for those repairs.

The decision came down to Fort Bribie's ability to cover both entrances to the northwest channel, while Caloundra could only cover the most northerly entrance.

The [[Autostadt]] is a visitor attraction next to the Volkswagen factory that features the company's model range: [[Audi AG|Audi]], [[Bentley Motors|Bentley]], [[Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.|Bugatti]], [[Ducati]], [[Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.|Lamborghini]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[Neoplan]], [[Porsche AG|Porsche]], [[Scania AB|Scania]], [[SEAT, S.A.|SEAT]], [[\u0160koda Auto]] and [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]]. Wolfsburg is one of the few German cities built during the first half of the 20th century. From its founding on 1 July 1938 as a [[company town|home for workers]] producing the \"KdF-Wagen\" ([[VW Beetle]]) until 25 May 1945, the city was called \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben\". In 1972, the population first exceeded 100,000.\n\n==Geography==\nWolfsburg is located at the Southern edge of the ancient river valley of the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] at the [[Mittellandkanal]] (''Midland Canal''). It is bordered by the districts of [[Gifhorn (district)|Gifhorn]] and [[Helmstedt (district)|Helmstedt]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe total annual precipitation is about {{convert|532|mm|0|abbr=on}} which is quite low as it belongs to the lowest tenth of the measured data in Germany. Only 7% of all observation stations of the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (''German Weather Service'') record lower measurements. The driest month is October, most precipitation is measured in June where observation stations measure 1.9 times more precipitation than in October. Precipitation hardly diversifies and is constantly distributed all over the year. Only 17% of observation stations measure lower annual deviation.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Schlo\u00df Wolfsburg 2016-1.jpg|thumb|[[Wolfsburg Castle]] ]]\nThe castle \"[[Wolfsburg Castle|Wolfsburg]]\" was first mentioned in 1302 in a document as the domicile of the noble lineage of Bartensleben. Originally a keep next to the Aller, it was protected by a moat some centuries later. In 1372, the first documentary reference to the Burg Neuhaus (''castle of Neuhaus'') near Wolfsburg appeared. After the extinction of the Bartensleben line in 1742, the property and its Schloss Wolfsburg (''Wolfsburg Castle'') passed on to the Earls of the Schulenburg. The communal manor was an important employer for the nearby settlements ''Rothenfelde'' and ''He\u00dflingen''.\n\nSome of today's urban districts, including ''He\u00dflingen'', belonged to the Duke of [[Magdeburg]] during the 18th century. In 1932, these districts were detached from the Prussian province [[Saxony]] and integrated in the administrative district of L\u00fcneburg belonging to [[Hannover]].\n\nOther urban districts, like ''Vorsfelde'' and the villages transferred to Wolfsburg from the county of [[Helmstedt]], belonged to the later Duke of [[Braunschweig]] (''Brunswick'') for centuries. ''Fallersleben'' and other villages belonged to the Electorate of Braunschweig - L\u00fcneburg or the Kingdom of Hanover.\n\nWolfsburg was founded on 1 July 1938 as the '''Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben''' ({{lang-en|City of the [[Kraft durch Freude|KdF]] Car at [[Fallersleben]]}}), a planned town centred around the village of Fallersleben, built to house workers of the [[Volkswagen]] (''people's car'') factories erected to assemble the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]] military cars, aeroplanes, and other military equipment were built there, mainly by [[forced labour in Germany during World War II|forced workers]] and [[prisoner of war|POWs]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In 1942, German authorities established the [[Arbeitsdorf]] concentration camp in the city for a few months.\n\nAt the urging of the British occupying power, the city was renamed as '''Wolfsburg''' on 25 May 1945, after the eponymous castle located there. In 1951, Wolfsburg was separated from the District of Gifhorn, and became an [[list of German urban districts|urban district]].\n\nIn 1955 the one-millionth VW Beetle was manufactured in Wolfsburg. Postwar Beetle production ended in Wolfsburg in 1974, though German Beetle production continued in [[Emden]] until 1978. The factories in Wolfsburg remain a key part of Volkswagen's production capacity.\n\nDuring the [[Wirtschaftswunder|German economic miracle]] Wolfsburg experienced a large influx of immigrant workers, especially from Italy.\n\nIn 1958 the city hall was built. In 1960 the Volkswagenwerk GmbH (limited partnership with a limited liability) was changed into an AG (public limited company).\n\nIn the course of a land reform in Lower Saxony in 1972, 20 localities were added to the city through the \"Wolfsburg-Act\".  Wolfsburg gained the status of major city with nearly 131,000 inhabitants. The city's area grew from 35 to nearly 204 square kilometers. In 1973, the city's population peaked at 131,971.\n\nIn 1982 the A39, a side road of the A2 (Oberhausen - Hannover - Werder), was built as a direct freeway to Wolfsburg.\n\nIn 1988, the city became a university town with the establishment of the University of Applied Science Braunschweig/Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Today its name is Ostfalia University of Applied Science.\n\nAs a launch promotion for the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|5th generation]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] the city of Wolfsburg welcomed visitors on the internet, on the official stationery, and on every city limit sign with the name \"'''Golfsburg'''\" from 25 August to 10 October 2003. This campaign gained the nationwide attention of press, radio, and TV broadcasting.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Wolfsburg gained nationwide attention when their football team, [[VfL Wolfsburg]], won the German football league. A party was held in the city centre with about 100,000 people, and was a first in the \nhistory of the city.\n\n==Culture and attractions==\n[[File:Autostadt, Wolfsburg Gel\u00e4nde.jpg|thumb|The [[Autostadt]]]]\nThe centre of Wolfsburg is unique in Germany. Instead of a medieval town center, Wolfsburg features a new and modern attraction called the [[Autostadt]]. The old part of the town [[Alt Wolfsburg]] [[:de:Alt-Wolfsburg|(de)]] shows some manor buildings in traditional framework style. Atop a hill by the [[Aller (Germany)|River Aller]] is the [[Wolfsburg Castle]].\n\nThe Autostadt is an open-air museum-theme park dedicated to [[automobile]]s owned and operated by [[Volkswagen]]. In the center of the park are the pavilions featuring Volkswagen's major brands: [[Volkswagen]] and [[Audi]] to the north, further south are [[SEAT]], [[\u0160koda Auto]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Bentley]], [[Bugatti]] and the Premium Clubhouse. Right next to the lagoon is the [[Porsche]] pavilion. The striking Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles pavilion is in the south-east of the park. \nThe Autostadt also includes: a [[planetarium]]; a [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel; the [[Phaeno Science Center]], the largest hands-on science museum in Germany; a water skiing resort; and a private art museum ([[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]]) specialised in modern and contemporary art.\n\nAnother major attraction is the Wolfsburg Water Show, the world's largest water-flame-laser-video fountain show with its up to 70 meter high fountains.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.niedersachsen-tourism.com/wassershow-wolfsburg |accessdate=29 September 2014|title=Water show Wolfsburg:  A truly unique experience is provided by the world\u2019s largest mobile water-fountain show with its up to 70 meter high fountains. The show is being staged every night for a period of four weeks. Visitors can prepare themselves for an unforgettable spectacle. Every year, the show is being themed and staged differently and accompanied by a lavish play of colours and a laser show. }}</ref>\n\n===Population development===\nFrom about 1,000 inhabitants in 1938, the population of the city increased to 25,000 in 1950 and doubled to 50,000 until 1958. On 1 July 1972, the population of Wolfsburg first went beyond the mark of 100,000 because of the suburbanization of several villages which made Wolfsburg a major city. In 1973, the population reached its highest level: 131,971. At the end of December 2010, 121,451 people were registered with their principal residence in Wolfsburg. Until the end of 2012, this number climbed to 123,144.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Rank\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Nationality\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Population (31.12.2018)\n|-\n|1||{{flag|Italy}}|| 5,506\n|-\n|2||{{flag|Syria}}||  1,469\n|-\n|3||{{flag|Poland}}|| 1,349\n|-\n|4||{{flag|Turkey}}|| 682\n|-\n|5||{{flag|India}}|| 563\n|-\n|6||{{flag|Iraq}}|| 521\n|-\n|7||{{flag|Tunisia}}|| 475\n|-\n|8||{{flag|Romania}}|| 450\n|-\n|9||{{flag|Russia}}|| 450\n|-\n|10||{{flag|China}}|| 403\n|-\n|11||{{flag|Kosovo}}||326\n|-\n|12||{{flag|Afghanistan}}||310\n|-\n|13||{{flag|Mexico}}||308\n|-\n|14||{{flag|Portugal}}||261\n|-\n|15||{{flag|Spain}}||259\n|-\n|}\n\n==Organization==\nThe city of Wolfsburg is organized into 40 districts. One or more districts make up one of the total of 16 localities which are represented by their own councils. Every council has a local official as its mayor.\n\nFirst the councils were only established in the 11 localities suburbanized in 1972. They partly took over the functions of the former town councils of each of the districts. In 1991 and 2001 some of the localities were split into smaller areas so that today there are 16 localities, each with its own council which are directly voted by the citizens.\n\nThe only exception from this organization is the [[Allerpark]] (''Aller Park''), a local recreation area surrounding the [[Allersee]] lake, and the area of the Volkswagen factory which are both located in the central city area.\n\nThe administrative area of Wolfsburg includes six nature reserves. Five of them are located in the ancient Aller river valley.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Rathaus Wolfsburg.jpg|thumb|The town hall]]\nHead of the young \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" became the government assessor Karl Bock on enactment #145 of the chief president of the government of [[L\u00fcneburg]] effective from 1 July 1938. His followers were also deployed by the government.\n\nIn 1946, the military government of the British zone of occupation established a communal constitution following the British example. After this, citizens voted for a council which elected a volunteer mayor/ lord mayor as the city's leader and representative. After 1946, the council elected a full-time director to lead the city council. In 2001, the city council's dual leadership was abolished. It is led by a full-time lord mayor who is also the city's representative, Klaus Mohrs. Since 2001, citizens directly elect the lord mayor. The council still has its own chairperson elected by the council's constitutive conference after every local election.\n\nThe city has been described as a \u201csocial democratic utopia\u201d.<ref name=\"veconomist\" >{{cite news|author=J.C.|title=How to keep populists small and marginal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/10/parable-lower-saxony|work=[[The Economist]]|date=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===City council===\nThe city council is made up of the fractions of the different parties (47 seats) and the lord mayor with one seat. The lord mayor is head of administration, thus the superior of all employees of the city council. The lord mayor is supported by four departmental heads that are voted by the council on his proposal. Together, they make up the board of directors of the city administration where the most important decisions concerning administration are deliberated weekly.\n\nResults of the local elections on 11 September 2011:<ref>[http://www.wolfsburg.de/irj/go/km/docs/imperia/mam/portal/grundstuecks_und_gebaeudemanagement/pdf/amtsblaetter/amtsblatt_nr_37_26_09_2011.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207214356/http://www.wolfsburg.de/irj/go/km/docs/imperia/mam/portal/grundstuecks_und_gebaeudemanagement/pdf/amtsblaetter/amtsblatt_nr_37_26_09_2011.pdf |date=2013-02-07 }} (PDF-Datei, 200 kB), Nr. 37 vom 26.

A golden wolf with a blue tongue paces over the castle's battlement. The city's flag is green and white.\n\nLower Saxony's Department of the Interior awarded the city of Wolfsburg's emblem in 1952 after it had been constituted in the association articles in 1947. In 1961, it was improved heraldically and newly awarded by the governmental executive committee of L\u00fcneburg. The symbols of the wolf and the castle reflect the city's name (canting arm) and do not have a historical, directly conveyed reference. The flag was adopted in 1955.\n\nVolkswagen used a modified version of the Wolfsburg coat of arms as its steering wheel emblem, (and occasionally as a hood ornament, on classic Beetles) until the early 1980s, when it was replaced by the VW roundel.\n\n===Regional authorities===\nThe city of Wolfsburg is a member of the association Braunschweigische Landschaft e.V. with a registered office in Braunschweig and in the L\u00fcneburgischen Landschaftsverband e.V. with a registered office in [[Uelzen]]. These associations were founded to foster cultural establishments of the regions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Library Wolfsburg Alvar Aalto photo by Christian G\u00e4nshirt.jpg|thumb|Cultural Center, [[Alvar Aalto]] (1958-62)]]\n[[File:Heilig Geist Kirche Wolfsburg Alvar Aalto 1958 62 photo by Christian G\u00e4nshirt.JPG|thumb|Heilig-Geist-Church, [[Alvar Aalto]] (1958-62)]]\n\n===Historical castles===\n* The '''Schloss Wolfsburg''' (''castle of Wolfsburg''), a Weser renaissance castle of the 13th century was first documented as the domicile of the noble lineage of Bartensleben in 1302.

Located on the River [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]]. It lies about {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Hanover]] and {{convert|230|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Berlin]].\n\nIn 2013, Wolfsburg ranked as the richest city in Germany with a GDP per capita of $128,000 due to its thriving auto industry.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thelocal.de/20130729/51105| journal=The Local | author=DPA/The Local/jcw| date=29 July 2013| accessdate = 29 September 2014| title=Germany's Motown is country's richest city}}</ref>\n\nWolfsburg is famous as the location of [[Volkswagen AG]]'s headquarters and [[Wolfsburg Volkswagen Plant|the world's biggest car plant]]. The [[Autostadt]] is a visitor attraction next to the Volkswagen factory that features the company's model range: [[Audi AG|Audi]], [[Bentley Motors|Bentley]], [[Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.|Bugatti]], [[Ducati]], [[Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.|Lamborghini]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[Neoplan]], [[Porsche AG|Porsche]], [[Scania AB|Scania]], [[SEAT, S.A.|SEAT]], [[\u0160koda Auto]] and [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]]. Wolfsburg is one of the few German cities built during the first half of the 20th century. From its founding on 1 July 1938 as a [[company town|home for workers]] producing the \"KdF-Wagen\" ([[VW Beetle]]) until 25 May 1945, the city was called \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben\". In 1972, the population first exceeded 100,000.\n\n==Geography==\nWolfsburg is located at the Southern edge of the ancient river valley of the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] at the [[Mittellandkanal]] (''Midland Canal''). It is bordered by the districts of [[Gifhorn (district)|Gifhorn]] and [[Helmstedt (district)|Helmstedt]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe total annual precipitation is about {{convert|532|mm|0|abbr=on}} which is quite low as it belongs to the lowest tenth of the measured data in Germany. Only 7% of all observation stations of the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (''German Weather Service'') record lower measurements. The driest month is October, most precipitation is measured in June where observation stations measure 1.9 times more precipitation than in October. Precipitation hardly diversifies and is constantly distributed all over the year. Only 17% of observation stations measure lower annual deviation.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Schlo\u00df Wolfsburg 2016-1.jpg|thumb|[[Wolfsburg Castle]] ]]\nThe castle \"[[Wolfsburg Castle|Wolfsburg]]\" was first mentioned in 1302 in a document as the domicile of the noble lineage of Bartensleben. Originally a keep next to the Aller, it was protected by a moat some centuries later. In 1372, the first documentary reference to the Burg Neuhaus (''castle of Neuhaus'') near Wolfsburg appeared. After the extinction of the Bartensleben line in 1742, the property and its Schloss Wolfsburg (''Wolfsburg Castle'') passed on to the Earls of the Schulenburg. The communal manor was an important employer for the nearby settlements ''Rothenfelde'' and ''He\u00dflingen''.\n\nSome of today's urban districts, including ''He\u00dflingen'', belonged to the Duke of [[Magdeburg]] during the 18th century. In 1932, these districts were detached from the Prussian province [[Saxony]] and integrated in the administrative district of L\u00fcneburg belonging to [[Hannover]].\n\nOther urban districts, like ''Vorsfelde'' and the villages transferred to Wolfsburg from the county of [[Helmstedt]], belonged to the later Duke of [[Braunschweig]] (''Brunswick'') for centuries. ''Fallersleben'' and other villages belonged to the Electorate of Braunschweig - L\u00fcneburg or the Kingdom of Hanover.\n\nWolfsburg was founded on 1 July 1938 as the '''Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben''' ({{lang-en|City of the [[Kraft durch Freude|KdF]] Car at [[Fallersleben]]}}), a planned town centred around the village of Fallersleben, built to house workers of the [[Volkswagen]] (''people's car'') factories erected to assemble the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]] military cars, aeroplanes, and other military equipment were built there, mainly by [[forced labour in Germany during World War II|forced workers]] and [[prisoner of war|POWs]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In 1942, German authorities established the [[Arbeitsdorf]] concentration camp in the city for a few months.\n\nAt the urging of the British occupying power, the city was renamed as '''Wolfsburg''' on 25 May 1945, after the eponymous castle located there. In 1951, Wolfsburg was separated from the District of Gifhorn, and became an [[list of German urban districts|urban district]].\n\nIn 1955 the one-millionth VW Beetle was manufactured in Wolfsburg. Postwar Beetle production ended in Wolfsburg in 1974, though German Beetle production continued in [[Emden]] until 1978. The factories in Wolfsburg remain a key part of Volkswagen's production capacity.\n\nDuring the [[Wirtschaftswunder|German economic miracle]] Wolfsburg experienced a large influx of immigrant workers, especially from Italy.\n\nIn 1958 the city hall was built. In 1960 the Volkswagenwerk GmbH (limited partnership with a limited liability) was changed into an AG (public limited company).\n\nIn the course of a land reform in Lower Saxony in 1972, 20 localities were added to the city through the \"Wolfsburg-Act\".  Wolfsburg gained the status of major city with nearly 131,000 inhabitants. The city's area grew from 35 to nearly 204 square kilometers. In 1973, the city's population peaked at 131,971.\n\nIn 1982 the A39, a side road of the A2 (Oberhausen - Hannover - Werder), was built as a direct freeway to Wolfsburg.\n\nIn 1988, the city became a university town with the establishment of the University of Applied Science Braunschweig/Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Today its name is Ostfalia University of Applied Science.\n\nAs a launch promotion for the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|5th generation]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] the city of Wolfsburg welcomed visitors on the internet, on the official stationery, and on every city limit sign with the name \"'''Golfsburg'''\" from 25 August to 10 October 2003. This campaign gained the nationwide attention of press, radio, and TV broadcasting.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Wolfsburg gained nationwide attention when their football team, [[VfL Wolfsburg]], won the German football league. A party was held in the city centre with about 100,000 people, and was a first in the \nhistory of the city.\n\n==Culture and attractions==\n[[File:Autostadt, Wolfsburg Gel\u00e4nde.jpg|thumb|The [[Autostadt]]]]\nThe centre of Wolfsburg is unique in Germany. Instead of a medieval town center, Wolfsburg features a new and modern attraction called the [[Autostadt]]. The old part of the town [[Alt Wolfsburg]] [[:de:Alt-Wolfsburg|(de)]] shows some manor buildings in traditional framework style. Atop a hill by the [[Aller (Germany)|River Aller]] is the [[Wolfsburg Castle]].\n\nThe Autostadt is an open-air museum-theme park dedicated to [[automobile]]s owned and operated by [[Volkswagen]]. In the center of the park are the pavilions featuring Volkswagen's major brands: [[Volkswagen]] and [[Audi]] to the north, further south are [[SEAT]], [[\u0160koda Auto]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Bentley]], [[Bugatti]] and the Premium Clubhouse. Right next to the lagoon is the [[Porsche]] pavilion. The striking Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles pavilion is in the south-east of the park. \nThe Autostadt also includes: a [[planetarium]]; a [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel; the [[Phaeno Science Center]], the largest hands-on science museum in Germany; a water skiing resort; and a private art museum ([[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]]) specialised in modern and contemporary art.\n\nAnother major attraction is the Wolfsburg Water Show, the world's largest water-flame-laser-video fountain show with its up to 70 meter high fountains.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.niedersachsen-tourism.com/wassershow-wolfsburg |accessdate=29 September 2014|title=Water show Wolfsburg:  A truly unique experience is provided by the world\u2019s largest mobile water-fountain show with its up to 70 meter high fountains. The show is being staged every night for a period of four weeks. Visitors can prepare themselves for an unforgettable spectacle. Every year, the show is being themed and staged differently and accompanied by a lavish play of colours and a laser show. }}</ref>\n\n===Population development===\nFrom about 1,000 inhabitants in 1938, the population of the city increased to 25,000 in 1950 and doubled to 50,000 until 1958. On 1 July 1972, the population of Wolfsburg first went beyond the mark of 100,000 because of the suburbanization of several villages which made Wolfsburg a major city. In 1973, the population reached its highest level: 131,971. At the end of December 2010, 121,451 people were registered with their principal residence in Wolfsburg. Until the end of 2012, this number climbed to 123,144.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Rank\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Nationality\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Population (31.12.2018)\n|-\n|1||{{flag|Italy}}|| 5,506\n|-\n|2||{{flag|Syria}}||  1,469\n|-\n|3||{{flag|Poland}}|| 1,349\n|-\n|4||{{flag|Turkey}}|| 682\n|-\n|5||{{flag|India}}|| 563\n|-\n|6||{{flag|Iraq}}|| 521\n|-\n|7||{{flag|Tunisia}}|| 475\n|-\n|8||{{flag|Romania}}|| 450\n|-\n|9||{{flag|Russia}}|| 450\n|-\n|10||{{flag|China}}|| 403\n|-\n|11||{{flag|Kosovo}}||326\n|-\n|12||{{flag|Afghanistan}}||310\n|-\n|13||{{flag|Mexico}}||308\n|-\n|14||{{flag|Portugal}}||261\n|-\n|15||{{flag|Spain}}||259\n|-\n|}\n\n==Organization==\nThe city of Wolfsburg is organized into 40 districts. One or more districts make up one of the total of 16 localities which are represented by their own councils. Every council has a local official as its mayor.\n\nFirst the councils were only established in the 11 localities suburbanized in 1972. They partly took over the functions of the former town councils of each of the districts. In 1991 and 2001 some of the localities were split into smaller areas so that today there are 16 localities, each with its own council which are directly voted by the citizens.\n\nThe only exception from this organization is the [[Allerpark]] (''Aller Park''), a local recreation area surrounding the [[Allersee]] lake, and the area of the Volkswagen factory which are both located in the central city area.\n\nThe administrative area of Wolfsburg includes six nature reserves. Five of them are located in the ancient Aller river valley.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Rathaus Wolfsburg.jpg|thumb|The town hall]]\nHead of the young \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" became the government assessor Karl Bock on enactment #145 of the chief president of the government of [[L\u00fcneburg]] effective from 1 July 1938. His followers were also deployed by the government.\n\nIn 1946, the military government of the British zone of occupation established a communal constitution following the British example. After this, citizens voted for a council which elected a volunteer mayor/ lord mayor as the city's leader and representative. After 1946, the council elected a full-time director to lead the city council. In 2001, the city council's dual leadership was abolished. It is led by a full-time lord mayor who is also the city's representative, Klaus Mohrs. Since 2001, citizens directly elect the lord mayor. The council still has its own chairperson elected by the council's constitutive conference after every local election.\n\nThe city has been described as a \u201csocial democratic utopia\u201d.<ref name=\"veconomist\" >{{cite news|author=J.C.|title=How to keep populists small and marginal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/10/parable-lower-saxony|work=[[The Economist]]|date=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===City council===\nThe city council is made up of the fractions of the different parties (47 seats) and the lord mayor with one seat. The lord mayor is head of administration, thus the superior of all employees of the city council. The lord mayor is supported by four departmental heads that are voted by the council on his proposal. Together, they make up the board of directors of the city administration where the most important decisions concerning administration are deliberated weekly.\n\nResults of the local elections on 11 September 2011:<ref>[http://www.wolfsburg.de/irj/go/km/docs/imperia/mam/portal/grundstuecks_und_gebaeudemanagement/pdf/amtsblaetter/amtsblatt_nr_37_26_09_2011.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207214356/http://www.wolfsburg.de/irj/go/km/docs/imperia/mam/portal/grundstuecks_und_gebaeudemanagement/pdf/amtsblaetter/amtsblatt_nr_37_26_09_2011.pdf |date=2013-02-07 }} (PDF-Datei, 200 kB), Nr. 37 vom 26.

A golden wolf with a blue tongue paces over the castle's battlement. The city's flag is green and white.\n\nLower Saxony's Department of the Interior awarded the city of Wolfsburg's emblem in 1952 after it had been constituted in the association articles in 1947. In 1961, it was improved heraldically and newly awarded by the governmental executive committee of L\u00fcneburg. The symbols of the wolf and the castle reflect the city's name (canting arm) and do not have a historical, directly conveyed reference. The flag was adopted in 1955.\n\nVolkswagen used a modified version of the Wolfsburg coat of arms as its steering wheel emblem, (and occasionally as a hood ornament, on classic Beetles) until the early 1980s, when it was replaced by the VW roundel.\n\n===Regional authorities===\nThe city of Wolfsburg is a member of the association Braunschweigische Landschaft e.V. with a registered office in Braunschweig and in the L\u00fcneburgischen Landschaftsverband e.V. with a registered office in [[Uelzen]]. These associations were founded to foster cultural establishments of the regions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Library Wolfsburg Alvar Aalto photo by Christian G\u00e4nshirt.jpg|thumb|Cultural Center, [[Alvar Aalto]] (1958-62)]]\n[[File:Heilig Geist Kirche Wolfsburg Alvar Aalto 1958 62 photo by Christian G\u00e4nshirt.JPG|thumb|Heilig-Geist-Church, [[Alvar Aalto]] (1958-62)]]\n\n===Historical castles===\n* The '''Schloss Wolfsburg''' (''castle of Wolfsburg''), a Weser renaissance castle of the 13th century was first documented as the domicile of the noble lineage of Bartensleben in 1302.
