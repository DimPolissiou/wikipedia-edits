There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6).

He quit the school's Community House program in the 9th grade and finished the year at [[Hammond High School (Columbia, Maryland)|Hammond High School]]. He briefly returned before dropping out of high school altogether. At the age of 16, Joplin successfully passed the [[General Educational Development|GED]] and earned his Maryland high school diploma. \n\nInspired very much by [[William Least Heat-Moon]]'s travelogue, [[Blue Highways]] and [[Woody Guthrie]]'s, [[Bound for Glory (book)|Bound for Glory]] Josh picked up his guitar and left home in a 1976 VW Camper Van and spent two years on and off the road, before settling in Denver. His first professional job in music was as the runner for folk/blues legend, [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s concert at [[Swallow Hill Music Association]] [https://swallowhillmusic.org]. They hired him later the same year to open for [[Bill Staines]].  \n\nHis interest in folk music began in earnest after hearing [[Bob Dylan]]'s, [[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']] , and [[Phil Ochs]]' [[Phil Ochs discography|Live At Carnegie Hall]].

This convinced him to relocate to Atlanta. He played mostly solo shows for tips at Sylvia's Atomic Cafe, a [[Candler Park]] neighborhood landmark.

He continued to tour and play with Josh Joplin Group as well as solo shows. The band followed the success of \"Useful Music\" with \"[[The Future That Was]]\", produced by Rob Gal ([[The Rock-A-Teens]]) and was recorded at [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[James Iha]]\u2019s studio, [[Stratosphere Sound]]. Though it received much more critical acclaim<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />, it had very little commercial success. Josh Joplin Group disbanded in December 2003.\n\nIn 2004, after being inspired by his then-neighbor [[Dan Zanes]], Joplin began recording a solo record with the friends he grew up with as well as the math teacher who originally taught him guitar. On August 23, 2005, he released \"[[Jaywalker (album)|Jaywalker]]\" on [[Eleven Thirty Records]].\n\nIn 2008, Joplin formed a new band with [[Garrison Starr]] called Among The Oak & Ash. Their self-titled debut album was released on June 16, 2009 on Verve Records.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n\n*''[[A Present for Hitler (album)|A Present for Hitler]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Facts of Fortune (album)|Facts of Fortune]]'' (1990)\n*''[[I Love Janey, But Janey Loves the Grateful Dead (album)|I Love Janey, But Janey Loves the Grateful Dead]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Projector Head (album)|Projector Head]]'' (1995)  Josh Joplin Band\n*''[[Boxing Nostalgic (album)|Boxing Nostalgic]]'' (1997)  Josh Joplin Band\n*''[[Useful Music]]'' (1998)  Josh Joplin Band\n*''[[Useful Music]]'' (reissue) (2001)  Josh Joplin Group\n*''[[The Future That Was]]'' (2002)  Josh Joplin Group\n*'' The Early Years: Volume One (2004)''\n*''[[Jaywalker (album)|Jaywalker]]'' (2005)  Solo\n*''[[Among The Oak & Ash (album)|Among the Oak & Ash]]'' (2009)  Among the Oak & Ash\n*''[[Devil Ship (album)|Devil Ship]]'' (2011)  Among the Oak & Ash\n*''[[Earth and Other Things]]'' (2013)  Among the Oak & Ash\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/josh_joplin Paste Magazine]\n*[http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/josh-joplin/Content?oid=1135026  The L Magazine]\n*[http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1457787/09252002/joplin_josh.jhtml VH1.com interview with Josh Joplin], vh1.com;

Josh attended [[Sandy Spring Friends School]] and learned from his headmaster in the 7th grade how to play guitar. He quit the school's Community House program in the 9th grade and finished the year at [[Hammond High School (Columbia, Maryland)|Hammond High School]]. He briefly returned before dropping out of high school altogether. At the age of 16, Joplin successfully passed the [[General Educational Development|GED]] and earned his Maryland high school diploma. \n\nInspired very much by [[William Least Heat-Moon]]'s travelogue, [[Blue Highways]] and [[Woody Guthrie]]'s, [[Bound for Glory (book)|Bound for Glory]] Josh picked up his guitar and left home in a 1976 VW Camper Van and spent two years on and off the road, before settling in Denver. His first professional job in music was as the runner for folk/blues legend, [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s concert at [[Swallow Hill Music Association]] [https://swallowhillmusic.org]. They hired him later the same year to open for [[Bill Staines]].  \n\nHis interest in folk music began in earnest after hearing [[Bob Dylan]]'s, [[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']] , and [[Phil Ochs]]' [[Phil Ochs discography|Live At Carnegie Hall]].

[[Geoffrey Himes]] gave Joplin his very first notice, in the Columbia Flier, in 1990. \n\n=== Move to Atlanta ===\nHaving stayed a short time in New York City, Joplin heard [[Kevn Kinney]] on [[WFUV]] and bought his record, MacDougal Blues. This convinced him to relocate to Atlanta. He played mostly solo shows for tips at Sylvia's Atomic Cafe, a [[Candler Park]] neighborhood landmark. It was there, Josh met its cook, fellow songwriter, [[Kelly Hogan]] who fronted, [[The Jody Grind (band)|The Jody Grind,]] and [[Shawn Mullins]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Crenshaw|first=Holly|url=|title=Coffeehouses, The Funky Teen Haven|date=April 29, 1993|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Murray|first=Sonia|url=|title=In The Clubs|date=April 10, 1993|work=The Atlanta Journal|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=DeVault|first=Russ|url=|title=In The Clubs|date=January 23, 1993|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>  Upon seeing, [[Five Eight (band)|Five-Eight]] opening for The Jody Grind, Joplin began to look for a band of his own.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Best Bets: Five-Eight et al, opening Josh Joplin|date=February 19, 1994|work=The Atlanta Journal|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Dollar|first=Steve|url=|title=Dodging Pigeonhole, Jody Grind Unleashes Genre-Jumping 'Deciever'|date=April 10, 1992|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nHe recorded his last 7\" vinyl for Sleepless Nights, I Love Janey (But Janey Loves The Grateful Dead) It was produced by Ed Burdell ([[Magnapop]]).

In 1995, Geoff Melkonian (bass/viola/vocals, and Jason Buecker drums/vocals) founded the [[Josh Joplin Group|Josh Joplin Band]].

Immaculata answered a growing need for Catholic secondary education on the Westbank. Located in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans]], the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]] served Immaculata from its inception until May 1979. In August 1979, the [[Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco|Salesian Sisters]] came to Immaculata.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331233623/http://www.immaculatahigh.org/History.html |title=Historical Profile of Immaculata High School |website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The founding pastor, Msgr.

In 1960, 24 students comprised the first graduating class; the total enrollment was 188 in that year. Immaculata continued as a co-ed school until the opening of [[Archbishop Shaw High School]] in 1962. Archbishop Shaw began with only a Freshman class of 9th grade boys and added successive grades each year thereafter.

Her mother, Susan, is a professional violinist who used to play in the [[Kansas City Symphony]] and her father, Marvin, ran a commercial recording studio and was the creative director and founder of an advertising agency in Kansas City.\n\nJames grew up riding her horse, April, and playing violin in Kansas before leaving for New York City at age 17. In 1992 she graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' with a  B.A. in Comparative Religion from [[Barnard College]], [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City]] (with a focus on [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]) while studying violin and viola at the [[Manhattan School of Music]] as a student of Lucie Robert and [[Karen Ritscher]].  She studied improvisation and swing fiddle with Marty Laster in New York City and studied [[Dhrupad]], an early form of North Indian Classical music, with Pandit Vidhur Malik in [[Vrindavan]], India.\n\nJames is a former managing editor of [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]] and a former editorial intern at [[Harper's Magazine]]. In the early 1990s she worked as a horse wrangler at the Home Ranch in [[Clark, Colorado]] where she also played fiddle in the ranch's cowboy band. James also worked occasionally as a packer and horse wrangler in the West Elk and La Garita Wilderness in Colorado in the mid-1990s, punctuated by brief stints in publishing in New York City. James is an alumnus of the [[Meadowmount School of Music]], the [[New York Youth Symphony]], the Columbia University Chamber Music Program, the New York String Orchestra Seminar with [[Alexander Schneider]] and the [[American Conservatory in Fontainebleau]], [[France]].\n\n==Musical career==\nElana James met guitarist [[Whit Smith]] in 1994 through an ad in the ''Village Voice'' while both were living in New York City. They played together for some years, later adding Jake Erwin, a slap bass player, and forming the American swing trio [[Hot Club of Cowtown]]. The group plays original material as well as a mix of pre-WWII Western swing, a style made famous by [[Bob Wills]] and [[Milton Brown]], combined with the Gypsy jazz of guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] and violinist [[Stephane Grappelli]]. Other influences include American swing violinists Stuff Smith, Joe Venuti, and Johnny Gimble. Hot Club of Cowtown, which has been based in Austin, Texas since 1998, is not named for any specific \"Cowtown,\" but is rather just intended as state of mind, or \"The Cowtown of the Imagination.\"\n\nJames toured with [[Bob Dylan]] in 2004, 2005, and 2006 (James came to Dylan's attention when The Hot Club of Cowtown opened for him and [[Willie Nelson]] during a joint tour of historic baseball parks in the Summer of 2004). She briefly joined Dylan's band in 2005 on a tour with [[Merle Haggard]], Bob Dylan, and [[Amos Lee]], as the first dedicated female instrumentalist to play in Dylan's touring band since [[Scarlet Rivera]] in the early 1970s.\n\nThe Hot Club of Cowtown briefly separated in 2005. Around this time, Fremerman changed her name to Elana James and released her debut album, ''Elana James'', forming a trio called Elana James and the Continental Two with Beau Sample on bass and Luke Hill on guitar.

She appeared on the show most recently with [[Des O'Connor]], and previously with [[Des Lynam]] and before that [[Richard Whiteley]] (from 1982 until his death in 2005).

Vorderman declined, and a search for a new presenter began while the show went into a four-month hiatus.  In October 2005, [[Des Lynam]] replaced Whiteley and co-hosted with Vorderman.

She has written books on [[Detox diet]]s. Her No. 1 bestseller was ''Detox For Life'', produced in collaboration with Ko Chohan and Anita Bean and published by [[Virgin Books]], which sold over a million copies.\n\nMany school textbooks have been published under her name, chiefly by [[Dorling Kindersley]] in series such as ''English Made Easy'', ''Maths Made Easy'', ''Science Made Easy'' and ''[[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|How to Pass National Curriculum Maths]]''.\n\n===Commercial ventures===\nVorderman also expanded her business ventures, launching a number of [[Sudoku]] products. In March 2007 she launched a brain-training game called ''Carol Vorderman's Mind Aerobics'' together with [[BSkyB]]. Also in 2007, she released a video game for [[PlayStation 2]] in the United States entitled ''Carol Vorderman's Sudoku''.\n\nIn 2007, Vorderman did TV commercials for the frozen food chain Farmfoods \u2013 advertising \"Chippy Chips for \u00a31\" and \"Cadbury's Cones for 99p\". <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903436/otherworks|title=Carol Vorderman|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of 2008, soon after she completed her final regular ''Countdown'' show, Vorderman announced a new commercial venture, her own property development and sales company that would specialise in overseas holiday and retirement homes in the Caribbean, the Bahamas and Spain.

In 2006 the charity Credit Action attempted to highlight the potential dangers of debt consolidation, calling on Vorderman to stop giving First Plus credibility.

She was also, after the accession of her brother Charles X on the throne (1654), a titular Royal Princess of Sweden.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===Early life===\nMaria Euphrosyne was born to [[count palatine|Count Palatine]] [[John Casimir, Count Palatine of Kleeburg|John Casimir of Zweibr\u00fccken]] and [[Catherine of Sweden (1584-1638)|Princess Catherine of Sweden]]. In 1622, her family fled from Germany during the [[Thirty Years War]] and settled in the birth country of her mother, Sweden, where Maria Euphrosyne herself was born three years later. She spent her first years at [[Stegeborg Castle]], the fief of her mother. In 1632, her mother was given the responsibility of her cousin, Queen Christina, and Maria Euphrosyne was from that moment brought up with her cousin the Queen: she and her siblings stayed at their court also after the death of their mother in 1638, while their father remained at Stegeborg. Maria Euphrosyne was given a very good education, being brought up with Christina, but she was eventually tutored separately, because Christina as a monarch was considered to require an education otherwise unsuitable for her sex.\n\n===During the Reign of Christina===\nIn 1643, she received a proposal from Count Henry of Nassau. According to a letter of Christina, Henry was a rich and beautiful Prince who was well liked by Maria Euphrosyne. She left the decision to her father, however: he was uncertain as to whether Henry could support her, and in 1645, after Christina stated that she was fully capable of arranging a marriage for the same status for her relative in Sweden, he denied Henry. On 15 March 1645, Maria Euphrosyne was engaged to the Queen's favorite Count [[Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie]], and on 7 March 1647, she married him in the Royal Chapel of [[Tre Kronor (castle)]] in Stockholm. The marriage was arranged by Christina. Traditional myth has regarded this as a triangle drama: Christina and Maria Euphrosyne were both believed to have been in love with Magnus Gabriel, and in the end, Christina gave up the plans of marrying him herself, and gave him to her cousin with the words: ''I give to you what I can not have myself''. A famous play has been written about this drama. It is not known how much of this legendary triangle drama is true, however. According to Maria Euphrosyne herself, the purpose was to show them both her favor. Magnus Gabriel had, according to her own memoirs, fallen in love with her at the age of eighteen, and due to the love letters exchanged by them during their marriage, at least Maria Euphrosyne certainly had strong feelings of affection for him. The marriage has however not been described as happy. At the wedding, Christina granted her several states, among them her grandmother's favorite residence H\u00f6jentorp, which was also to be her favorite, as well as a great personal allowance, which was later confirmed by her brother upon his succession. In 1653, Magnus Gabriel lost his favor with Christina and was expelled from court, and she tried to act as a mediator. Maria Euphrosyne had a close relationship with her brother Charles, and did what she could to support his planned marriage with Christina.\n\n===During the Reign of Charles X and Charles XI===\nAt the coronation of her brother King Charles X Gustavus in 1654, Maria Euphrosyne was granted the rank and status of a Royal Princess of Sweden. This was opposed by some parts of the [[nobility]]. Maria Euphrosyne did not use the title of Countess, but was generally referred to as  Princess. Maria Euphrosyne visited both her spouse and her brother in warfare: she visited her spouse in Germany and, in 1656, in Riga in Swedish Livonia, from where she had to flee again with her courtiers after just two weeks when the Russians set fire to the city. During the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658-1660)]], she and her sister-in-law [[Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Hedvig Eleonora]] lived at Kronborg in Denmark after it had been taken by the Swedish general [[Carl Gustaf Wrangel]].<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Lundh-Eriksson, Nanna\n | title = Hedvig Eleonora\n | publisher =  Wahlstr\u00f6m & Widstrand\n | year = 1947\n | language = Swedish\n | isbn=}}</ref> In 1658, her brother King Charles told her that he wished to make her spouse [[Lord High Chancellor of Sweden]], but she convinced him not to by saying that Magnus Gabriel was more suited for military work. In 1660, she was present at the death bed of her brother in Gothenburg. He promised her great estates in Denmark, pensions for her children, and told her that he had named her consort Lord High Chancellor of Sweden in his will against her wish.\n\nMaria Euphrosyne was very active as a mediator and a spokesperson for supplicants who wished to speak to her spouse or to her brother the King (and later her nephew the King) on their behalf. This matters were not only small things, they also concerned women asking her to use her contacts to acquire offices of great political importance for their male relatives. In the same fashion, she acted as a mediator between her consort and the royal house, especially when he was out of favor. At [[Karlberg Palace]], she received her supplicants in a room with paintings of her royal brother and mother, with a door open to the room where her brother the King had slept when he was a guest in her house. Contemporary view was that her spouse had her to thank for his successful career.\n\nIn 1676, [[Lisbeth Carlsdotter]], a witness in a [[Witch-hunt|witch trial]] inspired by the famous [[G\u00e4vle-Boy]],tried to implicate Maria Euphrosyne and her sister-in-law [[Maria Sofia De la Gardie|Maria Sofia]] for sorcery. This accusations was not taken seriously, but instead discredited the credibility of Lisbeth Carlsdotter as a witness and eventually led to the whole trial being dissolved.\n\nIn 1680, her spouse fell in favor of her nephew, the monarch, after the death of [[Johan G\u00f6ransson Gyllenstierna]]. She was denied an audience with her nephew without witnesses and had no success in getting her spouse in favor. After she, by using her contacts, managed to get an audience in private with the King, however, she told him that she hoped Gyllenstierna was now in Hell, and the result was that her spouse was appointed [[Seneschal in Scandinavia|Seneschal]]. During the great reduction of her nephew King Charles XI in the 1680s, a lot of the property of the family was [[confiscation|confiscated]] by the crown. Maria Euphrosyne was not above using her status as the aunt of the King to avoid confiscation, but she was only moderately successful: in 1685, she was allowed to keep her own personal allowance and her favorite residence H\u00f6jentorp Castle, but the confiscation of her husband's property continued undisturbed. Maria Euphrosyne became a widow in 1686. This was in the middle of the reduction. The King refused to pay for the funeral of her spouse, and to stop the creditors from inventorying her own personal possessions and jewelry as well.\n\nMaria Euphrosyne was described as religious. She had her German saying \u00bbGott ist mir all\u00e9s\u00bb carved at a wall at [[L\u00e4ck\u00f6 Castle]], as well as at a medallion, and in 1681, she anonymously published the German language prayer book \u00bbDer geistlich-hungerigen seelen himmelisches manna\u00bb. In 1682, she wrote her own autobiography.\n\n==Family==\nMaria Euphrosyne married Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie on 7 March 1647. Of their eleven children, only three survived childhood, and only one (Hedvig Ebba), had issue; but her only child himself died childless.\n\n===Issue===\n#[[Gustaf Adolf De la Gardie]] (1647\u20131695), unmarried, no issue.\n#[[Catharina Charlotta De la Gardie (1655-1697)|Catharina Charlotta De la Gardie]] (1655-1697), married Count [[Otto Wilhelm K\u00f6nigsmarck]], no issue.\n#[[Hedvig Ebba De la Gardie]] (1657\u20131700 ), married Count Carl Gustaf Eriksson Oxenstierna af S\u00f6derm\u00f6re, and had one son, who died childless.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Maria Euphrosyne had a close relationship with her brother Charles, and did what she could to support his planned marriage with Christina.\n\n===During the Reign of Charles X and Charles XI===\nAt the coronation of her brother King Charles X Gustavus in 1654, Maria Euphrosyne was granted the rank and status of a Royal Princess of Sweden. This was opposed by some parts of the [[nobility]]. Maria Euphrosyne did not use the title of Countess, but was generally referred to as  Princess. Maria Euphrosyne visited both her spouse and her brother in warfare: she visited her spouse in Germany and, in 1656, in Riga in Swedish Livonia, from where she had to flee again with her courtiers after just two weeks when the Russians set fire to the city. During the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658-1660)]], she and her sister-in-law [[Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Hedvig Eleonora]] lived at Kronborg in Denmark after it had been taken by the Swedish general [[Carl Gustaf Wrangel]].<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Lundh-Eriksson, Nanna\n | title = Hedvig Eleonora\n | publisher =  Wahlstr\u00f6m & Widstrand\n | year = 1947\n | language = Swedish\n | isbn=}}</ref> In 1658, her brother King Charles told her that he wished to make her spouse [[Lord High Chancellor of Sweden]], but she convinced him not to by saying that Magnus Gabriel was more suited for military work. In 1660, she was present at the death bed of her brother in Gothenburg. He promised her great estates in Denmark, pensions for her children, and told her that he had named her consort Lord High Chancellor of Sweden in his will against her wish.\n\nMaria Euphrosyne was very active as a mediator and a spokesperson for supplicants who wished to speak to her spouse or to her brother the King (and later her nephew the King) on their behalf. This matters were not only small things, they also concerned women asking her to use her contacts to acquire offices of great political importance for their male relatives. In the same fashion, she acted as a mediator between her consort and the royal house, especially when he was out of favor. At [[Karlberg Palace]], she received her supplicants in a room with paintings of her royal brother and mother, with a door open to the room where her brother the King had slept when he was a guest in her house. Contemporary view was that her spouse had her to thank for his successful career.\n\nIn 1676, [[Lisbeth Carlsdotter]], a witness in a [[Witch-hunt|witch trial]] inspired by the famous [[G\u00e4vle-Boy]],tried to implicate Maria Euphrosyne and her sister-in-law [[Maria Sofia De la Gardie|Maria Sofia]] for sorcery. This accusations was not taken seriously, but instead discredited the credibility of Lisbeth Carlsdotter as a witness and eventually led to the whole trial being dissolved.\n\nIn 1680, her spouse fell in favor of her nephew, the monarch, after the death of [[Johan G\u00f6ransson Gyllenstierna]]. She was denied an audience with her nephew without witnesses and had no success in getting her spouse in favor. After she, by using her contacts, managed to get an audience in private with the King, however, she told him that she hoped Gyllenstierna was now in Hell, and the result was that her spouse was appointed [[Seneschal in Scandinavia|Seneschal]]. During the great reduction of her nephew King Charles XI in the 1680s, a lot of the property of the family was [[confiscation|confiscated]] by the crown. Maria Euphrosyne was not above using her status as the aunt of the King to avoid confiscation, but she was only moderately successful: in 1685, she was allowed to keep her own personal allowance and her favorite residence H\u00f6jentorp Castle, but the confiscation of her husband's property continued undisturbed. Maria Euphrosyne became a widow in 1686. This was in the middle of the reduction. The King refused to pay for the funeral of her spouse, and to stop the creditors from inventorying her own personal possessions and jewelry as well.\n\nMaria Euphrosyne was described as religious. She had her German saying \u00bbGott ist mir all\u00e9s\u00bb carved at a wall at [[L\u00e4ck\u00f6 Castle]], as well as at a medallion, and in 1681, she anonymously published the German language prayer book \u00bbDer geistlich-hungerigen seelen himmelisches manna\u00bb. In 1682, she wrote her own autobiography.\n\n==Family==\nMaria Euphrosyne married Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie on 7 March 1647. Of their eleven children, only three survived childhood, and only one (Hedvig Ebba), had issue; but her only child himself died childless.\n\n===Issue===\n#[[Gustaf Adolf De la Gardie]] (1647\u20131695), unmarried, no issue.\n#[[Catharina Charlotta De la Gardie (1655-1697)|Catharina Charlotta De la Gardie]] (1655-1697), married Count [[Otto Wilhelm K\u00f6nigsmarck]], no issue.\n#[[Hedvig Ebba De la Gardie]] (1657\u20131700 ), married Count Carl Gustaf Eriksson Oxenstierna af S\u00f6derm\u00f6re, and had one son, who died childless.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

After public announcement of the discovery, Lucy captured much public interest, becoming a household name at the time.\n\nLucy became famous worldwide, and the story of her discovery and reconstruction was published in a book by Johanson. Beginning in 2007, the fossil assembly and associated artifacts were exhibited publicly in an extended six-year tour of the United States; the exhibition was called ''Lucy's Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia.'' There was discussion of the risks of damage to the unique fossils, and other museums preferred to display casts of the fossil assembly.<ref name=bloom/> The original fossils were returned to Ethiopia in 2013, and subsequent exhibitions have used casts.\n\n==Discovery==\n{{Human timeline}}\nFrench [[geologist]] and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Maurice Taieb]] discovered the [[Hadar Formation]] for [[paleoanthropology]] in 1970 in the [[Afar Triangle]] of [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in [[Hararghe]] region; he recognized its potential as a likely repository of the fossils and artifacts of human origins. Taieb formed the International Afar Research Expedition (IARE) and invited three prominent international scientists to conduct research expeditions into the region. These were: [[Donald Johanson]], an American paleoanthropologist and curator at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]], who later founded the [[Institute of Human Origins]], now part of [[Arizona State University]]; [[Mary Leakey]], the noted British paleoanthropologist; and [[Yves Coppens]], a French paleoanthropologist now based at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] which is considered to be France's most prestigious research establishment. An expedition was soon mounted with four American and seven French participants; in the autumn of 1973 the team began surveying sites around Hadar for signs related to the origin of humans.<ref>{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|pp=154\u2013158}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lucy (Frankfurt am Main).jpg|thumb|left|Side view of cast of Lucy in the [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg]]]]\nIn November 1971, near the end of the first field season, Johanson noticed a fossil of the upper end of a [[shinbone]], which had been sliced slightly at the front. The lower end of a [[femur]] was found near it, and when he fitted them together, the angle of the knee joint clearly showed that this fossil, reference [[AL 129-1]], was an upright walking hominin. This fossil was later dated at more than three million years old\u2014much older than other hominin fossils known at the time. The site lay about {{convert|2.5|km}} from the site where \"Lucy\" subsequently was found, in a rock stratum {{convert|200|ft}} deeper than that in which the Lucy fragments were found.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/knee-joint/johanson1.html |title=Lucy's Knee Joint.

Then, on the morning of 24 November 1974, near the [[Awash River]], Johanson abandoned a plan to update his field notes and joined graduate student Tom Gray to search Locality 162 for bone fossils.{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=4}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=5}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=6}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=7}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=8}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=9}}\n\nBy Johanson's later (published) accounts, both he and Tom Gray spent two hours on the increasingly hot and arid plain, surveying the dusty terrain. On a hunch, Johanson decided to look at the bottom of a small [[gully]] that had been checked at least twice before by other workers. At first view nothing was immediately visible, but as they turned to leave a fossil caught Johanson's eye; an [[humerus|arm bone]] fragment was lying on the slope. Near it lay a fragment from the back of a small skull. They noticed part of a femur (thigh bone) a few feet (about one meter) away. As they explored further, they found more and more bones on the slope, including [[vertebra]]e, part of a [[pelvis]], [[rib]]s, and pieces of jaw. They marked the spot and returned to camp, excited at finding so many pieces apparently from one individual hominin.<ref name=iho1>{{cite web |url=https://iho.asu.edu/about/lucys-story |title=Lucy's Story |accessdate=2014-02-15 |work=[[Institute of Human Origins]]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>\n[[File:Lucy Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cast of Lucy in Mexico]]\n\nIn the afternoon, all members of the expedition returned to the gully to section off the site and prepare it for careful excavation and collection, which eventually took three weeks. That first evening they celebrated at the camp; at some stage during the evening they named fossil AL 288-1 \"Lucy\", after [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", which was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp.<ref name=\"Johanson 1981 22\">{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|p=22}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three weeks the team found several hundred pieces or fragments of bone with no duplication, confirming their original speculation that the pieces were from a single individual; ultimately, it was determined that an amazing 40 percent of a hominin skeleton was recovered at the site. Johanson assessed it as female based on the one complete pelvic bone and sacrum, which indicated the width of the pelvic opening.<ref name=\"Johanson 1981 22\"/>\n\nLucy was {{height|m=1.1|precision=0}} tall,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jungers |first=William L. |title=Lucy's length: Stature reconstruction in ''Australopithecus afarensis'' (A.L.288-1) with implications for other small-bodied hominids |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=227\u2013231 |pmid=3137822 |year=June 1988 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330760211}}</ref> weighed {{convert|29|kg|abbr=on}}, and (after reconstruction) looked somewhat like a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]].

Lucy the pre-human [[Hominidae|hominid]] and fossil hominin, captured much public notice; she became almost a household name at the time.

An even more complete skeleton of a related hominid, ''[[Ardipithecus]]'', was found in the same [[Awash River|Awash Valley]] in 1992. \"[[Ardi]]\", like \"Lucy\", was a [[Ardipithecus ramidus|hominid-becoming-hominin]] species, but, dated at {{Ma|4.4}}, it had evolved much earlier than the ''afarensis'' species.

These efforts were hindered by several factors: the rocks in the recovery area were chemically altered or reworked by volcanic activity; datable crystals were very scarce in the sample material; and there was a complete absence of pumice clasts at Hadar. (The Lucy skeleton occurs in the part of the Hadar sequence that accumulated with the fastest rate of deposition, which partly accounts for her excellent preservation.)\n\nFieldwork at Hadar was suspended in the winter of 1976\u201377. When it was resumed thirteen years later in 1990, the more precise [[Argon-argon dating|argon-argon technology]] had been updated by Derek York at the [[University of Toronto]]. By 1992 Aronson and Robert Walter had found  two suitable samples of [[volcanic ash]]\u2014the older layer of ash was about 18 m below the fossil and the younger layer was only one meter below, closely marking the age of deposition of the specimen. These samples were argon-argon dated by Walter in the geochronology laboratory of the Institute of Human Origins at 3.22 and 3.18 million years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=Robert C. |year=1994 |title=Age of Lucy and the First Family |journal=Geology |volume=22 |issue=January |pages=6\u201310 |bibcode = 1994Geo....22....6W |doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0006:AOLATF>2.3.CO;2 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable characteristics==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Ambulation===\n[[File:Lucy Skeleton.jpg|thumb|Lucy skeleton reconstruction at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] ]]\nOne of the most striking characteristics of the Lucy skeleton is a [[Genu valgum|valgus knee]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stern Jr. | first1 = J.

Though the sacrum was remarkably well preserved, the innominate was distorted, leading to two different reconstructions. The first reconstruction had little iliac flare and virtually no anterior wrap, creating an [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] that greatly resembled that of an ape. However, this reconstruction proved to be faulty, as the [[Superior pubic ramus|superior pubic rami]] would not have been able to connect were the right ilium identical to the left.\n\nA later reconstruction by [[Tim D. White|Tim White]] showed a broad iliac flare and a definite [[anterior wrap]], indicating that Lucy had an unusually broad inner [[Acetabulum|acetabular]] distance and unusually long superior pubic rami. Her [[pubic arch]] was over 90 degrees and derived; that is, similar to modern human females. Her acetabulum, however, was small and primitive.\n\n===Cranial specimens===\nThe [[Skull|cranial]] evidence recovered from Lucy is far less [[Synapomorphy#Derived trait|derived]] than her [[Postcrania|postcranium]]. Her [[neurocranium]] is small and [[primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]], while she possesses more spatulate [[Canine tooth|canines]] than other apes. The [[Brain size|cranial capacity]] was about 375 to 500&nbsp;cc.\n\n===Rib cage and plant-based diet===\n''Australopithecus afarensis'' seems to have had the same conical rib-cage found in today's non-human [[Hominidae|great apes]] (like the chimpanzee and gorilla), which allows room for a large stomach below and indicates the longer intestine needed for digesting voluminous plant matter. Fully 60% of the blood supply of non-human apes is used in the digestion process, greatly impeding the development of brain function (which is limited thereby to using about 10% of the circulation).

The only visible damage is a single carnivore tooth mark on the top of her left pubic bone, believed to have occurred at or around the time of death, but which is not necessarily related to her death. Her third molars were erupted and slightly worn and, therefore, it was concluded that she was fully matured with completed skeletal development. There are indications of degenerative disease to her vertebrae that do not necessarily indicate old age.

After public announcement of the discovery, Lucy captured much public interest, becoming a household name at the time.\n\nLucy became famous worldwide, and the story of her discovery and reconstruction was published in a book by Johanson. Beginning in 2007, the fossil assembly and associated artifacts were exhibited publicly in an extended six-year tour of the United States; the exhibition was called ''Lucy's Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia.'' There was discussion of the risks of damage to the unique fossils, and other museums preferred to display casts of the fossil assembly.<ref name=bloom/> The original fossils were returned to Ethiopia in 2013, and subsequent exhibitions have used casts.\n\n==Discovery==\n{{Human timeline}}\nFrench [[geologist]] and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Maurice Taieb]] discovered the [[Hadar Formation]] for [[paleoanthropology]] in 1970 in the [[Afar Triangle]] of [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in [[Hararghe]] region; he recognized its potential as a likely repository of the fossils and artifacts of human origins. Taieb formed the International Afar Research Expedition (IARE) and invited three prominent international scientists to conduct research expeditions into the region. These were: [[Donald Johanson]], an American paleoanthropologist and curator at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]], who later founded the [[Institute of Human Origins]], now part of [[Arizona State University]]; [[Mary Leakey]], the noted British paleoanthropologist; and [[Yves Coppens]], a French paleoanthropologist now based at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] which is considered to be France's most prestigious research establishment. An expedition was soon mounted with four American and seven French participants; in the autumn of 1973 the team began surveying sites around Hadar for signs related to the origin of humans.<ref>{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|pp=154\u2013158}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lucy (Frankfurt am Main).jpg|thumb|left|Side view of cast of Lucy in the [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg]]]]\nIn November 1971, near the end of the first field season, Johanson noticed a fossil of the upper end of a [[shinbone]], which had been sliced slightly at the front. The lower end of a [[femur]] was found near it, and when he fitted them together, the angle of the knee joint clearly showed that this fossil, reference [[AL 129-1]], was an upright walking hominin. This fossil was later dated at more than three million years old\u2014much older than other hominin fossils known at the time. The site lay about {{convert|2.5|km}} from the site where \"Lucy\" subsequently was found, in a rock stratum {{convert|200|ft}} deeper than that in which the Lucy fragments were found.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/knee-joint/johanson1.html |title=Lucy's Knee Joint.

Then, on the morning of 24 November 1974, near the [[Awash River]], Johanson abandoned a plan to update his field notes and joined graduate student Tom Gray to search Locality 162 for bone fossils.{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=4}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=5}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=6}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=7}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=8}}{{sfn|Johanson|Wong|2009|p=9}}\n\nBy Johanson's later (published) accounts, both he and Tom Gray spent two hours on the increasingly hot and arid plain, surveying the dusty terrain. On a hunch, Johanson decided to look at the bottom of a small [[gully]] that had been checked at least twice before by other workers. At first view nothing was immediately visible, but as they turned to leave a fossil caught Johanson's eye; an [[humerus|arm bone]] fragment was lying on the slope. Near it lay a fragment from the back of a small skull. They noticed part of a femur (thigh bone) a few feet (about one meter) away. As they explored further, they found more and more bones on the slope, including [[vertebra]]e, part of a [[pelvis]], [[rib]]s, and pieces of jaw. They marked the spot and returned to camp, excited at finding so many pieces apparently from one individual hominin.<ref name=iho1>{{cite web |url=https://iho.asu.edu/about/lucys-story |title=Lucy's Story |accessdate=2014-02-15 |work=[[Institute of Human Origins]]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>\n[[File:Lucy Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cast of Lucy in Mexico]]\n\nIn the afternoon, all members of the expedition returned to the gully to section off the site and prepare it for careful excavation and collection, which eventually took three weeks. That first evening they celebrated at the camp; at some stage during the evening they named fossil AL 288-1 \"Lucy\", after [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", which was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp.<ref name=\"Johanson 1981 22\">{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|p=22}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three weeks the team found several hundred pieces or fragments of bone with no duplication, confirming their original speculation that the pieces were from a single individual; ultimately, it was determined that an amazing 40 percent of a hominin skeleton was recovered at the site.

These efforts were hindered by several factors: the rocks in the recovery area were chemically altered or reworked by volcanic activity; datable crystals were very scarce in the sample material; and there was a complete absence of pumice clasts at Hadar. (The Lucy skeleton occurs in the part of the Hadar sequence that accumulated with the fastest rate of deposition, which partly accounts for her excellent preservation.)\n\nFieldwork at Hadar was suspended in the winter of 1976\u201377. When it was resumed thirteen years later in 1990, the more precise [[Argon-argon dating|argon-argon technology]] had been updated by Derek York at the [[University of Toronto]]. By 1992 Aronson and Robert Walter had found  two suitable samples of [[volcanic ash]]\u2014the older layer of ash was about 18 m below the fossil and the younger layer was only one meter below, closely marking the age of deposition of the specimen. These samples were argon-argon dated by Walter in the geochronology laboratory of the Institute of Human Origins at 3.22 and 3.18 million years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=Robert C. |year=1994 |title=Age of Lucy and the First Family |journal=Geology |volume=22 |issue=January |pages=6\u201310 |bibcode = 1994Geo....22....6W |doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0006:AOLATF>2.3.CO;2 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable characteristics==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Ambulation===\n[[File:Lucy Skeleton.jpg|thumb|Lucy skeleton reconstruction at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] ]]\nOne of the most striking characteristics of the Lucy skeleton is a [[Genu valgum|valgus knee]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stern Jr. | first1 = J.

Though the sacrum was remarkably well preserved, the innominate was distorted, leading to two different reconstructions. The first reconstruction had little iliac flare and virtually no anterior wrap, creating an [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] that greatly resembled that of an ape. However, this reconstruction proved to be faulty, as the [[Superior pubic ramus|superior pubic rami]] would not have been able to connect were the right ilium identical to the left.\n\nA later reconstruction by [[Tim D. White|Tim White]] showed a broad iliac flare and a definite [[anterior wrap]], indicating that Lucy had an unusually broad inner [[Acetabulum|acetabular]] distance and unusually long superior pubic rami. Her [[pubic arch]] was over 90 degrees and derived; that is, similar to modern human females. Her acetabulum, however, was small and primitive.\n\n===Cranial specimens===\nThe [[Skull|cranial]] evidence recovered from Lucy is far less [[Synapomorphy#Derived trait|derived]] than her [[Postcrania|postcranium]]. Her [[neurocranium]] is small and [[primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]], while she possesses more spatulate [[Canine tooth|canines]] than other apes. The [[Brain size|cranial capacity]] was about 375 to 500&nbsp;cc.\n\n===Rib cage and plant-based diet===\n''Australopithecus afarensis'' seems to have had the same conical rib-cage found in today's non-human [[Hominidae|great apes]] (like the chimpanzee and gorilla), which allows room for a large stomach below and indicates the longer intestine needed for digesting voluminous plant matter. Fully 60% of the blood supply of non-human apes is used in the digestion process, greatly impeding the development of brain function (which is limited thereby to using about 10% of the circulation). The heavier musculature of the jaws\u2014those muscles operating the intensive masticatory process for chewing plant material\u2014similarly would also limit development, here of the skull (braincase). During evolution of the human lineage these muscles seem to have weakened with the loss of the myosin gene [[MYH16 gene|MYH16]], a two base-pair deletion that occurred about 2.4 million years ago.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Other findings===\nA study of the [[mandible]] across a number of specimens of ''A. afarensis'' indicated that Lucy's jaw was rather unlike other hominins, having a more gorilla-like appearance.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF02380881| title = Critique of '''Australopithecus afarensis''' as a single species based on dental metrics and morphology| year = 1989| last1 = Ferguson | first1 = W.

The only visible damage is a single carnivore tooth mark on the top of her left pubic bone, believed to have occurred at or around the time of death, but which is not necessarily related to her death. Her third molars were erupted and slightly worn and, therefore, it was concluded that she was fully matured with completed skeletal development.

It started in 1853 and was in business until 1892. Its claim to fame is that it made the first commercially available steel in America. One of its first uses for this steel was that of making steel rails for railroad construction.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Eureka Iron Works historical marker Wyandotte Michigan.JPG|thumb|upright 0.90|<center> [https://www.michmarkers.com/default?page=S0158  Eureka Iron & Steel Works historical marker]]]\nPhilip Thurber, a businessman from the Detroit area, took a summer vacation in [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Michigan's Upper Peninsula]] in 1853. The discovery of iron ore in the [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette area]] where he was vacationing piqued his interest. He took some samples for testing and found them to be of unusually high quality. Philip then came up with the idea that perhaps some sort of new iron enterprise could be developed from this high quality iron ore. With a group of investors, the Eureka Iron Works company was then organized on October 15, 1853.<ref name=FirstAmericanSteel>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Detroit / Eureka Iron Works|publisher=Detroit Historical Society|accessdate=December 12, 2019 |year=2019|quote= On May 25, 1865, the company produced the first Bessemer steel rails.|url= https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/eureka-iron-works }}</ref> The new company consisted of ten stockholders.

That became the village of Wyandotte on December 12, 1854. It is today the city of [[Wyandotte, Michigan]]. That land was chosen because of the {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}} river frontage for receiving iron ore by ship from the [[Lake Superior]] region of the Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The land had timber that was used in making charcoal. It was not very far from limestone quarries, a product needed in making iron and steel.{{sfn|Woodford|2001|p=80}} The newly organized company made in 1855 a complex of buildings for the company and workmen.

It started in 1853 and was in business until 1892. Its claim to fame is that it made the first commercially available steel in America. One of its first uses for this steel was that of making steel rails for railroad construction.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Eureka Iron Works historical marker Wyandotte Michigan.JPG|thumb|upright 0.90|<center> [https://www.michmarkers.com/default?page=S0158  Eureka Iron & Steel Works historical marker]]]\nPhilip Thurber, a businessman from the Detroit area, took a summer vacation in [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Michigan's Upper Peninsula]] in 1853. The discovery of iron ore in the [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette area]] where he was vacationing piqued his interest. He took some samples for testing and found them to be of unusually high quality. Philip then came up with the idea that perhaps some sort of new iron enterprise could be developed from this high quality iron ore. With a group of investors, the Eureka Iron Works company was then organized on October 15, 1853.<ref name=FirstAmericanSteel>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Detroit / Eureka Iron Works|publisher=Detroit Historical Society|accessdate=December 12, 2019 |year=2019|quote= On May 25, 1865, the company produced the first Bessemer steel rails.|url= https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/eureka-iron-works }}</ref> The new company consisted of ten stockholders.

They decided on a {{convert|2200|acre|adj=on}} plot owned by [[John Biddle (Michigan politician)|Major John Biddle]] as a summer estate called \"Wyandotte.\" They purchased it at $20 per acre. That became the village of Wyandotte on December 12, 1854. It is today the city of [[Wyandotte, Michigan]]. That land was chosen because of the {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}} river frontage for receiving iron ore by ship from the [[Lake Superior]] region of the Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The land had timber that was used in making charcoal. It was not very far from limestone quarries, a product needed in making iron and steel.{{sfn|Woodford|2001|p=80}} The newly organized company made in 1855 a complex of buildings for the company and workmen. They also constructed a blast furnace and a bar mill known as the Wyandotte Rolling Mill which was a nearby spin-off company from the same owners of Eureka Iron Works. These two foundries were known as the Wyandotte Mills.{{sfn|Farmer|1890|p=1277}}\n\n== Steel rails ==\n[[File:Standard rail profile.png|thumb|upright 0.90| Steel [[rail profile]], nineteenth century]]\nThe Eureka Iron Works company in 1864 started manufacturing inexpensive steel [[ingot]]s.<ref name=FirstSteelIngots>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Fete Marks Inception of First Steel Ingots  |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/40465258/ |work= Lansing State Journal| page =3 |location=Lansing, Michigan|date=July 5, 1958 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}</ref> The ingots were made from poured molten steel from [[Bessemer process|Bessemer converter]]s.

Capital {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''C''}} are the angles, and lower-case {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} are the sides opposite them. ({{math|''a''}} opposite {{math|''A''}}, etc.)]]\n{{Trigonometry}}\nIn [[trigonometry]], the '''law of sines''', '''sine law''', '''sine formula''', or '''sine rule''' is an [[equation]] relating the [[lengths]] of the sides of a [[triangle]] (any shape) to the [[sine]]s of its angles. According to the law,\n\n:<math> \\frac{a}{\\sin A} \\,=\\, \\frac{b}{\\sin B} \\,=\\, \\frac{c}{\\sin C} \\,=\\, d, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and {{math|''A'', ''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} are the opposite angles (see the figure to the right), while {{math|''d''}} is the [[diameter]] of the triangle's [[circumcircle]]. When the last part of the equation is not used, the law is sometimes stated using the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]];\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\sin A}{a} \\,=\\, \\frac{\\sin B}{b} \\,=\\, \\frac{\\sin C}{c}. </math>\n\nThe law of sines can be used to compute the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known\u2014a technique known as [[triangulation]]. It can also be used when two sides and one of the non-enclosed angles are known. In some such cases, the triangle is not uniquely determined by this data (called the ''ambiguous case'') and the technique gives two possible values for the enclosed angle.\n\nThe law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations commonly applied to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles, with the other being the [[law of cosines]].\n\nThe law of sines can be generalized to higher dimensions on surfaces with constant curvature.<ref name=mathworld>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedLawofSines.html|website=mathworld|title=Generalized law of sines}}</ref>\n\n==Proof==\nThe area {{math|''T''}} of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height.  Selecting one side of the triangle as the base, the height of the triangle relative to that base is computed as the length of another side times the sine of the angle between the chosen side and the base.  Thus, depending on the selection of the base the area of the triangle can be written as any of:\n:<math>T = \\frac{1}{2}b(c \\sin A) = \\frac{1}{2}c(a \\sin B) = \\frac{1}{2}a(b \\sin C)\\,.</math>\nMultiplying these by {{math|{{sfrac|2|''abc''}}}} gives\n:<math>\\frac{2T}{abc} = \\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c}\\,.</math>\n\nLl\n\n==Examples==\nThe following are examples of how to solve a problem using the law of sines.\n\n===Example 1===\nGiven: side {{math|''a'' {{=}} 20}}, side {{math|''c'' {{=}} 24}}, and angle {{math|''C'' {{=}} 40\u00b0}}. Angle {{math|''A''}} is desired.\n\nUsing the law of sines, we conclude that\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sin A}{20} = \\frac{\\sin 40^\\circ}{24}.</math>\n\n:<math> A = \\arcsin\\left( \\frac{20\\sin 40^\\circ}{24} \\right) \\approx 32.39^\\circ. </math>\n\nNote that the potential solution {{math|1=''A'' = 147.61\u00b0}} is excluded because that would necessarily give {{math|1=''A'' + ''B'' + ''C'' > 180\u00b0}}.\n\n===Example 2===\nIf the lengths of two sides of the triangle {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are equal to {{math|''x''}}, the third side has length {{math|''c''}}, and the angles opposite the sides of lengths {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} respectively then\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& A = B = \\frac{180^\\circ-C}{2}= 90^\\circ-\\frac{C}{2} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\sin A = \\sin B = \\sin \\left(90^\\circ-\\frac{C}{2}\\right) = \\cos \\left(\\frac{C}{2}\\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{c}{\\sin C}=\\frac{a}{\\sin A}=\\frac{x}{\\cos \\left(\\frac{C}{2}\\right)} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{c \\cos \\left(\\frac{C}{2}\\right)}{\\sin C} = x\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==Relation to the circumcircle==\nIn the identity\n\n:<math> \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C},</math>\n\nthe common value of the three fractions is actually the [[diameter]] of the triangle's [[circumcircle]] which dates back to [[Ptolemy]].<ref>Coxeter, H.

Thus the angles {{math|''\u03b1''}}, {{math|''\u03b2''}}, and {{math|''\u03b3''}} are the angles {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, respectively. The arc {{math|BC}} subtends an angle of magnitude {{math|''a''}} at the centre. Introduce a Cartesian basis with {{math|'''OA'''}} along the {{math|''z''}}-axis and {{math|'''OB'''}} in the {{math|''xz''}}-plane making an angle {{math|''c''}} with the {{math|''z''}}-axis. The vector {{math|'''OC'''}} projects to {{math|ON}} in the {{math|''xy''}}-plane and the angle between {{math|ON}} and the {{math|''x''}}-axis is {{math|''A''}}. Therefore, the three vectors have components:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{OA} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sin c \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\cos c\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{OC} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sin b\\cos A \\\\ \\sin b\\sin A \\\\ \\cos b\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe [[scalar triple product]], {{math|'''OA''' \u00b7 ('''OB''' \u00d7 '''OC''')}} is the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] formed by the position vectors of the vertices of the spherical triangle {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}}. This volume is invariant to the specific coordinate system used to represent {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}}. The value of the [[scalar triple product]] {{math|'''OA''' \u00b7 ('''OB''' \u00d7 '''OC''')}} is the 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3 determinant with {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}} as its rows.  With the {{math|''z''}}-axis along {{math|'''OA'''}} the square of this determinant is\n:<math>\t\n\\begin{align}\n\\bigl(\\mathbf{OA} \\cdot (\\mathbf{OB} \\times \\mathbf{OC})\\bigr)^2 & = \\bigl(\\det (\\mathbf{OA}, \\mathbf{OB}, \\mathbf{OC})\\bigr)^2 \\\\[4pt]\n& =  \\left( \\begin{vmatrix} \n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \t \t\n\\sin c & 0 & \\cos c \\\\ \t\n\\sin b \\cos A & \\sin b \\sin A & \\cos b \t\n\\end{vmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\left(\\sin b \\sin c \\sin A\\right)^2.\n\\end{align}</math>\nRepeating this calculation with the {{math|''z''}}-axis along {{math|'''OB'''}} gives {{math|(sin ''c'' sin ''a'' sin ''B'')<sup>2</sup>}}, while with the {{math|''z''}}-axis along {{math|'''OC'''}} it is {{math|(sin ''a'' sin ''b'' sin ''C'')<sup>2</sup>}}.

({{math|''a''}} opposite {{math|''A''}}, etc.)]]\n{{Trigonometry}}\nIn [[trigonometry]], the '''law of sines''', '''sine law''', '''sine formula''', or '''sine rule''' is an [[equation]] relating the [[lengths]] of the sides of a [[triangle]] (any shape) to the [[sine]]s of its angles. According to the law,\n\n:<math> \\frac{a}{\\sin A} \\,=\\, \\frac{b}{\\sin B} \\,=\\, \\frac{c}{\\sin C} \\,=\\, d, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and {{math|''A'', ''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} are the opposite angles (see the figure to the right), while {{math|''d''}} is the [[diameter]] of the triangle's [[circumcircle]]. When the last part of the equation is not used, the law is sometimes stated using the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]];\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\sin A}{a} \\,=\\, \\frac{\\sin B}{b} \\,=\\, \\frac{\\sin C}{c}. </math>\n\nThe law of sines can be used to compute the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known\u2014a technique known as [[triangulation]]. It can also be used when two sides and one of the non-enclosed angles are known. In some such cases, the triangle is not uniquely determined by this data (called the ''ambiguous case'') and the technique gives two possible values for the enclosed angle.\n\nThe law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations commonly applied to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles, with the other being the [[law of cosines]].\n\nThe law of sines can be generalized to higher dimensions on surfaces with constant curvature.<ref name=mathworld>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedLawofSines.html|website=mathworld|title=Generalized law of sines}}</ref>\n\n==Proof==\nThe area {{math|''T''}} of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height.  Selecting one side of the triangle as the base, the height of the triangle relative to that base is computed as the length of another side times the sine of the angle between the chosen side and the base.  Thus, depending on the selection of the base the area of the triangle can be written as any of:\n:<math>T = \\frac{1}{2}b(c \\sin A) = \\frac{1}{2}c(a \\sin B) = \\frac{1}{2}a(b \\sin C)\\,.</math>\nMultiplying these by {{math|{{sfrac|2|''abc''}}}} gives\n:<math>\\frac{2T}{abc} = \\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c}\\,.</math>\n\n==The ambiguous case of triangle solution==\nWhen using the law of sines to find a side of a triangle, an ambiguous case occurs when two separate triangles can be constructed from the data provided (i.e., there are two different possible solutions to the triangle). In the case shown below they are triangles {{math|''ABC''}} and {{math|''AB\u2032C\u2032''}}.\n\n:[[File:PictureAmbitext.svg]]\n\nGiven a general triangle, the following conditions would need to be fulfilled for the case to be ambiguous:\n* The only information known about the triangle is the angle {{math|''A''}} and the sides {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''c''}}.\n* The angle {{math|''A''}} is [[Angle#Types of angles|acute]] (i.e., {{math|''A''}} < 90\u00b0).\n* The side {{math|''a''}} is shorter than the side {{math|''c''}} (i.e., {{math|''a'' < ''c''}}).\n* The side {{math|''a''}} is longer than the altitude {{math|''h''}} from angle {{math|''B''}}, where {{math|''h'' {{=}} ''c'' sin ''A''}} (i.e., {{math|''a'' > ''h''}}).\n\nIf all the above conditions are true, then each of angles {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''C\u2032''}} produces a valid triangle, meaning that both of the following are true:\n\n:<math> C' = \\arcsin\\frac{c \\sin A}{a} \\text{ or } C = \\pi - \\arcsin\\frac{c \\sin A}{a}.</math>\n\nFrom there we can find the corresponding {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''b''}} or {{math|''B\u2032''}} and {{math|''b\u2032''}} if required, where {{math|''b''}} is the side bounded by angles {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''b\u2032''}} bounded by {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C\u2032''}}.\n\nWithout further information it is impossible to decide which is the triangle being asked for.\n\n==Examples==\nThe following are examples of how to solve a problem using the law of sines.\n\n===Example 1===\nGiven: side {{math|''a'' {{=}} 20}}, side {{math|''c'' {{=}} 24}}, and angle {{math|''C'' {{=}} 40\u00b0}}.

The arc {{math|BC}} subtends an angle of magnitude {{math|''a''}} at the centre. Introduce a Cartesian basis with {{math|'''OA'''}} along the {{math|''z''}}-axis and {{math|'''OB'''}} in the {{math|''xz''}}-plane making an angle {{math|''c''}} with the {{math|''z''}}-axis. The vector {{math|'''OC'''}} projects to {{math|ON}} in the {{math|''xy''}}-plane and the angle between {{math|ON}} and the {{math|''x''}}-axis is {{math|''A''}}.
