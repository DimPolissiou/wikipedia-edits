Ivan served as the co-ruler and [[regent]] for his blind father [[Vasily II]] from the mid-1450s before he officially ascended the throne in 1462.\n\nSometimes referred to as the \"gatherer of the Russian lands\", he tripled the territory of his state, ended the dominance of the Mongols/Tatars over Russia, renovated the [[Moscow Kremlin]], introduced [[Sudebnik of 1497|new legal codex]] and laid the foundations of the Russian [[Sovereign state|state]]. [[Great Stand on the Ugra River|His 1480 victory]] over the [[Great Horde]] is cited as the restoring of Russian independence 240 years after the fall of Kiev to Mongols' invasion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Kort|title=A Brief History of Russia|isbn=9781438108292|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=26}}</ref>\n\nIvan was the first Russian ruler to style himself \"[[tsar]]\", albeit not as an official title. Through marriage to [[Sofia Paleologue]], he made the [[double-headed eagle]] [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russia's coat of arms]] and adopted the idea of [[Moscow as Third Rome]]. His 43-year reign was one of the longest [[List of Russian rulers|in Russian history]], second only to his grandson [[Ivan IV]].\n\n==Gathering of Rus' lands==\nIvan's rule is marked by what some historians called 'the Gathering of the Russian Lands'. Ivan brought the independent duchies (knia\u017eestva) of different [[Rurikid]] princes under the direct control of Moscow, leaving the princes and their posterity without royal titles or land inheritance. His first enterprise was a war with the [[Republic of Novgorod]], with which [[Muscovy]] (''Moscow'') as a Northern district of Golden Horde had fought a series of wars stretching back to at least the reign of [[Dmitry Donskoi]]. These wars were waged over Moscow's religious and political sovereignty, and over Moscow's efforts to seize land in the [[Northern Dvina]] region.<ref>Michael C. Paul, \"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod up to the Muscovite Conquest,\" ''Kritika''  (2007) 8#2 pp:131\u2013170.</ref> Alarmed at the growing power of Moscow, Novgorod had negotiated with the Grand Duchy of [[Lithuania]] and Rus in the hope of placing itself under the protection of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]], [[King of Poland]] and Grand Prince of Lithuania, a would-be alliance that was proclaimed by the Moscow rulers as an act of [[apostasy]] from [[Orthodoxy]] (in part, because the Polish king was a Catholic).<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 261.</ref> Ivan took the field against Novgorod in 1470, and after his generals had twice defeated the forces of the republic \u2014 at the [[Battle of Shelon]] River and on the [[Northern Dvina]], both in the summer of 1471 \u2014 the [[Novgorod]]ians were forced to sue for peace, agreeing to abandon their overtures to Lithuania and to cede a considerable portion of their northern territories, while paying a war indemnity of 15,500 [[rouble]]s.\n\nIvan visited Novgorod several times in the next several years, persecuting a number of pro-Lithuanian [[boyars]] and confiscating their lands. In 1477, two Novgorodian envoys, claiming to have been sent by the archbishops and the entire city, addressed Ivan in public audience as ''Gosudar'' (sovereign) instead of the usual ''Gospodin'' (sir).<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 264.</ref> Ivan at once seized upon this as a recognition of his sovereignty, and when the Novgorodians repudiated the envoys (indeed, one was killed at the [[veche]] and several others of the pro-Moscow faction were killed with him) and swore openly in front of the Moscow ambassadors that they would turn to Lithuania again, he marched against them. Deserted by Casimir and surrounded on every side by the Moscow armies, which occupied the major monasteries around the city, Novgorod ultimately recognized Ivan's direct rule over the city and its vast hinterland in a document signed and sealed by Archbishop Feofil of Novgorod (1470\u20131480) on 15 January 1478.<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 268.</ref>\n\n[[File:LebedevK UnichNovgrodVecha.jpg|250px|thumb|Ivan's destruction of the [[Novgorod]] assembly]]\n\nIvan dispossessed Novgorod of more than four-fifths of its land, keeping half for himself and giving the other half to his allies.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 93</ref> Subsequent revolts (1479\u20131488) were punished by the removal en masse of the richest and most ancient families of Novgorod to Moscow, [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]], and other north-eastern Rus' cities. Archbishop Feofil was also removed to Moscow for plotting against the Grand Prince.<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 267.</ref> The rival republic of [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] owed the continuance of its own political existence to the readiness with which it assisted Ivan against its ancient enemy. The other principalities were eventually absorbed by conquest, purchase, or marriage contract: The [[Principality of Yaroslavl]] in 1463, [[Rostov]] in 1474, [[Prince of Tver|Tver]] in 1485, and [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]] 1489.\n\nIvan's refusal to share his conquests with his brothers, and his subsequent interference with the internal politics of their inherited principalities, involved him in several wars with them, from which, though the princes were assisted by Lithuania, he emerged victorious. Finally, Ivan's new rule of government, formally set forth in his last will to the effect that the domains of all his kinsfolk, after their deaths, should pass directly to the reigning [[List of Russian rulers|Grand Duke]] instead of reverting, as hitherto, to the princes' heirs, put an end once and for all to these semi-independent princelings.\n\nIvan had four brothers. The eldest, Yury, died childless on 12 September 1472. He only had a draft of a will that said nothing about his land. Ivan seized the land, much to the fury of the surviving brothers, whom he placated with some land. Boris and Andrei the Elder signed treaties with Vasily in February and September 1473. They agreed to protect each other's land and not to have secret dealings with foreign states; they broke this clause in 1480, fleeing to Lithuania. It is unknown whether Andrei the Younger signed a treaty. He died in 1481, leaving his lands to Ivan. In 1491 Andrei the Elder was arrested by Ivan for refusing to aid the [[Crimean Khanate]] against the [[Golden Horde]]. He died in prison in 1493, and Ivan seized his land. In 1494 Boris, the only brother able to pass his land to his sons, died. However, their land reverted to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsar]] upon their deaths in 1503 and 1515 respectively.<ref>Donald Ostowski, \"The Growth of Moscovy, (1462\u20131533)\" in Maureen Perrie, ed., ''The Cambridge History of Russia'' (2006) vol. I pages 222\u20133</ref>\n\nThere was one semi-autonomous prince in Muscovy when Ivan acceded: Prince Mikhail Andreevich of Vereia, who had been awarded an [[Appanage]] by [[Vasily II]]. In 1478 he was pressured into giving [[Belozersk]] to Ivan, who got all of Mikhail's land on his death in 1486.<ref>Donald Ostowski, The Cambridge History of Russia vol. I page 224</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy==\n[[File:Seal of Ivan 3 (reverse).svg|thumb|200px|left|Reverse of Ivan III's [[seal (emblem)|seal]] from 1472, after his marriage with Sophia Palaiologina]]\n[[File:Muscovy 1390 1525.png|thumb|Territory acquired by 1505 under Ivan III]]\n\nThe character of the government of Moscow changed significantly under Ivan III, taking on a new [[autocracy|autocratic]] form. This was a natural consequence of the [[hegemony]] of Moscow over the other [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] lands, but also to new imperial pretensions. After the [[fall of Constantinople]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodox]] canonists were inclined to regard the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Princes of Moscow]], where the Orthodox Metropolitan of [[Kiev]] moved in 1325 after the Mongol Invasions, as the successors of the [[Byzantine emperors]]. Ivan himself appeared to welcome the idea, and he began to style himself tsar in foreign correspondence. The British historian J. L. I. Fennell emphasizes Ivan's success in centralizing control over local rulers; he adds, however, that his reign was also \"a period of cultural depression and spiritual barrenness. Freedom was stamped out within the Muscovite lands. By his [[anti-Catholicism]] Ivan brought down the curtain between Muscovy and the west. For the sake of territorial aggrandizement he deprived his country of the fruits of Western learning and civilization.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated354\">J. L. I. Fennell, ''Ivan the Great of Moscow'' (1961) p 354</ref>\n\nThis movement coincided with a change in the family circumstances of Ivan III. After the death of his first consort, [[Maria of Tver]] (1467), and at the suggestion of [[Pope Paul II]] (1469), who hoped thereby to bind Muscovy to the [[Holy See]], Ivan III wedded [[Sophia Palaiologina]] (also known under her original name Zoe), daughter of [[Thomas Palaeologus]], despot of [[Morea]], who claimed the throne of Constantinople as the brother of [[Constantine XI]], the last Byzantine emperor. Frustrating the Pope's hopes of reuniting the two faiths, the princess endorsed [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Russia|Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Due to her family traditions, she encouraged imperial ideas in the mind of her consort. It was through her influence that the ceremonious [[etiquette]] of Constantinople (along with the imperial [[two-headed eagle|double-headed eagle]] and all that it implied) was adopted by the court of Moscow.\n\n[[File:Palais \u00e0 facettes.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Facets]] (1487\u201391) was commissioned by Ivan to Italian architects.]]\n[[File:Dormition (Kremlin).JPG|thumb|[[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|The Dormition Cathedral]] by Fioravanti laid claim as the mother church of all Rus'.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Simon Franklin|author2=Emma Widdis|title=National Identity in Russian Culture: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3q84rTm5ksC&pg=PA172|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=172|isbn=9780521024297}}</ref>]]\n\nIvan's son with [[Maria of Tver]], [[Ivan the Young]], died in 1490, leaving from his marriage with [[Helen of Moldavia]] an only child, [[Dmitry Ivanovich (grandson of Ivan III)|Dmitry the Grandson]].<ref>''The Dynastic Crisis 1497\u20131502'', J.

The decision was dictated by the crisis connected with the [[Sect of Skhariya the Jew]], as well as by the imperial prestige of Sophia's descendants. Dmitry the Grandson was put into prison, where he died, unmarried and childless, in 1509,<ref>''Reinventing the Russian Monarchy in the 1550s: Ivan the Terrible, the Dynasty, and the Church'', Sergei Bogatyrev, '''The Slavonic and East European Review''', Vol. 85, No. 2 (Apr., 2007), 283 note51.</ref> already under the rule of his uncle.\n\nThe Grand Duke increasingly held aloof from his boyars. The old patriarchal systems of government vanished. The boyars were no longer consulted on affairs of state. The sovereign became sacrosanct, while the boyars were reduced to dependency on the will of the sovereign. The boyars naturally resented this revolution and struggled against it.\n\nIt was in the reign of Ivan III that the new Muscovite [[Sudebnik]], or law code, was compiled by the scribe [[Vladimir Gusev (scribe)|Vladimir Gusev]]. Ivan did his utmost to make his capital a worthy successor to [[Constantinople]], and with that object invited many foreign masters and artificers to settle in Moscow. The most noted of these was the Italian [[Aristotele Fioravanti|Ridolfo di Fioravante]], nicknamed \"Aristotle\" because of his extraordinary knowledge, who built several cathedrals and palaces in the Kremlin, and also supervised the construction of the Kremlin walls.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dmitri\u012d Olegovich Shvidkovski\u012d|title=Russian Architecture and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQy9TJ2yOQEC&pg=PA81|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=81\u201382|isbn=978-0300109122}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy==\nMuscovy rejected the [[Tatar yoke]] during the reign of Ivan III. In 1476, Ivan refused to pay the customary tribute to the grand [[Akhmat Khan|Khan Ahmed]], and in 1480 Ahmed Khan organized a military campaign against Muscovy.  Throughout the autumn the Muscovy and Tatar hosts [[Great stand on the Ugra river|confronted each other on opposite sides of the Ugra]] River, till 11 November 1480 when Ahmed retreated into the [[steppe]].\n\nIn the following year the [[Grand Khan]], while preparing a second expedition against Moscow, was suddenly attacked, routed and slain by Ivak, the Khan of the [[Nogay Horde]], whereupon the Golden Horde suddenly fell to pieces. In 1487 Ivan reduced the khanate of Kazan, one of the offshoots of the Horde, to the condition of a [[Vassal state|vassal-state]], though in his later years it [[Russo-Kazan Wars|broke away from his suzerainty]]. With the other Muslim powers, the Khan of the [[Crimean Khanate]] and the sultans of Ottoman Empire, Ivan's relations were peaceful and even amicable. The Crimean Khan, [[Me\u00f1li I Giray]], helped him against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and facilitated the opening of diplomatic relations between Moscow and Constantinople, where the first Muscovian embassy appeared in 1495.\n\n[[File:Ivan vs khan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Ivan III tearing the khan's letter to pieces'', an [[apocrypha]]l 19th-century painting by [[Aleksey Kivshenko]].]]\n[[File:M\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly k\u00f6vets\u00e9ge 1488-ban, III.

The first attempt at forging an alliance was made by [[Alexander I of Kakheti|Alexander I]], king of a small [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[kingdom of Kakheti]], who dispatched two embassies, in 1483 and 1491, to Moscow. However, as the Muscovites were still too far from the Caucasus, neither of these missions had any effect on the course of events in the region. In 1488, Ivan sought gun-founders, master-gunners for siege cannons, gold- and silversmiths and (Italian) master builders from [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]].<ref>{{cite book|author=William Monter|title=Cultural Exchange in Early Modern Europe, Volume 4|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2006|page=81|isbn=9780521855532|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vdqeC14parkC&pg=PA81&dq=%22Ivan+III%22+1488+Corvinus#v=onepage&q=%22Ivan%20III%22%201488%20Corvinus&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scitech.mtesz.hu/51landmark |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025033234/http://www.scitech.mtesz.hu/51landmark/ |archivedate=2008-10-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00e1nos Szendrei|title=R\u00e9gi k\u00e9p M\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly oroszorsz\u00e1gi k\u00f6vets\u00e9g\u00e9r\u0151l|publisher=Archaeologiai \u00c9rtes\u00edt\u0151|year=1905|pages=137\u2013146|url=http://real-j.mtak.hu/332/1/ARCHERT_1905_uf_025.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn Nordic affairs, Ivan III concluded an offensive alliance with [[Hans of Denmark]] and maintained regular correspondence with Emperor Maximilian I, who called him a \"brother\". He built a strong citadel in [[Ingria]], named [[Ivangorod fortress|Ivangorod]] after himself, situated on the Russian-Estonian border, opposite the fortress of [[Narva]] held by the [[Livonian Confederation]]. In the [[Russo-Swedish War (1495\u20131497)]] Ivan III unsuccessfully attempted to conquer [[Vyborg|Viborg]] from Sweden, but this attempt was checked by the Swedish garrison in [[Viborg Castle]] led by Lord [[Knut Posse]].\n\nThe further extension of the Moscow dominion was facilitated by the death of Casimir IV in 1492, when Poland and Lithuania once again parted company. The throne of Lithuania was now occupied by Casimir's son [[Alexander of Poland|Alexander]], a weak and lethargic prince so incapable of defending his possessions against the persistent attacks of the Muscovites that he attempted to save them by a matrimonial compact, wedding [[Helena of Moscow|Helena]], Ivan's daughter. But the clear determination of Ivan to appropriate as much of Lithuania as possible finally compelled Alexander to take up arms against his father-in-law in 1499. The Lithuanians were routed at the [[Battle of Vedrosha]] on 14 July 1500, and in 1503 Alexander was glad to purchase peace by ceding to Ivan [[Chernigov]], [[Starodub]], [[Novgorod-Seversky]] and sixteen other towns.<ref>Much information on Ivan III and his court is contained in [[Sigismund von Herberstein]], ''[[Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]]'' (1549).</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:1000 Ivan III.jpg|thumb|Ivan III on the \"[[Millennium of Russia]]\" monument in Veliky Novgorod]]\n\nIvan conquered or brought under his control the lands of north-eastern Rus', marking the beginning of Muscovite dominance over Rus' territory. Ivan arguably became best known for his consolidation of Muscovite rule. His predecessors had increased Moscow's territory from less than 600 square miles under Ivan II (reigned 1353\u201359) to more than 15,000 square miles at the end of Vasily II's reign. It remained for Ivan III to absorb Moscow's old rivals, Novgorod and Tver, and establish virtually a single rule over what had been [[appanage]]s of Rus'. Although the circumstances surrounding the acquisitions varied, the results were basically the same: former sovereign or semi-autonomous principalities were reduced to the status of provinces of Moscow, while their princes joined the ranks of the Muscovite service nobility.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife in 1467, Ivan married (1472) [[Sophia Palaiologina|Sophia (Zo\u00eb) Palaiologina]], a Byzantine princess and niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine XI]] (killed in battle in 1453). The Vatican sponsored the marriage in hope of bringing Russia under the sway of the Pope and of establishing a broad front against the Turks, a goal that failed. From Ivan's point of view, the marriage fit well into the general trend of elevating the Muscovite ruler.\n\nFollowing his second marriage, Ivan developed a complicated court ceremonial on the Byzantine model and began to use the title of \"Tsar and Autocrat\". Also during the reign of Ivan and his son, Vasily III, Moscow came to be referred to by spokesmen as the [[Third Rome]]. [[Philotheus of Pskov|Philotheos]], a monk from Pskov, developed the idea of Moscow as the true successor to Byzantium and, hence, to Rome.\n\nAn impressive building program in Moscow took place under Ivan, directed primarily by Italian artists and craftsmen. New buildings were erected in the Kremlin, and the Kremlin walls were strengthened and furnished with towers and gates. In 1475, Ivan III established the first cannon foundry of Russia in Moscow, which started the native cannon production.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Alan Hosking|title=Russia and the Russians: A History|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/russiarussianshi00hosk/page/91 91]|isbn=9780674004733|url=https://archive.org/details/russiarussianshi00hosk|url-access=registration|quote=first cannon foundry was set up in moscow.|author-link=Geoffrey Alan Hosking}}</ref> Ivan died on 27 October 1505, and was succeeded by his son, Vasily III.\n\n==Further reading on Ivan III==\nThe only biography in English of Ivan is J.

Ivan served as the co-ruler and [[regent]] for his blind father [[Vasily II]] from the mid-1450s before he officially ascended the throne in 1462.\n\nSometimes referred to as the \"gatherer of the Russian lands\", he tripled the territory of his state, ended the dominance of the Mongols/Tatars over Russia, renovated the [[Moscow Kremlin]], introduced [[Sudebnik of 1497|new legal codex]] and laid the foundations of the Russian [[Sovereign state|state]]. [[Great Stand on the Ugra River|His 1480 victory]] over the [[Great Horde]] is cited as the restoring of Russian independence 240 years after the fall of Kiev to Mongols' invasion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Kort|title=A Brief History of Russia|isbn=9781438108292|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=26}}</ref>\n\nIvan was the first Russian ruler to style himself \"[[tsar]]\", albeit not as an official title. Through marriage to [[Sofia Paleologue]], he made the [[double-headed eagle]] [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russia's coat of arms]] and adopted the idea of [[Moscow as Third Rome]]. His 43-year reign was one of the longest [[List of Russian rulers|in Russian history]], second only to his grandson [[Ivan IV]].\n\n==Gathering of Rus' lands==\nIvan's rule is marked by what some historians called 'the Gathering of the Russian Lands'. Ivan brought the independent duchies (knia\u017eestva) of different [[Rurikid]] princes under the direct control of Moscow, leaving the princes and their posterity without royal titles or land inheritance. His first enterprise was a war with the [[Republic of Novgorod]], with which [[Muscovy]] (''Moscow'') as a Northern district of Golden Horde had fought a series of wars stretching back to at least the reign of [[Dmitry Donskoi]]. These wars were waged over Moscow's religious and political sovereignty, and over Moscow's efforts to seize land in the [[Northern Dvina]] region.<ref>Michael C. Paul, \"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod up to the Muscovite Conquest,\" ''Kritika''  (2007) 8#2 pp:131\u2013170.</ref> Alarmed at the growing power of Moscow, Novgorod had negotiated with the Grand Duchy of [[Lithuania]] and Rus in the hope of placing itself under the protection of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]], [[King of Poland]] and Grand Prince of Lithuania, a would-be alliance that was proclaimed by the Moscow rulers as an act of [[apostasy]] from [[Orthodoxy]] (in part, because the Polish king was a Catholic).<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 261.</ref> Ivan took the field against Novgorod in 1470, and after his generals had twice defeated the forces of the republic \u2014 at the [[Battle of Shelon]] River and on the [[Northern Dvina]], both in the summer of 1471 \u2014 the [[Novgorod]]ians were forced to sue for peace, agreeing to abandon their overtures to Lithuania and to cede a considerable portion of their northern territories, while paying a war indemnity of 15,500 [[rouble]]s.\n\nIvan visited Novgorod several times in the next several years, persecuting a number of pro-Lithuanian [[boyars]] and confiscating their lands. In 1477, two Novgorodian envoys, claiming to have been sent by the archbishops and the entire city, addressed Ivan in public audience as ''Gosudar'' (sovereign) instead of the usual ''Gospodin'' (sir).<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 264.</ref> Ivan at once seized upon this as a recognition of his sovereignty, and when the Novgorodians repudiated the envoys (indeed, one was killed at the [[veche]] and several others of the pro-Moscow faction were killed with him) and swore openly in front of the Moscow ambassadors that they would turn to Lithuania again, he marched against them. Deserted by Casimir and surrounded on every side by the Moscow armies, which occupied the major monasteries around the city, Novgorod ultimately recognized Ivan's direct rule over the city and its vast hinterland in a document signed and sealed by Archbishop Feofil of Novgorod (1470\u20131480) on 15 January 1478.<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 268.</ref>\n\n[[File:LebedevK UnichNovgrodVecha.jpg|250px|thumb|Ivan's destruction of the [[Novgorod]] assembly]]\n\nIvan dispossessed Novgorod of more than four-fifths of its land, keeping half for himself and giving the other half to his allies.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 93</ref> Subsequent revolts (1479\u20131488) were punished by the removal en masse of the richest and most ancient families of Novgorod to Moscow, [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]], and other north-eastern Rus' cities. Archbishop Feofil was also removed to Moscow for plotting against the Grand Prince.<ref>Paul, \"Secular Power,\" 267.</ref> The rival republic of [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] owed the continuance of its own political existence to the readiness with which it assisted Ivan against its ancient enemy. The other principalities were eventually absorbed by conquest, purchase, or marriage contract: The [[Principality of Yaroslavl]] in 1463, [[Rostov]] in 1474, [[Prince of Tver|Tver]] in 1485, and [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]] 1489.\n\nIvan's refusal to share his conquests with his brothers, and his subsequent interference with the internal politics of their inherited principalities, involved him in several wars with them, from which, though the princes were assisted by Lithuania, he emerged victorious. Finally, Ivan's new rule of government, formally set forth in his last will to the effect that the domains of all his kinsfolk, after their deaths, should pass directly to the reigning [[List of Russian rulers|Grand Duke]] instead of reverting, as hitherto, to the princes' heirs, put an end once and for all to these semi-independent princelings.\n\nIvan had four brothers. The eldest, Yury, died childless on 12 September 1472. He only had a draft of a will that said nothing about his land. Ivan seized the land, much to the fury of the surviving brothers, whom he placated with some land. Boris and Andrei the Elder signed treaties with Vasily in February and September 1473. They agreed to protect each other's land and not to have secret dealings with foreign states; they broke this clause in 1480, fleeing to Lithuania. It is unknown whether Andrei the Younger signed a treaty. He died in 1481, leaving his lands to Ivan. In 1491 Andrei the Elder was arrested by Ivan for refusing to aid the [[Crimean Khanate]] against the [[Golden Horde]]. He died in prison in 1493, and Ivan seized his land. In 1494 Boris, the only brother able to pass his land to his sons, died. However, their land reverted to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsar]] upon their deaths in 1503 and 1515 respectively.<ref>Donald Ostowski, \"The Growth of Moscovy, (1462\u20131533)\" in Maureen Perrie, ed., ''The Cambridge History of Russia'' (2006) vol.

In 1478 he was pressured into giving [[Belozersk]] to Ivan, who got all of Mikhail's land on his death in 1486.<ref>Donald Ostowski, The Cambridge History of Russia vol.

This was a natural consequence of the [[hegemony]] of Moscow over the other [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] lands, but also to new imperial pretensions. After the [[fall of Constantinople]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodox]] canonists were inclined to regard the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Princes of Moscow]], where the Orthodox Metropolitan of [[Kiev]] moved in 1325 after the Mongol Invasions, as the successors of the [[Byzantine emperors]]. Ivan himself appeared to welcome the idea, and he began to style himself tsar in foreign correspondence. The British historian J. L. I. Fennell emphasizes Ivan's success in centralizing control over local rulers; he adds, however, that his reign was also \"a period of cultural depression and spiritual barrenness. Freedom was stamped out within the Muscovite lands. By his [[anti-Catholicism]] Ivan brought down the curtain between Muscovy and the west. For the sake of territorial aggrandizement he deprived his country of the fruits of Western learning and civilization.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated354\">J. L. I. Fennell, ''Ivan the Great of Moscow'' (1961) p 354</ref>\n\nThis movement coincided with a change in the family circumstances of Ivan III. After the death of his first consort, [[Maria of Tver]] (1467), and at the suggestion of [[Pope Paul II]] (1469), who hoped thereby to bind Muscovy to the [[Holy See]], Ivan III wedded [[Sophia Palaiologina]] (also known under her original name Zoe), daughter of [[Thomas Palaeologus]], despot of [[Morea]], who claimed the throne of Constantinople as the brother of [[Constantine XI]], the last Byzantine emperor. Frustrating the Pope's hopes of reuniting the two faiths, the princess endorsed [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Russia|Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Due to her family traditions, she encouraged imperial ideas in the mind of her consort. It was through her influence that the ceremonious [[etiquette]] of Constantinople (along with the imperial [[two-headed eagle|double-headed eagle]] and all that it implied) was adopted by the court of Moscow.\n\n[[File:Palais \u00e0 facettes.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Facets]] (1487\u201391) was commissioned by Ivan to Italian architects.]]\n[[File:Dormition (Kremlin).JPG|thumb|[[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|The Dormition Cathedral]] by Fioravanti laid claim as the mother church of all Rus'.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Simon Franklin|author2=Emma Widdis|title=National Identity in Russian Culture: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3q84rTm5ksC&pg=PA172|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=172|isbn=9780521024297}}</ref>]]\n\nIvan's son with [[Maria of Tver]], [[Ivan the Young]], died in 1490, leaving from his marriage with [[Helen of Moldavia]] an only child, [[Dmitry Ivanovich (grandson of Ivan III)|Dmitry the Grandson]].<ref>''The Dynastic Crisis 1497\u20131502'', J.

The old patriarchal systems of government vanished. The boyars were no longer consulted on affairs of state. The sovereign became sacrosanct, while the boyars were reduced to dependency on the will of the sovereign. The boyars naturally resented this revolution and struggled against it.\n\nIt was in the reign of Ivan III that the new Muscovite [[Sudebnik]], or law code, was compiled by the scribe [[Vladimir Gusev (scribe)|Vladimir Gusev]]. Ivan did his utmost to make his capital a worthy successor to [[Constantinople]], and with that object invited many foreign masters and artificers to settle in Moscow. The most noted of these was the Italian [[Aristotele Fioravanti|Ridolfo di Fioravante]], nicknamed \"Aristotle\" because of his extraordinary knowledge, who built several cathedrals and palaces in the Kremlin, and also supervised the construction of the Kremlin walls.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dmitri\u012d Olegovich Shvidkovski\u012d|title=Russian Architecture and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQy9TJ2yOQEC&pg=PA81|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=81\u201382|isbn=978-0300109122}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy==\nMuscovy rejected the [[Tatar yoke]] during the reign of Ivan III. In 1476, Ivan refused to pay the customary tribute to the grand [[Akhmat Khan|Khan Ahmed]], and in 1480 Ahmed Khan organized a military campaign against Muscovy.  Throughout the autumn the Muscovy and Tatar hosts [[Great stand on the Ugra river|confronted each other on opposite sides of the Ugra]] River, till 11 November 1480 when Ahmed retreated into the [[steppe]].\n\nIn the following year the [[Grand Khan]], while preparing a second expedition against Moscow, was suddenly attacked, routed and slain by Ivak, the Khan of the [[Nogay Horde]], whereupon the Golden Horde suddenly fell to pieces. In 1487 Ivan reduced the khanate of Kazan, one of the offshoots of the Horde, to the condition of a [[Vassal state|vassal-state]], though in his later years it [[Russo-Kazan Wars|broke away from his suzerainty]]. With the other Muslim powers, the Khan of the [[Crimean Khanate]] and the sultans of Ottoman Empire, Ivan's relations were peaceful and even amicable. The Crimean Khan, [[Me\u00f1li I Giray]], helped him against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and facilitated the opening of diplomatic relations between Moscow and Constantinople, where the first Muscovian embassy appeared in 1495.\n\n[[File:Ivan vs khan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Ivan III tearing the khan's letter to pieces'', an [[apocrypha]]l 19th-century painting by [[Aleksey Kivshenko]].]]\n[[File:M\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly k\u00f6vets\u00e9ge 1488-ban, III.

The first attempt at forging an alliance was made by [[Alexander I of Kakheti|Alexander I]], king of a small [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[kingdom of Kakheti]], who dispatched two embassies, in 1483 and 1491, to Moscow. However, as the Muscovites were still too far from the Caucasus, neither of these missions had any effect on the course of events in the region. In 1488, Ivan sought gun-founders, master-gunners for siege cannons, gold- and silversmiths and (Italian) master builders from [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]].<ref>{{cite book|author=William Monter|title=Cultural Exchange in Early Modern Europe, Volume 4|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2006|page=81|isbn=9780521855532|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vdqeC14parkC&pg=PA81&dq=%22Ivan+III%22+1488+Corvinus#v=onepage&q=%22Ivan%20III%22%201488%20Corvinus&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scitech.mtesz.hu/51landmark |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025033234/http://www.scitech.mtesz.hu/51landmark/ |archivedate=2008-10-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00e1nos Szendrei|title=R\u00e9gi k\u00e9p M\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly oroszorsz\u00e1gi k\u00f6vets\u00e9g\u00e9r\u0151l|publisher=Archaeologiai \u00c9rtes\u00edt\u0151|year=1905|pages=137\u2013146|url=http://real-j.mtak.hu/332/1/ARCHERT_1905_uf_025.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn Nordic affairs, Ivan III concluded an offensive alliance with [[Hans of Denmark]] and maintained regular correspondence with Emperor Maximilian I, who called him a \"brother\". He built a strong citadel in [[Ingria]], named [[Ivangorod fortress|Ivangorod]] after himself, situated on the Russian-Estonian border, opposite the fortress of [[Narva]] held by the [[Livonian Confederation]]. In the [[Russo-Swedish War (1495\u20131497)]] Ivan III unsuccessfully attempted to conquer [[Vyborg|Viborg]] from Sweden, but this attempt was checked by the Swedish garrison in [[Viborg Castle]] led by Lord [[Knut Posse]].\n\nThe further extension of the Moscow dominion was facilitated by the death of Casimir IV in 1492, when Poland and Lithuania once again parted company. The throne of Lithuania was now occupied by Casimir's son [[Alexander of Poland|Alexander]], a weak and lethargic prince so incapable of defending his possessions against the persistent attacks of the Muscovites that he attempted to save them by a matrimonial compact, wedding [[Helena of Moscow|Helena]], Ivan's daughter. But the clear determination of Ivan to appropriate as much of Lithuania as possible finally compelled Alexander to take up arms against his father-in-law in 1499. The Lithuanians were routed at the [[Battle of Vedrosha]] on 14 July 1500, and in 1503 Alexander was glad to purchase peace by ceding to Ivan [[Chernigov]], [[Starodub]], [[Novgorod-Seversky]] and sixteen other towns.<ref>Much information on Ivan III and his court is contained in [[Sigismund von Herberstein]], ''[[Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]]'' (1549).</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:1000 Ivan III.jpg|thumb|Ivan III on the \"[[Millennium of Russia]]\" monument in Veliky Novgorod]]\n\nIvan conquered or brought under his control the lands of north-eastern Rus', marking the beginning of Muscovite dominance over Rus' territory. Ivan arguably became best known for his consolidation of Muscovite rule. His predecessors had increased Moscow's territory from less than 600 square miles under Ivan II (reigned 1353\u201359) to more than 15,000 square miles at the end of Vasily II's reign. It remained for Ivan III to absorb Moscow's old rivals, Novgorod and Tver, and establish virtually a single rule over what had been [[appanage]]s of Rus'. Although the circumstances surrounding the acquisitions varied, the results were basically the same: former sovereign or semi-autonomous principalities were reduced to the status of provinces of Moscow, while their princes joined the ranks of the Muscovite service nobility.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife in 1467, Ivan married (1472) [[Sophia Palaiologina|Sophia (Zo\u00eb) Palaiologina]], a Byzantine princess and niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine XI]] (killed in battle in 1453). The Vatican sponsored the marriage in hope of bringing Russia under the sway of the Pope and of establishing a broad front against the Turks, a goal that failed. From Ivan's point of view, the marriage fit well into the general trend of elevating the Muscovite ruler.\n\nFollowing his second marriage, Ivan developed a complicated court ceremonial on the Byzantine model and began to use the title of \"Tsar and Autocrat\". Also during the reign of Ivan and his son, Vasily III, Moscow came to be referred to by spokesmen as the [[Third Rome]]. [[Philotheus of Pskov|Philotheos]], a monk from Pskov, developed the idea of Moscow as the true successor to Byzantium and, hence, to Rome.\n\nAn impressive building program in Moscow took place under Ivan, directed primarily by Italian artists and craftsmen. New buildings were erected in the Kremlin, and the Kremlin walls were strengthened and furnished with towers and gates. In 1475, Ivan III established the first cannon foundry of Russia in Moscow, which started the native cannon production.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Alan Hosking|title=Russia and the Russians: A History|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/russiarussianshi00hosk/page/91 91]|isbn=9780674004733|url=https://archive.org/details/russiarussianshi00hosk|url-access=registration|quote=first cannon foundry was set up in moscow.|author-link=Geoffrey Alan Hosking}}</ref> Ivan died on 27 October 1505, and was succeeded by his son, Vasily III.\n\n==Further reading on Ivan III==\nThe only biography in English of Ivan is J.

In rare cases the constriction ring can form around other parts of the [[fetus]] and cause amputation or even [[intrauterine death]] (see Types and Classification).

This is sometimes attributed to '''vascular disruption''' shared between [[cleft palate]] and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with ABS; this co-occurrence suggests an \"intrinsic\" defect of the blood circulation.\n\nThe second theory postulates the involvement of an intrauterine disruption during [[pregnancy]] followed by a cascade of events involving [[Amniotic sac|amniotic]] rupture. When spontaneous rupture of the amnion occurs early in the second trimester, the separation of amnion from [[chorion]] produces many small, thin strands that can become entangled within digits and toes.<ref name=\"D\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Graf JL, Bealer JF, Gibbs DL |title=Chorioamniotic membrane separation: a potentially lethal finding |journal=J Fetal Diagn Ther |issue=21 |pages=255\u2013258 |year=2006|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Later, as the fetus grows but the bands do not, the bands become constricting.  This constriction reduces blood circulation, hence causes congenital abnormalities. In some cases a complete \"natural\" [[congenital amputation|amputation]] of a digit(s) or limb may occur before birth or the digit(s) or limbs may be necrotic (dead) and require surgical amputation following birth. The names \u201cAmniotic Band Syndrome\u201d (ABS), \u201cAmniotic Disruption Complex\", \"Amniochorionic Mesoblastic Fibrous Strings\",  are based on this theory.\n\nThe third theory postulates the involvement of intrauterine trauma. Intrauterine trauma could be  something like amniocentesis, or something like a [[fetal surgery]]. An intrauterine trauma could result in hemorrhage leading to acrosyndactyly. One study also showed the presence of bands as confirmed by sonography after fetal surgery.<ref name=\"D\"/><ref name=\"E\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Foulkes GD, Reinker K |title=Congenital Constriction Band Syndrome: A seventy-Year Experience |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=242\u2013248 |doi=10.1097/01241398-199403000-00021|pmid=8188842 |year=1994 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of these different theories, there are many names for this syndrome. For a long time people believed the second theory about the amniotic rupture and strands. In the research cases not every child had a real (amniotic) strand. It could be that there has to be another explanation for the development of these anomalies.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 008.jpg|thumb]]\nThe diagnosis of constriction ring syndrome can be confirmed with an [[ultrasonography]]. The clinical manifestations can be extremely variable. It could be a single or multiple manifestation. This can be confirmed at the end of the first trimester or at the beginning of the second trimester.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nardoza LMM |title=Prenatal Diagnosis of Amniotic Band Syndrome in the Third Trimester using 3D Echo |journal=J Clin Imaging Sci |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=22 |year=2012|doi=10.4103/2156-7514.95436 |pmid=22616039 |pmc=3352605 }}</ref>  But not every patient will be diagnosed at that moment, most will get this diagnosis at birth.\n\nIndividual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound, so bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs or digits. Misdiagnosis is also common, so if there are any signs of amniotic bands, further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity.  3D ultrasound and MRI can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damage/danger to the fetus.\n\nDecreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include ABS.  It is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death.\n\nThere is a strong relationship between ABS and [[clubfoot]] (also called \"talipes\") exists. A 31.5% of associated clubfoot deformity and ABS can be correlated with 20% occurring [[bilateral symmetry|bilateral]]ly. Other abnormalities found with ABS include: [[clubhand]]s, [[cleft lip]], and/or [[cleft palate]], and [[hemangioma]].\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nThe differential diagnosis includes;\n*Symbrachydactyly\n*Chorionic villus sampling\n*Congenital amputations\n*Hypoplasias of hand, digit, thumb\n*Adams-Oliver syndrome\n*ADAM complex\n\n'''ADAM Complex'''; CRS is sometimes mislabeled as ADAM complex.

In general, the thumb is not likely to be affected by a constriction ring because the fetus typically holds the thumb in tight adduction flexion, making entanglement with strands less likely.<ref name=\"A\"/> These malformations need to be surgically removed which must be executed in different stages and can done by different techniques (see also treatment).\n\nPatterson II;\nThe CRS involves strands which obstruct the [[lymphatic vessels]] and thus causing fluid retention, distal of the affected extremity. This utters itself with swollen parts distal of the constriction.\n\nPatterson III;\nIn this form there is a complex form of [[syndactyly]] named acrosyndactyly, the fingers (or toes) were initially separated but due to the constriction they are formed back together. Sometimes multiple fingers can be involved. The distal fusion between digits or toes never initially involves a skeletal coalition.<ref name=\"C\"/> The digits are usually hypoplastic if multiple digits are involved. When the constriction cuts off the blood supply to the fingers, the fingers can form a peak with the most palmar digit being the index finger.

This is sometimes attributed to '''vascular disruption''' shared between [[cleft palate]] and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with ABS; this co-occurrence suggests an \"intrinsic\" defect of the blood circulation.\n\nThe second theory postulates the involvement of an intrauterine disruption during [[pregnancy]] followed by a cascade of events involving [[Amniotic sac|amniotic]] rupture. When spontaneous rupture of the amnion occurs early in the second trimester, the separation of amnion from [[chorion]] produces many small, thin strands that can become entangled within digits and toes.<ref name=\"D\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Graf JL, Bealer JF, Gibbs DL |title=Chorioamniotic membrane separation: a potentially lethal finding |journal=J Fetal Diagn Ther |issue=21 |pages=255\u2013258 |year=2006|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Later, as the fetus grows but the bands do not, the bands become constricting.  This constriction reduces blood circulation, hence causes congenital abnormalities. In some cases a complete \"natural\" [[congenital amputation|amputation]] of a digit(s) or limb may occur before birth or the digit(s) or limbs may be necrotic (dead) and require surgical amputation following birth. The names \u201cAmniotic Band Syndrome\u201d (ABS), \u201cAmniotic Disruption Complex\", \"Amniochorionic Mesoblastic Fibrous Strings\",  are based on this theory.\n\nThe third theory postulates the involvement of intrauterine trauma. Intrauterine trauma could be  something like amniocentesis, or something like a [[fetal surgery]]. An intrauterine trauma could result in hemorrhage leading to acrosyndactyly. One study also showed the presence of bands as confirmed by sonography after fetal surgery.<ref name=\"D\"/><ref name=\"E\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Foulkes GD, Reinker K |title=Congenital Constriction Band Syndrome: A seventy-Year Experience |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=242\u2013248 |doi=10.1097/01241398-199403000-00021|pmid=8188842 |year=1994 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of these different theories, there are many names for this syndrome.

The clinical manifestations can be extremely variable. It could be a single or multiple manifestation.

Misdiagnosis is also common, so if there are any signs of amniotic bands, further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity.  3D ultrasound and MRI can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damage/danger to the fetus.\n\nDecreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include ABS.  It is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death.\n\nThere is a strong relationship between ABS and [[clubfoot]] (also called \"talipes\") exists.

This classification system is based on the severity of the syndrome and is useful because, the different types require different treatments.

In general, the thumb is not likely to be affected by a constriction ring because the fetus typically holds the thumb in tight adduction flexion, making entanglement with strands less likely.<ref name=\"A\"/> These malformations need to be surgically removed which must be executed in different stages and can done by different techniques (see also treatment).\n\nPatterson II;\nThe CRS involves strands which obstruct the [[lymphatic vessels]] and thus causing fluid retention, distal of the affected extremity. This utters itself with swollen parts distal of the constriction.\n\nPatterson III;\nIn this form there is a complex form of [[syndactyly]] named acrosyndactyly, the fingers (or toes) were initially separated but due to the constriction they are formed back together. Sometimes multiple fingers can be involved. The distal fusion between digits or toes never initially involves a skeletal coalition.<ref name=\"C\"/> The digits are usually hypoplastic if multiple digits are involved. When the constriction cuts off the blood supply to the fingers, the fingers can form a peak with the most palmar digit being the index finger. Normal [[neurovascular bundle]]s are not present in the distal parts.<ref name=\"C\"/> Hands with fused fingers need to be released in phases to preserve the distal blood supply.\n\nPaterson IV;\nOne of the most severe consequence of constriction strains is probably intrauterine amputations, this is where the constriction goes as deep as the bone and cuts of the blood supply of the proximal extremity. The result will be that the developing toe or finger will become [[Ischemia|ischemic]] and will fall of. Because the end result is a transverse amputation that cuts off the vascular supply to the developing extremity,<ref name=\"A\"/> the actual constriction ring is not seen <ref name=\"C\"/>\nThis can result in different outcomes;\n*complete resorption; this is the most common form of amputation.<ref name=\"C\"/> In this form the amputated digit is completely resorbed during intrauterine development and therefore the amputated digit can't be found.\n*recovery of the digit; the digit is recovered with the [[placenta]] during delivery.\n*engraftment elsewhere; the amputated digit can be, in rare cases, engrafted somewhere on the fetus.\n\nIntrauterine death;\nIn extremely rare cases a strain can form around the [[umbilical cord]] and cut off the blood supply to the fetus which will result in intrauterine death.\n\nMalformation associated with constriction ring syndrome;\nThe percentage of associated anomalies varies from 40% to as high as 80% <ref name=\"G\"/><ref name=\"H\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Light TR, Ogden JA |title=Congenital constriction band syndrome: Pathophysiology and treatment |journal=Yale J Biol Med |issue=66 |pages=143\u2013155 |year=1993}}</ref><ref name=\"I\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kawamura K, Chung KC |title=Constriction Band Syndrome |journal=Hand Clin |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=257\u2013264 |doi=10.1016/j.hcl.2008.10.007|pmid=19380064 |year=2009 }}</ref>\nConstriction ring deformities are as common on the lower extremity as on the upper, almost all of these involve the [[musculoskeletal system]], with clubbed feet being the most common in up to 30% of reported cases <ref name=\"Pillay VK 1965 514\u2013519\"/><ref name=\"E\"/><ref name=\"H\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Poswillo D |title=Observation of fetal posture and causal mechanism of congenital deformity of palate, mandible and limbs |journal=J Dent Res |volume=45 |pages=584\u2013596 |year=1966 |doi=10.1177/00220345660450032301|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/149457c97331b0b897c0ccc987607c08880b41c4 }}</ref>\nLarge reported series reveal an incidence between 5% and 15% of craniofacial malformations with [[Cleft lip and palate|clefting of the lip or palate]].<ref name=\"Van Allen MI, Curry C, Gallagher L 1987 529\u2013548\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Causabon J |title=Congenital band about the pelvis |journal=Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=71 |issue=71 |pages=120\u2013122 |year=1983 |doi=10.1097/00006534-198301000-00027|pmid=6849011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Coady MS, Moore MH, Wallis K |title=Amniotic Band Syndrome: the association between rare facial clefts and limb ring constrictions |journal=Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=640\u2013649 |year=1988 |doi=10.1097/00006534-199803000-00010|pmid=9500380 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eppley BL, David L, Li M |title=Amniotic band facies |journal=J Craniofac Surg |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=360\u2013365 |year=1998|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1097/00001665-199807000-00013 |pmid=9780931 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hudgins RJ, Edward MS, Ousterhout DK, Golabi M |title=Pediatric neurosurgical implications of the amniotic band disruption complex |journal=Pediatric Neursci |volume=12 |issue=4\u20135 |pages=232\u2013239 |year=1985\u20131986 |doi=10.1159/000120257|pmid=3039476 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Van der Meulen J |title=The amniotic band syndrome |journal=Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=103 |issue=13 |pages=1087\u20131090 |year=1999 |doi=10.1097/00006534-199903000-00068}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones K, Smith DW, Hall BD |title=A pattern of craniofacial and limb defects secondary to aberrant tissue bands |journal=J Pediatr |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=90\u201395 |year=1974|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(74)80559-7|pmid=12119963 }}</ref>\n==Prevention==\nAmniotic band syndrome is considered an accidental event and it does not appear to be genetic or hereditary, so the likelihood of it occurring in another pregnancy is remote.

At the first operation, one-half of the circumference is excised and the other one-half can be excised after three to six months. This will avoid any problems to the distal circulation in the limb, which may already be compromised. Lymphedema, when present, will significantly improve within a few weeks of the first surgery.\u201d <ref name=\"K\"/>\n\nFor the direct closure of the defect after dissecting a constriction band there are two different techniques:\n#Triangular flaps; For this technique the circumference between the two borders must be measured. Depending on the difference the number of triangular flaps can be decided. With a triangular flap you can create more skin.<ref name=\"L\"/>\n#Z/W-plasty; \u201cZ-plasty is a plastic surgery technique that is used to improve the functional and cosmetic appearance of scars. It can elongate a contracted scar or rotate the scar tension line. The middle line of the Z-shaped incision (the central element) is made along the line of greatest tension or contraction, and triangular flaps are raised on opposite sides of the two ends and then transposed.\u201d\n\nIn rare cases, if diagnosed in utero, fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb that is in danger of amputation or other deformity.

Every case is different and multiple bands may be entangled around the fetus.\n\nBands which wrap around fingers and toes can result in [[syndactyly]] or [[congenital amputation|amputation]]s of the digits. In other instances, bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet. In more severe cases, the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation. Amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate. If the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be life-threatening for the fetus.\n\nThe number of cases of [[miscarriage]] that can be attributed to ABS is unknown, although it has been reported that it may be the cause of 178 in 10,000 miscarriages.

Its area is about {{convert|11704|km2|abbr=on}}. It forms the cultural, commercial, financial, industrial, and residential center of South Korea. The largest city is Seoul, with a population of approximately 10 million people, followed by Incheon, with 3 million inhabitants.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{See also|Geography of South Korea}}\n\nThe Capital Area occupies a plain in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] valley.  It contains some of the most fertile land on the [[Korean peninsula]], although relatively little of it is now used for agriculture. The [[Gimpo Plain]], one of the country's larger expanses of level arable land, covers much of the area of the cities of [[Gimpo]] and [[Bucheon]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of South Korea|History of Seoul}}\n\n[[File:Seoul, nighttime.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of [[Seoul]] and greater area]]\n\nThe Capital Area has been home to a Korean capital for around 2,000 years. Its central location and relatively gentle landscape have given it a central role in the country's affairs.\n\nThe first capital to be constructed in the region was that of [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].  The country's first capital was built in 19 BC and was named [[Wiryeseong]].  This is believed to have been constructed near the modern-day boundary of [[Seoul]] and [[Gwangju (Gyeonggi)|Gwangju City]].  However, Baekje was unable to hold this territory, and surrendered the Han River valley to [[Goguryeo]] in the 5th century.  The land was then taken over by [[Silla]] in the 6th century, at which point it came to play a critical role in helping Silla to establish ties with [[China]].\n\nAfter the fall of [[Silla]], [[Taejo of Goryeo]] established the capital of his kingdom in [[Kaes\u014fng]], now just north of the [[Demilitarized Zone (Korea)|Demilitarized Zone]].  During the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]] in the 12th century, the seat of government briefly shifted to [[Ganghwa Island]], now just south of the DMZ in [[Incheon]] metropolitan city, where the Mongol naval attacks were repelled for about a decade before the king voluntarily surrendered to stop the carnage the Mongols committed in the peninsula, in order to lure the king out.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Goryeo|Goryeo Dynasty]] in 1392, the newly founded [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]] had its capital (then called Hanseong or Hanyang), less than {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} south of the old dynasty's capital, Kaes\u014fng. Hanyang was chosen to be the new capital for mountains surrounding it making it safe from enemies, and for the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], separating the north and south parts of the city that let the trade business flourish. During the new dynasty's rule, extensive road systems, administrative buildings, royal palaces, and new ports were built, quickly attracting wealth from all over the kingdom. During the [[Korean Empire]] period, Hanseong's public transportation was improved with the installation of streetcars and manually drawn trolleys similar to taxis. Horse carriage systems similar to the ones in Europe were also established.\n\nFollowing the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910, Hanseong was renamed Keijo (Gyeongseong) and served as colonial Korea's capital. Upon Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945, the former colonial capital was renamed Seoul and became capital of South Korea.\n\nIn the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), the Capital Area became the focus of battles so destructive that most of Seoul and the surrounding regions were eradicated. Seoul was especially hit hard, since it exchanged hands four times during the course of the war.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, the Capital Area began to rapidly develop as South Korea's economic wealth expanded. Population expanded fourfold since the Korean War. In 2001, the new [[Incheon International Airport]] took over all international flights to Seoul.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of South Korea}}\n\nCovering only about 12% of the country's area, the Seoul Capital Area is home to more than 48.2% of the national population, and is the world's [[List of urban areas by population|fifth largest urban area]]. This percentage has risen steadily since the mid-20th century, and the trend is expected to continue. Currently more than half of the people who move from one region to another are moving to the capital area.{{ref|trend1}} By 2020, it is projected that more than 52% of South Korea's population will live within the area, or 26,310,000 people.{{ref|trend2}} However, the Seoul Capital Area reached 25,620,000 people by 2015, bringing the chance of reaching a population of 26.31 Million in less than 5 years.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2017, Seoul Capital Area's gross regional product was \u20a9870 trillion([[US$]]770 billion), generating half of the country's total [[GDP]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kostat.go.kr/portal/korea/kor_nw/1/13/2/index.board?bmode=read&aSeq=372162 | title=\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc18c\ub4dd &#124; \ud1b5\uacc4\uccad}}</ref> It is the fourth largest urban economy in the world after Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kosis.kr/statisticsList/statisticsList_02List.jsp?vwcd=MT_GTITLE01&parmTabId=M_02_02_01#SubCont|title=\ud1b5\uacc4\uccad - KOSIS \uad6d\uac00\ud1b5\uacc4\ud3ec\ud138|website=kosis.kr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403101706/http://kosis.kr/statisticsList/statisticsList_02List.jsp?vwcd=MT_GTITLE01&parmTabId=M_02_02_01#SubCont|archivedate=2016-04-03}}</ref> and the region hosts headquarters of 59 [[Forbes Global 2000]] companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/2/#country:South%20Korea}}</ref>\nAs the economy of Seoul Capital Area transformed to [[knowledge economy]] from the [[manufacturing]]-based economy of the 20th century, there are a number of high-tech business parks in Seoul Capital Area, such as [[Digital Media City]] and [[Pangyo Techno Valley]].\n\n[[File:Spatial Structure Of Capital Region.jpg|thumb|Industrial Clusters in Seoul Capital Area]]\nThe South Korean government is now implementing a plan to create several centers for economic activities in the Capital Area. According to the plan, for example, Seoul is a 'Northeast Asia's Financial and Business Hub', and southwestern coast, with Incheon and Suwon, is 'International logistics and High-tech Industrial Belt'.\n\nThe Seoul Capital Area is home to the most affluent and livable cities and apartments in Korea but there are significant discrepancies between cities and districts, particularly between those built in the older and newer generations. Newer areas with more modern and luxurious apartments and infrastructure are more expensive, along with proximity to [[Gangnam District]], the commercial center of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2014/12/24/0200000000AKR20141224141700060.HTML?input=1195m|title=\ubbf8\uad70 \uc794\ub958\ub85c \ub099\ud6c4\ub41c \ub3d9\ub450\ucc9c, \ud2b9\ubcc4\ubc95 \uc81c\uc815\ud574\uc57c|website=www.yonhapnews.co.kr|date=2014-12-23}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Category:Companies based in Seoul}}\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Government of South Korea}}\n\nVarious agencies have been set up to deal with the intergovernmental problems of the region.

The [[Gimpo Plain]], one of the country's larger expanses of level arable land, covers much of the area of the cities of [[Gimpo]] and [[Bucheon]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of South Korea|History of Seoul}}\n\n[[File:Seoul, nighttime.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of [[Seoul]] and greater area]]\n\nThe Capital Area has been home to a Korean capital for around 2,000 years. Its central location and relatively gentle landscape have given it a central role in the country's affairs.\n\nThe first capital to be constructed in the region was that of [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].  The country's first capital was built in 19 BC and was named [[Wiryeseong]].  This is believed to have been constructed near the modern-day boundary of [[Seoul]] and [[Gwangju (Gyeonggi)|Gwangju City]].  However, Baekje was unable to hold this territory, and surrendered the Han River valley to [[Goguryeo]] in the 5th century.  The land was then taken over by [[Silla]] in the 6th century, at which point it came to play a critical role in helping Silla to establish ties with [[China]].\n\nAfter the fall of [[Silla]], [[Taejo of Goryeo]] established the capital of his kingdom in [[Kaes\u014fng]], now just north of the [[Demilitarized Zone (Korea)|Demilitarized Zone]].  During the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]] in the 12th century, the seat of government briefly shifted to [[Ganghwa Island]], now just south of the DMZ in [[Incheon]] metropolitan city, where the Mongol naval attacks were repelled for about a decade before the king voluntarily surrendered to stop the carnage the Mongols committed in the peninsula, in order to lure the king out.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Goryeo|Goryeo Dynasty]] in 1392, the newly founded [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]] had its capital (then called Hanseong or Hanyang), less than {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} south of the old dynasty's capital, Kaes\u014fng. Hanyang was chosen to be the new capital for mountains surrounding it making it safe from enemies, and for the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], separating the north and south parts of the city that let the trade business flourish. During the new dynasty's rule, extensive road systems, administrative buildings, royal palaces, and new ports were built, quickly attracting wealth from all over the kingdom. During the [[Korean Empire]] period, Hanseong's public transportation was improved with the installation of streetcars and manually drawn trolleys similar to taxis. Horse carriage systems similar to the ones in Europe were also established.\n\nFollowing the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910, Hanseong was renamed Keijo (Gyeongseong) and served as colonial Korea's capital. Upon Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945, the former colonial capital was renamed Seoul and became capital of South Korea.\n\nIn the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), the Capital Area became the focus of battles so destructive that most of Seoul and the surrounding regions were eradicated. Seoul was especially hit hard, since it exchanged hands four times during the course of the war.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, the Capital Area began to rapidly develop as South Korea's economic wealth expanded. Population expanded fourfold since the Korean War. In 2001, the new [[Incheon International Airport]] took over all international flights to Seoul.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of South Korea}}\n\nCovering only about 12% of the country's area, the Seoul Capital Area is home to more than 48.2% of the national population, and is the world's [[List of urban areas by population|fifth largest urban area]]. This percentage has risen steadily since the mid-20th century, and the trend is expected to continue. Currently more than half of the people who move from one region to another are moving to the capital area.{{ref|trend1}} By 2020, it is projected that more than 52% of South Korea's population will live within the area, or 26,310,000 people.{{ref|trend2}} However, the Seoul Capital Area reached 25,620,000 people by 2015, bringing the chance of reaching a population of 26.31 Million in less than 5 years.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2017, Seoul Capital Area's gross regional product was \u20a9870 trillion([[US$]]770 billion), generating half of the country's total [[GDP]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kostat.go.kr/portal/korea/kor_nw/1/13/2/index.board?bmode=read&aSeq=372162 | title=\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc18c\ub4dd &#124; \ud1b5\uacc4\uccad}}</ref> It is the fourth largest urban economy in the world after Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kosis.kr/statisticsList/statisticsList_02List.jsp?vwcd=MT_GTITLE01&parmTabId=M_02_02_01#SubCont|title=\ud1b5\uacc4\uccad - KOSIS \uad6d\uac00\ud1b5\uacc4\ud3ec\ud138|website=kosis.kr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403101706/http://kosis.kr/statisticsList/statisticsList_02List.jsp?vwcd=MT_GTITLE01&parmTabId=M_02_02_01#SubCont|archivedate=2016-04-03}}</ref> and the region hosts headquarters of 59 [[Forbes Global 2000]] companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/2/#country:South%20Korea}}</ref>\nAs the economy of Seoul Capital Area transformed to [[knowledge economy]] from the [[manufacturing]]-based economy of the 20th century, there are a number of high-tech business parks in Seoul Capital Area, such as [[Digital Media City]] and [[Pangyo Techno Valley]].\n\n[[File:Spatial Structure Of Capital Region.jpg|thumb|Industrial Clusters in Seoul Capital Area]]\nThe South Korean government is now implementing a plan to create several centers for economic activities in the Capital Area. According to the plan, for example, Seoul is a 'Northeast Asia's Financial and Business Hub', and southwestern coast, with Incheon and Suwon, is 'International logistics and High-tech Industrial Belt'.\n\nThe Seoul Capital Area is home to the most affluent and livable cities and apartments in Korea but there are significant discrepancies between cities and districts, particularly between those built in the older and newer generations. Newer areas with more modern and luxurious apartments and infrastructure are more expensive, along with proximity to [[Gangnam District]], the commercial center of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2014/12/24/0200000000AKR20141224141700060.HTML?input=1195m|title=\ubbf8\uad70 \uc794\ub958\ub85c \ub099\ud6c4\ub41c \ub3d9\ub450\ucc9c, \ud2b9\ubcc4\ubc95 \uc81c\uc815\ud574\uc57c|website=www.yonhapnews.co.kr|date=2014-12-23}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Category:Companies based in Seoul}}\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Government of South Korea}}\n\nVarious agencies have been set up to deal with the intergovernmental problems of the region.
