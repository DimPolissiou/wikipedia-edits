The House of Representatives convenes at the [[Massachusetts State House]] in Boston.\n\n==Representation==\nOriginally,{{when|date=June 2018}} representatives were apportioned by town. For the first 150 persons, one representative was granted, and this ratio increased as the population of the town increased. The largest membership of the House was 749 in 1812 (214 of these being from the [[District of Maine]]); the largest House without Maine was 635 in 1837.<ref>''The Massachusetts State House'', p. 110, 111.

The {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} pine carving of the cod was offered by Representative [[John Rowe (Boston Selectman)|John Rowe]] in 1784 in commemoration of the state's maritime economy and history. Two previous carvings of the cod existed during the legislature's colonial era; the first destroyed in a fire in 1747, and the second during the [[American War of Independence]]. Since 1784, the current Sacred Cod has been present at nearly every House session, and moved to its current location when the House began convening in the State House in 1798.\n\nIn 1933, members of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' stole the cod carving as part of a prank. The theft sparked a large statewide search by the [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] and [[Massachusetts State Police]]. Following outrage from Boston newspapers and the General Court itself, the cod was anonymously handed back.\n{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Massachusetts_House_Of_Representatives_Composition_Map_November_20_2019.svg|thumb|2019 composition by municipality]]\n\nThe Democrats hold a [[supermajority]] in the House.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! rowspan=3|Affiliation\n! colspan=3|Party <div style=\"font-size:80%\">(Shading indicates majority caucus)</div>\n! rowspan=3|Total\n!\n\n|-style=\"height:5px\"\n| style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Independent (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color: #C9C9C9\" |\n\n|-\n!

It is composed of 160 members elected from 14 counties each divided into single-member electoral districts across the Commonwealth. The House of Representatives convenes at the [[Massachusetts State House]] in Boston.\n\n==Representation==\nOriginally,{{when|date=June 2018}} representatives were apportioned by town. For the first 150 persons, one representative was granted, and this ratio increased as the population of the town increased. The largest membership of the House was 749 in 1812 (214 of these being from the [[District of Maine]]); the largest House without Maine was 635 in 1837.<ref>''The Massachusetts State House'', p. 110, 111. Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Boston, 1953.</ref> The original distribution was changed to the current regional population system in the 20th century. Until 1978, there were 240 members of the house,<ref>[http://www.lwvma.org/legislature.shtml League of Women Voters of Massachusetts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025200114/http://www.lwvma.org/legislature.shtml |date=October 25, 2006 }}</ref> a number in multi-member districts; today there are 160 in single-member districts.<ref>See Amendment CI of the [[Massachusetts Constitution]], adopted by voters in 1974</ref>\n\nToday, each Representative represents about 40,000 residents. Their districts are named for the counties they are in and tend to stay within one county, although districts occasionally cross county lines.  Representatives serve two-year terms which are not limited.\n[[File:USA State House 2 MA.jpg|thumb|Representatives' desk with microphone and voting buttons (yea/nay)]]\n\n==The Sacred Cod==\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Sacred Cod of Massachusetts.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The [[Sacred Cod of Massachusetts]] hanging from the House's Visitor Gallery.]] -->\nWithin the House's debating chamber hangs the [[Sacred Cod of Massachusetts]]. The {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} pine carving of the cod was offered by Representative [[John Rowe (Boston Selectman)|John Rowe]] in 1784 in commemoration of the state's maritime economy and history. Two previous carvings of the cod existed during the legislature's colonial era; the first destroyed in a fire in 1747, and the second during the [[American War of Independence]]. Since 1784, the current Sacred Cod has been present at nearly every House session, and moved to its current location when the House began convening in the State House in 1798.\n\nIn 1933, members of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' stole the cod carving as part of a prank. The theft sparked a large statewide search by the [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] and [[Massachusetts State Police]]. Following outrage from Boston newspapers and the General Court itself, the cod was anonymously handed back.\n{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Massachusetts_House_Of_Representatives_Composition_Map_November_20_2019.svg|thumb|2019 composition by municipality]]\n\nThe Democrats hold a [[supermajority]] in the House.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! rowspan=3|Affiliation\n! colspan=3|Party <div style=\"font-size:80%\">(Shading indicates majority caucus)</div>\n! rowspan=3|Total\n!\n\n|-style=\"height:5px\"\n| style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Independent (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color: #C9C9C9\" |\n\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Rudeness", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Rude}}\n{{Redirect|Impolite|the film|Impolite (film)}}\n\n'''Rudeness''' (also called '''effrontery''') is a display of disrespect by not complying with the [[Norm (social)|social norms]] or [[etiquette]] of a group or culture. These norms have been established as the essential [[personal boundaries|boundaries]] of normally [[acceptance|accepted]] behavior. To be unable or unwilling to align one's behavior with these norms known to the general population of what is socially acceptable is to be rude and are enforced as though they were a sort of social law, with social repercussions or rewards for violators or advocates, respectively. \n\nRudeness, \"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium\".{{sfn|Kasper|1990|p=208}}  Rudeness, particularly with respect to speech, is necessarily confrontational at its core.\n\nForms of rudeness include acting inconsiderate, insensitive, deliberately offensive, [[Politeness|impolite]], a faux pas, [[obscenity]], [[profanity]] and violating [[taboo]]s such as [[deviancy]]. In some cases, an act of rudeness can go so far as to be a [[crime]], for example, the crime of [[hate speech]].\n\n==Relationship to morality==\nBoth [[manners]] and [[morality]] deal with whether a thing is morally good or bad, but  at different levels.  Unlike morality, which, for example, condemns [[murder]] as a violation of a person, manners primarily concerns itself with violations of human [[dignity]], rather than the person's health or property.{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=123}}  Rude behaviour is a violation of human dignity or of the respect due to others.\n\n==Cultural differences==\n{{Main|Intercultural competence}}\n\nThe specific actions that are considered polite or rude vary dramatically by place, time, and context.  Differences in [[social role]], [[gender]], [[social class]], [[religion]], and [[cultural identity]] may all affect the appropriateness of a given behaviour.  Consequently, a behaviour that is considered perfectly acceptable by one group of people may be considered clearly rude by another.  For example, in [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], it was rude to indicate that a man wearing a [[mask]] in public could be recognized.{{sfn|Palleschi|2005}}  Instead, polite behaviour demanded that the masked person be treated as a completely unknown person and that no one ever attribute the masked person's actions to the individual who performed them.  By contrast, in the modern era, greeting a friend by name while he is wearing a mask, or talking to them later about their costume or activities, is not generally regarded as rude.\n\nCultural differences also appear over time.  In the mid-20th century, the meaning of [[eye rolling]] changed from its older signal of lust and passion to expressing contempt.{{sfn|Wickman|2013}}\n\n==Utility==\nSometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviours to achieve a goal.  Early works in [[linguistic pragmatism]] interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.\n\n{{harvnb|Lakoff|1989}} addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists ([[attack therapy]]) to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  Rudeness in everyday speech \"is frequently instrumental, and is not merely pragmatic failure\".{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=154}}  Most rude speakers are attempting to accomplish one of two important instrumental functions:  to vent negative feelings, and/or to get [[Power (social and political)|power]].{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=159}}\n\n== Examples ==\nIn every culture, it is possible to act rudely, although what constitutes rude behaviour varies.  The following are examples of behaviour that many Western societies would consider ''rude'' or a breach of etiquette, though views may vary by culture, setting, or individual circumstances: \n<!--\n\nNOTE:  The goal is *NOT* to provide a comprehensive list of rude behaviours, or to create a \"How to Be Rude\" manual.\n\nPlease don't include items that are more accurately described as \"unkind\" (gossip) or \"lazy\" (not cutting the lawn often enough to suit the neighbours) or tautologies (things that are defined as rude, such as \"rude gestures\" or \"rude words\").\n\n-->\n\n=== Speech ===\nWhat constitutes rude speech depends on the culture, the setting, and the speaker's social position in the culture. In every culture, some words or statements are considered [[hate speech]] or inappropriate [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]] (such as using the word ''[[Hun#20th-century_use_in_reference_to_Germans|Hun]]'' to a [[German people|German]], using the word ''[[Jap]]'' to a [[Japanese people|Japanese person]], etc.). In most modern cultures, [[insulting]] a person or group of people, especially for any reason outside their immediate control, such as having a medical condition, being a particular gender, or being poor, is considered rude. Rude speech also includes derogatory terms describing a individual person and asking inappropriate questions or pressing for answers to a question.\n\nHowever, there is no universal rule about which terms are considered derogatory and which questions are inappropriate under what circumstances.  A question or comment that is acceptable between family members might be resented from strangers, just like a question that is acceptable among young people in one culture might be unacceptable to older people or to young people in a different culture.\n\nRude ways of speaking include inappropriately discouraging a person's participation in a conversation with rude phrases, such as {{Wikt-lang|en|shut up}} or using a [[tone of voice]] that indicates disrespect for the other person.  An impolite tone may amplify obviously rude remarks or contradict nominally polite words.  A rude person may interrupt a speaker to indicate that the first speaker is unimportant.\n\nFailing to speak can also be rude:  a rude person might pointedly ignore a legitimate and polite greeting or question to communicate disregard for the other person, or might fail to express appropriate [[gratitude|thanks]] for favors or gifts by way of communicating either a sense of selfish entitlement or a disregard for the efforts of the giver.  Sometimes people will leave very short gaps when speaking that may allow another person to begin speaking on a subject, however that can vary, and sometimes two or more people speaking at the same time can be considered rude.  Which acts and communications require a response from which persons, under which circumstances, and what kind of response is required, depends on the culture and the social situation of the people concerned.\n\nOne last form of using rudeness is as a [[rite of passage]]. For example, the black community uses ''[[The Dozens]]'' as a mechanism to promote verbal abuse resilience and maturity among young people.\n\n=== Behaviours ===\nMany behaviours can be rude.  These often depend upon the context, including time, place, and culture.\n\nThis includes a failure to [[dress code|dress appropriately]] for an occasion, whether by dressing too informally, too formally, immodestly, or otherwise inappropriately (e.g., a young woman in public without a veil in Iran; a young woman in public with a veil in France).  [[C. S. Lewis]] writes that \"A girl in the Pacific islands wearing hardly any clothes and a Victorian lady completely covered in clothes might both be equally 'modest,' proper, or decent, according to the standards of their own societies\"\u2014but that in each culture, the idea of immodest, improper, and indecent dress existed, and that violating the culture's standard was rude.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=94}}\n\nRude behaviours often disturb other people, such as making [[noise]] or playing loud music.  An acceptable level of sound depends on the context:  yelling might be the only way to be heard at a noisy [[construction site]], and [[rock concert]]s are expected to feature loud music, but a conversation at a normal level, either by telephone or in person, might be rude in an environment where a reasonable degree of silence is expected, such as a [[library]], and complete silence is expected at other times, such as during religious ceremonies or performances of classical music.  This includes speaking over a presentation or film with no consideration for the other viewers.  Similarly, poor [[table manners]] can disturb or [[disgust]] nearby people, as can [[yawn]]ing, [[cough]]ing, [[fart]]ing or [[sneeze|sneezing]] without covering the mouth.\n\nOther rude behaviours have the effect of communicating disrespect for other people.  In extreme cases, this can rise to complete and deliberate [[social exclusion]] of the disrespected person; in others, the rudeness is only temporary and may be unintentional.  For example, it can be rude to use electronic devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s, if this results in ignoring someone or otherwise indicating that the present company is less interesting or important than the people elsewhere or the text messages they send.  Similarly, [[cutting in line]] signals that the person cutting in the line believes themselves to be more important that the people their action delays.  Barging into someone else's space without permission, whether that be a violation of [[personal space]] or [[Party crashing|crashing a party]], is rude because it does not respect the person's property rights or right to make personal choices.\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Bullying]] or [[intimidating]] people with the threat of violence\n*[[Lie|Lying]] to people\n*[[Snob]]bery\n*[[Aggressive driving]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Deviance (sociology)|Deviance]]\n* [[Dysphemism]]\n* [[Emily Post]]\n* [[Incivility]]\n* [[Innuendo]]\n* [[Insult]]\n* [[Intercultural competence]]\n* [[Loaded language]]\n* [[Miss Manners]]\n* [[Profanity]]\n* [[Workplace incivility]]\n* [[Worldwide etiquette]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* Beebe, L.

Rudeness in everyday speech \"is frequently instrumental, and is not merely pragmatic failure\".{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=154}}  Most rude speakers are attempting to accomplish one of two important instrumental functions:  to vent negative feelings, and/or to get [[Power (social and political)|power]].{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=159}}\n\n== Examples ==\nIn every culture, it is possible to act rudely, although what constitutes rude behaviour varies.  The following are examples of behaviour that many Western societies would consider ''rude'' or a breach of etiquette, though views may vary by culture, setting, or individual circumstances: \n<!--\n\nNOTE:  The goal is *NOT* to provide a comprehensive list of rude behaviours, or to create a \"How to Be Rude\" manual.\n\nPlease don't include items that are more accurately described as \"unkind\" (gossip) or \"lazy\" (not cutting the lawn often enough to suit the neighbours) or tautologies (things that are defined as rude, such as \"rude gestures\" or \"rude words\").\n\n-->\n\n=== Speech ===\nWhat constitutes rude speech depends on the culture, the setting, and the speaker's social position in the culture. In every culture, some words or statements are considered [[hate speech]] or inappropriate [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]] (such as using the word ''[[Hun#20th-century_use_in_reference_to_Germans|Hun]]'' to a [[German people|German]], using the word ''[[Jap]]'' to a [[Japanese people|Japanese person]], etc.). In most modern cultures, [[insulting]] a person or group of people, especially for any reason outside their immediate control, such as having a medical condition, being a particular gender, or being poor, is considered rude. Rude speech also includes derogatory terms describing an individual person and asking inappropriate questions or pressing for answers to a question.\n\nHowever, there is no universal rule about which terms are considered derogatory and which questions are inappropriate under what circumstances.  A question or comment that is acceptable between family members might be resented from strangers, just like a question that is acceptable among young people in one culture might be unacceptable to older people or to young people in a different culture.\n\nRude ways of speaking include inappropriately discouraging a person's participation in a conversation with rude phrases, such as {{Wikt-lang|en|shut up}} or using a [[tone of voice]] that indicates disrespect for the other person.  An impolite tone may amplify obviously rude remarks or contradict nominally polite words.  A rude person may interrupt a speaker to indicate that the first speaker is unimportant.\n\nFailing to speak can also be rude:  a rude person might pointedly ignore a legitimate and polite greeting or question to communicate disregard for the other person, or might fail to express appropriate [[gratitude|thanks]] for favors or gifts by way of communicating either a sense of selfish entitlement or a disregard for the efforts of the giver.  Sometimes people will leave very short gaps when speaking that may allow another person to begin speaking on a subject, however that can vary, and sometimes two or more people speaking at the same time can be considered rude.  Which acts and communications require a response from which persons, under which circumstances, and what kind of response is required, depends on the culture and the social situation of the people concerned.\n\nOne last form of using rudeness is as a [[rite of passage]]. For example, the black community uses ''[[The Dozens]]'' as a mechanism to promote verbal abuse resilience and maturity among young people.\n\n=== Behaviours ===\nMany behaviours can be rude.  These often depend upon the context, including time, place, and culture.\n\nThis includes a failure to [[dress code|dress appropriately]] for an occasion, whether by dressing too informally, too formally, immodestly, or otherwise inappropriately (e.g., a young woman in public without a veil in Iran; a young woman in public with a veil in France).  [[C. S. Lewis]] writes that \"A girl in the Pacific islands wearing hardly any clothes and a Victorian lady completely covered in clothes might both be equally 'modest,' proper, or decent, according to the standards of their own societies\"\u2014but that in each culture, the idea of immodest, improper, and indecent dress existed, and that violating the culture's standard was rude.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=94}}\n\nRude behaviours often disturb other people, such as making [[noise]] or playing loud music.  An acceptable level of sound depends on the context:  yelling might be the only way to be heard at a noisy [[construction site]], and [[rock concert]]s are expected to feature loud music, but a conversation at a normal level, either by telephone or in person, might be rude in an environment where a reasonable degree of silence is expected, such as a [[library]], and complete silence is expected at other times, such as during religious ceremonies or performances of classical music.  This includes speaking over a presentation or film with no consideration for the other viewers.  Similarly, poor [[table manners]] can disturb or [[disgust]] nearby people, as can [[yawn]]ing, [[cough]]ing, [[fart]]ing or [[sneeze|sneezing]] without covering the mouth.\n\nOther rude behaviours have the effect of communicating disrespect for other people.  In extreme cases, this can rise to complete and deliberate [[social exclusion]] of the disrespected person; in others, the rudeness is only temporary and may be unintentional.  For example, it can be rude to use electronic devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s, if this results in ignoring someone or otherwise indicating that the present company is less interesting or important than the people elsewhere or the text messages they send.  Similarly, [[cutting in line]] signals that the person cutting in the line believes themselves to be more important that the people their action delays.  Barging into someone else's space without permission, whether that be a violation of [[personal space]] or [[Party crashing|crashing a party]], is rude because it does not respect the person's property rights or right to make personal choices.\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Bullying]] or [[intimidating]] people with the threat of violence\n*[[Lie|Lying]] to people\n*[[Snob]]bery\n*[[Aggressive driving]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Deviance (sociology)|Deviance]]\n* [[Dysphemism]]\n* [[Emily Post]]\n* [[Incivility]]\n* [[Innuendo]]\n* [[Insult]]\n* [[Intercultural competence]]\n* [[Loaded language]]\n* [[Miss Manners]]\n* [[Profanity]]\n* [[Workplace incivility]]\n* [[Worldwide etiquette]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* Beebe, L.
