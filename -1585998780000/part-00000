Just three km from the Port of Limay, the Arsenal is strategically situated near the [[Petron Corporation|Petron]] Bataan Refinery, the Bataan Combined Cycle Power Plant, the [[National Power Corporation]] Plant, the Petro-Chemical Complex, and the [[Freeport Area of Bataan|Freeport Area]] at [[Mariveles, Bataan]]. To sustain its operations, the GA presently maintains and operates 124 buildings and structures sprawled over 70 hectares of land.\n\nA creation of [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 1884 which was signed into law on June 22, 1957, the Arsenal is a line bureau under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]]. However, it was only about a decade later, on March 7, 1967, that a presidential proclamation on its present site at [[Limay, Bataan]] was declared. Accordingly, on October 12, 1967, the ground breaking materialized at the spot where the statue of [[Antonio Luna|General Antonio Luna]] now stands. Site preparations were subsequently undertaken by the 514th and 564th Engineering Construction Battalions of the 51st Engineering Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Construction of essential buildings and facilities then followed along with training abroad of selected military and newly hired civilian personnel on the manufacture of small arms ammunition (SAA).\n\nOn August 15, 1971, or fourteen (14) years after the enactment of Republic Act 1884, the first SAA cartridge rolled out of the GA's production assembly line. Three years later, the integrated SAA manufacture began, with all the components - case, primer, propellant powder, and bullet assembled into a complete cartridge - manufactured in the arsenal.\n\nAs a strategic resource, the arsenal is envisioned to be a center for defense industries to meet domestic requirements and supply the world market. In line with this vision, the GA explored in the early 1980s, the possibility of exporting excess production, improving ammunition technology and expanding the capability for weapons production as called for in its charter. However, the impediments under the then existing laws prevented any real progress in this direction.\n\n==Modernization==\n[[File:GA Marine Scout Sniper Rifle Variant 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|GA-made [[Marine Scout Sniper Rifle|Marine Scout Sniper Rifles]] on display.]]\n\nOn February 23, 1995, Republic Act 7898, otherwise known as the [[AFP Modernization Act]], was enacted. Republic Act 7898 likewise provides for the modernization of the Government Arsenal for the development of production capabilities to enhance self-sufficiency in defense requirements. Specifically, Section 12 of this Act mandates that \"the government arsenal shall be utilized in the production of basic weapons, ammunition and other munitions for the use of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP), and for the sale and export of products in excess of AFP/PNP requirements.\" Furthermore, the GA is authorized to use such production facilities as it may own or be provided under the law or as it may arrange under joint venture, co-production or similar arrangements with local and foreign entities.\n\nAs part of the modernization effort, the arsenal, through the Department of National Defense, issued an invitation to bid for a Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 in August 2009.<ref name=\"bid\">{{cite web |title=Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB): Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 |url=http://www.dnd.gov.ph/DNDWEBPAGE_files/dndbac/ITB/ITEABSep09/ITAEB%20GA.pdf |publisher=Department of National Defense |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2009-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  This marks a significant expansion of existing production lines.\n\nAs of the most recent supplemental bulletin for the bid,<ref name=\"supp\">{{cite web |title=Supplemental bid bulletin Nr.

The intact proSAAS protein, as well as the carboxyy-terminal peptide containing the inhibitory hexapeptide LLRVKR, functions as an inhibitor of prohormone convertase 1/3, which regulates the proteolytic cleavage of  peptide precursors. ProSAAS is further processed into multiple short peptides. Differential expression of this gene may be associated with obesity. The central, unprocessed portion of the protein may function as a neural- and endocrine-specific chaperone due to its potent ability to block the aggregation of beta amyloid and alpha synuclein in vitro, and to block oligomer cytotoxicity in cells.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 27457957 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1601091113 | volume=113 | issue=32 | title=The neural chaperone proSAAS blocks \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation and neurotoxicity | pmc=4987805 | year=2016 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=E4708-15 | vauthors=Jarvela TS, Lam HA, Helwig M, Lorenzen N, Otzen DE, McLean PJ, Maidment NT, Lindberg I }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 24102330 | doi=10.1111/jnc.12454 | volume=128 | issue=3 | title=A novel function for proSAAS as an amyloid anti-aggregant in Alzheimer's disease | pmc=3946950 | year=2014 | journal=J Neurochem | pages=419\u201330 | vauthors=Hoshino A, Helwig M, Rezaei S, Berridge C, Eriksen JL, Lindberg I }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 27457957 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1601091113 | volume=113 | issue=32 | title=The neural chaperone proSAAS blocks \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation and neurotoxicity | pmc=4987805 | year=2016 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=E4708-15 | vauthors=Jarvela TS, Lam HA, Helwig M, Lorenzen N, Otzen DE, McLean PJ, Maidment NT, Lindberg I }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin | 2}}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Fortenberry Y, Hwang JR, Apletalina EV, Lindberg I |title=Functional characterization of ProSAAS: similarities and differences with 7B2 |journal=J.

The intact proSAAS protein, as well as the carboxyy-terminal peptide containing the inhibitory hexapeptide LLRVKR, functions as an inhibitor of prohormone convertase 1/3, which regulates the proteolytic cleavage of  peptide precursors. ProSAAS is further processed into multiple short peptides. Differential expression of this gene may be associated with obesity. The central, unprocessed portion of the protein may function as a neural- and endocrine-specific chaperone due to its potent ability to block the aggregation of beta amyloid and alpha synuclein in vitro, and to block oligomer cytotoxicity in cells (PMID: 27457957 PMID: 24102330 PMID: 27457957). \n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin | 2}}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Fortenberry Y, Hwang JR, Apletalina EV, Lindberg I |title=Functional characterization of ProSAAS: similarities and differences with 7B2 |journal=J.

It is first mentioned is in 6th-century records, and the immediate area hosted a major battle c. 987 involving the Irish king [[Brian Boru]]. During the [[middle ages]], the town was invaded by a succession of warring clans, including the Murcheatach U\u00ed Briain and Richard de Cogan families. In the [[early modern period]] the MacCarthy's took control and later the area found prosperity via milling. The MacCarthys built a series of [[tower house]]s, [[Carrigaphooca Castle|many of which]] survive. The family lost influence during the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite wars]] of the 1690s, after which authority over the town castle waxed and waned between the MacCarthys and a number of ambitious English families. In the 17th century, Macroom became a central point of conflict in the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]].\n\nThe population fell in the 1840s during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]]. Evidence can be found in the former [[workhouse]], now the district hospital at the north side of New Street, and the mass graveyard to the west, near [[Clondrohid]]. During the late 18th and early 19th century a number of [[Anglo-Irish]] families, and a branch of the [[Massey family]], settled in the area; but many of their estate houses were burned by [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u201322)|rebels]] during and after the [[Irish War of Independence]] as the town was caught the turmoil of [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] activity.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982 Macroom hosted the Mountain Dew Rock festival, with lineups that included [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Thin Lizzy]] and [[Van Morrison]], attended by [[Sex Pistol]] [[John Lydon]]. \n\nToday the town is an economic hub for the mid west Cork region, and host to a major [[Danone]] milk processing factory, which dries and cans [[Infant formula]], from milk supplied by local dairy farmers. Until the 1950s New Street was the town's economic hub, and contained many small retail outlets. In September 2019 Macroom was designated a rent pressure zone.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Christian===\nEvidence of the human activity in the area survives from pre-history, especially the many [[iron age]] burial monuments; the area is unusually rich with [[Glantane East|standing stones]], [[Knocknakilla megalithic complex|dolmen]]s and [[Carrigagulla|stone circle]]s.<ref name=\"gov\">\"[http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/decentralisation/Macroom.pdf Macroom: Town Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513053845/http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/decentralisation/Macroom.pdf |date=2006-05-13 }}\". agriculture.gov.ie.

This standing stone is part of a 3500-year-old complex in [[Knocknakilla]] between Macroom and [[Millstreet]]]]\nThe first historical reference to Macroom dates from the 6th century, when the townland was known as Achad Dorbchon and held within the kingdom of Muscraighe Mitine.<ref>Ring, 31</ref> The [[E\u00f3ganachta]] were then the dominant clan of [[Munster]]; they held kingdoms from Muscraighe Mitine to the midlands town of [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]. At some point, they were replaced by the U\u00ed Floinn, who commissioned a castle in Macroom so as to establish [[E\u00f3ganacht Raithlind|Raithleann]] as capital of [[Muskerry]].\n\n===Middle ages===\nMuscraighe Mitine underwent three invasions during the 13th century. The Murcheatach U\u00ed Briain and Richard de Cogan arrived in 1201 and 1207 respectively; the MacCarthys became the dominant and most powerful family and held [[Macroom Castle]] until the mid-17th century.<ref>Ring, 80</ref> \nFrom the 14th century, Macroom became the capital of the Barony of Muskerry and the centre for trade, burial and religious worship. It was one of the earliest Irish milling centres, and from the end of the 16th century the town grew from a village to a functionally diverse urban centre. The locality grew outwards from the castle. The MacCarthys established the town as a centre for markets and fairs, and in 1620 a market house was built to the east of and facing the castle. The family introduced a [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] scheme which aimed to attract new agriculture and industrial techniques and methods to the area.\n\n===Modern period===\nBy the mid-17th century English families owned approximately one-third of the town in value terms.<ref>Ring, 105</ref> The Protestant families introduced butter making, a labour-intensive industry. A 1750 [[tenement]] list details 134 buildings and 300 families, with a population ratio of 6 to 1 between Catholic and Protestants. The town had developed from a locality of mud cabins in the early 1660s to a linear shaped urban settlement of mainly [[thatch]]ed cabins, which were later replaced by solid cottages following a campaign by the [[Irish Land and Labour Association]] (ILLA). Macroom Castle was for a period controlled by [[Admiral Sir William Penn]], a British Admiral and father of [[William Penn]], after whom the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]] is named.\n\n====Battle of Macroom====\nThe 1650 [[battle of Macroom]] was waged as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], when the English Parliamentarian force under Roger Boyle defeated an Irish Confederate force under David Roche. Bishop [[Boetius MacEgan]], fighting on behalf of the MacCarthys, failed to hold the castle and was taken prisoner by the Cromwellian forces and hanged at [[Carrigadrohid]].<ref>''[http://www.kilbrin.net/KilbrinHistorySub9.html Boetius MacEgan, Bishop of Ross]'' Biography</ref>\n\n====War of Independence====\n[[File:Macroom Protest Meeting 1894.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|c. 1894 mass meeting, organised by the [[Irish Land and Labour Association|ILLA]] supported by small tenant farmers and agrarian labourers in the Market Square]]\nMacroom was the main base in Cork for the British [[Auxiliary Division]] during the 1919\u20131921 [[Irish War of Independence]]. The [[Irish Republican Army]] was highly active in the county, especially in the areas around Macroom, [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] and [[Dunmanway]]. [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] police in the town described the area as \"practically in a state of war\". After a series of burnings of local police barracks and courthouses<ref name=\"h27\">Hart, 27</ref> a curfew was imposed on the town, with a ban on public meetings and market fairs. A local IRA member wrote of a \"hinterland unpoliced and unwatched\". The local police felt they had lost control and the Auxiliaries were called to intervene. The townspeople treated army personnel with hostility, and there were instances of patrols being stoned. The Brits were embroiled in a guerrilla battle in the [[Muskerry]] hills, coming under fire from the Ballyvourney IRA cell, and lost three men \u2013 two of them officers \u2013 in one attack.<ref name=\"h28\">Hart, 28</ref>\n\nIn 1920 at [[Kilmichael, County Cork|Kilmichael]], on the road between Macroom and Dunmanway, 17 members of the Macroom Auxiliary \"C Company\" [[Kilmichael Ambush|were ambushed and killed]] by a local IRA cell led by the prominent general [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]]. In the aftermath of the attack, the British military were given the power to execute anyone found carrying arms and ammunition, to search houses, impose curfews, try suspects in military rather than civilian courts and to intern suspects without trial. On 11 December, in reprisal, the [[The Burning of Cork|centre of Cork city was burned]] by Auxiliaries, British soldiers and [[Black and Tans]].<ref>White & O'Shea, 9</ref>\n\nMacroom Castle was burned out on five separate occasions; the last occasion was on 18 August 1922 following the evacuation of British Auxiliaries from the town.

During the [[middle ages]], the town was invaded by a succession of warring clans, including the Murcheatach U\u00ed Briain and Richard de Cogan families. In the [[early modern period]] the MacCarthy's took control and later the area found prosperity via milling. The MacCarthys built a series of [[tower house]]s, [[Carrigaphooca Castle|many of which]] survive. The family lost influence during the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite wars]] of the 1690s, after which authority over the town castle waxed and waned between the MacCarthys and a number of ambitious English families.

This standing stone is part of a 3500-year-old complex in [[Knocknakilla]] between Macroom and [[Millstreet]]]]\nThe first historical reference to Macroom dates from the 6th century, when the townland was known as Achad Dorbchon and held within the kingdom of Muscraighe Mitine.<ref>Ring, 31</ref> The [[E\u00f3ganachta]] were then the dominant clan of [[Munster]]; they held kingdoms from Muscraighe Mitine to the midlands town of [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]. At some point, they were replaced by the U\u00ed Floinn, who commissioned a castle in Macroom so as to establish [[E\u00f3ganacht Raithlind|Raithleann]] as capital of [[Muskerry]].\n\n===Middle ages===\nMuscraighe Mitine underwent three invasions during the 13th century. The Murcheatach U\u00ed Briain and Richard de Cogan arrived in 1201 and 1207 respectively; the MacCarthys became the dominant and most powerful family and held [[Macroom Castle]] until the mid-17th century.<ref>Ring, 80</ref> \nFrom the 14th century, Macroom became the capital of the Barony of Muskerry and the centre for trade, burial and religious worship. It was one of the earliest Irish milling centres, and from the end of the 16th century the town grew from a village to a functionally diverse urban centre. The locality grew outwards from the castle. The MacCarthys established the town as a centre for markets and fairs, and in 1620 a market house was built to the east of and facing the castle. The family introduced a [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] scheme which aimed to attract new agriculture and industrial techniques and methods to the area.\n\n===Modern period===\nBy the mid-17th century English families owned approximately one-third of the town in value terms.<ref>Ring, 105</ref> The Protestant families introduced butter making, a labour-intensive industry. A 1750 [[tenement]] list details 134 buildings and 300 families, with a population ratio of 6 to 1 between Catholic and Protestants. The town had developed from a locality of mud cabins in the early 1660s to a linear shaped urban settlement of mainly [[thatch]]ed cabins, which were later replaced by solid cottages following a campaign by the [[Irish Land and Labour Association]] (ILLA). Macroom Castle was for a period controlled by [[Admiral Sir William Penn]], a British Admiral and father of [[William Penn]], after whom the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]] is named.\n\n====Battle of Macroom====\nThe 1650 [[battle of Macroom]] was waged as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], when the English Parliamentarian force under Roger Boyle defeated an Irish Confederate force under David Roche.

After a series of burnings of local police barracks and courthouses<ref name=\"h27\">Hart, 27</ref> a curfew was imposed on the town, with a ban on public meetings and market fairs. A local IRA member wrote of a \"hinterland unpoliced and unwatched\". The local police felt they had lost control and the Auxiliaries were called to intervene. The townspeople treated army personnel with hostility, and there were instances of patrols being stoned. The Brits were embroiled in a guerrilla battle in the [[Muskerry]] hills, coming under fire from the Ballyvourney IRA cell, and lost three men \u2013 two of them officers \u2013 in one attack.<ref name=\"h28\">Hart, 28</ref>\n\nIn 1920 at [[Kilmichael, County Cork|Kilmichael]], on the road between Macroom and Dunmanway, 17 members of the Macroom Auxiliary \"C Company\" [[Kilmichael Ambush|were ambushed and killed]] by a local IRA cell led by the prominent general [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]].
