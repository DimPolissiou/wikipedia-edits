{"title_page": "GameKing", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:gameking I.jpg|350px|right|thumb|The original GameKing (GM-218) ; ''GameKing I'']]\n\n'''GameKing''' is a brand of [[handheld console|handheld]] [[game consoles]], designed and developed by [[Timetop]] in 2003, for the [[Hong Kong]] consumer market. The brand has three consoles, the GameKing I, the GameKing II and the GameKing III.  A fourth console, the Handy Game, was produced by Timetop and shares some branding, but otherwise has little to do with the GameKing franchise.\n\n==GameKing I (GM-218)==\nThe original GameKing console is a [[8-bit]] [[handheld game console]]. It is based around a [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] running at 6.0 [[megahertz|MHz]].\nIt is fashioned to look like Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] and comes in a wide array of vivid pastel colours, either [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] or [[transparency (optics)|transparent]], and uses 2 [[AAA battery|AAA]] size batteries. The original GameKing lacks a backlit screen, a feature which has been added in its \"successor\", the GameKing II.\n\nThe consoles have above-average sound circuitry capable of multi-channel music and digital sound playback, but a comparably low quality greyscale LCD screen, only supporting four shades of grey and having a very low (48 by 32 [[pixels]]) resolution, combined with a slow refresh rate, poor readability and adjustments, compared to the original [[Game Boy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nGames can be compared to some of the earlier built-in [[cell phone]] games (pre [[Java platform|Java]] games), while their playing speed (scrolling etc.) and audio is far superior (multi-channel music and digitized samples and voices are quite common in GameKing games).\n\n===Audio hardware===\n{{original research|date=October 2011}}\nIt is unclear whether the machine uses a traditional [[programmable sound generator]] or relies only on digital samples for music and sound effects. Many of its games have soundtracks consisting of short audio samples with a sampling rate of 8&nbsp;[[kHz]], as opposed to games on other systems such as the [[Game Boy]] where sound is generated by a custom programmable sound generator.\n\n===Video hardware===\nAccording to Brian Provinciano's reverse engineering of the GameKing,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071028090324/http://www.bripro.com/low/gameking/index.php The Low Level: The Game King Handheld]</ref> most GameKing games heavily rely on [[bitmap]] rather than [[tiled rendering|tile-based rendering]] of the screen, e.g. most levels in its [[platform game|platform]] and [[shoot 'em up]] games are in reality large 4-colour bitmaps, instead of using the most common method of graphic tiles and tile maps, like in most other game consoles and arcade games. This was probably done for economic reasons (the CPU alone can handle all graphics easily, at that resolution) and easy development of the games, apart from the objectively low resolution of the screen. While such a scheme seems to work, it has the disadvantage of using cartridge space inefficiently, so that e.g. most platform games are limited to 3 levels. At this point, it is unknown if the GameKing uses some form of sprite rendering, although this is probably unlikely and unnecessary.\n\n==GameKing II (GM-219)==\n[[Image:GameKing2.jpg|250px|thumb|A GameKing II (GM-219) with its selection menu]]\n\nThe GameKing II, on the other hand, is fashioned to look like Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]], comes in more sober colors (either [[black]], [[grey]], [[white]] or [[aqua (color)|aqua]] - and although not shown on the packaging, [[yellow]] ones do also exist), and uses 3 [[AAA battery|AAA]] size batteries, of which only 2 are used to actually power up the GameKing's hardware, while the third one serves to power up both its built-in audio amplifier (a bit more powerful than the one on the original GameKing) and its backlit LCD screen (which can be turned on and off at will, depending on external lighting conditions, thus saving power). The unit can still work with 2 batteries, only with no sound and no backlighting available.\n\nAlso, the GameKing II has a fixed color background picture for its LCD screen, only visible when the backlighting is switched on. This is probably to give the false impression of having a colour LCD screen, as implied on its box.\n\nThe picture may vary between various GameKing models, however it has a mostly negative effect on screen readability when the backlighting is turned on.\n\nThis background picture can also be removed or replaced simply by opening the machine and removing the small plastic transparency behind the LCD. Removing it makes using the backlighting much more effective.\n\nThis model would also be the last in the Gameking line to have the text \"3in1\" stamped above the screen.\n\n''Notes: Likewise with the GK, no page exists for the GKII, but the Chinese site still lists the machine as product code GM-219.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050422074617/http://www.timetop.cn/newproduct.asp?id=109 GM-219]</ref>''\n\n===GK \"I\" vs. GK II===\nHowever, the two models are fully hardware compatible, can use the same games/cartridges, both have volume and contrast controls and use the same LCD screen. Also, they both have an external DC power supply 3.5&nbsp;mm minijack plug; however, the plug is not labeled as such, and its function is only slightly hinted at in the units' manuals. The GameKing requires 3V DC, while the GameKing2 requires 4.5V DC with the peculiarity of needing to keep at least one battery in the unit in order to have sound and backlighting.\n\n==GameKing III (GM-220)==\n\n\nTimeTop quietly released a third GameKing machine, called the 'GameKing III' or GM-220 sometime in 2005. While early advertisements showed the GameKing III with the same \"false color\" background picture as the GameKing I and II, which would indicate that the system is actually black and white like the previous GameKing models,the GM-220 is in fact full colour. Another distinction of the GM-220 is that unlike its predecessors, the Gameking I and II, which were promoted and marketed worldwide, the Gameking III was not actively distributed outside of Asia, making it much less common than the earlier models. In 2005, many websites initially reported the device as \"coming soon\", and it is not known why  Timetop eventually decided to offer only a limited release. \n\nAlthough accurate technical information is hard to obtain, it seems to be a handheld console using a 64-colour (or grey shades) [[LCD]] or [[TFT LCD|TFT]] screen, although little else is known about it. It was available in black, silver, dark violet, and blue.\n\nThe resolution doesn't seem enhanced compared to an original GameKing, and \"classic\" GameKing cartridges are automatically colorized, while games especially developed for it allegedly make use of the full color palette, which for the moment remains unknown. The site claimed a total of 12 carts for this system. If the built-in game is included, 8 titles are known as of 2010.\n\nA new design for the GKIII was placed in April 2006 at the Timetop site, and later removed (see GM-221, below).\n\n===GM-221===\n[[File:Gameking III (GM-221).jpg|GM-221 |thumb|right|200px]]\nA second design for the Gameking III also exists which combines elements from the GM-219 with the GM-220. The Button design and layout is from the GM-220 design, with the \"A\" button being distinctly larger than the \"B\" button, but the overall form is obviously inspired from Sony's PSP design. Several colors are shown on the back of the box, green and orange for example, however only two colors, a black edition and a white edition are confirmed to exist.\n\n===GM-222===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:gameking II.jpg|GM-222 |thumb|right|200px]] -->\nThe GM-222 sports an original design, which does not borrow much from previous models.  Even though it is sequenced later than the other consoles in the Gameking line, and therefore one would expect more advanced hardware, it is in fact a redesigned Gameking II. Moreover, besides returning to the lo-res black and white screen, the back-light has also been removed (notice however that the box for the GM-221 and GM-222 both show exactly the same false color screen shot, despite the two machines vastly different capabilities). It is not known why Timetop choice to release the GM-222 in this fashion, although renderings exist that show this design was intended at some point to be a full color model. It was available in charcoal, blue, and green.\n\n==Handy Game (GM-228)==\n[[Image:Gameking III cart.jpg|Gameking \"Handy Game\"|thumb|right|200px]]\n\nA distinct Timetop console exists which uses [[NES hardware clone|NES compatible]] hardware rather than the proprietary hardware of the other Gameking consoles, and also has an integrated TV output. While early mockups indicated this handheld was considered part of the Gameking line, Timetop eventually removed the gameking branding from this edition prior to its release, replacing it with \"Timetop LTPS Handy Game\" ( ironically, \"handy-game\" was the working title EPYX coined in 1987 for what would become the Atari Lynx). The console comes with 25 built-in games and is also able to accept cartridges, however their size and connectors are different from (and incompatible with) previous Gameking consoles. The game selection includes games typically found on NES clones, like ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'', ''[[Pooyan]]'' or ''[[Dig Dug]]'', as well as graphic [[Read-only memory|ROM]] hacks of famous NES games (for example, using [[Blue's Journey]] graphics with [[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]).\n\nThe GM-228 was available in a large variety of colors with some faceplaces containing very elaborate designs. Colors included silver, black, green, yellow, and pink.\n\n==Games==\n\n===GameKing/GameKing II games===\nThe console has a small selection of known games (38), being 3 built in and 35 in carts, although 37 games were said to be available by TimeTop. Most games are [[clone (computer science)|clones]] of famous [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Commodore 64|C64]] or [[Atari 2600]] titles, with heavily dropped graphics. The games come in cartridges resembling the original [[Game Boy]] ones, with a typical size of 128KB, although 4-in-1 cartridges are available, containing 4 normal GameKing games plus a selection menu, and have a maximum size of 512KB.\n\nBoth the GameKing and GameKing II come with three built in games.\n* ''Drifter'', a ''[[Wonder Boy]]''/''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]'' clone (Which seems to use music from [[Castlevania III]])\n* ''2003'', a ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' clone.\n* ''Miner'' or ''Mine Battle'', a ''[[Bomberman]]'' clone (Which seems to use music taken from the now-defunct Flash game, [[Spybotics|Spybot: The Nightfall Incident]])\n\nHere follows an incomplete list of known games.\nPlease note that many GameKing games use the same program altering only graphics to create \"new\" games e.g. ''2003'' and ''2004'' are essentially the same game with minor differences. Also, many games have major inconsistencies between the box, manual and in-game title. E.g., ''Lanneret'' becomes ''Hawk'' in the game title, Feichuan becomes \"Shenzhou Liuhao\" in the game,\nor ''Carlo Adventure Legend'' becomes ''Caro'' in-game.\n\n* ''Carlo Adventure Legend'', a ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' clone.\n* ''Soldier'', a ''[[Contra (arcade game)|Contra]]'' / ''Gryzor'' clone.\n* ''Happy Killer'' and ''Happy Ball'', both ''[[Lode Runner]] clones.\n* ''F1 2004'', a [[Formula One]] racing game resembling ''[[Pole Position]]''.\n* ''Super Motor'', essentially like ''F1 2004'' with motorcycles instead of cars.\n''Notes: The two previous titles are the only motor or sports games available on the GameKing.''\n* ''2004'', essentially the same game as the built in ''2003''.\n* ''Popper'', essentially the same game as the built in ''Miner''.\n* ''Hawk'' or ''Lanneret'', a ''[[Choplifter]]'' clone.\n* ''Dino Adventure'', essentially ''Carlo Adventure Legend'' with different graphics.\n* ''Duckman'', a ''[[Darkwing Duck (Capcom)|Darkwing Duck]]'' clone.\n* ''Ares'', ''Feichuan'' are all classic arcade shooters, probably using the same engine as ''2003'' and ''2004'' with different graphics.\n* ''Penguin'', an ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]''/''[[Tux Racer]] clone.\n* ''Street Hero'', a ''[[Double Dragon]]'' clone.\n* ''Trojan Legend'', a ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]] clone.\n* ''Seatercel'', a ''[[Tiger Heli]] clone.\n* ''Star Wars'', a ''[[Macross]]''-based clone, allowing the player to choose all three shapeshifting Fighter-Gerwalk-Battroid configurations.\n* ''Nagual'', a ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu Master]]'' clone.\n* ''Blaster'', a ''[[Blaster Master]]'' clone, a platform game with a shooting vehicle.\n* ''Chaser'', a marine defense game (clone unknown).\n* ''Star Ghazi'' or ''Star Chazi'', a ''[[Star Force]]'' clone\n* ''HERO'': a ''[[Batman]]'' or ''[[H.E.R.O. (video game)|H.E.R.O.]]'' clone.\n* ''Dracula Zone'' or ''Surf Eidolon'': A ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' clone(?).\n* ''Pocket Tank'', a ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]''/''[[Front Line (arcade game)|Front Line]]'' clone with a tank.\n* ''Warrior'', a ''[[Front Line (arcade game)|Front Line]]'' clone without the tank.\n* ''Clever Hawk'', a ''[[Star Force]]''-like game, but not the same game as ''Star Ghazi''.\n* ''Valliant'', a robot space fighting game (clone unknown). The sprites are pretty large.\n* ''Metal Deform'', a platform game with shooting elements and a jetpack(?). (clone unknown)\n* ''Three Battles'', an ''[[Ikari Warriors]]''-like game.\n* ''Lightsword'', a shooter that puts you on foot and then into a flying-robot shooter form (clone unknown).\n* ''Risker'', a game similar to ''[[Spy Hunter]]'' in mechanics.\n* ''Catman'', another platform game with weapons, but with large sprites.\n* ''Armada'', an arcade shooter (clone unknown).\n* ''Brains'', a puzzle-action game, clone unknown.\n\nGames are generally sold in separate cartridges, but there are 4-in-1 cartridges holding 4 distinct games. Later games seem to be only available in this manner. Also, each 4-in-1 pack comes numbered and higher numbers seem to provide games that are more refined in presentation.\n\nSome of these games found in 4-in-1 cartridges are:\n \n* ''Cyclon Action''\n* ''Might''\n* ''CarMan''\n* ''Spectask''\n* ''Captain'' (Which seems to use music from ''[[Mega Man X]]'')\n* ''Seaguard''\n* ''Whirlybird''\n* ''Happy Garden''\n* ''Airhero''\n* ''Magician''\n* ''Explorer''\n* ''Farer''\n* ''Seabedwar''\n* ''Sortie''\n* ''Phantom Fighter''\n\n===GameKing III games===\nGameKing III machines have a built-in game:\n* ''Galaxy Crisis''\nAt the moment the only known game carts for the GameKing III come from a picture:<ref>[http://www.mimibazar.cz/foto.php?id=1080302 GameKing III cartridges]{{dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref>\n* ''Adventure''\n* ''Urgent Action''\n* ''Diamond''\n* ''Panzer''\n* ''Fly Car''\n* ''Blaze Plane''\n* ''2030''\n* ''Hermic Battle''\n* ''Vagrant''\n\n===HandyGame (GM-228) games===\nThe NES-clone version of the GameKing III has its own selection of games, most of them being pirated or unlicensed NES games or variations. These come multi-carts with combinations such as 26in1, 49in1,and 72in1, etc. No HandyGame carts are compatible with any previous model.\n\n==References==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20080204211506/http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/000269.html\n*Game King official website is [https://www.gameking.co.in/upgameking.html UpGameKing]\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Handheld game consoles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gameking}}\n[[Category:Handheld game consoles]]\n[[Category:Monochrome video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Sixth-generation video game consoles]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:gameking I.jpg|350px|right|thumb|The original GameKing (GM-218) ; ''GameKing I'']]\n\n'''GameKing''' is a brand of [[handheld console|handheld]] [[game consoles]], designed and developed by [[Timetop]] in 2003, for the [[Hong Kong]] consumer market.

Many of its games have soundtracks consisting of short audio samples with a sampling rate of 8&nbsp;[[kHz]], as opposed to games on other systems such as the [[Game Boy]] where sound is generated by a custom programmable sound generator.\n\n===Video hardware===\nAccording to Brian Provinciano's reverse engineering of the GameKing,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071028090324/http://www.bripro.com/low/gameking/index.php The Low Level: The Game King Handheld]</ref> most GameKing games heavily rely on [[bitmap]] rather than [[tiled rendering|tile-based rendering]] of the screen, e.g. most levels in its [[platform game|platform]] and [[shoot 'em up]] games are in reality large 4-colour bitmaps, instead of using the most common method of graphic tiles and tile maps, like in most other game consoles and arcade games. This was probably done for economic reasons (the CPU alone can handle all graphics easily, at that resolution) and easy development of the games, apart from the objectively low resolution of the screen. While such a scheme seems to work, it has the disadvantage of using cartridge space inefficiently, so that e.g. most platform games are limited to 3 levels. At this point, it is unknown if the GameKing uses some form of sprite rendering, although this is probably unlikely and unnecessary.\n\n==GameKing II (GM-219)==\n[[Image:GameKing2.jpg|250px|thumb|A GameKing II (GM-219) with its selection menu]]\n\nThe GameKing II, on the other hand, is fashioned to look like Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]], comes in more sober colors (either [[black]], [[grey]], [[white]] or [[aqua (color)|aqua]] - and although not shown on the packaging, [[yellow]] ones do also exist), and uses 3 [[AAA battery|AAA]] size batteries, of which only 2 are used to actually power up the GameKing's hardware, while the third one serves to power up both its built-in audio amplifier (a bit more powerful than the one on the original GameKing) and its backlit LCD screen (which can be turned on and off at will, depending on external lighting conditions, thus saving power). The unit can still work with 2 batteries, only with no sound and no backlighting available.\n\nAlso, the GameKing II has a fixed color background picture for its LCD screen, only visible when the backlighting is switched on. This is probably to give the false impression of having a colour LCD screen, as implied on its box.\n\nThe picture may vary between various GameKing models, however it has a mostly negative effect on screen readability when the backlighting is turned on.\n\nThis background picture can also be removed or replaced simply by opening the machine and removing the small plastic transparency behind the LCD. Removing it makes using the backlighting much more effective.\n\nThis model would also be the last in the Gameking line to have the text \"3in1\" stamped above the screen.\n\n''Notes: Likewise with the GK, no page exists for the GKII, but the Chinese site still lists the machine as product code GM-219.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050422074617/http://www.timetop.cn/newproduct.asp?id=109 GM-219]</ref>''\n\n===GK \"I\" vs. GK II===\nHowever, the two models are fully hardware compatible, can use the same games/cartridges, both have volume and contrast controls and use the same LCD screen. Also, they both have an external DC power supply 3.5&nbsp;mm minijack plug; however, the plug is not labeled as such, and its function is only slightly hinted at in the units' manuals. The GameKing requires 3V DC, while the GameKing2 requires 4.5V DC with the peculiarity of needing to keep at least one battery in the unit in order to have sound and backlighting.\n\n==GameKing III (GM-220)==\n\n\nTimeTop quietly released a third GameKing machine, called the 'GameKing III' or GM-220 sometime in 2005. While early advertisements showed the GameKing III with the same \"false color\" background picture as the GameKing I and II, which would indicate that the system is actually black and white like the previous GameKing models,the GM-220 is in fact full colour. Another distinction of the GM-220 is that unlike its predecessors, the Gameking I and II, which were promoted and marketed worldwide, the Gameking III was not actively distributed outside of Asia, making it much less common than the earlier models. In 2005, many websites initially reported the device as \"coming soon\", and it is not known why  Timetop eventually decided to offer only a limited release. \n\nAlthough accurate technical information is hard to obtain, it seems to be a handheld console using a 64-colour (or grey shades) [[LCD]] or [[TFT LCD|TFT]] screen, although little else is known about it. It was available in black, silver, dark violet, and blue.\n\nThe resolution doesn't seem enhanced compared to an original GameKing, and \"classic\" GameKing cartridges are automatically colorized, while games especially developed for it allegedly make use of the full color palette, which for the moment remains unknown. The site claimed a total of 12 carts for this system. If the built-in game is included, 8 titles are known as of 2010.\n\nA new design for the GKIII was placed in April 2006 at the Timetop site, and later removed (see GM-221, below).\n\n===GM-221===\n[[File:Gameking III (GM-221).jpg|GM-221 |thumb|right|200px]]\nA second design for the Gameking III also exists which combines elements from the GM-219 with the GM-220. The Button design and layout is from the GM-220 design, with the \"A\" button being distinctly larger than the \"B\" button, but the overall form is obviously inspired from Sony's PSP design. Several colors are shown on the back of the box, green and orange for example, however only two colors, a black edition and a white edition are confirmed to exist.\n\n===GM-222===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:gameking II.jpg|GM-222 |thumb|right|200px]] -->\nThe GM-222 sports an original design, which does not borrow much from previous models.  Even though it is sequenced later than the other consoles in the Gameking line, and therefore one would expect more advanced hardware, it is in fact a redesigned Gameking II. Moreover, besides returning to the lo-res black and white screen, the back-light has also been removed (notice however that the box for the GM-221 and GM-222 both show exactly the same false color screen shot, despite the two machines vastly different capabilities). It is not known why Timetop choice to release the GM-222 in this fashion, although renderings exist that show this design was intended at some point to be a full color model. It was available in charcoal, blue, and green.\n\n==Handy Game (GM-228)==\n[[Image:Gameking III cart.jpg|Gameking \"Handy Game\"|thumb|right|200px]]\n\nA distinct Timetop console exists which uses [[NES hardware clone|NES compatible]] hardware rather than the proprietary hardware of the other Gameking consoles, and also has an integrated TV output. While early mockups indicated this handheld was considered part of the Gameking line, Timetop eventually removed the gameking branding from this edition prior to its release, replacing it with \"Timetop LTPS Handy Game\" ( ironically, \"handy-game\" was the working title EPYX coined in 1987 for what would become the Atari Lynx). The console comes with 25 built-in games and is also able to accept cartridges, however their size and connectors are different from (and incompatible with) previous Gameking consoles. The game selection includes games typically found on NES clones, like ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'', ''[[Pooyan]]'' or ''[[Dig Dug]]'', as well as graphic [[Read-only memory|ROM]] hacks of famous NES games (for example, using [[Blue's Journey]] graphics with [[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]).\n\nThe GM-228 was available in a large variety of colors with some faceplaces containing very elaborate designs. Colors included silver, black, green, yellow, and pink.\n\n==Games==\n\n===GameKing/GameKing II games===\nThe console has a small selection of known games (38), being 3 built in and 35 in carts, although 37 games were said to be available by TimeTop. Most games are [[clone (computer science)|clones]] of famous [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Commodore 64|C64]] or [[Atari 2600]] titles, with heavily dropped graphics. The games come in cartridges resembling the original [[Game Boy]] ones, with a typical size of 128KB, although 4-in-1 cartridges are available, containing 4 normal GameKing games plus a selection menu, and have a maximum size of 512KB.\n\nBoth the GameKing and GameKing II come with three built in games.\n* ''Drifter'', a ''[[Wonder Boy]]''/''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]'' clone (Which seems to use music from [[Castlevania III]])\n* ''2003'', a ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' clone.\n* ''Miner'' or ''Mine Battle'', a ''[[Bomberman]]'' clone (Which seems to use music taken from the now-defunct Flash game, [[Spybotics|Spybot: The Nightfall Incident]])\n\nHere follows an incomplete list of known games.\nPlease note that many GameKing games use the same program altering only graphics to create \"new\" games e.g. ''2003'' and ''2004'' are essentially the same game with minor differences. Also, many games have major inconsistencies between the box, manual and in-game title. E.g., ''Lanneret'' becomes ''Hawk'' in the game title, Feichuan becomes \"Shenzhou Liuhao\" in the game,\nor ''Carlo Adventure Legend'' becomes ''Caro'' in-game.\n\n* ''Carlo Adventure Legend'', a ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' clone.\n* ''Soldier'', a ''[[Contra (arcade game)|Contra]]'' / ''Gryzor'' clone.\n* ''Happy Killer'' and ''Happy Ball'', both ''[[Lode Runner]] clones.\n* ''F1 2004'', a [[Formula One]] racing game resembling ''[[Pole Position]]''.\n* ''Super Motor'', essentially like ''F1 2004'' with motorcycles instead of cars.\n''Notes: The two previous titles are the only motor or sports games available on the GameKing.''\n* ''2004'', essentially the same game as the built in ''2003''.\n* ''Popper'', essentially the same game as the built in ''Miner''.\n* ''Hawk'' or ''Lanneret'', a ''[[Choplifter]]'' clone.\n* ''Dino Adventure'', essentially ''Carlo Adventure Legend'' with different graphics.\n* ''Duckman'', a ''[[Darkwing Duck (Capcom)|Darkwing Duck]]'' clone.\n* ''Ares'', ''Feichuan'' are all classic arcade shooters, probably using the same engine as ''2003'' and ''2004'' with different graphics.\n* ''Penguin'', an ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]''/''[[Tux Racer]] clone.\n* ''Street Hero'', a ''[[Double Dragon]]'' clone.\n* ''Trojan Legend'', a ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]] clone.\n* ''Seatercel'', a ''[[Tiger Heli]] clone.\n* ''Star Wars'', a ''[[Macross]]''-based clone, allowing the player to choose all three shapeshifting Fighter-Gerwalk-Battroid configurations.\n* ''Nagual'', a ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu Master]]'' clone.\n* ''Blaster'', a ''[[Blaster Master]]'' clone, a platform game with a shooting vehicle.\n* ''Chaser'', a marine defense game (clone unknown).\n* ''Star Ghazi'' or ''Star Chazi'', a ''[[Star Force]]'' clone\n* ''HERO'': a ''[[Batman]]'' or ''[[H.E.R.O. (video game)|H.E.R.O.]]'' clone.\n* ''Dracula Zone'' or ''Surf Eidolon'': A ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' clone(?).\n* ''Pocket Tank'', a ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]''/''[[Front Line (arcade game)|Front Line]]'' clone with a tank.\n* ''Warrior'', a ''[[Front Line (arcade game)|Front Line]]'' clone without the tank.\n* ''Clever Hawk'', a ''[[Star Force]]''-like game, but not the same game as ''Star Ghazi''.\n* ''Valliant'', a robot space fighting game (clone unknown). The sprites are pretty large.\n* ''Metal Deform'', a platform game with shooting elements and a jetpack(?). (clone unknown)\n* ''Three Battles'', an ''[[Ikari Warriors]]''-like game.\n* ''Lightsword'', a shooter that puts you on foot and then into a flying-robot shooter form (clone unknown).\n* ''Risker'', a game similar to ''[[Spy Hunter]]'' in mechanics.\n* ''Catman'', another platform game with weapons, but with large sprites.\n* ''Armada'', an arcade shooter (clone unknown).\n* ''Brains'', a puzzle-action game, clone unknown.\n\nGames are generally sold in separate cartridges, but there are 4-in-1 cartridges holding 4 distinct games. Later games seem to be only available in this manner. Also, each 4-in-1 pack comes numbered and higher numbers seem to provide games that are more refined in presentation.\n\nSome of these games found in 4-in-1 cartridges are:\n \n* ''Cyclon Action''\n* ''Might''\n* ''CarMan''\n* ''Spectask''\n* ''Captain'' (Which seems to use music from ''[[Mega Man X]]'')\n* ''Seaguard''\n* ''Whirlybird''\n* ''Happy Garden''\n* ''Airhero''\n* ''Magician''\n* ''Explorer''\n* ''Farer''\n* ''Seabedwar''\n* ''Sortie''\n* ''Phantom Fighter''\n\n===GameKing III games===\nGameKing III machines have a built-in game:\n* ''Galaxy Crisis''\nAt the moment the only known game carts for the GameKing III come from a picture:<ref>[http://www.mimibazar.cz/foto.php?id=1080302 GameKing III cartridges]{{dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref>\n* ''Adventure''\n* ''Urgent Action''\n* ''Diamond''\n* ''Panzer''\n* ''Fly Car''\n* ''Blaze Plane''\n* ''2030''\n* ''Hermic Battle''\n* ''Vagrant''\n\n===HandyGame (GM-228) games===\nThe NES-clone version of the GameKing III has its own selection of games, most of them being pirated or unlicensed NES games or variations. These come multi-carts with combinations such as 26in1, 49in1,and 72in1, etc. No HandyGame carts are compatible with any previous model.\n\n==References==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20080204211506/http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/000269.html\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Handheld game consoles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gameking}}\n[[Category:Handheld game consoles]]\n[[Category:Monochrome video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Sixth-generation video game consoles]]\n", "name_user": "Upgameking", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameKing"}

The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours [[Farinograph#Method|absorb]] about 62% [[water]], while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Finley, John H. |author2=Phillips, R.

Flour provides the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The [[protein]] content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread [[dough]] and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12\u201314%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9\u201311%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hamelman, Jeffrey  |title=Bread: a baker's book of techniques and recipes |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=7\u201313 |quote=A high gluten white flour will require more mix time than a white flour with a lower gluten content,... |isbn=978-0-471-16857-7 }}</ref>\n\nWheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups ([[albumin]], [[globulin]], and [[proteose]]s) and two water-insoluble protein groups ([[glutenin]] and [[gliadin]]). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by [[kneading]], or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see [[no-knead bread]]), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as [[gluten]]. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to [[autolyse]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=Gary |last2=Carey |first2=Patrick |last3=Tinton |first3=Terry |last4=Walpole |first4=Steven |title=Professional Chef: Level 2 Diploma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iGHqXWigQ4C&pg=RA17-PA10 |year=2007 |publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA |isbn=978-1-84480-706-2 |pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Liquids===\nWater, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough.

There are two common methods. The first is to use [[baking powder]] or a [[self-raising flour]] that includes baking powder.  The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as [[buttermilk]] and add [[baking soda]]; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas.<ref name=BAC/> Chemically leavened breads are called ''[[quick bread]]s'' and ''[[soda bread]]s''. This method is commonly used to make [[muffin]]s, [[pancake]]s, American-style [[biscuits]], and quick breads such as [[banana bread]].\n\n===Yeast===\n{{Main|Baker's yeast}}\n[[File:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|Compressed fresh yeast]]\n\nMany breads are leavened by [[yeast]]. The yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages. This yeast [[Fermentation|ferments]] some of the [[carbohydrate]]s in the flour, including any [[sugar]], producing [[carbon dioxide]]. Commercial bakers often leaven their dough with commercially produced [[baker's yeast]]. Baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a [[pure culture]].<ref name=BAC/> Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast with a growth culture. If kept in the right conditions, it provides leavening for many years.<ref name=\"isbn0-387-38563-0-cite4\">{{cite book |author1=Young, Linda |author2=Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Technology of Breadmaking |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-387-38563-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXtJivmeDfcC&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe baker's yeast and [[sourdough]] methods follow the same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to [[Proofing (baking technique)|rise]] one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often \"punch down\" the dough and let it rise again), loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an [[oven]].<ref name=BAC/>\n\nMany breads are made from a \"[[straight dough]]\", which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time;<ref name=BAC/> others are made from a \"[[pre-ferment]]\" in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: \"[[poolish]]\" or \"pouliche\", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); \"[[biga (bread baking)|biga]]\", a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and \"p\u00e2te ferment\u00e9e\", which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artisan bread baking tips: Poolish & biga|url=https://www.weekendbakery.com/posts/more-artisan-bread-baking-tips-poolish-biga/|website=Weekend Bakery|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preferments|publisher=King Arthur Flour}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[File:Breaddough1.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (566 / 545)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough1.jpg]]\n| [[File:Breaddough2.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1942 / 1944)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough2.jpg]]\n| [[File:Risen bread dough in tin.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1752 / 1094)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ARisen%20bread%20dough%20in%20tin.jpg]]\n|-\n| Before first rising\n| After first rising\n| After [[proofing (baking technique)|proofing]], ready to bake\n|}</center>[[File:Sour dough loaves03.jpg|thumb|Sourdough loaves]]\n\n===Sourdough===\n{{Main|Sourdough}}\nSourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]].

The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture.<ref name=DavidsonSourdough/> At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs. Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mesure|first1=Susie|title=Supermarkets cash in on sourdough bread craze as popularity surges |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/supermarkets-cash-in-on-sourdough-bread-craze-as-popularity-surges-a6844101.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2016|date=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, peasant families throughout Europe baked on a fixed schedule, perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week's dough. The starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week's bread).<ref name=BAC/>\n\n===Steam===\nThe rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is as simple as it is unpredictable.  Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix.

The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most.

Flour provides the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The [[protein]] content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread [[dough]] and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12\u201314%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9\u201311%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hamelman, Jeffrey  |title=Bread: a baker's book of techniques and recipes |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=7\u201313 |quote=A high gluten white flour will require more mix time than a white flour with a lower gluten content,... |isbn=978-0-471-16857-7 }}</ref>\n\nWheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups ([[albumin]], [[globulin]], and [[proteose]]s) and two water-insoluble protein groups ([[glutenin]] and [[gliadin]]). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by [[kneading]], or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see [[no-knead bread]]), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as [[gluten]]. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to [[autolyse]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=Gary |last2=Carey |first2=Patrick |last3=Tinton |first3=Terry |last4=Walpole |first4=Steven |title=Professional Chef: Level 2 Diploma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iGHqXWigQ4C&pg=RA17-PA10 |year=2007 |publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA |isbn=978-1-84480-706-2 |pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Liquids===\nWater, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough.

There are two common methods. The first is to use [[baking powder]] or a [[self-raising flour]] that includes baking powder.  The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as [[buttermilk]] and add [[baking soda]]; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas.<ref name=BAC/> Chemically leavened breads are called ''[[quick bread]]s'' and ''[[soda bread]]s''. This method is commonly used to make [[muffin]]s, [[pancake]]s, American-style [[biscuits]], and quick breads such as [[banana bread]].\n\n===Yeast===\n{{Main|Baker's yeast}}\n[[File:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|Compressed fresh yeast]]\n\nMany breads are leavened by [[yeast]]. The yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages. This yeast [[Fermentation|ferments]] some of the [[carbohydrate]]s in the flour, including any [[sugar]], producing [[carbon dioxide]]. Commercial bakers often leaven their dough with commercially produced [[baker's yeast]]. Baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a [[pure culture]].<ref name=BAC/> Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast with a growth culture. If kept in the right conditions, it provides leavening for many years.<ref name=\"isbn0-387-38563-0-cite4\">{{cite book |author1=Young, Linda |author2=Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Technology of Breadmaking |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-387-38563-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXtJivmeDfcC&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe baker's yeast and [[sourdough]] methods follow the same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to [[Proofing (baking technique)|rise]] one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often \"punch down\" the dough and let it rise again), loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an [[oven]].<ref name=BAC/>\n\nMany breads are made from a \"[[straight dough]]\", which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time;<ref name=BAC/> others are made from a \"[[pre-ferment]]\" in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: \"[[poolish]]\" or \"pouliche\", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); \"[[biga (bread baking)|biga]]\", a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and \"p\u00e2te ferment\u00e9e\", which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artisan bread baking tips: Poolish & biga|url=https://www.weekendbakery.com/posts/more-artisan-bread-baking-tips-poolish-biga/|website=Weekend Bakery|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preferments|publisher=King Arthur Flour}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[File:Breaddough1.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (566 / 545)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough1.jpg]]\n| [[File:Breaddough2.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1942 / 1944)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough2.jpg]]\n| [[File:Risen bread dough in tin.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1752 / 1094)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ARisen%20bread%20dough%20in%20tin.jpg]]\n|-\n| Before first rising\n| After first rising\n| After [[proofing (baking technique)|proofing]], ready to bake\n|}</center>[[File:Sour dough loaves03.jpg|thumb|Sourdough loaves]]\n\n===Sourdough===\n{{Main|Sourdough}}\nSourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]].

The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture.<ref name=DavidsonSourdough/> At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs.

Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edwards, W.P.|title=The science of bakery products |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge |year=2007 |page=68 |isbn=978-0-85404-486-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&pg=PA68|quote=When bread expands in the oven the resulting expansion is known as oven spring.

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an [[artist]] and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job. Whether the end result is art, is unknown [to him]'.<ref name=\"Interview for Inkscape Magazine\">>{{cite web | url=https://sreysarkar.weebly.com/| title= Interview for Inkscape Magazine| publisher=

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an [[artist]] and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.
