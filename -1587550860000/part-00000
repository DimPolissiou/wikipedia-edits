Licca-chan also likes ''[[Doraemon]]''.<ref name=\"kidswebjapan\"/>\n\n[[Rough Trade Records]] teamed up with Takara in the late 90s to release \"Street Licca\", who was a DJ that carried a Rough Trade record satchel, and mini, doll-sized LPs from the labels' artists.

Street Licca was the ultimate \"indie rock\" doll.\n\nIn 2001, a pregnant adult version of Licca-chan was introduced which included a postcard the purchaser could send to Takara for a baby doll.

The initial plan was for the company to plan a dollhouse which could be carried by children, for dressing dolls of other companies like Mattel.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Okazaki|first=Manami|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2017/07/08/lifestyle/living-doll-licca-chans-legacy-lives/|title=Living doll: Licca-chan's legacy lives on|date=2017-07-08|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref> The size was larger than expected and the plan was reviewed not suitable for Japanese housing circumstances and children's carrying. While planning, a fashion doll, in a setting of elementary school, the height 21 cm to fit in the palm was in favor, adopting characteristics of a cartoon girl.

Subsequently, the name \"Rica\" became known as a name that works for both Japanese and foreigners. Two years after the launch in 1969, the dolls were accepted by the Japanese children causing Mattel (Mattel's Barbies) to move its production base to another country, focusing less on sales in Japan. Licca-chan started exceeding Barbie sales and began to reign as the queen of Japanese dress-up dolls.<ref name=\":0\" /> Despite the popularity, Licca-chan dolls suffered a decline in sales in the 1990s due to rival dolls based on the anime like Sailor Moon. In 1996, Licca-chan returned to the top sales of dress-up dolls again. \n\nEven now, Licca-chan is highly recognized and it is even used as a synonym for other dolls from different companies. From its high recognition from the Takara era to the current Takara Tomy, Licca is positioned as a corporate identity character of the manufacturer.<ref name=\":0\" /> As of today, Japan\u2019s Licca and America\u2019s Barbie are the only two fashion dolls in the world that have lasted more than 25 years and their sales are always in competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-10-27-wr-979-story.html|title=Culture : 'Doll Wars' Challenge Female Ideal : Japan likes 'cute.'

Subsequently, the name \"Rica\" became known as a name that works for both Japanese and foreigners. Two years after the launch in 1969, the dolls were accepted by the Japanese children causing Mattel (Mattel's Barbies) to move its production base to another country, focusing less on sales in Japan. Licca-chan started exceeding Barbie sales and began to reign as the queen of Japanese dress-up dolls.<ref name=\":0\" /> Despite the popularity, Licca-chan dolls suffered a decline in sales in the 1990s due to rival dolls based on the anime like Sailor Moon. In 1996, Licca-chan returned to the top sales of dress-up dolls again. \n\nEven now, Licca-chan is highly recognized and it is even used as a synonym for other dolls from different companies.
