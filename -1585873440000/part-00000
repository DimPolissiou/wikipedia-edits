2017)]]\n[[File:Oil Reserves Top 5 Countries.png|thumb|Trends in proven oil reserves in top five countries, 1980\u20132013 (data from US Energy Information Administration)]]\n[[File:Oil Reserves Updated.png|thumb|right|A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, January 2014]]\n\nThis is a '''list of countries by [[oil reserves|proven oil reserves]]'''. Proven reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated, with a high degree of confidence, to be commercially recoverable from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions.\n\nSome statistics on this page are disputed and controversial. Different sources ([[OPEC]], [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], [[list of oil exploration and production companies|oil companies]]) give different figures. Some of the differences reflect different types of oil included. Different estimates may or may not include [[oil shale]], mined [[oil sands]] or [[Natural-gas processing#Contaminants in raw natural gas|natural gas liquids]].\n\nBecause proven reserves include oil recoverable under current economic conditions, nations may see large increases in proven reserves when known, but previously uneconomic deposits become economic to develop. In this way, Canada's proven reserves increased suddenly in 2003 when the oil sands of [[Alberta]] were seen to be economically viable. Similarly, Venezuela's proven reserves jumped in the late 2000s when the heavy oil of the [[Orinoco Belt]] was judged economic.\n\n== Countries ==\n<!-- BEFORE YOU CHANGE THE TABLE, PLEASE NOTE:\nThis is a table only for PROVEN RESERVES, which is a restricted classification not always understood by popular news reports. Other reserve classifications or descriptions often used, including ESTIMATED, PROBABLE, POSSIBLE, or LIKELY reserves, DO NOT BELONG IN THIS TABLE. -->\n\nReserves amounts are listed in millions of [[barrel (unit)|barrels]].
