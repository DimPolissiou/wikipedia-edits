According to both sources, Paul was not a follower of Jesus and did not know him before his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Paul's conversion occurred after Jesus' crucifixion. The accounts of Paul's conversion experience describe it as miraculous, supernatural, or otherwise revelatory in nature.\n\n===Before conversion===\nBefore his conversion, Paul, also known as Saul, was \"a Pharisee of [[Pharisees]]\", who \"[[Persecution of Christians|intensely persecuted]]\" the followers of Jesus. Says Paul in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]]: \"For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.\" (Galatians 1:13\u201314), [[NIV]]\n\nPaul also discusses his pre-conversion life in his [[Epistle to the Philippians]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|Philippians|3:4-6||3:4-6}} and his participation in the [[Saint Stephen#Martyrdom|stoning of Stephen]] is described in {{Bibleref2|Acts|7:57-8:3}}.\n\n===Pauline epistles===\nIn the Pauline epistles, the description of the conversion experience is brief. The [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|9:1}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|15:3-8}} describes Paul as [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|having seen the risen Christ]]:\n{{quote|For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.|1 Cor. 15:3\u20138, NIV}}\n\nThe [[Epistle to the Galatians]] [[Galatians 1|chapter 1]] also describes his conversion as a divine [[revelation]], with Jesus appearing to Paul.\n{{quote|I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.\n\nFor you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. ...But when God, who set me apart from my mother\u2019s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being.|Galatians 1:11-16, NIV}}\n\n===Acts of the Apostles===\nActs of the Apostles discusses Paul's conversion experience at three different points in the text, in far more detail than in the accounts in Paul's letters. The Book of Acts says that Paul was on his way from [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] to Syrian [[Early Christianity#Damascus|Damascus]] with a mandate issued by the [[Kohen ha-Gadol|High Priest]] to seek out and arrest followers of Jesus, with the intention of returning them to Jerusalem as prisoners for questioning and possible execution.<ref>Acts 9:2</ref> The journey is interrupted when Paul sees a blinding light, and communicates directly with a divine voice.\n\n{{Bibleref2|Acts|9}} tells the story as a [[third-person narrative]]:\n{{quote|As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\"\n\n\"Who are you, Lord?\" Saul asked.\n\n\"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,\" he replied. \"Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.\"\n\nThe men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. Paul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.|Acts 9:3\u20139, NIV}}\n\n[[File:Ananias restoring the sight of st paul (34663925).jpg|thumb|right|''Ananias Restoring the Sight of St. Paul'' (c.1631) by [[Pietro da Cortona]].]]\nThe account continues with a description of [[Ananias of Damascus]] receiving a divine revelation instructing him to visit Saul at the house of Judas on the [[Street Called Straight]] and there [[Laying on of hands|lay hands]] on him to restore his sight (the house of Judas is traditionally believed to have been near the west end of the street).<ref name=\"JohnPhillips\">John Phillips, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FozDQzGHxmsC&pg=PA179 Exploring Acts: An expository commentary]'', Kregel Academic, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8254-3490-4}}, p. 179.</ref> Ananias is initially reluctant, having heard about Saul's persecution, but obeys the divine command:\n{{quote|Then Ananias went to the house and entered it.

For example, {{Bibleref2|Acts|9:7}} notes that Paul's companions did not see who he was speaking to, while {{Bibleref2|Acts|22:9}} indicates that they did share in seeing the light (see also [[Conversion of Paul#Differences|Differences between the accounts]], below).

Additionally, Paul's blindness remitted in sudden fashion, rather than the gradual resolution typical of post-ictal states, and no mention is made of epileptic [[convulsion]]s; indeed such convulsions may, in Paul's time, have been interpreted as a sign of demonic influence, unlikely in someone accepted as a religious leader.<ref name=\"Brorson\"/>\n\nA 2012 paper in the ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'' suggested that Paul\u2019s conversion experience might be understood as involving psychogenic events.

According to both sources, Paul was not a follower of Jesus and did not know him before his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Paul's conversion occurred after Jesus' crucifixion. The accounts of Paul's conversion experience describe it as miraculous, supernatural, or otherwise revelatory in nature.\n\n===Before conversion===\nBefore his conversion, Paul, also known as Saul, was \"a Pharisee of [[Pharisees]]\", who \"[[Persecution of Christians|intensely persecuted]]\" the followers of Jesus. Says Paul in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]]: \"For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.\" (Galatians 1:13\u201314), [[NIV]]\n\nPaul also discusses his pre-conversion life in his [[Epistle to the Philippians]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|Philippians|3:4-6||3:4-6}} and his participation in the [[Saint Stephen#Martyrdom|stoning of Stephen]] is described in {{Bibleref2|Acts|7:57-8:3}}.\n\n===Pauline epistles===\nIn the Pauline epistles, the description of the conversion experience is brief.

Additionally, Paul's blindness remitted in sudden fashion, rather than the gradual resolution typical of post-ictal states, and no mention is made of epileptic [[convulsion]]s; indeed such convulsions may, in Paul's time, have been interpreted as a sign of demonic influence, unlikely in someone accepted as a religious leader.<ref name=\"Brorson\"/>\n\nA 2012 paper in the ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'' suggested that Paul\u2019s conversion experience might be understood as involving psychogenic events.

He attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Sanskrit]] and the classics. In 1896, he achieved a first-class result in [[Honour Moderations|mods]], and was awarded a [[Boden Scholarship]] in Sanskrit in 1897.  He was given honorable mentions for the Hertford (1895), Ireland (1896) and Craven (1896) scholarships.\n\nClementi was ''proxime accessit'' (runner-up) for the [[Gaisford Prize|Gaisford Greek Prose prize]] in 1897, and obtained his B.A. (2nd class ''[[Literae Humaniores|lit. hum.]]'', i.e. classics) in 1898. Clementi was also ''proxime accessit'' for the Chancellor's Latin Essay prize in 1899, and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] in 1901.\n\n==Early colonial service==\nIn 1899, Clementi placed fourth in the competitive examinations for the civil service, which allowed him his choice of postings. His choice was Hong Kong, and upon his arrival he was sent up to [[Guangzhou|Canton]], where he was a land officer until forced to return to Hong Kong by the events of the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Clementi's facility with languages was demonstrated when he passed the Cantonese examination in 1900, and the Pekingese examination six years later, in 1906.\n\nAfter serving as an Assistant Registrar General in 1901, Clementi joined as a member of the Board of Examiners in Chinese, in 1902. In 1902, Clementi was seconded for special service under government of India and was created [[Justice of the Peace|J.P.]] in that same year. A year later, he was seconded for famine relief work in Kwangsi ([[Guangxi]]). A year afterwards, Clementi was appointed Member of Land Court, Assistant Land Officer and Police Magistrate at [[New Territories]], Hong Kong, a position he served in until 1906.\n\nDue to his outstanding performance in the services, Clementi was promoted to Assistant Colonial Secretary and Clerk of Council, in 1907. While he was in that position, Clementi represented the Hong Kong government in the International Opium Conference at Shanghai, in 1909. A year later, he became the Private Secretary to the Administrator at that time, Sir [[Francis Henry May]]. Clementi eventually became Acting Colonial Secretary and Member of both the Executive and Legislative Councils of Hong Kong. He would remain there until 1912.\n\nClementi played a part in the founding of the [[University of Hong Kong]]. Indeed, he wrote the words, in Latin, of the University Anthem, first performed 11 March 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/archivesandmanuscripts/2015/11/19/sir-cecil-clementi-and-the-university-of-hong-kong/|title=Sir Cecil Clementi and the University of Hong Kong|work=Archives & Manuscripts at the Bodleian Library [[University of Oxford]]|date=19 November 2015|accessdate= 12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Clementi was appointed Colonial Secretary of [[British Guiana]], a post he held until 1922. From there he was named the Colonial Secretary of [[Ceylon]], where he served until 1925. Each position imparted considerable responsibility, and on more than one occasion he was in charge of administering the entire government of his area of responsibility. Whilst in Ceylon he served as President of the [[Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society]] in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalasiaticsociety.lk/about-2/past-presidents/|title=Past Presidents|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka|accessdate= 7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of Hong Kong==\nIn 1925, Clementi was appointed as [[Governor of Hong Kong]], a position to which his fluency in Cantonese suited him well and in which he served until 1930.<ref>{{cite book|title=Governing Hong Kong: Administrative Officers from the 19th Century to the Handover to China, 1862\u20131997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THR5HVD4aYEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781845115258|date=2007|publisher=[[I.B.

He also notably ended the practice of ''[[Mui Tsai]]'', the traditional Chinese \"female maid servitude\" system which often resulted in the abuse of young servant girls. He also appointed [[Shouson Chow]], a prominent Chinese merchant, as the first unofficial member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]]. At the same time, he increased the numbers of official and non-official (\"Unofficial\") members in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] from eight to ten (including the Governor) and from six to eight, respectively.

He attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Sanskrit]] and the classics. In 1896, he achieved a first-class result in [[Honour Moderations|mods]], and was awarded a Boden scholarship in Sanskrit in 1897.  He was given honorable mentions for the Hertford (1895), Ireland (1896) and Craven (1896) scholarships.\n\nClementi was ''proxime accessit'' (runner-up) for the [[Gaisford Prize|Gaisford Greek Prose prize]] in 1897, and obtained his B.A. (2nd class ''[[Literae Humaniores|lit. hum.]]'', i.e. classics) in 1898. Clementi was also ''proxime accessit'' for the Chancellor's Latin Essay prize in 1899, and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] in 1901.\n\n==Early colonial service==\nIn 1899, Clementi placed fourth in the competitive examinations for the civil service, which allowed him his choice of postings. His choice was Hong Kong, and upon his arrival he was sent up to [[Guangzhou|Canton]], where he was a land officer until forced to return to Hong Kong by the events of the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Clementi's facility with languages was demonstrated when he passed the Cantonese examination in 1900, and the Pekingese examination six years later, in 1906.\n\nAfter serving as an Assistant Registrar General in 1901, Clementi joined as a member of the Board of Examiners in Chinese, in 1902. In 1902, Clementi was seconded for special service under government of India and was created [[Justice of the Peace|J.P.]] in that same year. A year later, he was seconded for famine relief work in Kwangsi ([[Guangxi]]). A year afterwards, Clementi was appointed Member of Land Court, Assistant Land Officer and Police Magistrate at [[New Territories]], Hong Kong, a position he served in until 1906.\n\nDue to his outstanding performance in the services, Clementi was promoted to Assistant Colonial Secretary and Clerk of Council, in 1907. While he was in that position, Clementi represented the Hong Kong government in the International Opium Conference at Shanghai, in 1909. A year later, he became the Private Secretary to the Administrator at that time, Sir [[Francis Henry May]]. Clementi eventually became Acting Colonial Secretary and Member of both the Executive and Legislative Councils of Hong Kong. He would remain there until 1912.\n\nClementi played a part in the founding of the [[University of Hong Kong]]. Indeed, he wrote the words, in Latin, of the University Anthem, first performed 11 March 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/archivesandmanuscripts/2015/11/19/sir-cecil-clementi-and-the-university-of-hong-kong/|title=Sir Cecil Clementi and the University of Hong Kong|work=Archives & Manuscripts at the Bodleian Library [[University of Oxford]]|date=19 November 2015|accessdate= 12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Clementi was appointed Colonial Secretary of [[British Guiana]], a post he held until 1922. From there he was named the Colonial Secretary of [[Ceylon]], where he served until 1925. Each position imparted considerable responsibility, and on more than one occasion he was in charge of administering the entire government of his area of responsibility. Whilst in Ceylon he served as President of the [[Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society]] in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalasiaticsociety.lk/about-2/past-presidents/|title=Past Presidents|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka|accessdate= 7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of Hong Kong==\nIn 1925, Clementi was appointed as [[Governor of Hong Kong]], a position to which his fluency in Cantonese suited him well and in which he served until 1930.<ref>{{cite book|title=Governing Hong Kong: Administrative Officers from the 19th Century to the Handover to China, 1862\u20131997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THR5HVD4aYEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781845115258|date=2007|publisher=[[I.B.

He also notably ended the practice of ''[[Mui Tsai]]'', the traditional Chinese \"female maid servitude\" system which often resulted in the abuse of young servant girls. He also appointed [[Shouson Chow]], a prominent Chinese merchant, as the first unofficial member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]]. At the same time, he increased the numbers of official and non-official (\"Unofficial\") members in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] from eight to ten (including the Governor) and from six to eight, respectively. He invited one Chinese and one Portuguese ([[Jose Pedro Braga]]) to be Unofficials.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=T.

The position of Governor was later filled by Sir [[Shenton Thomas]] on 9 November 1934.\n\nSix years later, in 1940, Clementi became the Master of the [[Mercers' Company]].\n\n==Personal life==\nClementi was the nephew of the Rt. Hon. Sir [[Cecil Clementi Smith]] (1860\u20131916), Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner in the period 1887 to 1893. He was also the great-grandson of the [[Italy|Italian]]-born musician [[Muzio Clementi]].\n\nClementi married Marie Penelope Rose Eyres, daughter of Admiral Cresswell John Eyres, in 1912.
