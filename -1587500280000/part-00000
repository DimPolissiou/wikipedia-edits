The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation uses a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode (early models had the option of full automatic mode, or standard \"soft-tip\" which was manual mode indicated by no button on the gearshift) or in semi-automatic (half automatic) mode via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\nFrom 2009, revised transmission software enabled smoother and faster gear changes.

The turbo-diesel engine had 799&nbsp;cc displacement giving 30&nbsp;kW (41&nbsp;hp).\n\n===Models===\nThe Fortwo is available as a coupe or [[cabriolet]], originally called the \"city coupe\" & \"city cabrio\", now the \"Fortwo\" & \"Fortwo cabrio\", introduced in 2000 and restyled in 2002. Trim levels include the Pure, Pulse, and Passion. Pure models are fitted with the standard audio system but nothing else; Pulse models are fitted with alloy wheels, panoramic glass roof and paddle-shifters on the steering wheel (2004+); and finally, the Passion models are fitted with air-conditioning and ability to select between fully automatic and sequential gearbox.\n* '''Limited 1''': The first limited edition of which 7500 were made, all left-hand drive. It was released at the original launch in 1998. It had a black Tridion cell and white body panels. It also had alloy wheels, a Limited 1 insignia, and a blue interior with beige leather finishings. It was supplied with a certificate showing which number out of the 7500, and a plaque with this number below the windshield on the inside.\n* '''SE''': This was the second limited edition that smart made; it was sold in mid 2001 (Mk5) and all were left hand drive. They were all Pulse specification with a redesigned steering wheel, soft touch, air conditioning, CD Multichanger and drinks holder as standard. The engine power was upped to 61BHP from the standard 55BHP normally applied to the Pulse in the 600cc G1 cars. It was designated by a SE badge on the boot and was sold in Bay Grey with grey interior and dark blue twist fabric.\n* '''Cdi''': has the world's smallest production [[common rail|common-rail direct injection]] [[diesel engine]]. With a consumption of 3.3 litres ([[New European Driving Cycle|NEDC]]) per 100 kilometres (71.2 mpg) and [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions of just 88&nbsp;grams per kilometre, it has the lowest current production car CO<sub>2</sub> emissions worldwide, since [[Audi]] and [[Volkswagen]] retired its 3-cylinder cars, the [[Audi A2#1.2 TDI|A2 1.2 TDI]] and the [[Volkswagen Lupo#Lupo 3L|Lupo 1.2 TDI]] respectively.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-smart-fortwo-micro-hybrid-launches/ |title=Frankfurt 2007: Smart Fortwo micro hybrid launched |publisher=AutoblogGreen |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n* '''Crossblade''': a 2002 limited-edition variant of the city cabrio, a roadster without a windshield, roof or conventional doors. Its weight was still {{convert|740|kg}}. The [[Brabus]]-tuned engine developed 52&nbsp;kW (71&nbsp;PS) from its 599&nbsp;cc engine. After [[Robbie Williams]] purchased Crossblade number 008, Smart began a marketing association with him, using him to promote the brand and the new [[Forfour]].\n* '''[[Smart Crosstown|Crosstown]]''': a convertible with a foldable windshield based on the Fortwo, was presented at IAA Frankfurt in 2005. No plans have been announced to bring this model to market.\n* '''Nightrun''': includes instrument panels, steering wheel, paddles, shifter, Monoblock VI alloy wheels, leather seats and engine upgrade from Brabus. Edition Nightrun is only available with the Fortwo coup\u00e9/cabrio.\n* '''Truestyle''': painted in metallic ruby red, available in pure trim.\n* '''i-move''': a special edition run of 70 Fortwo cabrios, based on the Passion cabrio specs with [[Brabus]] Monobloc VI wheels, leather interior trim, Lite White panels, an iPod cradle with special edition 20Gb 3G iPod, and an aluminium name plate on the dash confirmed its special edition status.\n* '''Forfun2 Concept''': an off-road version of the Fortwo introduced at the 2005 Athens Motor Show by Greek 4x4 Rally Champion Stefan Attart. It combines the body of a Fortwo with the chassis and drivetrain of a [[Unimog]].

It also featured wider wheels, revised front spoiler and grille, and a revised rear exhaust.\n* '''K''': launched in October 2001, exclusively for the [[Japan]]ese market. It was designed to fit the [[Japan]]ese [[kei car]] regulations by adopting specially developed rear fenders and narrowing the track width and tire dimensions and the width reduced to 1.47&nbsp;m. The engine displacement remains unchanged at 598 cc, as specified in the standard. Safety features include ESP ([[Electronic Stability Program]]) and BAS ([[Brake Assist System]]) as standard.

Smart subsequently designed a floorpan for right-hand-drive models.  The Fortwo is now marketed in 37 countries worldwide.\n\n'''Australia''': The Smart Fortwo was marketed through select [[Mercedes-Benz]] dealers in [[Australia]] from 2003 to 2015 in only the middle 'Pulse' range, and with the petrol engine. In 2007, the base price for the Fortwo coup\u00e9 was [[Australian dollar|A$]]19,900, and the Fortwo cabriolet was $22,900.

It was offered with the \"micro-hybrid drive\"  natural aspirated engine (mhd) in standard configuration with a special edition named \"Brazilian Edition\" which was offered only in yellow (in reference to the Brazilian Flag) with a Brazilian flag sticker on both sides, and turbocharged versions named \"standard\" (no name), Tritop and Passion. The mhd were offered only in \"coup\u00e9\" configuration with no sunroof, and turbocharged versions were offered in both coup\u00e9 (with sunroof) and cabrio variants.\n\nA few units of the fortwo Brabus were also offered in Brazil in the year 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Mercedes-Benz decided to discontinue offer of the fortwo in Brazilian market, hence Brazilian customers never had the option of the 453.\n\nThere are also a few W450s in Brazil, although they weren't officially imported by Mercedes-Benz and have no official support.\n\n'''China''':\nIn April 2008, Smart premiered at the 2008 [[Beijing Auto Show]]. In October 2008, the Smart \"[[vending machine]]\" road show had the first stop in [[Shenyang]] and began the Fortwo's pre-order period.\n\n'''Japan''': The Fortwo is the only non-Japanese car ever to fulfil the regulations for [[Kei car]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} There is a Japan-only variant of the first generation Smart Fortwo, called the Smart K.\n\n===Canada===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:2013 Smart Fortwo -- 2012 NYIAS.JPG|thumb|2013 Smart Fortwo]]\n\nThe smart fortwo was introduced in [[Canada]] in September 2004 and sold through Mercedes-Benz dealers. Only the turbo-diesel powerplant was offered for the 450 coup\u00e9 and 450 convertible models because the fuel vapour recovery system for the gasoline-powered car would have had to be redesigned to meet Transport Canada standards.  Diesels do not require such a system because the fuel is not volatile, so the cdi was certified instead.  Demand was initially heavy, with up to six-month waiting lists in major urban areas in the spring of 2005. 10,242 cdi cars were imported in model years 2005 and 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag%3Dsmart-car-history |title=Greg Williams \u2013 Motor Writer \u2014 Automobiles, Trucks, Motorcycles old and new |accessdate=2015-04-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094615/http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag=smart-car-history |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>  Two or three of these were used in Transport Canada crash testing.\n\nCanada received three special versions of the 450 cdi: the grandstyle\u2014only available in dark green with silver, and beige leather\u2014of which 200 were imported in coup\u00e9 and cabriolet forms, the BRABUS nightrun\u2014equipped with BRABUS accessories at the Hambach factory, which only came as a black on black (with blue-grey leather) coup\u00e9, and 50 of those were delivered, and finally the BRABUS Tailor Made Canada 1 models, of which only four were produced, three red on red and one white on white, all with highest equipment levels and all BRABUS accessories, high-quality dyed-through leather and Alcantara interiors.  The white car is a cabriolet, as are two of the red ones.  The sole Canada 1 coup\u00e9 has a fixed glass roof.\n\nIn 2008, Canada received only the gasoline 451 model because the diesel version did not meet 2007 Canadian emission standards. The 451 fortwo carries a 1.0-litre engine that delivers up to {{convert|70|hp}} and a re-engineered automated-manual 5-speed transmission with a slightly larger body.

The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation uses a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode (early models had the option of full automatic mode, or standard \"soft-tip\" which was manual mode indicated by no button on the gearshift) or in semi-automatic (half automatic) mode via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\nFrom 2009, revised transmission software enabled smoother and faster gear changes. The software, available via an ECU upgrade, was also made available for 2008 second generation cars, with a new battery as required.<ref>{{cite web|last='qwcdirect' |title=SMART FOURTWO |url=http://www.houndgear.org/category/smart/ |accessdate=10 September 2010 |date=13 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228054019/http://www.houndgear.org/category/smart/ |archivedate=December 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last='tampasmart'|title=Do you need smart 2.0 upgrade?|url=http://www.smartcarofamerica.com/forums/f25/do-you-need-smart-2-0-upgrade-21725/|work= Smart Car of America Forums|accessdate=10 September 2010|date=4 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThird generation models receive a five-speed manual transmission or dual clutch automated manual transmission.\n\n===Parking===\nWith an overall length (first generation: 2.5&nbsp;m (98.4&nbsp;in)) approximately equal to the width of regular parking space, a smart Fortwo can park perpendicularly in spaces typically designed for [[parallel parking]], allowing two Smarts to park in one space\u2014a manner of parking not permissible in many jurisdictions worldwide (e.g. Austria, New Zealand and California<ref>{{cite web|title=Section 22502 \u2013 Curb Parking|url=http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22502.htm|work=California Vehicle Code|publisher=California DMV|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>).\n\n=={{anchor|1|W450}}First generation (Build series W450, 1998\u20132007)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Smart Fortwo passion front.JPG\n| production = 1998\u20132007\n| name = First generation (W450)\n| aka = Smart City Coup\u00e9 (1998\u20132002)<br />Smart Fortwo (facelift)\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]]\n| front_suspension =\n| rear_suspension =\n| wheelbase = {{convert|71.3|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|98.4|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|59.6|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|61|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|1610|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| engine = {{ubl\n  |0.6\u20130.7 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M160 engine|M160]]'' [[Straight-three engine|I3]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (petrol)\n  |0.8 L ''[[Mercedes-Benz OM660 engine|OM660]]'' [[Straight-three engine|I3]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (diesel)\n  }}\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual]]\n| sp = uk\n}}\n\nThe first generation, build series W450, debuted in 1998 and received a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 2002.\n\n===Engine===\nThe engines are [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] with [[straight-3|three cylinders]].

Trim levels include the Pure, Pulse, and Passion. Pure models are fitted with the standard audio system but nothing else; Pulse models are fitted with alloy wheels, panoramic glass roof and paddle-shifters on the steering wheel (2004+); and finally, the Passion models are fitted with air-conditioning and ability to select between fully automatic and sequential gearbox.\n* '''Limited 1''': The first limited edition of which 7500 were made, all left-hand drive. It was released at the original launch in 1998. It had a black Tridion cell and white body panels. It also had alloy wheels, a Limited 1 insignia, and a blue interior with beige leather finishings. It was supplied with a certificate showing which number out of the 7500, and a plaque with this number below the windshield on the inside.\n* '''SE''': This was the second limited edition that smart made; it was sold in mid 2001 (Mk5) and all were left hand drive. They were all Pulse specification with a redesigned steering wheel, soft touch, air conditioning, CD Multichanger and drinks holder as standard. The engine power was upped to 61BHP from the standard 55BHP normally applied to the Pulse in the 600cc G1 cars. It was designated by a SE badge on the boot and was sold in Bay Grey with grey interior and dark blue twist fabric.\n* '''Cdi''': has the world's smallest production [[common rail|common-rail direct injection]] [[diesel engine]]. With a consumption of 3.3 litres ([[New European Driving Cycle|NEDC]]) per 100 kilometres (71.2 mpg) and [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions of just 88&nbsp;grams per kilometre, it has the lowest current production car CO<sub>2</sub> emissions worldwide, since [[Audi]] and [[Volkswagen]] retired its 3-cylinder cars, the [[Audi A2#1.2 TDI|A2 1.2 TDI]] and the [[Volkswagen Lupo#Lupo 3L|Lupo 1.2 TDI]] respectively.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-smart-fortwo-micro-hybrid-launches/ |title=Frankfurt 2007: Smart Fortwo micro hybrid launched |publisher=AutoblogGreen |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n* '''Crossblade''': a 2002 limited-edition variant of the city cabrio, a roadster without a windshield, roof or conventional doors.

No plans have been announced to bring this model to market.\n* '''Nightrun''': includes instrument panels, steering wheel, paddles, shifter, Monoblock VI alloy wheels, leather seats and engine upgrade from Brabus. Edition Nightrun is only available with the Fortwo coup\u00e9/cabrio.\n* '''Truestyle''': painted in metallic ruby red, available in pure trim.\n* '''i-move''': a special edition run of 70 Fortwo cabrios, based on the Passion cabrio specs with [[Brabus]] Monobloc VI wheels, leather interior trim, Lite White panels, an iPod cradle with special edition 20Gb 3G iPod, and an aluminium name plate on the dash confirmed its special edition status.\n* '''Forfun2 Concept''': an off-road version of the Fortwo introduced at the 2005 Athens Motor Show by Greek 4x4 Rally Champion Stefan Attart.

It also featured wider wheels, revised front spoiler and grille, and a revised rear exhaust.\n* '''K''': launched in October 2001, exclusively for the [[Japan]]ese market. It was designed to fit the [[Japan]]ese [[kei car]] regulations by adopting specially developed rear fenders and narrowing the track width and tire dimensions and the width reduced to 1.47&nbsp;m.

Smart subsequently designed a floorpan for right-hand-drive models.  The Fortwo is now marketed in 37 countries worldwide.\n\n'''Australia''': The Smart Fortwo was marketed through select [[Mercedes-Benz]] dealers in [[Australia]] from 2003 to 2015 in only the middle 'Pulse' range, and with the petrol engine. In 2007, the base price for the Fortwo coup\u00e9 was [[Australian dollar|A$]]19,900, and the Fortwo cabriolet was $22,900.

It was offered with the \"micro-hybrid drive\"  natural aspirated engine (mhd) in standard configuration with a special edition named \"Brazilian Edition\" which was offered only in yellow (in reference to the Brazilian Flag) with a Brazilian flag sticker on both sides, and turbocharged versions named \"standard\" (no name), Tritop and Passion. The mhd were offered only in \"coup\u00e9\" configuration with no sunroof, and turbocharged versions were offered in both coup\u00e9 (with sunroof) and cabrio variants.\n\nA few units of the fortwo Brabus were also offered in Brazil in the year 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Mercedes-Benz decided to discontinue offer of the fortwo in Brazilian market, hence Brazilian customers never had the option of the 453.\n\nThere are also a few W450s in Brazil, although they weren't officially imported by Mercedes-Benz and have no official support.\n\n'''China''':\nIn April 2008, Smart premiered at the 2008 [[Beijing Auto Show]]. In October 2008, the Smart \"[[vending machine]]\" road show had the first stop in [[Shenyang]] and began the Fortwo's pre-order period.\n\n'''Japan''': The Fortwo is the only non-Japanese car ever to fulfil the regulations for [[Kei car]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} There is a Japan-only variant of the first generation Smart Fortwo, called the Smart K.\n\n===Canada===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:2013 Smart Fortwo -- 2012 NYIAS.JPG|thumb|2013 Smart Fortwo]]\n\nThe smart fortwo was introduced in [[Canada]] in September 2004 and sold through Mercedes-Benz dealers. Only the turbo-diesel powerplant was offered for the 450 coup\u00e9 and 450 convertible models because the fuel vapour recovery system for the gasoline-powered car would have had to be redesigned to meet Transport Canada standards.  Diesels do not require such a system because the fuel is not volatile, so the cdi was certified instead.  Demand was initially heavy, with up to six-month waiting lists in major urban areas in the spring of 2005. 10,242 cdi cars were imported in model years 2005 and 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag%3Dsmart-car-history |title=Greg Williams \u2013 Motor Writer \u2014 Automobiles, Trucks, Motorcycles old and new |accessdate=2015-04-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094615/http://www.gregwilliams.ca/?tag=smart-car-history |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>  Two or three of these were used in Transport Canada crash testing.\n\nCanada received three special versions of the 450 cdi: the grandstyle\u2014only available in dark green with silver, and beige leather\u2014of which 200 were imported in coup\u00e9 and cabriolet forms, the BRABUS nightrun\u2014equipped with BRABUS accessories at the Hambach factory, which only came as a black on black (with blue-grey leather) coup\u00e9, and 50 of those were delivered, and finally the BRABUS Tailor Made Canada 1 models, of which only four were produced, three red on red and one white on white, all with highest equipment levels and all BRABUS accessories, high-quality dyed-through leather and Alcantara interiors.  The white car is a cabriolet, as are two of the red ones.  The sole Canada 1 coup\u00e9 has a fixed glass roof.\n\nIn 2008, Canada received only the gasoline 451 model because the diesel version did not meet 2007 Canadian emission standards. The 451 fortwo carries a 1.0-litre engine that delivers up to {{convert|70|hp}} and a re-engineered automated-manual 5-speed transmission with a slightly larger body.  This engine has been the sole powertrain for Canada since the 451 was introduced\u2014even the BRABUS models only have 70 HP. The 451 has sold very well in Canada: over 12,600 were registered between the start of 2008 and the end of 2012.  The lack of a diesel option has hindered 451 sales to some owners of the diesel 450s.\n\nCanada received several special versions of the 451 as well: the limited 1, the limited 3, the highstyle, the greystyle, the edit10n BRABUS Tailor Made (ten coup\u00e9s), one all orange \"Ultimate\" BRABUS Tailor Made, the sharpred, among others.\n\nSmart Canada released ten 10th anniversary edition smart Fortwo cars in February 2009. Each car started life as a Canadian BRABUS model before being converted into 10th anniversary editions by BRABUS in Germany.  All examples feature arctic grey metallic paint with brown and alcantara leather interiors and black BRABUS Monoblock 7 wheels. The cars carry a number plate on the dash to signify its production number out of ten.\n\nSmart Canada also commissioned Busch Automodelle GmbH to produce 1:87 scale versions (with a black tridion), of which 10,000 were made.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Smart-ForTwo.jpg|thumb|right|G & K Auto Conversion Model in the US]]\n\nIn June 2002, a Smart Fortwo was exhibited in the U.S. at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) affiliate [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]] in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]].\n\nIn January 2005, DaimlerChrysler showed the Smart brand at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.

Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, which means it cannot carry oxygen to tissues. It is bluish chocolate-brown in color. In human blood a trace amount of methemoglobin is normally produced spontaneously, but when present in excess the blood becomes abnormally dark bluish brown. The [[NADH]]-dependent enzyme [[methemoglobin reductase]] ([[diaphorase|a type of diaphorase]]) is responsible for converting methemoglobin back to [[hemoglobin]].\n\nNormally one to two percent of a person's hemoglobin is methemoglobin; a higher percentage than this can be genetic or caused by exposure to various chemicals and depending on the level can cause health problems known as [[methemoglobinemia]]. A higher level of methemoglobin will tend to cause a [[pulse oximeter]] to read closer to 85% regardless of the true level of oxygen saturation. An abnormal increase of methemoglobin will increase the oxygen binding affinity of normal hemoglobin, resulting in a decreased unloading of oxygen to the tissues. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC1466.HTM |accessdate=2008-03-31 |last=Denshaw-Burke |first=Mary |date=2006-11-07 |title=Methemoglobinema |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411042751/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1466.htm |archive-date=2008-04-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Common causes of elevated methemoglobin ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Methemoglobin Crystal Structure.png|thumb|Structure of methemoglobin obtained by X-ray crystallography.

Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, which means it cannot carry oxygen to tissues. It is bluish chocolate-brown in color. In human blood a trace amount of methemoglobin is normally produced spontaneously, but when present in excess the blood becomes abnormally dark bluish brown. The [[NADH]]-dependent enzyme [[methemoglobin reductase]] ([[diaphorase|a type of diaphorase]]) is responsible for converting methemoglobin back to [[hemoglobin]].\n\nNormally one to two percent of a person's hemoglobin is methemoglobin; a higher percentage than this can be genetic or caused by exposure to various chemicals and depending on the level can cause health problems known as [[methemoglobinemia]]. A higher level of methemoglobin will tend to cause a [[pulse oximeter]] to read closer to 85% regardless of the true level of oxygen saturation. An abnormal increase of methemoglobin will increase the oxygen binding affinity of normal hemoglobin, resulting in a decreased unloading of oxygen to the tissues. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC1466.HTM |accessdate=2008-03-31 |last=Denshaw-Burke |first=Mary |date=2006-11-07 |title=Methemoglobinema |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411042751/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1466.htm |archive-date=2008-04-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Common causes of elevated methemoglobin ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Methemoglobin Crystal Structure.png|thumb|Structure of methemoglobin obtained by X-ray crystallography.

After his retirement he left the [[Dewanoumi stable|Dewanoumi]] group of [[heya (sumo)|stables]] and founded [[Kokonoe stable]] in 1967. He died in 1977 while still an active stablemaster. \n\n==Career==\nThe fifth son of a squid fisherman, he joined [[Dewanoumi stable]] in January 1942. He injured his knee in his first tournament, an injury that was to trouble him for the rest of his career.<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> He reached the second highest ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'' division in November 1944 and made his debut in the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in November 1945. He had been an admirer of ''yokozuna'' [[Futabayama]] but his dream of facing him in competition ended after Futabayama announced his retirement during Chiyonoyama's ''makuuchi'' debut. In this first tournament he won all ten of his bouts but was denied the championship as in the absence of any playoff system in the event of a tie, it was simply awarded to the wrestler higher in rank (in this case, ''yokozuna'' [[Haguroyama Masaji|Haguroyama]]).<ref name=\"Sharnoff\">{{Cite book |author=Sharnoff, Lora |title=Grand Sumo|publisher=Weatherhill |year=1993 |isbn=0-8348-0283-X}}</ref> In May 1949 he defeated three ''yokozuna'', finishing with a 12\u20133 record, and was promoted to ''[[\u014dzeki]]''. He won two consecutive championships in October 1949 and January 1950 but was denied promotion to ''yokozuna'' as the [[Sumo Association]] felt he was rather young at twenty three and with his second championship being \"only\" a 12\u20133 they wanted to wait until they were sure he was ready.<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> His October 1949 victory also coincided with the controversy over struggling ''yokozuna'' [[Maedayama]] being told to retire after being seen at a baseball game while he was supposed to be recuperating from illness. Chiyonoyama was eventually promoted in May 1951 after winning his third championship with a 14\u20131 record. He is the first ''yokozuna'' to be promoted without being awarded a licence by the house of Yoshida Tsukasa. During his ''yokozuna'' career he missed many bouts through injury and in 1953 even asked to be demoted back to ''\u014dzeki'' so he could start over again. The [[Sumo Association]] refused this unprecedented request.<ref name=\"Sharnoff\"/> Chiyonoyama finally took his first championship as a ''yokozuna'' in January 1955 with a playoff win over [[Tokitsuyama]] and won two more thereafter, in March 1955 and January 1957. Increasingly troubled by his knee injury to the point where he could sometimes barely walk due to the pain, he announced his retirement in January 1959.\n[[File:Chiyonoyama 1951 Scan10018-2.jpg|thumb|left|Chiyonoyama performs the ''yokozuna'' ''[[dohyo-iri]]'' at the [[Meiji Shrine]] in June 1951, shortly after his promotion.]]\n\n\n==Retirement from sumo==\n\nChiyonoyama had expected to take over as head coach of Dewanoumi stable after the death of Dewanoumi Oyakata in 1960, but he was considered too young for the responsibility at 34,<ref name=\"Sharnoff\"/> and he lost a succession battle to former ''[[maegashira]]'' [[Dewanohana Kuniichi|Dewanohana]]. After ''yokozuna'' [[Sadanoyama Shinmatsu|Sadanoyama]] married Dewanohana's daughter, Chiyonoyama realised he had no chance to take over and so asked to leave and set up his own stable. This was allowed on the condition that he also leave the Dewanoumi ''[[ichimon]]'' (group of stables).<ref name=\"Sharnoff\"/> Previously the Dewanoumi camp had, since the days of [[Hitachiyama Taniemon|Hitachiyama]], always prevented ex-wrestlers from branching out. In March 1967 he set up [[Kokonoe stable]], taking ''\u014dzeki'' (later ''yokozuna'') [[Kitanofuji]] and nine other recruits with him. In 1970 future ''yokozuna'' [[Chiyonofuji]], also from [[Fukushima, Hokkaid\u014d]], joined the stable. Chiyonoyama was unable to see Chiyonofuji reach the ''yokozuna'' rank as he died of liver cancer aged fifty one in 1977, but his widow attended Chiyonofuji's promotion ceremony in 1981.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn September 1952 he married the daughter of an [[Osaka]] restaurant owner.<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> \n\n==Fighting style==\nEarly in his career Chiyonoyama was known for the power of his ''tsuppari'' (thrusting) attack but during his successful run to ''yokozuna'' in 1951 he made an effort to improve his ''yotsu-sumo'' (grappling) techniques under the supervision of ex-''yokozuna'' [[Tochigiyama]] of [[Kasugano stable]] and his own head coach, former ''yokozuna'' [[Tsunenohana Kan'ichi|Tsunenohana]].<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> He liked a ''migi-yotsu'' (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip on his opponent's ''[[mawashi]]'' and his favourite ''[[kimarite]]'' was ''uwatenage'' (overarm throw).<ref name=\"kuroda\"/>\n\n==Career record==\n\n''Through most of the 1940s, only two tournaments were held a year, and only one was held in 1946.

(\u5343\u4ee3\u306e\u5c71 \u96c5\u4fe1, June 2, 1926 \u2013 October 29, 1977) was a [[sumo]] wrestler from [[Fukushima, Hokkaid\u014d|Fukushima]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Japan]]. He was the sport's 41st ''[[makuuchi#Yokozuna|yokozuna]]'' from 1951 until 1959. He is regarded as the first \"modern\" ''yokozuna'' in that he was promoted by the [[Japan Sumo Association]] itself and not the House of Yoshida Tsukasa.<ref name=\"kuroda\">{{cite web | author= Kuroda, Joe| title=Rikishi of Old| publisher=sumofanmag.com | url=http://www.sumofanmag.com/content/Issue_4/Rikishi_of_Old.htm| date=December 2005| accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref> He was the first ''yokozuna'' from Hokkaid\u014d, which was also the birthplace of the subsequent ''yokozuna'' [[Yoshibayama]], [[Taih\u014d Koki|Taih\u014d]], [[Kitanoumi]] and his own recruits [[Kitanofuji]] and [[Chiyonofuji]]. After his retirement he left the [[Dewanoumi stable|Dewanoumi]] group of [[heya (sumo)|stables]] and founded [[Kokonoe stable]] in 1967. He died in 1977 while still an active stablemaster. \n\n==Career==\nThe fifth son of a squid fisherman, he joined [[Dewanoumi stable]] in January 1942. He injured his knee in his first tournament, an injury that was to trouble him for the rest of his career.<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> He reached the second highest ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'' division in November 1944 and made his debut in the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in November 1945. He had been an admirer of ''yokozuna'' [[Futabayama]] but his dream of facing him in competition ended after Futabayama announced his retirement during Chiyonoyama's ''makuuchi'' debut. In this first tournament he won all ten of his bouts but was denied the championship as in the absence of any playoff system in the event of a tie, it was simply awarded to the wrestler higher in rank (in this case, ''yokozuna'' [[Haguroyama Masaji|Haguroyama]]).<ref name=\"Sharnoff\">{{Cite book |author=Sharnoff, Lora |title=Grand Sumo|publisher=Weatherhill |year=1993 |isbn=0-8348-0283-X}}</ref> In May 1949 he defeated three ''yokozuna'', finishing with a 12\u20133 record, and was promoted to ''[[\u014dzeki]]''. He won two consecutive championships in October 1949 and January 1950 but was denied promotion to ''yokozuna'' as the [[Sumo Association]] felt he was rather young at twenty three and with his second championship being \"only\" a 12\u20133 they wanted to wait until they were sure he was ready.<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> His October 1949 victory also coincided with the controversy over struggling ''yokozuna'' [[Maedayama]] being told to retire after being seen at a baseball game while he was supposed to be recuperating from illness. Chiyonoyama was eventually promoted in May 1951 after winning his third championship with a 14\u20131 record. He is the first ''yokozuna'' to be promoted without being awarded a licence by the house of Yoshida Tsukasa. During his ''yokozuna'' career he missed many bouts through injury and in 1953 even asked to be demoted back to ''\u014dzeki'' so he could start over again. The [[Sumo Association]] refused this unprecedented request.<ref name=\"Sharnoff\"/> Chiyonoyama finally took his first championship as a ''yokozuna'' in January 1955 with a playoff win over [[Tokitsuyama]] and won two more thereafter, in March 1955 and January 1957. Increasingly troubled by his knee injury to the point where he could sometimes barely walk due to the pain, he announced his retirement in January 1959.\n[[File:Chiyonoyama 1951 Scan10018-2.jpg|thumb|left|Chiyonoyama performs the ''yokozuna'' ''[[dohyo-iri]]'' at the [[Meiji Shrine]] in June 1951, shortly after his promotion.]]\n\n\n==Retirement from sumo==\n\nChiyonoyama had expected to take over as head coach of Dewanoumi stable after the death of Dewanoumi Oyakata in 1960, but he was considered too young for the responsibility at 34,<ref name=\"Sharnoff\"/> and he lost a succession battle to former ''[[maegashira]]'' [[Dewanohana Kuniichi|Dewanohana]]. After ''yokozuna'' [[Sadanoyama Shinmatsu|Sadanoyama]] married Dewanohana's daughter, Chiyonoyama realised he had no chance to take over and so asked to leave and set up his own stable. This was allowed on the condition that he also leave the Dewanoumi ''[[ichimon]]'' (group of stables).<ref name=\"Sharnoff\"/> Previously the Dewanoumi camp had, since the days of [[Hitachiyama Taniemon|Hitachiyama]], always prevented ex-wrestlers from branching out. In March 1967 he set up [[Kokonoe stable]], taking ''\u014dzeki'' (later ''yokozuna'') [[Kitanofuji]] and nine other recruits with him. In 1970 future ''yokozuna'' [[Chiyonofuji]], also from [[Fukushima, Hokkaid\u014d]], joined the stable. Chiyonoyama was unable to see Chiyonofuji reach the ''yokozuna'' rank as he died of liver cancer aged fifty one in 1977, but his widow attended Chiyonofuji's promotion ceremony in 1981.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn September 1952 he married the daughter of an [[Osaka]] restaurant owner.<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> \n\n==Fighting style==\nEarly in his career Chiyonoyama was known for the power of his ''tsuppari'' (thrusting) attack but during his successful run to ''yokozuna'' in 1951 he made an effort to improve his ''yotsu-sumo'' (grappling) techniques under the supervision of ex-''yokozuna'' [[Tochigiyama]] of [[Kasugano stable]] and his own head coach, former ''yokozuna'' [[Tsunenohana Kan'ichi|Tsunenohana]].<ref name=\"kuroda\"/> He liked a ''migi-yotsu'' (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip on his opponent's ''[[mawashi]]'' and his favourite ''[[kimarite]]'' was ''uwatenage'' (overarm throw).<ref name=\"kuroda\"/>\n\n==Career record==\n\n''Through most of the 1940s, only two tournaments were held a year, and only one was held in 1946. The New Year tournament began and the Spring tournament returned to Osaka in 1953.''\n{{Sumo record box start 1933-1952|Chiyonoyama<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Chiyonoyama Masanobu Rikishi Information| publisher=Sumo Reference| url=http://sumodb.sumogames.de/Rikishi.aspx?shikona=chiyonoyama&heya=-1&shusshin=-1&b=-1&high=-1&hd=-1&entry=-1&intai=-1&sort=1| date= | accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Sumo record year start|1942}}\n    {{Basho|maezumou}}\n    {{Basho|sj|||4|0}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1943}}\n    {{Basho|jo|37|e|8|0}}\n    {{Basho|sa|17|w|5|3}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1944}}\n    {{Basho|ma|46|w|6|2}}\n    {{Basho|ma|12|w|4|1}}\n    {{Basho|j|13|w|8|2<br>Champion}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1945}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n    {{basho|j|2|e|6|1<br>Champion}}\n    {{Basho|m|10|e|10|0||j}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1946}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n    {{Basho|m|1|e|10|3}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1947}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=s|r-no=1|tozai=w}}\n    {{Basho|m|1|w|8|3|||*}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1948}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|w|4|6|1draw}}\n    {{Basho|m|1|w|8|3|||f|*|*}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1949}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|w|8|5}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|e|12|3|||o}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|13|2||y}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1950}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|12|3||y}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|11|4}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1951}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|14|1||y}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|9|6}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1952}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|13|2||j}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|w|10|5}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|w|11|4}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n</table>\n{{Sumo record box start 1953-1956}} \n {{Sumo record year start|1953}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|e|4|4|7}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|e|1|5|9}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=y|r-no=2|tozai=e}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|11|4}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1954}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|w|10|5}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|e|10|5}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|w|12|3||j}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|e|12|3||j}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1955}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|e|12|3|P|y}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|e|13|2|P|y}} \n    {{Basho|y|1|e|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|e|10|4|1draw}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1956}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|w|4|1|10}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|11|4}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=y|r-no=1|tozai=e}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n{{Sumo record box end}}\n\n==Modern top division record==\n*''Since the addition of the Kyushu tournament in 1957 and the Nagoya tournament in 1958, the yearly schedule has remained unchanged.''\n{{Sumo record box start}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1957}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|15|0||y}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|e|10|5}} \n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=y|r-no=2|tozai=e}}\n    {{Basho|note|'''Not held'''}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|5|8|2}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=y|r-no=2|tozai=w}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1958}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|w|12|3||j}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|e|12|3}}\n    {{Basho|y|1|e|12|3||j}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=y|r-no=1|tozai=w}}\n    {{Basho|y|2|e|1|4|10}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=y|r-no=2|tozai=e}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1959}}\n    {{Basho|INTAI|rank=y|tozai=e|r-no=2|win=3|loss=3|absent=9}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n{{Sumo record box end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glossary of sumo terms]]\n*[[List of past sumo wrestlers]]\n*[[List of sumo tournament top division champions]]\n*[[List of sumo tournament top division runners-up]]\n*[[List of yokozuna]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120320125142/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/kiroku_daicho/mei_yokozuna/chiyonoyama.html Japan Sumo Association profile]\n\n{{Yokozuna box | previous = [[Azumafuji Kin'ichi]] | number = 41st | active = 1951\u20131959 | next = [[Kagamisato Kiyoji]]}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chiyonoyama Masanobu}}\n[[Category:1926 births]]\n[[Category:1977 deaths]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Japan]]\n[[Category:Deaths from liver cancer]]\n[[Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Sumo people from Hokkaido]]\n[[Category:Yokozuna]]\n", "name_user": "Beland", "label": "safe", "comment": "drop spurious </table>", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiyonoyama_Masanobu"}

''After Hours'' will be promoted with [[the After Hours Tour]], which is set to span [[North America]] and [[Europe]].  \n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', and ''[[Uncut Gems]]''.

''After Hours'' will be promoted with [[the After Hours Tour]], which is set to span [[North America]] and [[Europe]].  \n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', and ''[[Uncut Gems]]''. The album was supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\", with \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\" peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Its [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single. \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\" both received [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certifications in the US. In March 2020, ''After Hours'' broke the record for the most global pre-adds in [[Apple Music]] history, with over 1.02 million users.\n\n''After Hours'' received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best piece of work. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales.

His first series of concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum, a total of four ''Eason's 99Big Live'' concerts and came four years after his debut in 1995. Even today, that amount of time is considered short for a singer to gain the general approval and public support needed to perform at such a prestigious venue. Two years later in 2001, Chan held a series of nine ''The Easy Ride'' concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum under the wing of his second record company, Music Plus. In 2003, he again held a series of seven ''The Third Encounter'' concerts with the support of Music Plus. In the spring of 2006, after a year of rest and another change of record company, Chan held his fourth theme concerts, a total of nine ''Get a Life'' concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum. A year later, Chan broke his own record while holding his fifth series of concerts named ''Eason's Moving on Stage''. During October and November 2007, he completed a total of 16 hugely successful Chan's Moving on Stage1 concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/3086/2007/10/25/1261@287672.htm|title=Eason Chan Moves on Stage|accessdate=2008-03-03|publisher=english.cri.cn}}</ref> As of January 2008, Chan has held 45 concerts at Hong Kong Coliseum.\n\nChan began his Moving on Stage World Tour in February 2008.

Despite Honda parthersip, Penske had a ''de facto'' direct Honda factory support, with engines coming straight from the Japanese company's racing division in Japan and United States including tune-up support from [[Ilmor Engineering]] in Plymouth, Michigan, United States. The partnership started well in 2006 including winning the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]] and [[2006 IndyCar Series]] titles in the hands of [[Sam Hornish Jr.]].\n\nPenske retained their Castroneves - Hornish Jr. pair for the [[2007 IndyCar Series|2007]] season. The second year of the renewed Honda partnership was much more promising than the first with the team being able to challenge for retaining [[Indianapolis 500]] and [[IndyCar Series]] driver and team titles. However the team was slumped just scored only two victories due to driver errors and incidents and the team failed to won major IndyCar silverwares for the first time since 2005 season.

Team Penske became a three-car team for the first time since 1994, with the addition of a full-time team for Power. Team Penske started 2010 season in style by winning the first three races whilst Will Power challenged for the driver's title until suspension failure in season finale at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] robbed him of first driver's title. Penske ended up 2010 season with nine wins, thirteen pole positions and six fastest laps (mostly by [[Will Power]]).\n\nOn 12 November 2010, Penske confirmed that they would end their partnership with Honda at the end of the [[2011 IndyCar Series|2011 season]] and use engines supplied by [[Chevrolet]] for 2012 season. For 2011 season, the team entered their sixth and final year of Penske-Honda partnership. Penske trio pair Castroneves-Briscoe-Power remained for the second year in the row while the team lost [[ExxonMobil]] sponsorship to [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] NASCAR team in favor of [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] and [[Pennzoil]] as their official motor oil partner.

The car displayed was driven by [[Al Unser, Jr.]].]]\nPenske's 1994 IndyCar World Series Championship was one of, if not the most dominating performance from a race team in history of American open wheel racing. Roger Penske had found the key to win but also found a way to run from the competition. The new Penske PC-23 chassis with the [[Ilmor]]- Indy V8 engine would power the Penske drivers of [[Al Unser, Jr.]], [[Paul Tracy]], and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]. The team racked up 12 wins out of 16 races, collecting 10 poles and 28 podium finishes on their way to the championship. The team also dominated a controversial May at Indianapolis. Penske debuted a radical new Mercedes-Benz engine at Indy, the 500I. This engine used a provision in the rules intended for stock block [[Cam-in-block|pushrod]] engines such as the [[V6 engine|V-6]] [[Buick]] engines that allowed an extra 650&nbsp;cm\u00b3 and 10 [[Inch of mercury|inches]] (4.9 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]]/33.8 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of boost. This extra power (at least 900 [[horsepower]], and rumored to be in excess of 1000) allowed the Penskes to run significantly faster, giving them the pole and outside front row on the grid for the [[1994 Indianapolis 500|78th Indianapolis 500]]. [[Al Unser, Jr.]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] dominated the race, eventually lapping the field with 16 laps to go in the 200 lap race when Fittipaldi made contact with the wall coming out of Turn 4, giving [[Al Unser, Jr.]] the lead and win. The only driver who finished on the lead lap was rookie [[Jacques Villeneuve]]. This one season gave Penske the Driver's Championship with [[Al Unser, Jr.]], Constructor's Cup with the Penske PC-23, and Manufacturer's Cup with the Ilmor-Indy V8 engine. (In the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995 Indy 500]] Penske failed to qualify any cars for the race)\n\n===Drivers who have raced for Team Penske in [[American open-wheel car racing|American Open-wheel Racing]]===\n[[File:PenskeIRL2007.JPG|thumb|right|Penske's No. 3 [[Dallara]]-[[Honda]] at the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n[[File:Penske Racing 2009 Indy 500 Carb Day.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ryan Briscoe]], [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], and [[Roger Penske]] at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] for Miller Lite Carb Day in 2009.]]\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mark Donohue]] (1968\u20131975)\n*{{flagicon|GBR}} [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]] (1971)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gary Bettenhausen]] (1972\u20131974)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gordon Johncock]] (1972)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mike Hiss]] (1972, 1974)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bobby Allison]] (1973, 1975)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tom Sneva]] (1975\u20131978)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mario Andretti]] (1976\u20131980)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Rick Mears]] (1978\u20131992)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bobby Unser]] (1979\u20131981)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bill Alsup]] (1981)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Kevin Cogan]] (1982)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Al Unser]] (1983\u20131989)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Johnny Rutherford]] (1984) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Mike Thackwell]] (1984) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Danny Sullivan]] (1985\u20131990)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Geoff Brabham]] (1989) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] (1990\u20131996)\n*{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Paul Tracy]] (1991\u20131994, 1996\u20131997)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Al Unser, Jr.]] (1994\u20131999)\n*{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Jan Magnussen]] (1996) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro (racing driver)|Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro]] (1998)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Alex Barron (racing driver)|Alex Barron]] (1999, 2003; 2003 as injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|URU}} [[Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Gonzalo Rodriguez]] (1999) (killed at Laguna Seca Raceway)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Tarso Marques]] (1999) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Gil de Ferran]] (2000\u20132003)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} '''[[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] (2000\u2013present)'''\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Max Papis]] (2002) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Hornish, Jr.]] (2004\u20132007)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Ryan Briscoe]] (2008\u20132012)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} '''[[Will Power]] (2009\u2013present)''' (legal replacement, 1 race;  two other races in No. 12 in 2009, full-time in 2010 beyond)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[A.

The team subsequently changed their livery to black and white with red trim (similar to [[McLaren]] when they had a black-silver livery from 1997\u20132005 reflecting [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz engines]] and [[West (cigarette)|West]] sponsorship), reflecting Verizon sponsorship.\n==NASCAR==\n{{main|Team Penske (NASCAR)}}\n\n==Sports car racing==\n{{Motor racing team\n| name           = {{flagicon|USA}} Team Penske\n| logo           = \n| founded        = 1965\n| principal      = [[Roger Penske]] (founder)<br>[[Tim Cindric]] (President)\n| current series = [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]\n| former series  = [[Rolex Sports Car Series]], [[United States Road Racing Championship]], [[Can-Am]], [[Trans-Am series]], [[American Le Mans Series]]\n|current drivers = {{flagicon|COL}} [[Juan Pablo Montoya]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Dane Cameron]]<br>{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Helio Castroneves]]<br> {{flagicon|USA}} [[Ricky Taylor]]<br>{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Simon Pagenaud]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Alexander Rossi]]\n| driver titles  = 7 ('06, '07, '08 [[ALMS]], '72, '73 [[Can-Am]], '67, '68 [[USRRC]])\n}}\n\n===Trans-Am Series===\nPenske first fielded a blue [[Sunoco]] [https://archive.is/20041019185034/http://home.comcast.net/~jbalthasar/camaro.htm  1967 Chevrolet Camaro] driven by [[Mark Donohue]] in this series designed for [[Pony car]]s like the [[Ford Mustang]].

American Motors won the Over 2.5 liter title in 1971, after which Penske withdrew from the championship. Penske Racing also had an alliance with pioneer Trans-Am team, [[Jocko Maggiacomo|Jocko's Racing]] which won the [[1976 Trans-Am Series]] championship in a Penske-leased car.\n\n===Can-Am Series===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nPenske Racing entered a [[Lola T70]] in the 1966 [[Can-Am]] Series for [[Mark Donohue]], resulting in one win at [[Mosport]]. In 1967, Penske Racing entered two Lolas, one for Mark Donohue and one for [[George Follmer]]. 1968 saw Penske switch to a McLaren M6, which had won the series in 1967. Donohue won one race that year in Can-Am at [[Bridgehampton]]. With the McLaren domination of the Can-Am, Penske switched back to Lola Cars for his 1969 Can-Am efforts, but only entered the car in one race at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]].\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Penske was Porsche's official partner in the [[Can-Am Challenge Cup|CanAm]] Series. In late 1971, Penske and [[Mark Donohue]] helped to develop the turbocharged version of the [[Porsche 917#1972, 1973 and after|Porsche 917]]. [[George Follmer]] won the series in 1972, and Donohue dominated CanAm in 1973 with the ultimate evolution of the 917, the 917/30. The rules were changed for 1974, and Penske raced only once this year.\n[[File:Porsche917-30.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Porsche 917/30, in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen Museum]]\n\n===Endurance racing===\nA [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]] T70 Mk IIIb entered by Penske was the surprise winner of the 1969 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].\n\nDuring the 1970 season the competition between the 5-liter sportscars of Porsche and Ferrari turned to the advantage of the [[Porsche 917]]. In 1971, Ferrari decided to give up any official effort with the 5-liter [[Ferrari 512]]. In order to prepare the 1972 season, the new works prototype [[Ferrari 312PB]] was presented and engaged by the factory in several races.\n\nRoger Penske bought a used 512 M chassis that was totally dismantled and rebuilt. The car was specially tuned for long races receiving many unique features, among them were a large rear wing and an aviation inspired quick refueling system. The engine was tuned by [[Can-Am Challenge Cup|CanAm]] V8 specialist Traco, and was probably able to deliver more than 600&nbsp;hp (450&nbsp;kW). As of today it's unknown to what extent Penske's initiative was backed by Ferrari works. This 512M was painted in a blue and yellow livery and was sponsored by [[Sunoco]] and the Californian Ferrari dealer Kirk F. White. The car made the pole position for the 1971 [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and finished second despite an accident. For the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] the \"Sunoco\" made the pole again but finished the race at the sixth position after making contact with Pedro Rodrigez's 917. Despite this misfortune the car had proved to be a serious opponent for the 917. Not only this car was the fastest on track in Daytona and Sebring but it was also the car that had the shortest refueling time.\n\nThe presence of the 512 M \"Sunoco\" forced Porsche to pursue his effort of research and development on the 917: The 917K short tail was modified, and the 917 LH aerodynamics received further improvements. New Magnesium chassis were developed. An entirely new car, the 917/20 was built as test-bed for future CanAm parts and aerodynamic \"low-drag\" concepts.\n\nIn Le Mans the \"Sunoco\" Ferrari was unable to break the 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h) barrier on the straight while the Porsche 917 LH were lightning quick at speeds of over 240&nbsp;mph (380&nbsp;km/h). Mark Donohue qualified fourth anyway, which was obviously the result of an aerodynamic configuration that favored downforce over drag, which helped in the twistier sections. The car did not have much luck in the race though.\n\n===American Le Mans Series===\n[[File:Pair of RS Spyders.jpg|thumb|250px|Both of Penske's [[Porsche RS Spyder|RS Spyders]] at the [[2007 Generac 500]] where they scored an overall victory.]]\nIn April 2005, it was announced that [[Porsche]] would build an [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) sanctioned LMP2 Class Prototype that would be entered by Penske Racing in the [[American Le Mans Series]] and thus formally competed as '''DHL Porsche Penske Racing''' in a reference of Porsche Motorsport works team. The  [[Porsche RS Spyder]] made its successful debut at the ALMS season final race at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]]. The \"[[Porsche Junioren]]\" factory drivers [[Sascha Maassen]] and [[Lucas Luhr]] finished 1st in LMP2 Class and 5th Overall in the 4\u2013Hour Endurance Race. The livery of Penske Racing American Le Mans Series team was inspired by [[Jordan EJ12]]'s [[DHL]] [[Formula 1]] livery driven by [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] and [[Takuma Sato]].\n\nIn 2006, Penske Motorsports fielded two LMP2 Porsche RS Spyder in the American Le Mans Series, but did not run the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in June. The Penske cars combined to win seven class victories and the overall win at [[2006 American Le Mans at Mid-Ohio|Mid-Ohio]]. Penske Racing won the LMP2 team championship. Drivers Sascha Maassen and Lucas Luhr tied for first place in the driver's championship, while Timo Bernhard finished fifth, Romain Dumas finished sixth, and Emmanuel Collard finished tenth.\n\n2006 team lineup:\n* LMP2 [[Porsche RS Spyder]] No. 6: [[Sascha Maassen]], [[Lucas Luhr]] (with [[Emmanuel Collard]] for endurance events)\n* LMP2 [[Porsche RS Spyder]] No. 7: [[Timo Bernhard]], [[Romain Dumas]] (with [[Patrick Long]] for endurance events)\n\nIn 2007, Penske Motorsports fielded two LMP2 Porsche RS Spyder Evo in the American Le Mans Series. Penske Motorsports for the 2nd year in a row did not compete in [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in June. Penske's two cars combined for eleven class victories and eight overall victories during the twelve race season. Penske won the LMP2 team championship, and team drivers Romain Dumas and Timo Bernhard finished tied for first in the LMP2 driver's championship, while Sascha Maassen and [[Ryan Briscoe]] tied for third place.\n\n2007 team lineup:\n* LMP2 [[Porsche RS Spyder]] No. 6: [[Sascha Maassen]], [[Ryan Briscoe]] (with [[Emmanuel Collard]] for endurance events)\n* LMP2 [[Porsche RS Spyder]] No. 7: [[Timo Bernhard]], [[Romain Dumas]] (with [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] (Sebring only) and [[Patrick Long]] (Road Atlanta only) for endurance events)\n\nPenske started out their 2008 season with an overall win in the [[2008 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]]. This was [[Porsche]]'s first overall win in the race since 1988 in a [[Porsche 962]].\n\n2008 team lineup:\n* LMP2 [[Porsche RS Spyder]] No. 5: [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], [[Ryan Briscoe]] (Road Atlanta and Laguna Seca only)\n* LMP2 [[Porsche RS Spyder]] No. 6: [[Sascha Maassen]], [[Patrick Long]]\n* LMP2 [[Porsche RS Spyder]] No. 7: [[Timo Bernhard]], [[Romain Dumas]] (with [[Emmanuel Collard]] for endurance events)\n\nIn 2009, the No. 6 and No. 7 ALMS teams were used for Penske's No. 12 Indycar, driven by [[Will Power]] in five races. The team announced in late 2009 that the ALMS teams would be dissolved and turned into the new No. 12 [[Verizon]] sponsored Indycar for Will Power to run full-time in 2010.\n\n===IMSA===\n[[File:Acura ARX-05 n\u00b06 - 2018 12 Hours of Sebring.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Penske ran the Acura ARX-05 in the DPi class, to some successful results.]]\nIn 2017, it was announced that Penske Racing would make a comeback to sportscar racing in IMSA's [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the 2018 season. They will run 2 [[Acura ARX-05]] [[Daytona Prototype|DPi]]s in the prototype (P) class.

Although the cars were built at the British base in [[Poole]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corktree.tripod.com/Case_History.html |title=Case History |publisher=Corktree.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-05}}</ref> the team held an American [[List of Formula One constructors#Team's nationality|licence]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Watkins_Glen-1974-10-06e.jpg|title=1974 United States Grand Prix Entry list}}</ref> In 1971, Penske had sponsored the second McLaren entry in the 1971 Canadian and US GP, entering [[Mark Donohue]], who took the car to a podium finish. The team returned three years later, in the 1974 Canadian GP, with their own chassis, the PC1, a standard tub built around a [[Cosworth]] DFV engine and a [[Hewland]] gearbox. Donohue took the car to 12th place on its debut. In 1975, Roger Penske mounted a full season attack with the PC1, Donohue managing to score a fifth place in the Swedish GP. However, the car was retired after the French GP and Penske entered a [[March Engineering|March 751]] for the next three races, scoring another fifth in the British GP. However, Donohue crashed the car in the final practice session of the [[1975 Austrian Grand Prix]] at [[Spielberg, Styria|Spielberg]] and later died from his injuries. Penske missed the Italian race, returning only for the US GP, abandoning the March 751 in favor of the PC1 with Northern Irish driver [[John Watson (driver)|John Watson]].\n\nFor 1976, Penske signed a sponsorship deal with [[Citibank]] and entered a brand new PC3 for Watson. In spite of a fifth place scored at the [[1976 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]] at [[Kyalami]], the PC3 was evolved into the PC4, which was much more competitive, allowing Watson to score two podiums in France and Britain. Then, in the [[1976 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], the team scored their only F1 win. So far this has been the last time an American constructor won a F1 race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.f1i.com/news/46708-penske-anxious-to-see-how-haas-f1-fares.html|title=Penske 'anxious' to see how Haas F1 fares|date=March 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>Though American-owned, [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] achieved a victory at the [[1977 Austrian Grand Prix]] having raced with a  British licence.</ref> Still, Roger Penske was tired of Europe and at the end of the year decided to concentrate solely on Indycar racing, selling the remains of his European operations to [[G\u00fcnther Schmidt]] of [[Germany]].\n\nFor 1977, the car was entered by Schmidt's [[ATS (wheels)|ATS Wheels]] business and run under the name of ATS Racing Team. The ATS-Penske PC4, now painted yellow, debuted in the [[1977 United States Grand Prix West]] with [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] at the wheel, where the Frenchman scored the team's single point of the season. A second PC4 was eventually entered for [[Hans Heyer]] (who started the [[1977 German Grand Prix]] despite failing to qualify) and [[Hans Binder]] (3 races) but the team's fortunes sank and Schmidt quit after the Italian GP, before returning in 1978 with his own chassis. A third PC4 was built by Penske for [[Ted Field|Interscope]] Racing, who entered the car in the [[1977 United States Grand Prix|United States]] and [[1977 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] Grands Prix, driven by American [[Danny Ongais]] with no results.\n\nIn 1979 Penske designed and built the HR100 for wealthy Mexican 'gentleman driver' [[H\u00e9ctor Rebaque]]. The car was entered for the final three races of the season, but either failed to qualify or to finish in each case.\n\n==Supercars Championship==\n{{main|DJR Team Penske}}\n\nIn [[2015 International V8 Supercars Championship|2015]], Team Penske entered the Australian [[V8 Supercars Championship]], having purchased a 51% stake in Dick Johnson Racing in September 2014.

In 1972, Penske driver [[Gary Bettenhausen]] led the most laps but lost an engine with 24 laps to go. His teammate [[Mark Donohue]] led the waning laps en route to Penske's first Indianapolis 500 victory. In 1979, Penske driver [[Bobby Unser]] led the most laps of the Indianapolis 500 while teammate [[Rick Mears]] won the race, from the pole.\n\nPenske's next ''500'' victory was one of the most controversial finishes in IndyCar history. Penske driver Unser won the pole position and led the most of the final 100 laps. On lap 140, Bobby Unser and former Penske driver [[Mario Andretti]] came out of the pits. Unser passed 11 cars under a yellow flag while Andretti passed 2 cars. Unser won the race, but was stripped of the victory the next morning in favor of Andretti. After a lengthy appeal, Unser was reinstated the victory and was instead fined $40,000 ($104,000 in today's money). Unser retired from racing after the season was over in the fall-out of the controversy.\n\nPenske's next Indy 500 win was with Rick Mears in 1984. Mears and former Penske driver [[Tom Sneva]] battled for the lead in the final 100 laps but after Sneva dropped out with a broken CV joint, Mears led the final 40 laps unchallenged to win by 2-laps ahead of the field. The next year, first-year Penske driver [[Danny Sullivan]] led the final 61 laps en route to his first Indianapolis 500 victory after winning a 4-lap shootout with [[Mario Andretti]]. In 1987, Penske driver [[Danny Ongais]] got taken out of the race due to injuries and former Penske driver [[Al Unser]] was tabbed as a temporary replacement. Unser won the race.\n\n1988 was one of the most dominating performances by Penske Racing in the history of the Indianapolis 500. Penske's team members, Sullivan, Unser and Mears qualified in the front row and proceeded to lead 192 of the race's 200 laps, 91 by Sullivan, 89 by Mears, and 12 by Unser. Mears won the race. In 1991, Mears won an 18-lap duel with [[Michael Andretti]] to win his 4th Indianapolis 500. Emerson Fittipaldi won the 500 in 1993 but angered American fans by drinking [[orange juice]] instead of the traditional milk.\n\nIn 1994, the Penske team, consisting of [[Al Unser Jr.]], [[Paul Tracy]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] led 193 of the race's 200 laps, thanks to a new engine invented by Penske that went up to 1000 horsepower. The engine was later banned, which resulted in Penske Racing not qualifying a single car in the 1995 Indianapolis 500.\n\nDue to the open-wheel split, Penske did not field a car at the Indianapolis 500 from 1996-2000. In 2001, Penske Racing crossed a picket-line by fielding the team in the 500, consisting of rookie [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] and [[Gil de Ferran]]. The duo proceeded to lead the most laps, en route to the victory, giving Penske Racing a 1-2 finish, the first time in the team's history. In a post-race interview, Roger Penske said that after the heartbreak in 1995, the win was the biggest of all his Indy 500 wins.\n\nIn 2002, Castroneves barely beat [[Paul Tracy]] to win his second consecutive Indy 500. Controversy overshadowed the race when video tapes appeared to have shown that Tracy was ahead of Castroneves at the moment of a final-lap caution. After a lengthy appeal, Castroneves' win was upheld on July 2. In 2003, [[Gil de Ferran]] won his first 500 and then retired when the season was over. Penske Racing has since proceeded to win the 500 in 2006, 2009, 2015, 2018, and 2019.\n\n==Penske Racing Museum==\n\n[[File:PenskeMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|Penske and Dallara Indy cars on display at the Penske Racing Museum in Scottsdale, Arizona.]]\n\nOpened in 2002, the Penske Racing Museum in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], Arizona, is located within a complex of [[Penske Automotive Group]] car dealerships at the Scottsdale 101 Auto Collection.

Penske had collaborated with Honda engines in 2000-2001 CART Champ Car season. After a prolonged period, the team announced [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] and [[Sam Hornish Jr.]] as their official race drivers. Despite Honda parthersip, Penske had a ''de facto'' direct Honda factory support, with engines coming straight from the Japanese company's racing division in Japan and United States including tune-up support from [[Ilmor Engineering]] in Plymouth, Michigan, United States. The partnership started well in 2006 including winning the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]] and [[2006 IndyCar Series]] titles in the hands of [[Sam Hornish Jr.]].\n\nPenske retained their Castroneves - Hornish Jr. pair for the [[2007 IndyCar Series|2007]] season. The second year of the renewed Honda partnership was much more promising than the first with the team being able to challenge for retaining [[Indianapolis 500]] and [[IndyCar Series]] driver and team titles. However the team was slumped just scored only two victories due to driver errors and incidents and the team failed to won major IndyCar silverwares for the first time since 2005 season.

[[Ryan Briscoe]] finally scored his first win at Milwaukee Mile while Castroneves scored first 2008 season win in [[Sonoma Raceway|Infineon Raceway]] and Castroneves nearly won the title in Chicagoland Speedway while Scott Dixon finished in 2nd place to ensure 2008 [[IndyCar Series]] driver's title.\n\nFor 2009, [[Verizon Wireless]], joined ExxonMobil as associate sponsors, and the team was billed as Verizon Championship Racing. The third car was driven by Will Power, originally a substitute for Castroneves, carried the No. 12 and featured primary sponsorship of both Verizon Wireless brand and Roger Penske's truck rental business.\n\nFor 2010 season, the team entered their fifth year of Penske-Honda partnership with [[Will Power]] promoted to full-time Penske seat alongside Castroneves and Briscoe. Team Penske became a three-car team for the first time since 1994, with the addition of a full-time team for Power. Team Penske started 2010 season in style by winning the first three races whilst Will Power challenged for the driver's title until suspension failure in season finale at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] robbed him of first driver's title. Penske ended up 2010 season with nine wins, thirteen pole positions and six fastest laps (mostly by [[Will Power]]).\n\nOn 12 November 2010, Penske confirmed that they would end their partnership with Honda at the end of the [[2011 IndyCar Series|2011 season]] and use engines supplied by [[Chevrolet]] for 2012 season. For 2011 season, the team entered their sixth and final year of Penske-Honda partnership. Penske trio pair Castroneves-Briscoe-Power remained for the second year in the row while the team lost [[ExxonMobil]] sponsorship to [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] NASCAR team in favor of [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] and [[Pennzoil]] as their official motor oil partner.

The car displayed was driven by [[Al Unser, Jr.]].]]\nPenske's 1994 IndyCar World Series Championship was one of, if not the most dominating performance from a race team in history of American open wheel racing. Roger Penske had found the key to win but also found a way to run from the competition. The new Penske PC-23 chassis with the [[Ilmor]]- Indy V8 engine would power the Penske drivers of [[Al Unser, Jr.]], [[Paul Tracy]], and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]. The team racked up 12 wins out of 16 races, collecting 10 poles and 28 podium finishes on their way to the championship. The team also dominated a controversial May at Indianapolis. Penske debuted a radical new Mercedes-Benz engine at Indy, the 500I. This engine used a provision in the rules intended for stock block [[Cam-in-block|pushrod]] engines such as the [[V6 engine|V-6]] [[Buick]] engines that allowed an extra 650&nbsp;cm\u00b3 and 10 [[Inch of mercury|inches]] (4.9 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]]/33.8 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of boost. This extra power (at least 900 [[horsepower]], and rumored to be in excess of 1000) allowed the Penskes to run significantly faster, giving them the pole and outside front row on the grid for the [[1994 Indianapolis 500|78th Indianapolis 500]]. [[Al Unser, Jr.]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] dominated the race, eventually lapping the field with 16 laps to go in the 200 lap race when Fittipaldi made contact with the wall coming out of Turn 4, giving [[Al Unser, Jr.]] the lead and win. The only driver who finished on the lead lap was rookie [[Jacques Villeneuve]]. This one season gave Penske the Driver's Championship with [[Al Unser, Jr.]], Constructor's Cup with the Penske PC-23, and Manufacturer's Cup with the Ilmor-Indy V8 engine. (In the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995 Indy 500]] Penske failed to qualify any cars for the race)\n\n===Drivers who have raced for Team Penske in [[American open-wheel car racing|American Open-wheel Racing]]===\n[[File:PenskeIRL2007.JPG|thumb|right|Penske's No. 3 [[Dallara]]-[[Honda]] at the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n[[File:Penske Racing 2009 Indy 500 Carb Day.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ryan Briscoe]], [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], and [[Roger Penske]] at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] for Miller Lite Carb Day in 2009.]]\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mark Donohue]] (1968\u20131975)\n*{{flagicon|GBR}} [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]] (1971)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gary Bettenhausen]] (1972\u20131974)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gordon Johncock]] (1972)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mike Hiss]] (1972, 1974)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bobby Allison]] (1973, 1975)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tom Sneva]] (1975\u20131978)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mario Andretti]] (1976\u20131980)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Rick Mears]] (1978\u20131992)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bobby Unser]] (1979\u20131981)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bill Alsup]] (1981)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Kevin Cogan]] (1982)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Al Unser]] (1983\u20131989)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Johnny Rutherford]] (1984) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Mike Thackwell]] (1984) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Danny Sullivan]] (1985\u20131990)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Geoff Brabham]] (1989) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] (1990\u20131996)\n*{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Paul Tracy]] (1991\u20131994, 1996\u20131997)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Al Unser, Jr.]] (1994\u20131999)\n*{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Jan Magnussen]] (1996) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro (racing driver)|Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro]] (1998)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Alex Barron (racing driver)|Alex Barron]] (1999, 2003; 2003 as injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|URU}} [[Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Gonzalo Rodriguez]] (1999) (killed at Laguna Seca Raceway)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Tarso Marques]] (1999) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Gil de Ferran]] (2000\u20132003)\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} '''[[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] (2000\u2013present)'''\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Max Papis]] (2002) (injury replacement)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Hornish, Jr.]] (2004\u20132007)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Ryan Briscoe]] (2008\u20132012)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} '''[[Will Power]] (2009\u2013present)''' (legal replacement, 1 race;  two other races in No. 12 in 2009, full-time in 2010 beyond)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[A.

American Motors won the Over 2.5 liter title in 1971, after which Penske withdrew from the championship. Penske Racing also had an alliance with pioneer Trans-Am team, [[Jocko Maggiacomo|Jocko's Racing]] which won the [[1976 Trans-Am Series]] championship in a Penske-leased car.\n\n===Can-Am Series===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nPenske Racing entered a [[Lola T70]] in the 1966 [[Can-Am]] Series for [[Mark Donohue]], resulting in one win at [[Mosport]]. In 1967, Penske Racing entered two Lolas, one for Mark Donohue and one for [[George Follmer]]. 1968 saw Penske switch to a McLaren M6, which had won the series in 1967. Donohue won one race that year in Can-Am at [[Bridgehampton]]. With the McLaren domination of the Can-Am, Penske switched back to Lola Cars for his 1969 Can-Am efforts, but only entered the car in one race at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]].\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Penske was Porsche's official partner in the [[Can-Am Challenge Cup|CanAm]] Series. In late 1971, Penske and [[Mark Donohue]] helped to develop the turbocharged version of the [[Porsche 917#1972, 1973 and after|Porsche 917]]. [[George Follmer]] won the series in 1972, and Donohue dominated CanAm in 1973 with the ultimate evolution of the 917, the 917/30. The rules were changed for 1974, and Penske raced only once this year.\n[[File:Porsche917-30.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Porsche 917/30, in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen Museum]]\n\n===Endurance racing===\nA [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]] T70 Mk IIIb entered by Penske was the surprise winner of the 1969 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].\n\nDuring the 1970 season the competition between the 5-liter sportscars of Porsche and Ferrari turned to the advantage of the [[Porsche 917]]. In 1971, Ferrari decided to give up any official effort with the 5-liter [[Ferrari 512]]. In order to prepare the 1972 season, the new works prototype [[Ferrari 312PB]] was presented and engaged by the factory in several races.\n\nRoger Penske bought a used 512 M chassis that was totally dismantled and rebuilt. The car was specially tuned for long races receiving many unique features, among them were a large rear wing and an aviation inspired quick refueling system. The engine was tuned by [[Can-Am Challenge Cup|CanAm]] V8 specialist Traco, and was probably able to deliver more than 600&nbsp;hp (450&nbsp;kW). As of today it's unknown to what extent Penske's initiative was backed by Ferrari works. This 512M was painted in a blue and yellow livery and was sponsored by [[Sunoco]] and the Californian Ferrari dealer Kirk F. White. The car made the pole position for the 1971 [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and finished second despite an accident. For the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] the \"Sunoco\" made the pole again but finished the race at the sixth position after making contact with Pedro Rodrigez's 917. Despite this misfortune the car had proved to be a serious opponent for the 917. Not only this car was the fastest on track in Daytona and Sebring but it was also the car that had the shortest refueling time.\n\nThe presence of the 512 M \"Sunoco\" forced Porsche to pursue his effort of research and development on the 917: The 917K short tail was modified, and the 917 LH aerodynamics received further improvements. New Magnesium chassis were developed. An entirely new car, the 917/20 was built as test-bed for future CanAm parts and aerodynamic \"low-drag\" concepts.\n\nIn Le Mans the \"Sunoco\" Ferrari was unable to break the 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h) barrier on the straight while the Porsche 917 LH were lightning quick at speeds of over 240&nbsp;mph (380&nbsp;km/h). Mark Donohue qualified fourth anyway, which was obviously the result of an aerodynamic configuration that favored downforce over drag, which helped in the twistier sections. The car did not have much luck in the race though.\n\n===American Le Mans Series===\n[[File:Pair of RS Spyders.jpg|thumb|250px|Both of Penske's [[Porsche RS Spyder|RS Spyders]] at the [[2007 Generac 500]] where they scored an overall victory.]]\nIn April 2005, it was announced that [[Porsche]] would build an [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) sanctioned LMP2 Class Prototype that would be entered by Penske Racing in the [[American Le Mans Series]] and thus formally competed as '''DHL Porsche Penske Racing''' in a reference of Porsche Motorsport works team. The  [[Porsche RS Spyder]] made its successful debut at the ALMS season final race at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]]. The \"[[Porsche Junioren]]\" factory drivers [[Sascha Maassen]] and [[Lucas Luhr]] finished 1st in LMP2 Class and 5th Overall in the 4\u2013Hour Endurance Race. The livery of Penske Racing American Le Mans Series team was inspired by [[Jordan EJ12]]'s [[DHL]] [[Formula 1]] livery driven by [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] and [[Takuma Sato]].\n\nIn 2006, Penske Motorsports fielded two LMP2 Porsche RS Spyder in the American Le Mans Series, but did not run the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in June. The Penske cars combined to win seven class victories and the overall win at [[2006 American Le Mans at Mid-Ohio|Mid-Ohio]]. Penske Racing won the LMP2 team championship.

The team returned three years later, in the 1974 Canadian GP, with their own chassis, the PC1, a standard tub built around a [[Cosworth]] DFV engine and a [[Hewland]] gearbox. Donohue took the car to 12th place on its debut. In 1975, Roger Penske mounted a full season attack with the PC1, Donohue managing to score a fifth place in the Swedish GP. However, the car was retired after the French GP and Penske entered a [[March Engineering|March 751]] for the next three races, scoring another fifth in the British GP. However, Donohue crashed the car in the final practice session of the [[1975 Austrian Grand Prix]] at [[Spielberg, Styria|Spielberg]] and later died from his injuries. Penske missed the Italian race, returning only for the US GP, abandoning the March 751 in favor of the PC1 with Northern Irish driver [[John Watson (driver)|John Watson]].\n\nFor 1976, Penske signed a sponsorship deal with [[Citibank]] and entered a brand new PC3 for Watson. In spite of a fifth place scored at the [[1976 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]] at [[Kyalami]], the PC3 was evolved into the PC4, which was much more competitive, allowing Watson to score two podiums in France and Britain. Then, in the [[1976 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], the team scored their only F1 win. So far this has been the last time an American constructor won a F1 race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.f1i.com/news/46708-penske-anxious-to-see-how-haas-f1-fares.html|title=Penske 'anxious' to see how Haas F1 fares|date=March 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>Though American-owned, [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] achieved a victory at the [[1977 Austrian Grand Prix]] having raced with a  British licence.</ref> Still, Roger Penske was tired of Europe and at the end of the year decided to concentrate solely on Indycar racing, selling the remains of his European operations to [[G\u00fcnther Schmidt]] of [[Germany]].\n\nFor 1977, the car was entered by Schmidt's [[ATS (wheels)|ATS Wheels]] business and run under the name of ATS Racing Team. The ATS-Penske PC4, now painted yellow, debuted in the [[1977 United States Grand Prix West]] with [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] at the wheel, where the Frenchman scored the team's single point of the season. A second PC4 was eventually entered for [[Hans Heyer]] (who started the [[1977 German Grand Prix]] despite failing to qualify) and [[Hans Binder]] (3 races) but the team's fortunes sank and Schmidt quit after the Italian GP, before returning in 1978 with his own chassis. A third PC4 was built by Penske for [[Ted Field|Interscope]] Racing, who entered the car in the [[1977 United States Grand Prix|United States]] and [[1977 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] Grands Prix, driven by American [[Danny Ongais]] with no results.\n\nIn 1979 Penske designed and built the HR100 for wealthy Mexican 'gentleman driver' [[H\u00e9ctor Rebaque]].

In 1972, Penske driver [[Gary Bettenhausen]] led the most laps but lost an engine with 24 laps to go. His teammate [[Mark Donohue]] led the waning laps en route to Penske's first Indianapolis 500 victory. In 1979, Penske driver [[Bobby Unser]] led the most laps of the Indianapolis 500 while teammate [[Rick Mears]] won the race, from the pole.\n\nPenske's next ''500'' victory was one of the most controversial finishes in IndyCar history. Penske driver Unser won the pole position and led the most of the final 100 laps. On lap 140, Bobby Unser and former Penske driver [[Mario Andretti]] came out of the pits. Unser passed 11 cars under a yellow flag while Andretti passed 2 cars. Unser won the race, but was stripped of the victory the next morning in favor of Andretti. After a lengthy appeal, Unser was reinstated the victory and was instead fined $40,000 ($104,000 in today's money). Unser retired from racing after the season was over in the fall-out of the controversy.\n\nPenske's next Indy 500 win was with Rick Mears in 1984. Mears and former Penske driver [[Tom Sneva]] battled for the lead in the final 100 laps but after Sneva dropped out with a broken CV joint, Mears led the final 40 laps unchallenged to win by 2-laps ahead of the field. The next year, first-year Penske driver [[Danny Sullivan]] led the final 61 laps en route to his first Indianapolis 500 victory after winning a 4-lap shootout with [[Mario Andretti]]. In 1987, Penske driver [[Danny Ongais]] got taken out of the race due to injuries and former Penske driver [[Al Unser]] was tabbed as a temporary replacement. Unser won the race.\n\n1988 was one of the most dominating performances by Penske Racing in the history of the Indianapolis 500. Penske's team members, Sullivan, Unser and Mears qualified in the front row and proceeded to lead 192 of the race's 200 laps, 91 by Sullivan, 89 by Mears, and 12 by Unser. Mears won the race. In 1991, Mears won an 18-lap duel with [[Michael Andretti]] to win his 4th Indianapolis 500. Emerson Fittipaldi won the 500 in 1993 but angered American fans by drinking [[orange juice]] instead of the traditional milk.\n\nIn 1994, the Penske team, consisting of [[Al Unser Jr.]], [[Paul Tracy]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] led 193 of the race's 200 laps, thanks to a new engine invented by Penske that went up to 1000 horsepower. The engine was later banned, which resulted in Penske Racing not qualifying a single car in the 1995 Indianapolis 500.\n\nDue to the open-wheel split, Penske did not field a car at the Indianapolis 500 from 1996-2000. In 2001, Penske Racing crossed a picket-line by fielding the team in the 500, consisting of rookie [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] and [[Gil de Ferran]]. The duo proceeded to lead the most laps, en route to the victory, giving Penske Racing a 1-2 finish, the first time in the team's history. In a post-race interview, Roger Penske said that after the heartbreak in 1995, the win was the biggest of all his Indy 500 wins.\n\nIn 2002, Castroneves barely beat [[Paul Tracy]] to win his second consecutive Indy 500. Controversy overshadowed the race when video tapes appeared to have shown that Tracy was ahead of Castroneves at the moment of a final-lap caution. After a lengthy appeal, Castroneves' win was upheld on July 2. In 2003, [[Gil de Ferran]] won his first 500 and then retired when the season was over. Penske Racing has since proceeded to win the 500 in 2006, 2009, 2015, 2018, and 2019.\n\n==Penske Racing Museum==\n\n[[File:PenskeMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|Penske and Dallara Indy cars on display at the Penske Racing Museum in Scottsdale, Arizona.]]\n\nOpened in 2002, the Penske Racing Museum in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], Arizona, is located within a complex of [[Penske Automotive Group]] car dealerships at the Scottsdale 101 Auto Collection. The two-story, {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} museum houses approximately 20 historically significant Penske Racing cars, along with trophies, artwork, engines and other memorabilia dating from Penske Racing's earliest origins up to the present day. Displays are rotated on a regular basis, but the museum focuses primarily on the team's successes in the Indy 500 and NASCAR, with lesser emphasis on F1 and sports car racing.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Racing results==\n===USAC Championship Car results===\n([[Template:American Open Wheel driver results legend|key]]) (Results in '''bold''' indicate pole position; results in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n!
