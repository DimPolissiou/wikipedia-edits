{"title_page": "Business routes of Interstate 25", "text_new": "{{Infobox road\n|country=USA\n|type=I\n|route=25\n}}\nInterstate [[business route]]s are roads connecting a central or commercial district of a city or town with an [[Interstate highway|Interstate]] bypass.

Some states regard Interstate business routes as fully integrated within their state highway system while other states consider them to be either local roads to be maintained by county or municipal authorities or a hybrid of state and local control. Every state along I-25 regards its business routes as fully incorporated members of their respective state maintained highway systems.\n\nAlthough the public may differentiate between different business routes by the number of the parent route and the location of the route, there is no uniform naming convention. Each state highway department internally uses its own designations to identify segments within its jurisdiction.\n\n== New Mexico ==\nAll of the business loops within New Mexico are maintained by the [[New Mexico DepaWHO EHERE WANTES A PET THAT IS ALSO A DOG WATCH LOVE ON A LEASHing northward with additional routes serving the towns of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], [[Las Vegas, New Mexico|Las Vegas]], [[Springer, New Mexico|Springer]], and [[Raton, New Mexico|Raton]].

Within Colorado, all highways maintained by the state are classified as state highways including Interstates and U.S. routes which hold the same numerical designations as their nationally established routes. The numerical values of all state highway names are followed by an alphabetic suffix, although this convention is used by the department internally and not reflected in route signage. Hence, the mainline of [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate&nbsp;25]] throughout the length of the state is classified as State Highway&nbsp;25A while its two business routes in [[Aguilar, Colorado|Aguilar]] and [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]] are internally named State Highway&nbsp;25B and State Highway&nbsp;25C respectively.  [[U.S. Route 85 in Colorado|US&nbsp;85]] and  [[U.S. Route 87 in Colorado|US&nbsp;87]] are hidden routes not recognized nor signed by CDOT in southern Colorado. They are, however, established AASHTO routes maintaining continuity with signed portions in other states along their routes. In southern Colorado, the routes primarily follow I-25 including at Aguilar but with deviations such as along the Walsenburg business route. In addition to these,  [[U.S. Route 160 in Colorado|US&nbsp;160]] joins I-25 at Walsenburg and follows concurrently with the Interstate to [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]] including the portion bypassing Aguilar. Thus in Walsenburg, US&nbsp;160 crosses the business route in the town center and again at the business route's southern terminus.\n\n===Aguilar===\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=CO\n|type=BS\n|route=25\n|name=State Highway 25B\n|location=[[Aguilar, Colorado|Aguilar]]\n|length_mi=1.981\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"SH 25B\">{{cite web|title=Highway 025B between 0 and 1.948|url=http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/otis/HighwayData#/ui/1/0/criteria/025B/0/1.948|author=Staff, Online Transportation Information System|publisher=[[Colorado Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=September 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910013513/http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/Otis/HighwayData#/ui/1/0/criteria/025B/0/1.948#/ui/1/0/criteria/025B/0/1.948|archive-date=2012-09-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|length_round=3\n|formed=\n|yr_ref=\n}}\n'''State Highway&nbsp;25B''' is a business spur of I-25 connecting the town of Aguilar in [[Las Animas County, Colorado|Las Animas County]] to the Interstate.

Interstate business route [[reassurance markers]] are signed as either [[Loop route|loops]] or [[Spur route|spurs]] using a green [[Highway shield|shield]] shaped and numbered like the shield of the parent Interstate highway.\n\nAlong [[Interstate&nbsp;25]] (I-25), business routes are found in all three states through which I-25 passes: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], and [[Wyoming]]. Some states regard Interstate business routes as fully integrated within their state highway system while other states consider them to be either local roads to be maintained by county or municipal authorities or a hybrid of state and local control. Every state along I-25 regards its business routes as fully incorporated members of their respective state maintained highway systems.\n\nAlthough the public may differentiate between different business routes by the number of the parent route and the location of the route, there is no uniform naming convention. Each state highway department internally uses its own designations to identify segments within its jurisdiction.\n\n== New Mexico ==\nAll of the business loops within New Mexico are maintained by the [[New Mexico Department of Transportation]] (NMDOT). In New Mexico, Interstate business routes are named independently of their parent Interstate's designation with business loops of [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|Interstate&nbsp;25]] (I-25) numbered between 10\u201319, those of  [[Interstate 10 (New Mexico)|I-10]] between 20\u201329, and those of  [[Interstate 40 (New Mexico)|I-40]] between 30\u201339. New Mexico business loop numbers ascend eastward and northward with gaps in numbering to allow for future designations. I-25 begins with a business route through [[Williamsburg, New Mexico|Williamsburg]] and [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico|Truth or Consequences]] before proceeding northward with additional routes serving the towns of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], [[Las Vegas, New Mexico|Las Vegas]], [[Springer, New Mexico|Springer]], and [[Raton, New Mexico|Raton]]. These routes largely conform to the current or former alignment of the unsigned [[U.S. Route 85 in New Mexico|U.S. Route&nbsp;85]] (US&nbsp;85) through these communities before the construction of I-25. NMDOT has decommissioned US&nbsp;85 throughout the state and no longer signs the highway along its length as US&nbsp;85 entirely follows I-25 with the single exception of the business loop in Las Vegas. The [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO), however, continues to recognize the New Mexico portion of US&nbsp;85 maintaining continuity with sections in adjacent states.\n\n===Williamsburg &ndash; Truth or Consequences ===\n{{Infobox road small\n|country=USA\n|state=NM\n|county=[[Sierra County, New Mexico|Sierra County]]\n|type=BL\n|route=25\n|name=Business Loop 11\n|location=[[Williamsburg, New Mexico|Williamsburg]] &ndash; [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico|Truth or Consequences]]\n|length_mi=5.711\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"NMDOT Highway Log\">{{cite web|url=http://dot.state.nm.us/content/dam/nmdot/Data_Management/POSTED%20ROUTE-businessloops.pdf|title=Posted Route&ndash;Legal Description; Business Loops|author=Staff, Data Management Bureau|publisher=[[New Mexico Department of Transportation]]|date=March 16, 2010|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref>{{rp|1}}\n|length_round=3\n|formed=\n|deleted=\n|yr_ref=\n}}\n\n'''Business Loop 11''' is a {{convert|5.7|mi|adj=on}} business loop serving the cities of Williamsburg and Truth or Consequences in [[Sierra County, New Mexico|Sierra County]].

Within Colorado, all highways maintained by the state are classified as state highways including Interstates and U.S. routes which hold the same numerical designations as their nationally established routes. The numerical values of all state highway names are followed by an alphabetic suffix, although this convention is used by the department internally and not reflected in route signage. Hence, the mainline of [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate&nbsp;25]] throughout the length of the state is classified as State Highway&nbsp;25A while its two business routes in [[Aguilar, Colorado|Aguilar]] and [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]] are internally named State Highway&nbsp;25B and State Highway&nbsp;25C respectively.  [[U.S. Route 85 in Colorado|US&nbsp;85]] and  [[U.S. Route 87 in Colorado|US&nbsp;87]] are hidden routes not recognized nor signed by CDOT in southern Colorado. They are, however, established AASHTO routes maintaining continuity with signed portions in other states along their routes. In southern Colorado, the routes primarily follow I-25 including at Aguilar but with deviations such as along the Walsenburg business route. In addition to these,  [[U.S. Route 160 in Colorado|US&nbsp;160]] joins I-25 at Walsenburg and follows concurrently with the Interstate to [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]] including the portion bypassing Aguilar. Thus in Walsenburg, US&nbsp;160 crosses the business route in the town center and again at the business route's southern terminus.\n\n===Aguilar===\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=CO\n|type=BS\n|route=25\n|name=State Highway 25B\n|location=[[Aguilar, Colorado|Aguilar]]\n|length_mi=1.981\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"SH 25B\">{{cite web|title=Highway 025B between 0 and 1.948|url=http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/otis/HighwayData#/ui/1/0/criteria/025B/0/1.948|author=Staff, Online Transportation Information System|publisher=[[Colorado Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=September 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910013513/http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/Otis/HighwayData#/ui/1/0/criteria/025B/0/1.948#/ui/1/0/criteria/025B/0/1.948|archive-date=2012-09-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|length_round=3\n|formed=\n|yr_ref=\n}}\n'''State Highway&nbsp;25B''' is a business spur of I-25 connecting the town of Aguilar in [[Las Animas County, Colorado|Las Animas County]] to the Interstate.

The station is owned by the [[Fox Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[Fox Corporation]], as part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Seattle-licensed [[MyNetworkTV]] O&O [[KZJO]] (channel 22). The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle's [[Westlake, Seattle, Washington|Westlake]] neighborhood; KCPQ's transmitter is located on [[Gold Mountain (Washington)|Gold Mountain]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]].\n\nKCPQ is one of five local Seattle television stations seen in Canada on [[satellite television|satellite]] providers [[Bell TV]] and [[Shaw Direct]], as well as various [[cable television|cable]] systems across Canada. The station is also carried on several cable systems in [[Southeast Alaska|southeastern]] [[Alaska]].\n\n==History==\n\n===As KMO-TV/KTVW===\nChannel 13 signed on air on August 2, 1953 as '''KMO-TV''', co-owned with KMO radio (AM 1360, now [[KKMO]]), initially owned by Carl Haymond. The station carried some [[NBC]] programming for its first year until Seattle-licensed [[KOMO-TV]] (channel 4) began broadcasting on December 11. Hampered by a poor signal from north of Tacoma and the lack of alternate sources of programming, Haymond was forced to declare [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] and sell the station to J. Elroy McCaw, a colorful and eccentric radio and television station owner, and father of cellular phone magnate [[Craig McCaw]].\n\nUnder the ownership of McCaw's Gotham Broadcasting, who changed Channel 13's call letters to '''KTVW''', the station closed its studio in Tacoma's Roxy Theater and relocated to its transmitter building in North Tacoma overlooking Commencement Bay. McCaw operated the independent station on a shoestring budget. It limped along on a diet of a low-budget local programming, and older off-network syndicated programs and obscure [[feature film|movies]]. Its branding of the period featured a stylized [[black cat]] and the ironic tag line \"Lucky 13.\" KTVW was opportunistic on occasion and picked up broadcast rights to Tacoma's [[minor league baseball]] team games and an occasional Seafair hydroplane race. During much of the 1960s, an afternoon children's show, ''Penny and Her Pals'', was hosted by [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] LaMoyne \"Penny\" Hreha.\n\nAn interesting note in channel 13's history is that for a very brief time in late 1957 and early 1958, it carried [[CBS]] network news. KTNT-TV (channel 11, now [[KSTW]]), which at that time was the local CBS affiliate, stopped carrying the then-15-minute ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' with [[Douglas Edwards]] sometime in late summer 1957, saying that it wanted to expand its local news show to 30 minutes. KTVW picked up the newscast on October 28, 1957, according to ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. CBS, which wanted to see its newscasts remain on the air in Seattle\u2013Tacoma, set up special telephone lines to permit channel 13 to carry Edwards as its first live network show under the KTVW name. Speculation is that when KTNT learned that it would eventually lose its CBS affiliation to [[KIRO-TV]], which hit the airwaves in February 1958, it threw an on-air tantrum by dropping the ''Evening News'' and letting channel 13 pick it up.\n\nIn the mid to late 1960s, Stu Martin (also known as \"Stu Baby\" and \"Stu Boo\") was host of a locally produced in-studio [[B movie]] program on KTVW called ''Stu Martin's Double Date at the Movies''. In addition to its host, it featured two women with [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], \"Miss Early Date\" and \"Miss Late Date\". During breaks in the movie, in addition to commercials, the program featured a talent show. Viewers called Miss Early Date or Miss Late Date with their vote on the evening's top talent featuring local entertainers or those who thought they were entertaining.  The station got a competitor in 1962, when KTNT-TV lost its CBS affiliation for good and became an independent.\n\nIn 1970, KTVW ran a weekday stock-market news program called ''Business Action Line''; the show's producer, Rockwell Hammond, leased 6\u00bd hours a day on KTVW and originated the program, which was broadcast live from the Northern Life Tower in Seattle from where it was microwaved to the station in Tacoma. Their financial-news studio later moved to West Seattle and was housed in a building with ample microwave line-of-sight to the Tacoma tower. The show was hosted by Merrill Mael; Dick Stokke and, later, Joe McCusker read the news. Despite the poor over-the-air reception of KTVW in Seattle, the program had a following in the business community, if only for the 15-minute delayed stock ticker and the real time display of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]. However, expenses quickly overcame the income from what proved to be a limited commercial base, and the venture failed. Mael, a respected broadcaster for six decades, died in 2000. McCusker moved on to a career with the [[United Nations]] television operation, and retired in 2007.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, the station featured an on-air sports program and ''Swing Shift Theater'' movie host named Bob Corcoran, who hawked endless items from Tacoma's B & I Circus Store and Niagara recliners. He shared night-time television time with Stu Martin in airing B movies. Corcoran later forged a fledgling political career from his television late-night talk show (he died in February 2014). One of his early forays into politics was to enthusiastically support the candidacy of Seattle [[Chrysler]]/[[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] dealer Ralph Williams for Washington Attorney General. Not long after waging a losing campaign, Williams was indicted for tax evasion.\n\nWhen McCaw died in 1969, the McCaw estate sold KTVW to Seattle-based Blaidon Mutual Investors Corporation in 1971 for $1.1&nbsp;million. Blaidon tried to turn KTVW around by boosting the station's signal strength, acquiring first-run syndicated programming and color-capable broadcast equipment (the station had broadcast exclusively in black-and-white until 1972). Channel 13 premiered its new programming lineup with ''The Tony Visco Show'', its flagship effort. The talk/entertainment show was an attempt to recreate a ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]''-style program hosted by [[Las Vegas]] lounge entertainer/singer Tony Visco. It was taped at a Seattle night spot called the Cirque Dinner Theatre. Blaidon brought in a [[Los Angeles]] producer/director to develop the show, which featured a live band on-set, and had hopes of flying in show-business guests from L.A. and later syndicating the program nationwide. After two months on-air, rising production costs forced Blaidon to relocate the program to the station's Tacoma studios. Channel 13 canceled ''The Tony Visco Show'' after it completed its 13-week run because of poor advertising sponsorship and high production costs.\n\nKTVW launched an afternoon cartoon show hosted by a \"superhero\" for whom viewers were asked to suggest a name. The winning entry was \"Flash Blaidon\" and the host frequently made his entrance \"flying\" onto the set by jumping off a ladder whose shadow was often visible on the back wall of the cramped studio. KTVW introduced an evening movie program that included a puzzle contest offering $1,000 to the call-in winner. During the program's first week on the air, an overwhelming number of phone calls overloaded the station's phone system and put it out of order. A cult favorite program, ''Dr. ZinGRR's Astro-Projections'', aired on Saturday nights and into the wee hours of Sunday. \"Dr. ZinGRR\" was played by popular Seattle\u2013Tacoma radio disc jockey Robert O. Smith. He introduced Z-grade horror movies and performed satirical, comedic segments during movie breaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatacmedia.com/?p=16076|title=seatacmedia.com|author=|date=|website=www.seatacmedia.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDespite KTVW's improved and sometimes innovative programming, national advertisers failed to materialize and the station quickly lost momentum in the market. Channel 13's over-the-air signal, still spotty in many parts of the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market, along with a weak [[Puget Sound]] economy and Blaidon's under-capitalized organization, rendered the station a money-losing proposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatacmedia.com/?p=18794|title=seatacmedia.com|author=|date=|website=www.seatacmedia.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> Even though Seattle\u2013Tacoma was big enough on paper to support two independent stations, channel 13 increasingly lost ground to KTNT-TV, which had a stronger signal and much wealthier ownership that could afford stronger programming.\n \nPlagued by numerous lawsuits from unpaid syndication suppliers who reclaimed most of their programming from the station, KTVW's ratings plummeted and remaining advertisers deserted the operation. Blaidon was forced into bankruptcy protection. Program suppliers had asked a district court judge to place the station in receivership. Blaidon president Donald Wolfstone had attempted to sell the station to then-unknown televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] and his fledgling [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], but a court-appointed trustee canceled the deal. For a brief time under the court-appointed trusteeship, Len Sampson, a former KOMO-TV talk show host and personality, served as station manager and revised the schedule with a variety of syndicated programs and old network reruns as well as hosting some broadcasts himself. Another sale to Suburban Broadcasting, a [[Long Island]] television broadcast company, also fell through when the potential buyers failed to agree to assume the station's $4 million in liabilities. A bankruptcy judge then forced KTVW to cease operations at the end of a ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' rerun at 5 p.m. on December 12, 1974.\n\n===As KCPQ===\nThe station's remaining assets were bought in bankruptcy court bidding by the [[Clover Park School District]] in [[Lakewood, Washington|Lakewood]], for $378,000. Clover Park outbid the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and a local group to acquire the station. The call letters were changed to '''KCPQ''', replacing Clover Park's UHF channel 56 transmitter which had operated under the name KPEC-TV, and relocated its headquarters and city of license to Tacoma. The station went back on the air on January 4, 1976<ref>{{cite web |title=KCPQ-TV|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Annuals/Archive-Television-Factbook-IDX/IDX/90s/TV-Factbook-1992-OKL-USVI-OCR-Page-0298.pdf |website=www.americanradiohistory.com |publisher=American Radio History |accessdate=27 September 2019}}</ref> as the third [[PBS]] member station in the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market (after [[KCTS]] and [[KBTC-TV|KTPS-TV]] [now KBTC-TV]), airing secondary PBS and educational programs. Channel 56 would return to the air in 2000 as [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar]]-owned religious station [[KWDK]].\n\nBy 1980, the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market had become large enough that it could now sustain another VHF commercial television station. Kelly Broadcasting, owners of [[KCRA-TV]] in its home city of [[Sacramento, California]], purchased KCPQ from the Clover Park School District for $6.25&nbsp;million, outbidding Roadrunner Television from [[Tucson, Arizona]], which then owned KZAZ in Tucson (the current-day [[KMSB]], a fellow Fox affiliate). Channel 13 temporarily went silent on February 28, 1980 to facilitate changes in studio facilities and the transmitter. KCPQ's transmitter was relocated to [[Gold Mountain (Washington)|Gold Mountain]], a peak located west of [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], where the station erected a new tower to more effectively reach as much the Seattle market as they could under their FCC license to maintain primary service to Tacoma. While the move greatly increased the station's signal footprint across western Washington, it resulted in a somewhat weaker signal in the northern and eastern portions of the market. In promotional advertisements that aired on the station during the early 1980s, popular local celebrities (such as then-[[Seattle Seahawks]] player [[Steve Raible]]) encouraged KCPQ viewers in these areas to \"aim towards Bremerton\" with their TV antennas in order to get the best reception from the new transmitter.\n\nThe station relaunched on November 4, 1980 under its now-familiar \"Q13\" branding (although for the first several months on the air, it was referred to as \"The NEW 13\"), as well as another slogan: \"The Northwest's Movie Channel\". (It would also be occasionally be referred to on-air as \"Puget Sound Television\", with an alternate ident featuring a drawing of a boat within the green \"Q\" portion of the logo.) It used a logo similar to that of sister station KCRA, but with the square converted into a stylized \"Q.\" Its station jingle for the first 15 years of operation was two ship's bells. Channel 13 ran movies during the midday hours, late nights and weekends, and chose to counter-program the network shows during prime time with uncut versions of feature films, with \"limited interruptions\". The first film to be shown uncut on KCPQ was ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', with only two commercial breaks. The station also ran CBS and NBC shows that KIRO-TV and [[KING-TV]] respectively preempted, including ''[[The CBS Late Movie|CBS Late Night]]'', NBC's [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s and select game shows from both networks. For a short time after the relaunch, the station had an afternoon children's program, \"Captain Sea-Tac\", featuring a friendly boat captain. But eventually, other than Saturdays, KCPQ did not run children's programming during the week. The station also did not carry many off-network [[sitcom]]s, choosing instead to air first-run syndicated [[talk show|talk]] and [[game show]]s, off-network [[drama (film and television)|dramas]], and some early morning [[religious broadcasting|religious programs]].\n\n[[File:Q13Fox.svg|thumb|right|100px|KCPQ's former logo until June 2016. The \"Q-13\" element had remained unchanged outside of differing coloring dependent on design trends from 1991 until 2016, with the \"Fox\" logo added with varying use since its 1996 inception.]]\nOn October 9, 1986, KCPQ joined the newly-established Fox network as a charter affiliate, being one of a handful of VHF stations to align with the new network upon its startup. In 1987, with the children's television business growing, KCPQ began running [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] weekday mornings from 7 to 9&nbsp;a.m., and afternoons from 3 to 5&nbsp;p.m. Channel 13 added sitcoms as well, and continued airing first-run syndicated shows and movies. In February 1990, KCPQ signed a three-year deal with [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] to carry ''[[The Disney Afternoon]]'', spurning Fox's [[Fox Kids|own children's lineup]] which launched that fall until 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox  affiliate  defects  to  Buena  Vista|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1990/BC-1990-02-12.pdf|accessdate=November 30, 2015|work=Broadcasting|issue=Vol.  118  No.  7|page=22|publisher=Broadcasting  Publications  Inc. |date=February 12, 1990}}</ref>\n\nKCPQ was in danger of losing its Fox affiliation in February 1997, when [[Fox Television Stations]] was reported to be in negotiations to acquire then-UPN affiliate KIRO-TV from [[Belo|Belo Corporation]] (the then-owners of NBC affiliate KING-TV, whose acquisition necessitated KIRO's sale).<ref name=\"tst-kirobelofox?\">{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=Three-Network Switch Possible For Seattle TV|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970205&slug=2522436|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=February 5, 1997}}</ref> Fox was reportedly dissatisfied with KCPQ, as it was described by one observer as being \"recalcitrant.\"<ref name=\"b&c-kirobelofox?\">{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=Fox trading for KIRO-TV; network will swap Phoenix, Austin stations for Seattle|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19090124.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610220625/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19090124.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=February 3, 1997}} (preview of subscription content)</ref> At the time, KCPQ was one of the few large-market Fox stations without a full-scale news department (which it would not reactivate for another year).

The station held contracts with the [[Washington Huskies|University of Washington]] and [[Washington State Cougars|Washington State University]] to televise football and basketball coaches' shows during this period.\n\nSince the Seattle Seahawks' move to the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] from the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] in [[2002 Seattle Seahawks season|2002]], KCPQ has aired the majority of Seahawks regular season games through the ''[[NFL on Fox]]'', and since [[2018 NFL season|2018]], via Fox's exclusive contract, all ''Thursday Night Football'' games (however, the station had already been airing Seahawks games since Fox began broadcasting NFL games in 1994; those were limited to home interconference contests, as the Seahawks were part of the AFC prior to 2002). Seattle is the largest NFC market where the Fox station is only an affiliate. In [[2012 Seattle Seahawks season|2012]], KCPQ became the official television station of the Seahawks, adding analysis programs, along with coverage of the team's pre-season games (with replays of games on KZJO the following day). As Fox held rights to the game as part of its three-year cycle, KCPQ also broadcast the Seahawks' victory in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] in 2014. In [[2014 Seattle Sounders FC season|2014]], the station began to air [[Seattle Sounders FC]] [[Major League Soccer]] matches alongside KZJO.\n\nKCPQ has also aired select [[Seattle Mariners]] games by way of [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox's MLB broadcast contract]] since [[1996 Seattle Mariners season|1996]].\n\n==News operation==\nQ13 News produces 64\u00bd hours of newscasts each week for KCPQ and KZJO (with 11 hours each on Mondays through Thursdays, 10\u00bd hours on Fridays, 4\u00bd hours on Saturdays and 5\u00bd hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the second highest local newscast output among the Seattle market's television stations behind KING/KONG which broadcast 67 hours of local newscasts per week. In addition, the station produces a local version of ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' called ''Washington's Most Wanted'', hosted by anchor David Rose, which airs every Friday at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===News department history===\nKCPQ once ran several news updates between movies during the early 1980s, and briefly ran a full-scale half-hour 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast in the middle of the decade. This operation could not compete with the more established 10&nbsp;p.m. news on then-independent KSTW (it became a CBS affiliate briefly in 1995), and was eventually canceled by 1987. In June 1997, KCPQ announced a news share agreement that would have had KIRO-TV produce a 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast for the station; this came at the same time that KIRO was preparing to switch affiliations with KSTW, with KIRO becoming a CBS affiliate once again and KSTW becoming a UPN affiliate (it is now an owned-and-operated station of UPN's successor network, The CW). This newscast, however, did not come to fruition.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970624&slug=2546281 KCPQ May Air KIRO News ''[[Seattle Times]]'', June 14, 1997.]</ref><ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970625&slug=2546334 Issues Snag KIRO, KCPQ News Pact], ''Seattle Times'', June 25, 1997.</ref> Instead, the station established its current news department independently on January 18, 1998, when it launched a 35-minute 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast (initially named ''Q13 Reports'', recalling then-sister station KCRA's long-time news branding ''Channel 3 Reports''), which initially ran only on Sunday through Thursday nights for its first year-and-a-half.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980109&slug=2727728 KCPQ-TV Adds A 10 P.M.

In January 2007, KCPQ made headlines when, during a satellite interview with the station's morning newscast, [[Paula Abdul]] (who was promoting ''[[American Idol]]'') began to sway in her chair and slur her speech. Abdul's publicist attributed this to fatigue and technical difficulties during the recording of the interview, which she was also doing with other Fox affiliates.<ref name=\"Reuters\">{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN1230203320070114 |title=Singer Paula Abdul cancels interviews after video |work=Reuters |date=January 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 14, 2008}}</ref> It was later revealed on Abdul's [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] reality show ''[[Hey Paula (TV series)|Hey Paula]]'', which had followed Abdul with a video camera prior to the interviews, that she had not been sleeping, perhaps suffering from some mild form of [[insomnia]].\n\nIn April 2009, KCPQ became the second station in Seattle to broadcast its local newscasts in widescreen standard definition. In 2010, KCPQ began broadcasting its newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]], becoming the fourth Seattle station to do so. In June 2011, KCPQ added a 5&nbsp;p.m. newscast, making it the last Tribune-owned Fox station to debut an early evening newscast (its five other Fox-affiliated sister stations all debuted early evening newscasts during the fall of 2010). On March 26, 2012, KCPQ debuted an hour-long 4&nbsp;p.m. newscast that competes with ABC affiliate KOMO-TV's own hour-long newscast in that timeslot. On August 17, 2014, Q13 Fox launched the half-hour ''Q13 Fox News at 11'', which airs every Sunday through Thursday at 11 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]].\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n*[[Christine Chen]] \u2013 anchor\n*[[Ron Corning]] \u2013 anchor (later worked at [[ABC News]], syndicated news program ''[[The Daily Buzz]]'', and [[WNYW]] in New York City, now at [[WFAA-TV]] in Dallas)\n*[[Stanley Kramer]] \u2013 movie host (1980s) (deceased)\n*[[Don Poier]] \u2013 sports play-by-play (1980s; later voice of [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver/Memphis Grizzlies]] of NBA) (deceased)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/Don-Poier-1951-2005-Voice-of-Grizzlies-honed-1164905.php|title=Don Poier, 1951\u20132005: Voice of Grizzlies honed his skills in NW|last=Moore|first=Jim|date=January 24, 2005|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Repeaters==\nAll [[Relay transmitter|repeaters]] are owned by KCPQ and are within the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market, unless specified.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:50%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The station is owned by the [[Fox Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[Fox Corporation]], as part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Seattle-licensed [[MyNetworkTV]] O&O [[KZJO]] (channel 22). The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle's [[Westlake, Seattle, Washington|Westlake]] neighborhood; KCPQ's transmitter is located on [[Gold Mountain (Washington)|Gold Mountain]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]].\n\nKCPQ is one of five local Seattle television stations seen in Canada on [[satellite television|satellite]] providers [[Bell TV]] and [[Shaw Direct]], as well as various [[cable television|cable]] systems across Canada. The station is also carried on several cable systems in [[Southeast Alaska|southeastern]] [[Alaska]].\n\n==History==\n\n===As KMO-TV/KTVW===\nChannel 13 signed on air on August 2, 1953 as '''KMO-TV''', co-owned with KMO radio (AM 1360, now [[KKMO]]), initially owned by Carl Haymond. The station carried some [[NBC]] programming for its first year until Seattle-licensed [[KOMO-TV]] (channel 4) began broadcasting on December 11. Hampered by a poor signal from north of Tacoma and the lack of alternate sources of programming, Haymond was forced to declare [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] and sell the station to J. Elroy McCaw, a colorful and eccentric radio and television station owner, and father of cellular phone magnate [[Craig McCaw]].\n\nUnder the ownership of McCaw's Gotham Broadcasting, who changed Channel 13's call letters to '''KTVW''', the station closed its studio in Tacoma's Roxy Theater and relocated to its transmitter building in North Tacoma overlooking Commencement Bay. McCaw operated the independent station on a shoestring budget. It limped along on a diet of a low-budget local programming, and older off-network syndicated programs and obscure [[feature film|movies]]. Its branding of the period featured a stylized [[black cat]] and the ironic tag line \"Lucky 13.\" KTVW was opportunistic on occasion and picked up broadcast rights to Tacoma's [[minor league baseball]] team games and an occasional Seafair hydroplane race. During much of the 1960s, an afternoon children's show, ''Penny and Her Pals'', was hosted by [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] LaMoyne \"Penny\" Hreha.\n\nAn interesting note in channel 13's history is that for a very brief time in late 1957 and early 1958, it carried [[CBS]] network news. KTNT-TV (channel 11, now [[KSTW]]), which at that time was the local CBS affiliate, stopped carrying the then-15-minute ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' with [[Douglas Edwards]] sometime in late summer 1957, saying that it wanted to expand its local news show to 30 minutes. KTVW picked up the newscast on October 28, 1957, according to ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. CBS, which wanted to see its newscasts remain on the air in Seattle\u2013Tacoma, set up special telephone lines to permit channel 13 to carry Edwards as its first live network show under the KTVW name. Speculation is that when KTNT learned that it would eventually lose its CBS affiliation to [[KIRO-TV]], which hit the airwaves in February 1958, it threw an on-air tantrum by dropping the ''Evening News'' and letting channel 13 pick it up.\n\nIn the mid to late 1960s, Stu Martin (also known as \"Stu Baby\" and \"Stu Boo\") was host of a locally produced in-studio [[B movie]] program on KTVW called ''Stu Martin's Double Date at the Movies''. In addition to its host, it featured two women with [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], \"Miss Early Date\" and \"Miss Late Date\". During breaks in the movie, in addition to commercials, the program featured a talent show. Viewers called Miss Early Date or Miss Late Date with their vote on the evening's top talent featuring local entertainers or those who thought they were entertaining.  The station got a competitor in 1962, when KTNT-TV lost its CBS affiliation for good and became an independent.\n\nIn 1970, KTVW ran a weekday stock-market news program called ''Business Action Line''; the show's producer, Rockwell Hammond, leased 6\u00bd hours a day on KTVW and originated the program, which was broadcast live from the Northern Life Tower in Seattle from where it was microwaved to the station in Tacoma. Their financial-news studio later moved to West Seattle and was housed in a building with ample microwave line-of-sight to the Tacoma tower. The show was hosted by Merrill Mael; Dick Stokke and, later, Joe McCusker read the news. Despite the poor over-the-air reception of KTVW in Seattle, the program had a following in the business community, if only for the 15-minute delayed stock ticker and the real time display of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]. However, expenses quickly overcame the income from what proved to be a limited commercial base, and the venture failed. Mael, a respected broadcaster for six decades, died in 2000. McCusker moved on to a career with the [[United Nations]] television operation, and retired in 2007.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, the station featured an on-air sports program and ''Swing Shift Theater'' movie host named Bob Corcoran, who hawked endless items from Tacoma's B & I Circus Store and Niagara recliners. He shared night-time television time with Stu Martin in airing B movies. Corcoran later forged a fledgling political career from his television late-night talk show (he died in February 2014). One of his early forays into politics was to enthusiastically support the candidacy of Seattle [[Chrysler]]/[[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] dealer Ralph Williams for Washington Attorney General. Not long after waging a losing campaign, Williams was indicted for tax evasion.\n\nWhen McCaw died in 1969, the McCaw estate sold KTVW to Seattle-based Blaidon Mutual Investors Corporation in 1971 for $1.1&nbsp;million. Blaidon tried to turn KTVW around by boosting the station's signal strength, acquiring first-run syndicated programming and color-capable broadcast equipment (the station had broadcast exclusively in black-and-white until 1972). Channel 13 premiered its new programming lineup with ''The Tony Visco Show'', its flagship effort. The talk/entertainment show was an attempt to recreate a ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]''-style program hosted by [[Las Vegas]] lounge entertainer/singer Tony Visco. It was taped at a Seattle night spot called the Cirque Dinner Theatre. Blaidon brought in a [[Los Angeles]] producer/director to develop the show, which featured a live band on-set, and had hopes of flying in show-business guests from L.A. and later syndicating the program nationwide. After two months on-air, rising production costs forced Blaidon to relocate the program to the station's Tacoma studios. Channel 13 canceled ''The Tony Visco Show'' after it completed its 13-week run because of poor advertising sponsorship and high production costs.\n\nKTVW launched an afternoon cartoon show hosted by a \"superhero\" for whom viewers were asked to suggest a name. The winning entry was \"Flash Blaidon\" and the host frequently made his entrance \"flying\" onto the set by jumping off a ladder whose shadow was often visible on the back wall of the cramped studio. KTVW introduced an evening movie program that included a puzzle contest offering $1,000 to the call-in winner. During the program's first week on the air, an overwhelming number of phone calls overloaded the station's phone system and put it out of order. A cult favorite program, ''Dr. ZinGRR's Astro-Projections'', aired on Saturday nights and into the wee hours of Sunday. \"Dr. ZinGRR\" was played by popular Seattle\u2013Tacoma radio disc jockey Robert O. Smith. He introduced Z-grade horror movies and performed satirical, comedic segments during movie breaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatacmedia.com/?p=16076|title=seatacmedia.com|author=|date=|website=www.seatacmedia.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDespite KTVW's improved and sometimes innovative programming, national advertisers failed to materialize and the station quickly lost momentum in the market. Channel 13's over-the-air signal, still spotty in many parts of the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market, along with a weak [[Puget Sound]] economy and Blaidon's under-capitalized organization, rendered the station a money-losing proposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatacmedia.com/?p=18794|title=seatacmedia.com|author=|date=|website=www.seatacmedia.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> Even though Seattle\u2013Tacoma was big enough on paper to support two independent stations, channel 13 increasingly lost ground to KTNT-TV, which had a stronger signal and much wealthier ownership that could afford stronger programming.\n \nPlagued by numerous lawsuits from unpaid syndication suppliers who reclaimed most of their programming from the station, KTVW's ratings plummeted and remaining advertisers deserted the operation. Blaidon was forced into bankruptcy protection. Program suppliers had asked a district court judge to place the station in receivership. Blaidon president Donald Wolfstone had attempted to sell the station to then-unknown televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] and his fledgling [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], but a court-appointed trustee canceled the deal. For a brief time under the court-appointed trusteeship, Len Sampson, a former KOMO-TV talk show host and personality, served as station manager and revised the schedule with a variety of syndicated programs and old network reruns as well as hosting some broadcasts himself. Another sale to Suburban Broadcasting, a [[Long Island]] television broadcast company, also fell through when the potential buyers failed to agree to assume the station's $4 million in liabilities. A bankruptcy judge then forced KTVW to cease operations at the end of a ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' rerun at 5 p.m. on December 12, 1974.\n\n===As KCPQ===\nThe station's remaining assets were bought in bankruptcy court bidding by the [[Clover Park School District]] in [[Lakewood, Washington|Lakewood]], for $378,000. Clover Park outbid the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and a local group to acquire the station. The call letters were changed to '''KCPQ''', replacing Clover Park's UHF channel 56 transmitter which had operated under the name KPEC-TV, and relocated its headquarters and city of license to Tacoma. The station went back on the air on January 4, 1976<ref>{{cite web |title=KCPQ-TV|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Annuals/Archive-Television-Factbook-IDX/IDX/90s/TV-Factbook-1992-OKL-USVI-OCR-Page-0298.pdf |website=www.americanradiohistory.com |publisher=American Radio History |accessdate=27 September 2019}}</ref> as the third [[PBS]] member station in the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market (after [[KCTS]] and [[KBTC-TV|KTPS-TV]] [now KBTC-TV]), airing secondary PBS and educational programs. Channel 56 would return to the air in 2000 as [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar]]-owned religious station [[KWDK]].\n\nBy 1980, the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market had become large enough that it could now sustain another VHF commercial television station. Kelly Broadcasting, owners of [[KCRA-TV]] in its home city of [[Sacramento, California]], purchased KCPQ from the Clover Park School District for $6.25&nbsp;million, outbidding Roadrunner Television from [[Tucson, Arizona]], which then owned KZAZ in Tucson (the current-day [[KMSB]], a fellow Fox affiliate). Channel 13 temporarily went silent on February 28, 1980 to facilitate changes in studio facilities and the transmitter. KCPQ's transmitter was relocated to [[Gold Mountain (Washington)|Gold Mountain]], a peak located west of [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], where the station erected a new tower to more effectively reach as much the Seattle market as they could under their FCC license to maintain primary service to Tacoma. While the move greatly increased the station's signal footprint across western Washington, it resulted in a somewhat weaker signal in the northern and eastern portions of the market. In promotional advertisements that aired on the station during the early 1980s, popular local celebrities (such as then-[[Seattle Seahawks]] player [[Steve Raible]]) encouraged KCPQ viewers in these areas to \"aim towards Bremerton\" with their TV antennas in order to get the best reception from the new transmitter.\n\nThe station relaunched on November 4, 1980 under its now-familiar \"Q13\" branding (although for the first several months on the air, it was referred to as \"The NEW 13\"), as well as another slogan: \"The Northwest's Movie Channel\". (It would also be occasionally be referred to on-air as \"Puget Sound Television\", with an alternate ident featuring a drawing of a boat within the green \"Q\" portion of the logo.) It used a logo similar to that of sister station KCRA, but with the square converted into a stylized \"Q.\" Its station jingle for the first 15 years of operation was two ship's bells. Channel 13 ran movies during the midday hours, late nights and weekends, and chose to counter-program the network shows during prime time with uncut versions of feature films, with \"limited interruptions\". The first film to be shown uncut on KCPQ was ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', with only two commercial breaks. The station also ran CBS and NBC shows that KIRO-TV and [[KING-TV]] respectively preempted, including ''[[The CBS Late Movie|CBS Late Night]]'', NBC's [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s and select game shows from both networks. For a short time after the relaunch, the station had an afternoon children's program, \"Captain Sea-Tac\", featuring a friendly boat captain. But eventually, other than Saturdays, KCPQ did not run children's programming during the week. The station also did not carry many off-network [[sitcom]]s, choosing instead to air first-run syndicated [[talk show|talk]] and [[game show]]s, off-network [[drama (film and television)|dramas]], and some early morning [[religious broadcasting|religious programs]].\n\n[[File:Q13Fox.svg|thumb|right|100px|KCPQ's former logo until June 2016. The \"Q-13\" element had remained unchanged outside of differing coloring dependent on design trends from 1991 until 2016, with the \"Fox\" logo added with varying use since its 1996 inception.]]\nOn October 9, 1986, KCPQ joined the newly-established Fox network as a charter affiliate, being one of a handful of VHF stations to align with the new network upon its startup. In 1987, with the children's television business growing, KCPQ began running [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] weekday mornings from 7 to 9&nbsp;a.m., and afternoons from 3 to 5&nbsp;p.m. Channel 13 added sitcoms as well, and continued airing first-run syndicated shows and movies. In February 1990, KCPQ signed a three-year deal with [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] to carry ''[[The Disney Afternoon]]'', spurning Fox's [[Fox Kids|own children's lineup]] which launched that fall until 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox  affiliate  defects  to  Buena  Vista|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1990/BC-1990-02-12.pdf|accessdate=November 30, 2015|work=Broadcasting|issue=Vol.  118  No.  7|page=22|publisher=Broadcasting  Publications  Inc. |date=February 12, 1990}}</ref>\n\nKCPQ was in danger of losing its Fox affiliation in February 1997, when [[Fox Television Stations]] was reported to be in negotiations to acquire then-UPN affiliate KIRO-TV from [[Belo|Belo Corporation]] (the then-owners of NBC affiliate KING-TV, whose acquisition necessitated KIRO's sale).<ref name=\"tst-kirobelofox?\">{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=Three-Network Switch Possible For Seattle TV|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970205&slug=2522436|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=February 5, 1997}}</ref> Fox was reportedly dissatisfied with KCPQ, as it was described by one observer as being \"recalcitrant.\"<ref name=\"b&c-kirobelofox?\">{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=Fox trading for KIRO-TV; network will swap Phoenix, Austin stations for Seattle|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19090124.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610220625/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19090124.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=February 3, 1997}} (preview of subscription content)</ref> At the time, KCPQ was one of the few large-market Fox stations without a full-scale news department (which it would not reactivate for another year).

In June 2014, Fox reached a deal with Cox to trade its [[San Francisco]] Fox affiliate [[KTVU]] and sister independent [[KICU]] to Fox in exchange for its owned-and-operated stations in [[WFXT|Boston]] and [[WHBQ-TV|Memphis]].

The station held contracts with the [[Washington Huskies|University of Washington]] and [[Washington State Cougars|Washington State University]] to televise football and basketball coaches' shows during this period.\n\nSince the Seattle Seahawks' move to the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] from the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] in [[2002 Seattle Seahawks season|2002]], KCPQ has aired the majority of Seahawks regular season games through the ''[[NFL on Fox]]'', and since [[2018 NFL season|2018]], via Fox's exclusive contract, all ''Thursday Night Football'' games (however, the station had already been airing Seahawks games since Fox began broadcasting NFL games in 1994; those were limited to home interconference contests, as the Seahawks were part of the AFC prior to 2002). Seattle is the largest NFC market where the Fox station is only an affiliate. In [[2012 Seattle Seahawks season|2012]], KCPQ became the official television station of the Seahawks, adding analysis programs, along with coverage of the team's pre-season games (with replays of games on KZJO the following day). As Fox held rights to the game as part of its three-year cycle, KCPQ also broadcast the Seahawks' victory in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] in 2014. In [[2014 Seattle Sounders FC season|2014]], the station began to air [[Seattle Sounders FC]] [[Major League Soccer]] matches alongside KZJO.\n\nKCPQ has also aired select [[Seattle Mariners]] games by way of [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox's MLB broadcast contract]] since [[1996 Seattle Mariners season|1996]].\n\n==News operation==\nQ13 News produces 64\u00bd hours of newscasts each week for KCPQ and KZJO (with 11 hours each on Mondays through Thursdays, 10\u00bd hours on Fridays, 4\u00bd hours on Saturdays and 5\u00bd hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the second highest local newscast output among the Seattle market's television stations behind KING/KONG which broadcast 67 hours of local newscasts per week. In addition, the station produces a local version of ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' called ''Washington's Most Wanted'', hosted by anchor David Rose, which airs every Friday at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===News department history===\nKCPQ once ran several news updates between movies during the early 1980s, and briefly ran a full-scale half-hour 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast in the middle of the decade. This operation could not compete with the more established 10&nbsp;p.m. news on then-independent KSTW (it became a CBS affiliate briefly in 1995), and was eventually canceled by 1987. In June 1997, KCPQ announced a news share agreement that would have had KIRO-TV produce a 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast for the station; this came at the same time that KIRO was preparing to switch affiliations with KSTW, with KIRO becoming a CBS affiliate once again and KSTW becoming a UPN affiliate (it is now an owned-and-operated station of UPN's successor network, The CW). This newscast, however, did not come to fruition.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970624&slug=2546281 KCPQ May Air KIRO News ''[[Seattle Times]]'', June 14, 1997.]</ref><ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970625&slug=2546334 Issues Snag KIRO, KCPQ News Pact], ''Seattle Times'', June 25, 1997.</ref> Instead, the station established its current news department independently on January 18, 1998, when it launched a 35-minute 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast (initially named ''Q13 Reports'', recalling then-sister station KCRA's long-time news branding ''Channel 3 Reports''), which initially ran only on Sunday through Thursday nights for its first year-and-a-half.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980109&slug=2727728 KCPQ-TV Adds A 10 P.M.

In January 2007, KCPQ made headlines when, during a satellite interview with the station's morning newscast, [[Paula Abdul]] (who was promoting ''[[American Idol]]'') began to sway in her chair and slur her speech. Abdul's publicist attributed this to fatigue and technical difficulties during the recording of the interview, which she was also doing with other Fox affiliates.<ref name=\"Reuters\">{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN1230203320070114 |title=Singer Paula Abdul cancels interviews after video |work=Reuters |date=January 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 14, 2008}}</ref> It was later revealed on Abdul's [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] reality show ''[[Hey Paula (TV series)|Hey Paula]]'', which had followed Abdul with a video camera prior to the interviews, that she had not been sleeping, perhaps suffering from some mild form of [[insomnia]].\n\nIn April 2009, KCPQ became the second station in Seattle to broadcast its local newscasts in widescreen standard definition. In 2010, KCPQ began broadcasting its newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]], becoming the fourth Seattle station to do so. In June 2011, KCPQ added a 5&nbsp;p.m. newscast, making it the last Tribune-owned Fox station to debut an early evening newscast (its five other Fox-affiliated sister stations all debuted early evening newscasts during the fall of 2010). On March 26, 2012, KCPQ debuted an hour-long 4&nbsp;p.m. newscast that competes with ABC affiliate KOMO-TV's own hour-long newscast in that timeslot. On August 17, 2014, Q13 Fox launched the half-hour ''Q13 Fox News at 11'', which airs every Sunday through Thursday at 11 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]].\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n*[[Christine Chen]] \u2013 anchor\n*[[Ron Corning]] \u2013 anchor (later worked at [[ABC News]], syndicated news program ''[[The Daily Buzz]]'', and [[WNYW]] in New York City, now at [[WFAA-TV]] in Dallas)\n*[[Stanley Kramer]] \u2013 movie host (1980s) (deceased)\n*[[Don Poier]] \u2013 sports play-by-play (1980s; later voice of [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver/Memphis Grizzlies]] of NBA) (deceased)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/Don-Poier-1951-2005-Voice-of-Grizzlies-honed-1164905.php|title=Don Poier, 1951\u20132005: Voice of Grizzlies honed his skills in NW|last=Moore|first=Jim|date=January 24, 2005|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Repeaters==\nAll [[Relay transmitter|repeaters]] are owned by KCPQ and are within the Seattle\u2013Tacoma market, unless specified.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:50%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
