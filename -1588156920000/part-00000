The war, however, encouraged the development of automobile technology, stimulating interest in the motor car, and spurring demand for Cycle & Carriage's products in 1918.

In 1904, Cycle & Carriage shifted to [[list of roads in Kuala Lumpur|the corner of High Street, Market Street and Market Square]] and subsequently expanded to [[Ipoh]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]]. \n\n=== World War I and the shift to Singapore ===\nDuring [[World War I]], Cycle & Carriage suffered economically as a result of the shortage of supply for cars. The war, however, encouraged the development of automobile technology, stimulating interest in the motor car, and spurring demand for Cycle & Carriage's products in 1918. In that year, Cycle & Carriage was registered in the Federated Malay States with SG$250,000 in registered capital. In 1926, Cycle & Carriage shifted its headquarters to [[Orchard Road]] in [[Singapore]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.jcclgroup.com/flipbook1899|title=1899, the Cycle & Carriage Century|last=Leong|first=Ching|last2=Lim|first2=Richard|publisher=Cycle & Carriage Ltd|year=1999|isbn=9810413963|location=Singapore|pages=10}}</ref> with capital of SG$5 million and registered as a public company known as The Cycle & Carriage Company (1926) Limited.\n\n=== World War II and the ''Daimler-Benz'' contract ===\n\n[[World War II]] caused the company to cease operations, and its workshops, motor cars and trucks were absorbed by the Japanese during the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]].

On 4 March 1965, the [[Minister for Finance (Singapore)]] [[Goh Keng Swee]] laid the foundation stone for the SG$2.5 million plant, and predicted that it would create 10,000 new jobs over the following five years. In 1969, the company launched an [[initial public offering]], which was oversubscribed by 73 times, with a total offering of SG$241.65 million - which amounted to just a little short of the budget for the Ministry of Interior and Defense for that year.\n\n=== Acquisition by Jardine Matheson ===\n\nBy 1999, [[Jardine Matheson]] was a major shareholder in Cycle & Carriage Limited, with a 24.6% stake.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.jcclgroup.com/flipbook1899|title=1899, the Cycle & Carriage Century|last=Leong|first=Ching|last2=Lim|first2=Richard|publisher=Cycle & Carriage Ltd|year=1999|isbn=9810413963|location=Singapore|pages=57}}</ref> In 2002, Cycle & Carriage Limited became a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson when [[Jardine Strategic]] increased its stake to over 50%.

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s.

He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight.

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context.

From Proto-Balto-Slavic, the later [[Balto-Slavic languages]] are thought to have developed, composed of sub-branches [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and including modern [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] among others.\n\nLike most other proto-languages, it is not attested by any surviving texts but has been reconstructed using the [[comparative method]]. There are several [[isogloss]]es that Baltic and Slavic languages share in [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and accentology, which represent common innovations from Proto-Indo-European times and can be chronologically arranged.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\nProto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops lost their aspiration in Proto-Balto-Slavic. Stops were no longer distinguished between fortis and aspirated but were voiceless and voiced.<ref>Kortlandt (2002:3)</ref> However,  several new palatal ([[postalveolar]]) consonants had developed: *\u015b and *\u017a from earlier palatovelar plosives and *\u0161 from *s as a result of the [[Ruki sound law]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Proto-Balto-Slavic consonants<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Ronald|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|chapter=The phonology of Balto-Slavic|date=2018|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=1975\u20131976}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!

Short ''*o'' was merged into ''*a'', and former ''*eu'' had become ''*jau''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Proto-Balto-Slavic vowels<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Ronald|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|chapter=The phonology of Balto-Slavic|date=2018|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=1977\u20131978}}</ref>\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Short\n! colspan=\"2\" | Long\n! colspan=\"2\" | Diphthong\n|-\n!\n!

These were inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and formed anew from PIE syllabic sonorants. Although not diphthongs in the traditional sense, they behaved as a single syllable nucleus in Proto-Balto-Slavic, and could bear the acute like long vowels and regular diphthongs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n! -l\n! -m\n! -n\n! -r\n|-\n! a-\n| al\n| am\n| an\n| ar\n|-\n! e-\n| el\n| em\n| en\n| er\n|-\n! i-\n| il\n| im\n| in\n| ir\n|-\n! u-\n| ul\n| um\n| un\n| ur\n|}\n\n===Accent===\nMost Proto-Balto-Slavic words could be accented on any syllable, as in Proto-Indo-European. The placement of the accent was changed significantly relative to PIE, with much paradigmatic leveling of the mobile PIE accent, along with leftward and rightward shifts conditioned by the surrounding phonemes. There is still some disagreement among linguists on the exact position of the accent in each Proto-Balto-Slavic form, and the rules governing these changes.\n\n===Acute===\nSome syllables in Proto-Balto-Slavic had an additional distinguishing feature, known as ''acute''. It is primarily a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European laryngeals, as well as a result of [[Winter's law]]. The exact nature of the acute is not clear, and different linguists have different interpretations.\n\nThe modern interpretation, favoured by an increasing number of linguists, is that the acute was realised as [[glottalisation]], an interruption of voicing similar to the [[st\u00f8d]] found in [[Danish language|Danish]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Jay|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|date=2017|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, Boston|page=71}}</ref> This glottalisation is still found in modern [[Samogitian language|Samogitian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]], under the term \"broken tone\". Olander indicates it with a superscript glottalisation symbol ''\u02c0'' after the nucleus of the syllable,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Olander|first1=Thomas|title=Balto-Slavic accentual mobility|date=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|location=Berlin, New York|page=xi}}</ref> while Jasanoff is more noncommittal and uses underlining.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Jay|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|date=2017|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, Boston|page=59}}</ref> Some linguists go further, and interpret the acute as an actual consonantal segment, which Derksen indicates as a glottal stop ''\u0294'' and Kortlandt as a laryngeal consonant ''H''. They reconstruct this consonantal segment not just after vowels, but also before them, as direct reflexes of PIE laryngeals. Such consonantal reflexes of laryngeals are not widely accepted, however. For consistency<!-- and also for compatibility with Wiktionary -->, Olander's glottalisation symbol ''\u02c0'' will be used in this article.\n\nIn Proto-Balto-Slavic, the acute was independent of accent position, and could appear on any \"long\" syllable, which included:\n* Syllables with long vowels. They could be original PIE long vowels or vowels that were lengthened by a following laryngeal.\n* Syllables with vocalic diphthongs (''*ei'', ''*ai'', ''*au'').\n* Syllables with sonorant diphthongs, which consisted of short vowel followed by ''*l'', ''*m'', ''*n'' or ''*r''.\n\nThus, any syllable was either long with acute, long without acute or short. Syllables without acute are sometimes collectively termed \"circumflex\", although this term is also used specifically for ''long'' syllables lacking the acute. Within an inflectional paradigm, a long syllable could become short if the nucleus was immediately followed by an inflectional ending beginning with a vowel. This, in turn, resulted in the loss of the acute, as the acute was not permitted on short syllables. Such alternations were found in consonant stem nouns and in primary verbs.\n\nNo modern language retains the original Balto-Slavic distribution of the acute. In Lithuanian and Slavic, the acute distinction was lost on unaccented syllables and converted to an intonation distinction. This happened relatively late and not before some important accentual changes occurred, such as [[De Saussure's law]] and [[Dybo's law]]. In Latvian, the acute is reflected as the glottalised \"broken tone\" in words that originally had mobile accentuation.\n\n===Alternations===\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained the system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] from its parent language, but it was far less productive and had been significantly reworked. Vowel alternations were often leveled, but it is not always easy to determine how far this leveling had progressed by the time the Balto-Slavic dialects began to diverge, as the leveling progressed along the same lines in all of them to some degree.\n\nThe lengthened grade remained productive in word derivation and was used in many innovative formations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European. After the merger of ''*o'' and ''*a'', the resulting phoneme ''*a'' could lengthen to both ''*\u0101'' and ''*\u014d''.\n\nPre-Proto-Slavic retained many such uses of lengthened grades in morphology. The length distinctions are reflected as vowel quality distinctions in Late Common Slavic (LCS) and the later Slavic languages:\n* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u015bl\u0101\u02c0w\u0101\u02c0'' > Early Slavic ''*sl\u0101w\u0101'' \"fame, glory\" > LCS ''*slava'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430#Old Church Slavonic|slava]]'') vs. Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u015blawas'' > Early Slavic ''*slawa'' \"word\" > LCS ''*slovo'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e#Old Church Slavonic|slovo]]'')\n* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*tw\u0101ris'' > Early Slavic ''*tw\u0101ri'' \"substance\" > LCS ''*tvar\u044c'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c#Old Church Slavonic|tvar\u044c]]'') vs. Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*tw\u00e1r\u012b\u02c0tei'' > Early Slavic ''*twar\u012btei'' \"to form, create\" > ''*tvoriti'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438#Old Church Slavonic|tvoriti]]'')\n\nThese are similar examples in Lithuanian:\n* Lithuanian ''pr\u00f5tas'' \"intellect, mind\" (< ''*pr\u0101tas'') vs. ''pr\u00e0sti'' \"to understand\"\n* Lithuanian ''g\u0117\u0303ris'' \"goodness\" (< ''*g\u0113ris'') vs. ''[[wikt:geras#Lithuanian|g\u1ebdras]]'' \"good\"\n\nOn the basis of the existing length alternations inherited from Proto-Indo-European, new alternations arose between the long ''*\u012b'', ''*\u016b'' and the short ''*i'', ''*u''. This latter type of apophony was not productive in PIE.

The exact conditioning of this change is currently not well understood, but led to alternations between ''*e-'' and ''*a-'' in related words or even as alternative forms of the same word. The alternations often gave rise to different initial vowels in different languages.

A number can be explained by regular sound laws, but some laws have been obscured by numerous [[Analogy#Linguistics|analogical]] developments. Others are argued to be borrowings from Centum languages.\n\nFor example, Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*k\u00e1r\u02c0w\u0101\u02c0'' 'cow' (Lithuanian ''[[wikt:karv\u0117#Lithuanian|k\u00e1rv\u0117]]'', OCS ''krava'', Russian ''[[wikt:\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430#Russian|kor\u00f3va]]'') is likely a feminine derivation of a lost masculine noun that was likely borrowed from [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*karwos'' \"deer\" (Middle Welsh ''carw'', Middle Breton ''karo'', Middle Cornish ''carow''), which in turn is a regular reflex of PIE {{PIE|''*\u1e31r\u0325h\u2082wos''}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eugen|first1=Hill|editor1-last=Nielsen Whitehead|editor1-first=Benedicte|editor2-last=Olander|editor2-first=Thomas|editor3-last=Olsen|editor3-first=Birgit Anette|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rasmussen|editor4-first=Jens Elmeg\u00e5rd|title=The Sound of Indo-European \u2013 Phonetics, Phonemics and Morphophonemics|date=2012|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|location=Copenhagen|page=190|url=https://www.academia.edu/3727224/Hidden_sound_laws_in_the_inflectional_morphology_of_Proto-Indo-European._A_phonological_account_of_the_primary_first_singular_of_thematic_verbs_and_the_instrumental_case_of_thematic_nouns_and_adjectives|accessdate=11 October 2015|chapter=Hidden sound laws in the inflectional morphology of Proto-Indo-European}}</ref>\n\nPIE palatovelars could also depalatalize in Balto-Slavic. Several depalatalization rules for Balto-Slavic have been proposed.<ref>For an alternative formulation, see {{Harvcoltxt|Kortlandt|1978|pp=12\u201324}}</ref> According to Matasovi\u0107,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2008|pp=86}}. For a more precise formulation of the rule, see {{Harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2005}}</ref> the depalatalization of palatovelars occurred before sonorant followed by a back vowel: \u1e30 > K/_RV<sup>back</sup>.

According to the [[Ruki sound law|Ruki law]], it became ''*\u0161'' when it was preceded by ''*r'', ''*u'', ''*k'' or ''*i''. It also included diphthongs ending in ''*u'' or ''*i'', the long vowels ''*\u016b'' and ''*\u012b'' (whether original or from a following laryngeal), and the voiced velar ''*g''.\n\nAmong the Balto-Slavic languages, the evidence of Ruki law is recognizable only in Lithuanian and Slavic because in the other languages ''*\u0161'', ''*\u015b'' and ''*s'' all merge into plain ''*s''. In Lithuanian, ''*\u0161'' and ''*\u015b'' are merged to ''*\u0161'' instead, remaining distinct from ''*s''. In Slavic, ''*\u015b'' merges with ''s'' but ''*\u0161'' remains distinct (and becomes ''*x'' before back vowels).\n\nMost handbooks, on the basis of Lithuanian material, state that in Baltic Ruki law has been applied only partially. The most common claim is that the law applied unconditionally in Lithuanian only after ''*r'', while after ''*u'', ''*k'' and ''*i'', both ''*s'' and ''*\u0161'' occur. Compare:\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:au\u0161ra#Lithuanian|au\u0161r\u00e0]]'' \"dawn\" < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*au\u0161r\u0101\u02c0'' < PIE {{PIE|''*h\u2082\u00e9wsreh\u2082''}} (compare Latin ''[[wikt:aurora#Latin|aur\u014dra]]'', Sanskrit ''[[wikt:\u0909\u0937\u0938\u094d#Sanskrit|u\u1e63\u00e1s]]''), with RUKI applied.\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:ausis#Lithuanian|aus\u00ecs]]'' \"ear\" < Pre-Lithuanian ''*ausis'' < PIE {{PIE|''*h\u2082\u00e9wsis''}} (compare Latin ''[[wikt:auris#Latin|auris]]'') reflects ''*s'' while Slavic ''*uxo'' < Pre-Slavic ''*au\u0161-'' reflects ''*\u0161'' instead.\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:mai\u0161as#Lithuanian|ma\u0129\u0161as]]'' \"sack\" < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*mai\u0161\u00e1s'' < PIE {{PIE|''*moys\u00f3s''}} (compare Sanskrit ''[[wikt:\u092e\u0947\u0937#Sanskrit|me\u1e63\u00e1]]'') reflects ''*\u0161'', matching Slavic ''*m\u011bx\u044a''.\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:teisus#Lithuanian|teis\u00f9s]]'' < Pre-Lithuanian ''*teisus'' reflects ''*s'' while Slavic ''*tix\u044a'' < Pre-Slavic ''*tei\u0161us'' reflects ''*\u0161''.\n\nThere is no simple solution to such double reflexes the Ruki law in Lithuanian and thus no simple answer to the question of whether Ruki law is a common Balto-Slavic isogloss or not. The most probable answer seems to be the assumption that PIE ''*s'' was changed to ''*\u0161'' after ''*r'', ''*u'', ''*k'', ''*i'' completely regularly within Balto-Slavic proper, but the traces of the effect of RUKI law were erased by subsequent changes in Lithuanian such as the change of word-final ''*-\u0161'' to ''*-s''.\n\nGenerally, it can be ascertained that Lithuanian shows the effect of Ruki law only in old words inherited from Balto-Slavic period so Lithuanian ''\u0161'' appears in words that have a complete formational and morphological correspondence in Slavic (ruling out the possibility of accidental, parallel formations).\n\nIt appears that palatovelars yielded fricatives in Proto-Balto-Slavic before the effect of RUKI law, so that {{PIE|''*\u1e31s''}} appears simply as ''*\u015b''.

The systems of the two languages are vastly different in detail, however. PIE mobility and Balto-Slavic mobility are unconnected; Balto-Slavic mobility is not inherited from Proto-Indo-European, but formed entirely anew. PIE mobility was entirely lost in the early stages of Proto-Balto-Slavic,<ref>{{citation|last=Kortlandt|first=Frederik|year=2002|title=From Proto-Indo-European to Slavic|page=3|url=https://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf}}</ref> by eliminating the accentual distinction between \"strong\" and \"weak\" forms (accented further to the left and right, respectively), usually in favour of the weak forms, i.e. accent on the suffix syllable for proterokinetic stems. Hysterokinetic stems already effectively had fixed accent on the first syllable after the root, and retained this. Amphikinetic stems joined this pattern.\n\nThe exact process by which the new Balto-Slavic type of mobility arose is still a hotly debated topic, although some details are clear. As a general rule, nouns that had the accent on the ending (\"oxytones\") became mobile, while those that had accent on the root (\"barytones\") retained their fixed accent. Words with mobile accent had accent on the leftmost syllable of the stem in some forms, accent on the rightmost syllable of the ending in others (modified by [[Hirt's law]]).\n\nThe following sections lay out the explanations for mobility given by various linguists. The explanations are very different in nature, and sometimes also give different results for different cases. The \"incorrect\" outcomes are in turn explained by each in their own way.\n\n====Jasanoff====\n[[Jay Jasanoff|J.

If the accent came onto an initial syllable, it received a special \"left-marginal\" accent contour.\n# Proto-Vasilev-Dolobko's law (Proto-VDL): In phonological words of four or more syllables headed by a left-marginal accent, the final syllable acquired a lexical accent and the left-marginal accent was lost.\nAfter these changes, analogical changes took place. The mobility pattern of prefixed verbs was extended to unprefixed verbs. The final accent of nouns with two syllables before the ending (resulting from Proto-VDL) was extended to nouns with one syllable before the ending, e.g. regular *''su\u1dc5Hnumos'' \u2192 analogical ''*suHnumo\u030ds'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*s\u016b\u02c0num\u00e1s'' based on regular ''*golHwinomo\u030ds''.\n\n====Kortlandt====\n[[Frederik Kortlandt|Kortlandt]] proposes three changes that created new mobility:<ref>{{citation|last=Kortlandt|first=Frederik|year=2002|title=From Proto-Indo-European to Slavic|page=4|url=https://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf}}</ref>\n# Pedersen's law: The accent was retracted from medial syllables in stems that remained \"mobile\", i.e. in hysterokonetic and amphikinetic consonant stems, in which the accent sometimes fell on the suffix and sometimes on the ending.

Thus, acc. sg. {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*suHn\u00fas|*suHn\u00fam}} > ''*s\u00faHnum'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*s\u016b\u0301\u02c0nun''.\n# Oxytonesis: The accent shifted from a medial syllable to the end of the word in paradigms with end-accented forms. This shifted the accent to the last syllable of multisyllabic endings.\n\n====Olander====\n[[Thomas Olander|Olander]]'s \u201cmobility law\u201d<ref>{{citation|last=Olander|first=Thomas|year=2009|title=Balto-Slavic accentual mobility|pages=155\u2013156}}</ref> presupposes some conditions, namely:\n* Accented short vowels had one mora, which was accented.\n* Accented long vowels (whether inherited or from laryngeals) had two moras, with accent on the first.\n* Accented hiatal long vowels (i.e. V\u0301HV) had two moras, with accent on the second.\nThe mobility law itself then states that the accent was deleted if it fell on the last mora of a word, and the word became inherently unaccented. Such words appeared with a default accent on the leftmost mora of the word.\n\n====Moscow accentological school====\n{{also|Proto-Indo-European accent#Valence theory}}\nThe [[Moscow accentological school]] considers the Proto-Balto-Slavic mobile accent paradigm to be a direct reflex of recessive [[Proto-Indo-European]] platforms. Whereas in the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] and [[Proto-Hellenic|Hellenic]] in a recessive platforms, there was a shift of accent to the right, thus moving from the paradigmatic of the accent system to the categorical of the accent system:<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2014|pp=18-86}}</ref>\n*  ''Proto-Indo-European'' *m\u00e9d\u02b0<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-u<sub>(\u2212)</sub> > (metatony a\u0441ut\u0435 \u21d2 circumflex) ''Proto-Balto-Slavic'' *med<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-\u00fas<sub>(\u00b1)</sub>; ''Proto-Hellenic'' *m\u00e9t\u02b0<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-u<sub>(\u2212)</sub>, ''Proto-Indo-Iranian'' *m\u00e1d\u02b0<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-u<sub>(\u2212)</sub>.\n*  ''Proto-Indo-European'' *d\u00e9yw<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-o<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-s<sub>(+)</sub> (metatony a\u0441ut\u0435 \u21d2 circumflex) > ''Proto-Balto-Slavic'' *deiw<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-\u00e1s<sub>(\u00b1)</sub>, ''Proto-Indo-Iranian'' *dayw<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-\u00e1s<sub>(\u00b1)</sub>.\n\n===Hirt's law===\n{{main|Hirt's law}}\nHirt's law caused the accent to retract to the previous syllable if the vowel in the preceding syllable was immediately followed by a laryngeal. It took place before the addition of epenthetic vowels before syllabic sonorants, so at the time of the change, syllabic sonorants still acted as a vocalic nucleus like the true vowels and could attract the accent as well.\n\nHirt's law took place after the creation of new accentual mobility, and served to modify it. Where endings of mobile-accented words had multiple syllables, it could shift the accent from the final syllable onto the preceding one, thus creating the non-final accent of Slavic ''*-\u00ecti'' (infinitive) and ''*-\u00e0x\u044a'' (locative plural). If the accent was shifted from the ending of a mobile-accent word onto the stem, the word was usually converted to a fixed-accent pattern:\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*duHm\u00f3s'' \"smoke\" > (by Hirt's law, then conversion to fixed accent) ''*d\u00faHmos'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*d\u016b\u0301\u02c0mas'' > Lithuanian ''d\u016b\u0301mai'' (AP 1), Late Common Slavic ''*d\u1ef3m\u044a'' (AP a)\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*griHw\u00e1H'' \"?\" > (by Hirt's law, then conversion to fixed accent) ''*gr\u00edHwaH'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*gr\u012b\u0301\u02c0w\u0101\u02c0'' > Latvian ''gr\u0129va'', Late Common Slavic ''*gr\u00ecva'' (AP a)\nHowever, in some cases, Hirt's law does not appear to have taken place where it would be expected, and the words remain mobile-accented:\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*suHn\u00fas'' \"son\" > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*s\u016b\u02c0n\u00fas'' > Lithuanian ''s\u016bn\u00f9s'' (AP 3), Late Common Slavic ''*sy\u0311n\u044a'' (AP c)\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*giHw\u00f3s'' \"alive\" > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*g\u012b\u02c0w\u00e1s'' > Lithuanian ''g\u00fdvas'' (AP 3), Late Common Slavic ''*\u017e\u020bv\u044a'' (AP c)\n\n===Syllabic sonorants===\nThe Proto-Indo-European syllabic sonorants ''*l\u0325'', ''*r\u0325'', ''*m\u0325'' and ''*n\u0325'' (abbreviated ''*R\u0325'') developed a prothetic vowel in front of them, converting them into \"sonorant diphthongs\". This change occurred after Hirt's law, which operated on original syllabic sonorants but not on sonorant diphthongs.\n\nBoth ''*i'' and ''*u'' appear as prothetic vowels, yielding reflexes ''*im'', ''*in'', ''*ir'', ''*il'' (''*iR'') and ''*um'', ''*un'', ''*ur'', ''*ul'' (''*uR''). It has remained an unsolved problem to this day as to the exact phonological conditions that trigger which reflex. Regardless, analysis of their distribution has shown that ''*i'' appears much more often, suggesting that it is the default reflex, with ''*u'' appearing only in special cases. In a sample of 215 Balto-Slavic lexical items, 36 (17%) are attested only with ''*uR'' reflexes, 22 (10%) with both reflexes in the same language or branch or with one in Slavic and the other in Baltic, and the remaining 157 (73%) are attested only with ''*iR'' reflex.{{sfn|Andersen|2003|p=60}}\n\nSeveral theories have been proposed, the most notable being the one by [[Andr\u00e9 Vaillant]] from 1950.<ref>Vaillant, Andr\u00e9, \"Grammaire compar\u00e9e des langues slaves. Tome I, Phon\u00e9tique\", IAC, Lyon 1950, p. 171</ref> According to him, ''*u'' arose after PIE labiovelars. If true, it would be the only trace of PIE labiovelars in Balto-Slavic.\n\nAfter surveying [[Reinhold Trautmann]]'s 1924 Balto-Slavic dictionary, [[Jerzy Kury\u0142owicz]] in 1956 found no phonologically consistent distribution for the dual reflexes except in a single position: after PIE palatovelars Baltic and Slavic have only ''*iR'' reflex.<ref>c, Jerzy, 1956. \"L'apophonie en indo-europe\u00e9e\". Wroc\u0142aw: Ossolineum. Pages 227\u2013242.</ref>\n\n[[George Shevelov]] in 1965 inspected Slavic data in much detail, but in the end, he demonstrated only that the\ndistribution of the dual reflexes in Slavic is not reducible to phonological conditioning.<ref>Shevelov, George  Y. 1965. ''A  Prehistory  of  Slavic. The Historical Phonology  of  Common Slavic''. New York: Columbia University Press. Pages 86\u201391.</ref>\n\nAccording to an analysis by [[Christian Stang]] in 1966 Kury\u0142owicz's statistics proved only that ''*iR'' reflexes are much more frequent than ''*uR'' reflexes.{{sfn|Stang|1966|p=79}} Stang made several important observations:\n* Balto-Slavic grammatical morphemes have ''*iR'' reflexes, but no ''*uR'' reflexes\n* ''*iR'' reflexes are productive in ablaut alternations, while ''*uR'' are not\n* many words containing ''*uR'' diphthongs have an expressive meaning,{{sfn|Stang|1966|p=79-80}} meaning (i) \"fat\", \"dumb\", \"lazy\", \"clumsy\",  (ii) \"crooked, bent\",  (iii)  \"crippled, decrepit\", (iv) \"dark\",  \"dirty\",  or (v) they are of onomatopoeic origin. Such words could have been innovated at various times during the prehistory and have no relation to the Balto-Slavic reflexes of PIE ''*R\u0325''. Such ''u'' + sonorant combinations reflect a [[Sound symbolism|universal semantic category]];{{sfn|Andersen|2003|p=62}} compare English ''plump'', ''dumb'', ''bungle'', ''bulky'', ''clumsy'', ''glum'', ''dumpy'' etc.; German ''dumm'', ''dumpf'', ''stumm'', ''stumpf'', ''plump'' etc.\n\nStang's analysis indicates that ''*iR'' was the regular result of the diphthongization of PIE syllabic sonorants. Doublets with expressive meaning are then explained as expressively motivated ''*uR'' replacements of the original ''*iR'' reflex, or as borrowings from substratum dialects (such as Germanic) that regularly had the ''*R\u0325'' > ''*uR'' reflex, when (pre-)Balto-Slavic no longer had syllabic sonorants and were then used side by side with the original reflex.\n\nAccording to J\u0101nis Endzel\u012bns and Reinhold Trautmann ''*uR'' reflex resulted in zero-grade of morphemes that had PIE ''*o'' (> Balto-Slavic ''*a'') in normal grade.{{Clarify|date=November 2019}}\n\nMatasovi\u0107, in 2008,{{sfn|Matasovi\u0107|2008|p=111}} proposed the following rules:\n# At first, syllabic sonorants develop a prothetic schwa: ''*R\u0325'' > ''*\u0259R''.\n# ''*\u0259'' > ''*i'' in a final syllable.\n# ''*\u0259'' > ''*u'' after velars and before nasals.\n# ''*\u0259'' > ''*i'' otherwise.\n\n===Laryngeals and the acute===\nAccording to the traditional school, laryngeals disappeared as independent phonemes. Some linguists of the Leiden school, in particular Derksen and Kortlandt, reconstruct a glottal or laryngeal consonant for Proto-Balto-Slavic, as a direct reflex of original laryngeals. The remainder of this section thus only applies if one does not follow that idea.\n\nLike in almost all Indo-European branches, laryngeals in the syllable onset were lost, as were all word-initial laryngeals. Laryngeals between consonants disappeared as well, but in the first syllable, they are reflected as ''*a''. Compare:\n* PIE {{PIE|''*h\u2081rh\u0325\u2083d\u00e9h\u2082''}} \"heron, stork\" (Ancient Greek ''er\u014ddi\u00f3s'', Latin ''[[wikt:ardea#Latin|ardea]]'') > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*rad\u0101\u02c0'' > Slavic ''*roda'' (Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:roda#Serbo-Croatian|r\u00f3da]]'').\n* PIE {{PIE|''*sh\u0325\u2082l-''}} (oblique case stem of {{PIE|''*seh\u2082ls''}} \"salt\") > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*salis'' > Old Prussian ''sal'', Slavic ''*sol\u044c'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c#Old Church Slavonic|sol\u044c]]'', Polish ''[[wikt:s\u00f3l#Polish|s\u00f3l]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c#Russian|sol\u02b9]]'').\n\nOther laryngeals were lost in Proto-Balto-Slavic, but in some cases, the syllable was acuted as a \"leftover\" of the former laryngeal. The following outcomes can be noted, with H standing for a laryngeal, V for a vowel, R for a sonorant and C for any consonant:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Ronald|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|chapter=The phonology of Balto-Slavic|date=2018|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Boston|page=1982}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In other cases, the outcome is a long non-acute vowel.\n\nThe outcome of long vowels inherited directly from Proto-Indo-European, not lengthened by a laryngeal, is disputed. Traditional opinion holds that the acute is an automatic reflex of vowel length, and therefore all long vowels were automatically acuted, whether original or resulting from a following laryngeal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Ronald|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|chapter=The phonology of Balto-Slavic|date=2018|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Boston|page=1981}}</ref> Absolutely word-final long vowels of PIE origin were not acuted, but remained distinct from long vowels resulting from laryngeals, a distinction also found in [[Proto-Germanic]] \"overlong\" vowels. Kortlandt instead takes the position that the acute reflects laryngeals only; thus inherited long vowels do not trigger the acute. Regardless, the acute appears in all cases of vowel lengthening within Balto-Slavic. All long vowels that arose as part of word formations or sound changes within the Balto-Slavic period received the acute. This included the new alternations ''*u'' ~ ''*\u016b'' and ''*i'' ~ ''*\u012b'' that were innovated within Balto-Slavic.\n\nAside from acuteness, syllabic sonorants followed by laryngeals show the same outcome as syllabic sonorants in other environments. Balto-Slavic shares that characteristic with Germanic but no other Indo-European languages, which show clearly distinct reflexes in this case. Compare:\n* PIE ''*pl\u0325h\u2081n\u00f3s'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*p\u00edl\u02c0nas'' (Slavic ''*p\u044cln\u044a'', Lithuanian ''p\u00eclnas''), and Proto-Germanic ''*fullaz'' (< earlier ''*fulnaz'', with regular ''*l\u0325'' > ''*ul''; English ''full''), but Proto-Celtic ''*\u0278l\u0101nos'' (where ''*l\u0325'' > ''al'' normally).\n\n===Winter's law===\n{{main|Winter's law}}\nWinter's law caused lengthening of vowels if a plain voiced stop followed, and the new long vowels received the acute. According to some analyses, the change occurred only if the stop was in [[syllable coda]] (the syllable ending with that consonant).\n\nThe plain and aspirated stops merged in Balto-Slavic, but Winter's law operated before this merger had taken place. Consequently, the distinction between those two series has been indirectly preserved in Proto-Balto-Slavic by long acuted vowels. Furthermore, Winter's law took place before ''*o'' and ''*a'' merged, as it lengthened earlier ''*o'' to ''*\u014d\u02c0'' and ''*a'' to ''\u0101\u02c0''.\n\nOn the basis of relative chronology of sound changes, it has been ascertained that Winter's law acted rather late, after some other less prominent Balto-Slavic changes had occurred such as after the disappearance of laryngeals in prevocalic position.{{sfn|Matasovi\u0107|2008|p=83}} Compare:\n* PIE {{PIE|''*e\u01f5h\u2082\u00f3m''}} > Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*e\u017aHom'' > (Winter's law) ''*\u0113\u02c0\u017aHom'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u0113\u02c0\u017aun'' > Common Slavic ''*(j)az\u044a\u0301'' > [[Old Church Slavonic|OCS]] ''[[wikt:\u0430\u0437\u044a#Old Church Slavonic|az\u044a]]'', Slovene ''[[wikt:jaz#Slovene|jaz]]''.\n\nThe rules governing the emergence of the acute from voiced stops seem complicated when they are formulated within the framework of \"classical\" Proto-Indo-European [[laryngeal theory]], as there is no obvious connection between laryngeals and voiced stops, both of which trigger the acute. [[Frederik Kortlandt]] has proposed an alternative, more elegant and economic rule for the derivation of Balto-Slavic acute by using the [[glottalic theory]] framework of Proto-Indo-European. He proposed that the acute is a reflex of a [[glottal stop]], which has two sources, the merger of PIE laryngeals and the dissolution of PIE pre-glottalized stop (\"voiced stops\" in traditional reconstruction) to glottal stop and voiced stop, according to the Winter's law.\n\nThough elegant, Kortlandt's theory also has some problems. The glottalic theory, which was proposed in the 1970s, is not generally accepted among linguists, and today only a small minority of linguists would consider it a reliable and self-supportive framework onto which to base modern Indo-European research. Also, there is a number of Balto-Slavic lexemes with the acute that are provably not of PIE laryngeal origin, and some of them were a result of apophonical lengthenings occurring only in Balto-Slavic period.\n\n===Nasals===\nWord-finally, ''*m'' became ''*n'' in Balto-Slavic. Final nasals are not directly preserved in most Balto-Slavic languages, however, making evidence mostly indirect. Old Prussian uniquely preserves final ''*-n'', and there is indeed a clear attestation of the change in the nominative-accusative of neuters, such as ''[[wikt:assaran#Old Prussian|assaran]]'' \"lake\" < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u00e9\u017aeran''/''*\u00e1\u017aeran'' < PIE {{PIE|''*e\u01f5\u02b0erom''}}. In the other Baltic languages, no final nasals are retained. Lithuanian has vowel lengthening that reflects earlier nasal vowels, but they could conceivably come from either final ''-n'' or ''-m'' and thus do not provide evidence either way. In Slavic, all word-final consonants are lost in one way or another so there is no direct evidence there either.\n\nHowever, there is indirect evidence in the form of [[sandhi]] effects that were preserved in some Slavic pronouns. For example, Old Church Slavonic attests constructions like ''s\u044a nim\u044c'' \"with him\", which can be traced back to Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u015bun eimi\u0161'' where the first word reflects the common Proto-Indo-European preposition ''*\u1e31om'' \"with\" (compare Latin ''cum''), and the second reflects the PIE pronominal stem ''*ey-'' (Latin ''is'', German ''er''). In Slavic, in accordance with the \"[[Law of Open Syllables]]\", the final ''-n'' of the preposition was reinterpreted as belonging to the pronoun, which acted to preserve the nasal in its Balto-Slavic form, thus corroborating that it was indeed ''-n'': If the change of ''*-m'' to ''*-n'' had not taken place at an earlier stage, the phrase would have been ''*\u015bu'''m''' eimi\u0161'', which would have given ''*s\u044a '''m'''im\u044c'' in OCS instead.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe following changes to vowels in Proto-Balto-Slavic can be noted:\n\n* Long vowels are shortened before word-final ''*-n''. Thus, the \u0101-stem accusative singular, originally ''*-\u0101\u02c0m'', was shortened to ''*-an'': Lithuanian ''-\u0105'', Old Prussian ''-an'', Slavic ''*-\u01eb''. If the genitive plural ending was originally ''*-\u014dm'', it was shortened to ''*-on'' by this change.\n* Word-final ''*-os'' and ''*-on'' are raised to ''*-us'' and ''*-un'' when stressed, e.g. ''*e\u01f5h\u2082\u00f3m'' > Balto-Slavic ''*\u0113\u02c0\u017aun'' > Slavic ''*\u00e3z\u044a''. This causes a split in the o-stem paradigm, which is levelled in various ways later on. In Baltic, the nominals with original ending stress are transferred to the u-stem inflection. In Slavic, masculines of the two types are conflated and merge almost completely in most modern languages.\n* Word-final ''*-mi'' is reduced to ''*-n'' after a long vowel. This change occurred after the shortening, so that the vowel remained long and, if applicable, acuted. For example, the \u0101-stem instrumental singular ending ''*-\u0101mi'' was reduced to ''*-\u0101n'' > Lithuanian ''-\u00e0'', Slavic ''*-\u01eb'' (compared to the o-stem ending ''*-ami'' > Slavic ''*-om\u044c'').\n* ''*o'' > ''*a''\n* ''*un'' is lengthened to ''*\u016b\u02c0n'' (with acute) when a stop followed.{{clarify|reason=What about -\u016bns in the o-stem accusative plural?|date=November 2016}} In Slavic, it is reflected as ''*y'', with no nasal. For example: PIE ''*Hunk-'' \"to get used to\" > Balto-Slavic ''*\u016b\u02c0nktei'' > Lithuanian ''j\u00f9nkti'', Latvian ''j\u00fbkt'', OCS ''vykn\u01ebti'', Upper Sorbian ''wukny\u0107''. ''*in'' did not exhibit lengthening in such conditions, as older literature often states.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2008|pp=109}}</ref>\n\n==Morphology==\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained many of the grammatical features present in Proto-Indo-European.\n\n===Nominals===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\n====Grammatical categories====\nProto-Balto-Slavic made use of seven [[Grammatical case|cases]]:\n* [[Nominative case|Nominative]] - subject\n* [[Accusative case|Accusative]] - direct object\n* [[Genitive case|Genitive]] - possession, relation or association; direct object of negated verb\n* [[Locative case|Locative]] - stationary location\n* [[Dative case|Dative]] - indirect object\n* [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]] - tool, means by which, accompanying\n* [[Vocative case|Vocative]] - direct address\nThe eighth Proto-Indo-European case, the [[Ablative case|ablative]], had merged with the genitive case. Some of the inflectional endings for the genitive were replaced with those of the former ablative.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic also distinguished three [[Grammatical number|numbers]]:\n* singular (for one item)\n* dual (for two items)\n* plural (for three or more items)\nThe dual was retained into the early Slavic languages, but most modern Slavic languages have lost it. [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Chakavian]] (a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]]), and [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] are the only remaining Slavic languages that still make consistent use of the dual number. In most other Slavic languages, the dual number is not retained except for historically-paired nouns (eyes, ears, shoulders), certain fixed expressions, and agreement of nouns when used with numbers; it is synchronically often analyzed as genitive singular because of the resemblance in forms. The Baltic languages also used to have a dual number system, but it has become practically obsolete in modern Latvian and Lithuanian.\n\nFinally, Proto-Balto-Slavic nouns could also have one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Many originally neuter nouns in PIE had become masculine in Balto-Slavic so the group was somewhat reduced relative to the others. The modern Slavic languages largely continue the use of three grammatical genders, but modern Baltic languages have merged the neuter gender into the masculine. Lithuanian has no neuter-gender nouns, but in pronouns, participles and numerals, the neuter is retained. Latvian has no neuter gender at all.\n\nAn innovation within Balto-Slavic was the use of the genitive in place of the accusative for the direct object of a negative verb.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2008|pp=56\u201357}} ''\"Navedimo najva\u017enije baltoslavenske izoglose...Upotreba genitiva za izricanje objekta zanijekanog glagola\"''</ref> That feature is still present in its descendants:\n* \"I have read the book\": Russian ''{{lang|ru|(\u044f) \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0301\u043b \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0433'''\u0443'''}}'' (''(ja) \u010dit\u00e1l kn\u00edg'''u'''''), Slovene ''{{lang|sl|s\u00e8m br\u00e1l knj\u00edg'''o'''}}'', Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|kn\u1ef9g'''\u0105''' skai\u010diau}}''\n* \"I have not read the book\": Russian ''{{lang|ru|(\u044f) \u043d\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0301\u043b \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0433'''\u0438'''}}'' (''(ja) ne \u010dit\u00e1l kn\u00edg'''i'''''), Slovene ''{{lang|sl|n\u00edsem br\u00e1l knj\u00edg'''e'''}}'', Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|kn\u1ef9g'''os''' neskai\u010diau}}''\n\n====Nouns====\n{{empty section|date=May 2019}}\n\n====Adjectives====\nA Balto-Slavic innovation to the inflection of adjectives was the creation of a distinct \"definite\" inflection of adjectives by affixing forms of the pronoun ''*ja-'' to existing adjective forms. The inflection had a function resembling that of the definite article 'the' in English: Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|ger\u00e0sis}}'', Old Church Slavonic ''{{lang|cu|\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\ua651\u0438}}'' \"the good\" vs. ''{{lang|lt|g\u1ebdras}}'', ''{{lang|cu|\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044a}}'' \"good\". The distinction is no longer productive in most Slavic languages today, and most Slavic languages preserve a mixture of definite forms and indefinite forms in a single paradigm.\n\nRussian, Czech and Polish for example use the original definite nominative singular forms (Russian ''-\u044b\u0439, -\u0430\u044f, -\u043e\u0435'' (''-yj, -aja, -oje''), Polish ''-y, -a, -e'', Czech ''-\u00fd, -\u00e1, -\u00e9''). Czech and Polish have lost the indefinite forms except in a few limited uses, while Russian preserves the indefinite nominative forms as the so-called \"short forms\", used in some cases in [[predicative expression|predicate]] position. Serbo-Croatian and Slovene still distinguish the two types but only in the masculine nominative singular (definite ''-i'' versus indefinite with no ending). Bulgarian and Macedonian have innovated completely new forms, affixing forms of the demonstrative pronoun ''*t-'' instead.\n\n===Verbs===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\nThe distinction between athematic and thematic verbs was preserved, but athematic verbs were gradually reduced in number. The primary first-person singular endings, athematic ''*-mi'' and thematic ''*-oh\u2082'', were kept distinct, giving Balto-Slavic ''*-mi'' and ''*-\u014d\u02c0'' respectively. The thematic ending was occasionally extended by adding the athematic ending to it, apparently in Balto-Slavic times, resulting in a third ending: ''*-\u014d\u02c0mi'' > ''*-\u014d\u02c0m'' > ''*-\u014d\u02c0n'' > ''*-an'', replacing the original ending in Slavic, reflected as ''*-\u01eb'' (Russian ''-\u0443'' (''-u''), Polish ''-\u0119'', Bulgarian ''-a'').\n\nIn many Slavic languages, particularly South and West Slavic, the athematic ending was analogically extended to other verbs and even replaced the thematic ending completely in some languages (Slovene, Serbo-Croatian). In the Baltic languages, only the thematic ending was retained, as Lithuanian ''-\u00f9'' and Latvian ''-u'' (< East Baltic ''*-uo\u02c0'' < Balto-Slavic ''*-\u014d\u02c0''). In Latvian, the first-person singular form of ''b\u016bt'' \"to be\" is ''esmu'', which preserves the original ''*-m-'' of the athematic ending, but it was extended with the thematic ending.\n\nBalto-Slavic replaced the PIE second-person singular ending ''*-si'' with ''*-seHi'' > ''*-sei'' for which the origin is not fully understood. According to Kortlandt, the ending is a combination of the ending ''*-si'' with ''*-eHi'', which he considers to be the original thematic ending.<ref>Kortlandt(1979:58)</ref> The new ending, ''*-sei'', carried over into all three branches of Balto-Slavic and came to be used in all athematic root verbs in Baltic. In Old Church Slavonic, it completely ousted the older ending. In the other Slavic languages, the original ending generally survives except in the athematic verbs.\n\nThe aspectual distinction between present and aorist was retained and still productive in Proto-Balto-Slavic. It was preserved into early Slavic but was gradually replaced with an innovated aspectual distinction, with a variety of forms. Modern Bulgarian retained the aorist, however, alongside the innovated system, producing a four-way contrast. The Indo-European perfect/stative was falling out of use in Proto-Balto-Slavic and was likely already reduced to relics by Proto-Balto-Slavic times. It survives in Slavic only in the irregular Old Church Slavonic form ''v\u011bd\u011b'' \"I know\" (< Balto-Slavic ''*waidai'' < PIE ''*w\u00f3yde'', from ''*weyd-'' \"to see\"), which preserves an irregular first-person singular ending, presumed to originate in the perfect.\n\nProto-Indo-European did not originally have an [[infinitive]], but it did have several constructions that served as action nouns. Two of these, the ''-tis'' and ''-tus'' nouns, remained in use into Balto-Slavic and acquired verbal noun and infinitive-like functions. They were not fully integrated into the verb system by Balto-Slavic times, however, and the individual Balto-Slavic languages diverge on the details. In Slavic and the Eastern Baltic languages, the infinitive was formed from a case form of the ''-tis'' noun: Lithuanian ''-ti'', Latvian ''-t'', Proto-Slavic ''*-ti''. Old Prussian, however, has ''-t'' and ''-twei'' as infinitive endings, the latter of which comes from the ''-tus'' noun instead. The shorter ''-t'' could come from either type.\n\n===Accentual system===\n\nThe [[Proto-Indo-European accent]] was completely reworked in Balto-Slavic, with far-reaching consequences for accentual systems of the modern daughter languages. The development was conditioned by several delicate factors, such as the syllable length, presence of a laryngeal closing the syllable, and the position of PIE ictus. There is still no consensus among Balto-Slavists on the precise details of the development of Balto-Slavic accentual system. All modern research is based on the seminal study of Stang (1957), which basically instituted the field of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology. However, many laws and correspondences have been discovered and are now held to be true by the majority of researchers even if the exact details sometimes remain in dispute.\n\nEarly Balto-Slavic retained a simple accent in which only the placement of the accent was distinctive, but there were no pitch distinctions. The acute register was initially no more than an articulatory feature on certain syllables and could occur independently of accent placement. However, the acute was the trigger for several sound changes that affected the placement of the accent. For example, under [[Hirt's law]], the accent tended to shift leftwards onto a syllable that bore the acute.\n\nOn accented syllables, the acute came to be accompanied by a distinct pitch contour in late Proto-Balto-Slavic. Consequently, accented syllables of any type that could carry the acute register in Proto-Balto-Slavic (listed above) now differed in pitch contour as well as articulation; they had rising or falling pitch (whether accented acute syllables had rising or falling pitch differed by dialect). The tonal accents that emerged from this process are called \"acute accent\" and \"circumflex accent\" in Balto-Slavic linguistics.\n\nSyllables with a single short vowel could not bear the acute register and so also had no tonal distinctions. When accented, they had the same pitch contour (though nondistinctive) as a circumflex-accented syllable. The syllables are said to have \"short accent\".\n\nTo reconstruct the Balto-Slavic accent, the most important are those languages that have retained tonal oppositions: Lithuanian, Latvian, (probably) Old Prussian and the West South Slavic languages of Slovene and Serbo-Croatian. However, one should keep in mind that the prosodical systems of dialects in the aforementioned languages are sometimes very different from those of [[standard language]]s. For example, some Croatian dialects like [[\u010cakavian]] and Posavian dialects of [[Slavonia]]n \u0160tokavian are especially important for Balto-Slavic accentology, as they retain more archaic and complex tonal accentual system than the Neo\u0161tokavian dialect on which modern [[standard language|standard]] varieties of Serbo-Croatian ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) are based. On the other hand, many dialects have completely lost tonal oppositions (such as some [[Kajkavian]] varieties, the Zagreb spoken nonstandard idiom).\n\nA minority view, originating from [[Vladimir Dybo]], considers Balto-Slavic accentuation (based on correspondences in the Germanic, Celtic, and Italic languages) more archaic than Greek-Vedic and therefore closer to Proto-Indo-European.<ref>cf. Dybo, Nikolajev & Starostin:1978, Nikolaev:1989, Dybo 2007:47-50</ref>\n\n====Notation====\nWhat follows is a short overview of the commonly used diacritical marks for Balto-Slavic (BSl.) accents and/or prosodic features, all based on the example letter ''a''. In each case, there is a crude characterization of the pronunciation in terms of High, Mid, and Low-tone sequences.\n\n* Lithuanian: \"falling\"/HL (acute) ''\u00e1'', \"rising\"/H(L)H (circumflex) ''\u00e3'', \"short\"/H ''\u00e0''\n* Latvian (on ''all'' syllables): \"falling\"/HL ''\u00e0'', \"rising\"/LH (or \"lengthened\") ''\u00e3'', \"broken\"/L'H ''\u00e2''\n* Slovenian: \"falling\"/HL ''\u0203'', \"rising\"/LH ''\u00e1'', \"short\"/H ''\u0201''\n* Serbo-Croatian:<ref>All examples given for Serbo-Croatian are based on the standard language, stylised Neo\u0161tokavian dialect; they are accented according to the ''Rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga jezika'', F. Broz and I. Ivekovi\u0107, Zagreb 1901 and ''Akademijin Rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'', XXIII volumes, 1880\u20131976</ref> \"short falling\"/HL ''\u0201'', \"long falling\"/HML ''\u0203'', \"short rising\"/LH ''\u00e0'', \"long rising\"/LMH ''\u00e1'', \"posttonic length\" ''\u0101''\n* Common Slavic: \"short falling\"/HL (short circumflex) ''\u0201'', \"long falling\"/HML (long circumflex) ''\u0203'', \"acute\"/LH (old acute, old rising\") ''a\u030b'', \"neoacute\"/L(M)H (old acute, old rising\") ''\u00e1'' or ''\u00e3''\n\nIn Croatian dialects, especially \u010cakavian and Posavian, the \"neoacute\" (\"new acute\", a new rising tone) is usually marked with tilde, as ''\u00e3''. Short neoacute (\"short new rising\") is marked as ''\u00e0''. Neoacutes represent a post\u2013Proto-Slavic development.\n\nHere is a reverse key to help decode the various diacritical marks:\n\n* [[acute accent]] (''\u00e1''): Usually long rising and/or BSl. acute. Neoacute in some Slavic reconstructions. The default accent when a language has only one phonemic prosodic feature (such as stress in Russian, length in Czech). Marks long falling in Lithuanian because this derives from BSl. acute.\n* [[grave accent]] (''\u00e0''): Usually short rising or simply short.\n* [[circumflex accent]] (''\u00e2''): BSl. circumflex in reconstructions. Broken tone in modern Baltic (Latvian and [[\u017demaitian]] Lithuanian), a vowel with a glottal stop in the middle (derives from BSl. acute). Long falling in modern Slavic languages.\n* [[tilde]] (''\u00e3''): Alternative notation for BSl. circumflex in reconstructions. Long rising in various modern languages (Lithuanian, Latvian, archaic Serbo-Croatian dialects such as [[Chakavian]]). Derives from diverse sources: Lithuanian < BSl. circumflex, Latvian < BSl. acute, Serbo-Croatian dialects < long Common Slavic neoacute (from accentual retraction).\n* [[double grave accent]] (''\u0201''): Usually short falling (mostly in Slavic). Derived from circumflex (= long falling) by converting the \"acute\" portion of the accent to a grave, much as a simple acute (= long rising) is shortened by conversion to a grave.\n* [[double acute accent]] (''a\u030b''): Old acute in some Slavic reconstructions. (As opposed to a single acute for Slavic neoacute in reconstructions. Based on the fact that the old acute was shortened in Common Slavic.)\n* [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''\u0101''): Vowel length, particularly in syllables without tone (such as unstressed syllables in Slavic).\n* [[breve]] (''\u0103''): Vowel shortness.\n\nThere are multiple competing systems used for different languages and different periods. The most important are these:\n# Three-way system of Proto-Slavic, Proto-Balto-Slavic, modern Lithuanian: acute tone (''\u00e1'') vs. circumflex tone (''\u00e2'' or ''\u00e3'') vs. short accent (''\u00e0'').\n# Four-way Serbo-Croatian system, also used in Slovenian and often in Slavic reconstructions: long rising (''\u00e1''), short rising (''\u00e0''), long falling (''\u00e2''), short falling (''\u0201'').\n# Two-way length: long (''\u0101'') vs. short (''\u0103'').\n# Length only, as in Czech and Slovak: long (''\u00e1'') vs. short (''a'').\n# Stress only, as in Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian: stressed (''\u00e1'') vs. unstressed (''a'').\n\nMany nonprosodic marks are also found in various languages in combinations with certain letters. The various combinations of letter and diacritic should normally be viewed as single symbols (i.e. as equivalent to such simple symbols as ''a, b, c ...'').\n\nExamples on vowels:\n* [[ogonek]] (''\u0105''): With a rightward-curving hook unlike the leftward-curving [[cedilla]] (''\u00e7''): Vowel [[nasalization]]. In Standard Lithuanian, the nasalization is historical and the vowels are now simply reflected as long vowels, but some dialects still preserve nasalized vowels. Occasionally used to indicate [[low-mid]] quality in ''e, o''.\n* [[overdot]] (''\u0117 \u022f''), [[underdot]] (''\u1eb9 \u1ecd''): [[High-mid]] vowel quality {{IPA|[e o]}}, distinguished from plain ''e o'' indicating [[low-mid]] vowels {{IPA|[\u025b \u0254]}}. The overdot is normally found in Lithuanian, the underdot in Slovenian.\n* [[inverted breve]] below (''e\u032f i\u032f o\u032f u\u032f''), indicating nonsyllabic vowels (often, it is the second part of a diphthong).\n* [[h\u00e1\u010dek]] (''\u011b''): With a pointed ''v'' shape, rather than the rounded ''u'' shape of the [[breve]]: ''\u011b'', in Slavic reconstructions, is a vowel known as [[yat]], distinct in length and later quality from simple ''e'' (originally longer and lower; later, longer and higher in many dialects), but ''\u011b'', in Czech, sometimes indicates instead a simple ''e'', with palatalization of the preceding consonant (''d\u011b'' ''t\u011b'' ''n\u011b'').\n* ''\u00f4, \u00f3, \u016f'' originally indicated a [[high-mid]] {{IPA|[o]}} or diphthongized {{IPA|[uo]}} in various Slavic languages (respectively: Slovak/dialectal Russian; Polish/[[Upper Sorbian]]/[[Lower Sorbian]]; Czech). It now indicates {{IPA|[u]}} in Polish and long {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} in Czech.\n\nExamples in consonants:\n* Most diacritics on consonants indicate various sorts of palatal sounds such as an [[acute accent]] (''\u0107 \u01f5 \u1e31 \u013a \u0144 \u0155 \u015b \u017a''), a [[comma]] (''\u0123 \u0137 \u013c \u0146''), a [[ha\u010dek]] (''\u010d \u010f \u013e \u0148 \u0159 \u0161 \u0165 \u017e'') or an [[overbar]] (''\u0111''). They can indicate three:\n**[[palatoalveolar]]s (''\u010d \u0161 \u017e''): They have a \"hushing\" pronunciation {{IPA|[t\u0283 \u0283 \u0292]}}, as in English ''kitchen, mission, vision'' and are less palatal than the sounds indicated by ''\u0107 \u015b \u017a'';\n**[[alveolopalatal]]s (''\u0107 \u0111 \u015b \u017a'', as in Polish and Serbo-Croatian);\n**[[palatal stop]]s (voiceless ''\u1e31/\u0137/\u0165'' and voiced ''\u01f5/\u0123/\u010f\" in Macedonian, Latvian and Czech, respectively);\n**a [[palatal nasal]] (''\u0144 \u0146 \u0148'');\n**a [[palatal lateral]] (''\u013a \u013c \u013e''); or\n**a palatalized trill (''\u0155'', also ''\u0159'' in Czech specifically for a [[fricative trill]]).\n* In Slovak,'' \u013a'' and ''\u0155'' indicate doubled rather than palatal(ized) consonants (v\u0155ba=willow, h\u013abka=depth).\n* In western West Slavic (Polish, Kashubian, [[Upper Sorbian]] and [[Lower Sorbian]]), ''\u017c'' indicates a [[voiced retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0290]}}. (Other such sibilants are indicated by digraphs like ''cz'', ''sz''.)\n* In western West Slavic, ''\u0142'' indicates a sound that was once a dark (velarized) ''l'' but is now usually pronounced [w].\n\n====Accent paradigms==== <!--LINKED FROM REDIRECTS [[Mobile paradigm]] and [[Fixed paradigm]]-->\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n{{missing information|section|verb accent paradigms|date=April 2014}}\nProto-Balto-Slavic, just like Proto-Indo-European, had a class of nominals with so called \"mobile\" accentuation in which accent alternated between the word stem and the ending. The classes of nominals are usually reconstructed on the basis of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] and [[Ancient Greek]], which have retained the position of the original PIE accent almost unchanged. However, by comparing the Balto-Slavic evidence, it was discovered that the PIE rules on accent alternations, devised on the basis of Vedic and Greek, do not match those found in Balto-Slavic.\n\nMoreover, nominals that belong to mobile paradigms in Balto-Slavic belong to declension classes that always had fixed accent in PIE paradigms: \u0101-stems and o-stems. For a long time, the exact relationships between the accentuation of nominals in Balto-Slavic and PIE was one of the most mysterious questions of Indo-European studies, and some parts of the puzzle are still missing.\n\nResearch conducted by [[Christian Stang]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Vladimir Dybo]] has led to a conclusion that Balto-Slavic nominals, with regard to accentuation, could be reduced to two paradigms: fixed and mobile. Nominals of the fixed paradigm had accent on one of the stem syllables, and in the nominals of the mobile paradigm, the accent alternated between the stem and the ending. As shown by Illi\u010d-Svity\u010d, Balto-Slavic nominals of the fixed paradigm correspond to the PIE nominals with accent on the root (PIE barytones). The only exception were nominals with the accent on the ending (PIE oxytones) when it was shifted onto the root in Balto Slavic in accordance with [[Hirt's law]]; such nominals also have fixed accent in Balto-Slavic.\n\nThe origin of the Balto-Slavic nominals of the mobile paradigm has not been completely determined, with several proposed theories of origin. According to Illi\u010d-Svity\u010d, they originate as an analogical development from fixed-accent PIE oxytones. That theory has been criticized as leaving unclear why PIE nominals with fixed accent on the ending would become mobile, as analogies usually lead to uniformity and regularity. According to [[Antoine Meillet|Meillet]] and [[Christian Schweigaard Stang|Stang]], Balto-Slavic accentual mobility was inherited from PIE consonant and vowel-stems but not for o-stems, where they represent Balto-Slavic innovation. Vedic and Greek lost the accentual mobility in vowel stems, retaining it only in consonant stems. [[Ferdinand de Saussure|De Saussure]] explained it as a result of accent retraction in the medially stressed syllables of consonant-stems exhibiting the hysterokinetic paradigm, with vocalic stems subsequently imitating the new accentual patterns by analogy. According to [[Vladimir Dybo|Dybo]] the position of Balto-Slavic accent is determined by a formula from PIE tones according to the ''valence theory'' developed by the Moscow school, which presupposes [[PIE accent#Modern theories|lexical tone in PIE]]. Kortlandt up to 2006 supported the theory of Balto-Slavic losing PIE consonant-stem accentual mobility in nominals, and innovating everywhere else, but after 2006 maintains that the original PIE accentual mobility was preserved in Balto-Slavic in \u0101-stems (eh\u2082-stems), i-stems, u-stems and consonant-stems.\n\nThe Balto-Slavic accentual system was further reworked during the Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic period ([[Dybo's law]], [[Meillet's law]], [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]], etc.), resulting in three Common Slavic accentual paradigms (conventionally indicated using the letters ''A'', ''B'', ''C''), corresponding to four Lithuanian accentual paradigms (indicated with the numbers ''1'', ''2'', ''3'', ''4'') in a simple scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=2 rowspan=2 |\n| colspan=2 | Acute register on the root\n|-\n| yes\n| no\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | fixed accent\n| yes\n| a.p.&nbsp;1/a.p.

B\n|-\n| no\n| a.p.&nbsp;3/a.p.&nbsp;C\n| a.p.&nbsp;4/a.p.&nbsp;C\n|}\n\n=====Fixed paradigm with acuted root=====\nThe simplest accentuation is that of nominals which were acuted on the root in Balto-Slavic. They remain accented on the root (''root'' here is understood in the Proto-Balto-Slavic, not the PIE sense) throughout the paradigm in Baltic (Lithuanian ''first accentual paradigm'') and Slavic (''accent paradigm a'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n!

An acute-accented liquid diphthong yields accent on the epenthetic vowel; a circumflex-accented one results in accent on the first (original) vowel (''-\u00e1r\u02c0-'' > ''-or\u00f3-'', ''-ar-'' > ''-\u00f3ro-''). Serbo-Croatian and Slovene show metathesis instead.\n* Serbo-Croatian does not reflect the acute as a tonal distinction but shows short falling accent consistently for all words with post-Slavic initial accent regardless of tone. The short falling accent in the genitive plural has been lengthened due to the loss of a [[yer]]. The addition of ''-\u0101'' is a later innovation.\n* Slovene has a rising vowel, which reflects the original acute. All short accented vowels in non-final syllables were lengthened, which eliminated the length distinction in the genitive plural.\n\n=====Fixed paradigm with non-acuted root=====\nIn the nouns with non-mobile initial accent, which did not have an acuted root syllable, both Lithuanian and Slavic had an independent accent shift occur, from the root to the ending.

In the forms that had an acuted ending (nominative, vocative and instrumental singular, accusative plural), the accent shifted onto the ending, in accordance with the rule discovered by de Saussure. Later, that acuted syllable was shortened by Leskien's law.\n* In Slavic, the accent shifted from the root onto the ending in accordance with [[Dybo's law]], regardless of the syllable nature (whether it was acuted in Balto-Slavic or not) so the nouns of the B paradigm are consistently accented on the ending (oxytonic, except in the instrumental plural).\n* In the Neo\u0161tokavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian, which are used as the basis for standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, the so-called \"Neo\u0161tokavian retraction\" occurred: the accent was retracted from the ending onto the root syllable and became rising. Old \u0160tokavian and \u010cakavian dialects preserved the original ending-stressed paradigm.\n* Slovene also has retraction of the accent, which results in a long rising tone.\n\n=====Mobile paradigm=====\nNominals with mobile accent had in some cases an accented first syllable, in others an accented ending.\n\nLithuanian distinguishes two accent paradigms of these nominals, depending on whether the root was acuted, as in the fixed paradigm, or not.\n* If the root was acuted, it is said to belong to ''third accent paradigm''.\n* If the root was not acuted, then, by the operation of de Saussure's law, the accent shifted onto all the acuted endings in the paradigm, and these nouns are accounted as belonging to the ''fourth accent paradigm''.\n\nIn Proto-Slavic, the operation of [[Meillet's law]] converted acute roots to circumflexed in mobile nominals, so that the split found in Lithuanian does not occur.

All non-accented vowels were shortened, and all non-final accented vowels were lengthened.\n\n==Post-Balto-Slavic developments==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\nIn the later Balto-Slavic languages, the acute articulation itself was often lost, leaving only the pitch distinction on accented syllables as the reflex. There, \"acute\" is only a type of pitch accent, rather than a specific articulatory feature. The Slavic languages have no trace of the acute articulation and preserve only tonal distinctions although most have since lost even those, in their development from Proto-Slavic. The East Baltic languages preserve some traces of the original acute articulation, in the form of the so-called \"broken tone\", the is a long vowel with a glottal stop in the middle of it, typically denoted by a circumflex diacritic, not to be confused with the circumflex accent: ''\u00e2'' {{IPA|[a\u02c0a]}}. The broken tone is preserved in syllables in certain dialects of Latvian and Lithuanian. The broken tone can occur on unaccented syllables so it is not actually a tone but a [[register (phonology)|register]] distinction, much like the [[Danish language|Danish]] ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' or the ''ng\u00e3'' tone in Northern [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].\n\nThe short accent was preserved as such in both the Baltic and Slavic languages, but its lengthening could be triggered by certain conditions. For example, in Lithuanian, vowels /a/ and /e/ were lengthened when they initially bore short accent in open syllable, and rising tone emerged, marked with tilde sign ''\u00e3''. Compare:\n* PIE {{PIE|''*k\u02b7\u00e9k\u02b7lo-''}} \"circle, wheel\" > Balto-Slavic ''*k\u00e1kla-'' > Lithuanian ''[[wikt:kaklas#Lithuanian|k\u00e3klas]]'' \"neck\", Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:kolo#Serbo-Croatian|k\u020dlo]]''.\n* PIE {{PIE|''*d\u00e9\u1e31m\u0325t''}} \"ten\" > Balto-Slavic ''*d\u00e9\u015bimt'' > Lithuanian ''[[wikt:de\u0161imt#Lithuanian|d\u1ebd\u0161imt]]'', Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:deset#Serbo-Croatian|d\u0205set]]''.\n\n===Latvian===\nThe most direct continuation of the acute is in Latvian, particularly in the three-tone central dialects. There, the acute register is directly continued as a broken tone (''lauzt\u0101'') in originally unstressed syllables, marked with a circumflex diacritic: ''lu\u00f4gs'' \"window\". In originally-stressed syllables, the acute register is continued as a rising or lengthened intonation (''stiept\u0101''), marked with a [[tilde]]: ''lu\u00f5ks'' \"spring onion\". The circumflex register is generally continued as a falling intonation (''kr\u012bto\u0161\u0101''), marked with a [[grave accent]]:  ''l\u00f9oks'' \"arch, bow\". It can occur on all syllables: [[locative]] plural ''gal\u0302v\u00e2s'' \"on the heads\" (compare: Lithuanian ''galvos\u00e8'' with stress on a short final vowel, deleted in Latvian), including monosyllables: ''d\u00eat'' \"to lay eggs\" < ''*d\u00eat\u00ec''.<ref name=\"derksen12\">Derksen, Rick (2008). ''Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon''. Leiden: Brill. p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lithuanian===\nIn Lithuanian, the distinction between acute and circumflex is not preserved in unstressed syllables. In Standard Lithuanian, based on the [[Auk\u0161taitian dialect]], the acute becomes a falling tone (so-called \"Lithuanian metatony\") and is marked with an [[acute accent]], and the circumflex becomes a rising tone, marked with a [[tilde]]. In diphthongs, the acute accent is placed on the first letter of the diphthong while the tilde marking rising tone (the original circumflex) is placed on the second letter. In diphthongs with a sonorant as a second part, the same convention is used, but the acute accent is replaced with a [[grave accent]]: Lithuanian ''[[wikt:pilnas#Lithuanian|p\u00eclnas]]'' 'full' < PIE {{PIE|*plh\u2081nos}}). Word-finally, the acute was regularly shortened: ''[[wikt:geras#Lithuanian|ger\u00e0]]'' 'good' (indefinite adjective) : ''ger\u00f3ji'' 'the good' (definite adjective). That rule is called '''Leskien's law''' after the German neogrammarian [[August Leskien]].\n\nThe shortening operated according to Leskien's law after the Lithuanian metatony. In monosyllabic words, the acute became circumflexed. Metatonical retraction of the accent from the final syllable to the penultimate syllable also created a circumflex automatically.\n\nIn the [[\u017demaitian]] (Samogitian) dialects of Lithuanian, the usual reflex of Balto-Slavic acute in a stressed syllable is a broken tone like Latvian: \u017demaitian (Kretinga) ''\u1ed9m\u017e\u0301i\u1ecds'' \"age, century\" = standard ''\u00e1m\u017eius''.<ref name=\"derksen12\"/>\n\n===Old Prussian===\nIn Old Prussian, the acute was reflected probably as a rising tone and circumflex as a falling tone. The marks on long vowels and diphthongs in [[Abel Will]]'s translation of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion|Enchiridion]]'' point to that conclusion. It is the only accented Old Prussian text preserved. Diphthongs that correspond to a reconstructable Balto-Slavic acute are generally long in the second part of the diphthong, and those corresponding to a Balto\u2013Slavic circumflex are generally long in the first part.\n\n===Slavic===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n{{main|Proto-Slavic accent}}\nIn Proto-Slavic, the acute was lost as an articulatory feature and retained only as a tonal distinction on accented syllables. The acute produced a rising tone and the circumflex a falling tone, as in Latvian and Old Prussian.\n\nSeveral developments in Late Common Slavic affected vowel length. Syllables that were originally short could lengthen, and those originally long could shorten. However, the long vowels also acquired different quality from the short ones so lengthenings and shortenings did not cause them to merge.\n\nInstead, the vowels remained separate, causing the number of distinct vowels to almost double. Thus, differences vowel quality reflected older length distinctions while new vowel length distinctions were conditioned by accent type and placement. Consequently, in the Slavic languages that retain it, vowel length is often a [[suprasegmental]] feature tied to the accentual system rather phonemes. In Czech, Slovak and Old Polish, the mobile accent was lost in favour of fixed stress, which rephonemicised the older accentual length distinctions. Thus, the languages have long vowels as distinct phonemes, but they do not reflect the original Proto-Slavic length distinctions.\n\nIn all Slavic languages, the acute was shortened when it fell on a long vowel. A new rising accent (the \"neoacute\"), generally long, developed from retraction of the stress from a weak [[yer]] vowel (later usually lost). The short rising accent that developed from the old acute (and in some circumstances, the neoacute) was later lengthened again in a number of Slavic languages (such as Russian, Czech, Slovenian). The circumflex was shortened in some dialects as well (such as Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovak). Direct continuation of the acute vs. circumflex difference as a tonal distinction occurs only in archaic Serbo\u2013Croatian dialects (such as [[Chakavian]]) and, to some extent, Slovenian (although the relationship between Slovenian and Proto-Slavic tones and accent position is complex).\n\nIn addition, the Proto-Slavic tonal distinction on liquid diphthongs is reflected fairly directly in Russian as a multisyllable accent shape ([[pleophony]]): *\u00f4r (falling) > ''\u00f3ro'', *\u00f3r (rising) > ''or\u00f3''. In some other languages (most notably Czech and standard [[Neoshtokavian]] Serbo-Croatian), the acute vs. circumflex distinction is continued as a length distinction (although in all languages, both long and short vowels have other sources as well). The length-from-tone distinction no longer exists in Russian.\n\nHere is a table of basic accentual correspondences of the first syllable of a word:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

In 1802 the influential German scholar of Slavic languages and history [[August Ludwig von Schl\u00f6zer]] described how his understanding of this relationship had changed over the years: whereas previously he had argued that the 'Latvian' or 'Old-Prussian' peoples spoke languages that belonged to the Slavic group, he had come to see them as an independent language family.<ref>Schl\u00f6zer, August Ludwig, [Nestor in Russian] Russische Annalen in ihrer Slavonischen GrundSprache verglichen, \u00fcbersetzt, und erkl\u00e4rt, vol.2: Ru\u00dflands VorGeschichte.

(G\u00f6ttingen: Dieterich, 1802), pp.xii-xiii</ref>\n\nIt was formerly thought that Balto-Slavic split into two branches, Baltic and Slavic, which both developed as a single common language for some time afterwards. More recently, scholarship suggests that Baltic was not a single branch of Balto-Slavic.<ref>{{citation |last=Kortlandt |first=Frederik |author-link=Frederik Kortlandt |year=2009 |title=Baltica & Balto-Slavica |page=5 |quote=Though Prussian is undoubtedly closer to the East Baltic languages than to Slavic, the characteristic features of the Baltic languages seem to be either retentions or results of parallel development and cultural interaction.

From Proto-Balto-Slavic, the later [[Balto-Slavic languages]] are thought to have developed, composed of sub-branches [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and including modern [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] among others.\n\nLike most other proto-languages, it is not attested by any surviving texts but has been reconstructed using the [[comparative method]]. There are several [[isogloss]]es that Baltic and Slavic languages share in [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and accentology, which represent common innovations from Proto-Indo-European times and can be chronologically arranged.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\nProto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops lost their aspiration in Proto-Balto-Slavic.

These were inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and formed anew from PIE syllabic sonorants. Although not diphthongs in the traditional sense, they behaved as a single syllable nucleus in Proto-Balto-Slavic, and could bear the acute like long vowels and regular diphthongs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n! -l\n! -m\n! -n\n! -r\n|-\n! a-\n| al\n| am\n| an\n| ar\n|-\n! e-\n| el\n| em\n| en\n| er\n|-\n! i-\n| il\n| im\n| in\n| ir\n|-\n! u-\n| ul\n| um\n| un\n| ur\n|}\n\n===Accent===\nMost Proto-Balto-Slavic words could be accented on any syllable, as in Proto-Indo-European. The placement of the accent was changed significantly relative to PIE, with much paradigmatic leveling of the mobile PIE accent, along with leftward and rightward shifts conditioned by the surrounding phonemes. There is still some disagreement among linguists on the exact position of the accent in each Proto-Balto-Slavic form, and the rules governing these changes.\n\n===Acute===\nSome syllables in Proto-Balto-Slavic had an additional distinguishing feature, known as ''acute''. It is primarily a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European laryngeals, as well as a result of [[Winter's law]]. The exact nature of the acute is not clear, and different linguists have different interpretations.\n\nThe modern interpretation, favoured by an increasing number of linguists, is that the acute was realised as [[glottalisation]], an interruption of voicing similar to the [[st\u00f8d]] found in [[Danish language|Danish]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Jay|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|date=2017|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, Boston|page=71}}</ref> This glottalisation is still found in modern [[Samogitian language|Samogitian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]], under the term \"broken tone\". Olander indicates it with a superscript glottalisation symbol ''\u02c0'' after the nucleus of the syllable,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Olander|first1=Thomas|title=Balto-Slavic accentual mobility|date=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|location=Berlin, New York|page=xi}}</ref> while Jasanoff is more noncommittal and uses underlining.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Jay|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|date=2017|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, Boston|page=59}}</ref> Some linguists go further, and interpret the acute as an actual consonantal segment, which Derksen indicates as a glottal stop ''\u0294'' and Kortlandt as a laryngeal consonant ''H''. They reconstruct this consonantal segment not just after vowels, but also before them, as direct reflexes of PIE laryngeals. Such consonantal reflexes of laryngeals are not widely accepted, however. For consistency<!-- and also for compatibility with Wiktionary -->, Olander's glottalisation symbol ''\u02c0'' will be used in this article.\n\nIn Proto-Balto-Slavic, the acute was independent of accent position, and could appear on any \"long\" syllable, which included:\n* Syllables with long vowels. They could be original PIE long vowels or vowels that were lengthened by a following laryngeal.\n* Syllables with vocalic diphthongs (''*ei'', ''*ai'', ''*au'').\n* Syllables with sonorant diphthongs, which consisted of short vowel followed by ''*l'', ''*m'', ''*n'' or ''*r''.\n\nThus, any syllable was either long with acute, long without acute or short. Syllables without acute are sometimes collectively termed \"circumflex\", although this term is also used specifically for ''long'' syllables lacking the acute. Within an inflectional paradigm, a long syllable could become short if the nucleus was immediately followed by an inflectional ending beginning with a vowel. This, in turn, resulted in the loss of the acute, as the acute was not permitted on short syllables. Such alternations were found in consonant stem nouns and in primary verbs.\n\nNo modern language retains the original Balto-Slavic distribution of the acute. In Lithuanian and Slavic, the acute distinction was lost on unaccented syllables and converted to an intonation distinction. This happened relatively late and not before some important accentual changes occurred, such as [[De Saussure's law]] and [[Dybo's law]]. In Latvian, the acute is reflected as the glottalised \"broken tone\" in words that originally had mobile accentuation.\n\n===Alternations===\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained the system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] from its parent language, but it was far less productive and had been significantly reworked. Vowel alternations were often leveled, but it is not always easy to determine how far this leveling had progressed by the time the Balto-Slavic dialects began to diverge, as the leveling progressed along the same lines in all of them to some degree.\n\nThe lengthened grade remained productive in word derivation and was used in many innovative formations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European. After the merger of ''*o'' and ''*a'', the resulting phoneme ''*a'' could lengthen to both ''*\u0101'' and ''*\u014d''.\n\nPre-Proto-Slavic retained many such uses of lengthened grades in morphology. The length distinctions are reflected as vowel quality distinctions in Late Common Slavic (LCS) and the later Slavic languages:\n* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u015bl\u0101\u02c0w\u0101\u02c0'' > Early Slavic ''*sl\u0101w\u0101'' \"fame, glory\" > LCS ''*slava'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430#Old Church Slavonic|slava]]'') vs. Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u015blawas'' > Early Slavic ''*slawa'' \"word\" > LCS ''*slovo'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e#Old Church Slavonic|slovo]]'')\n* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*tw\u0101ris'' > Early Slavic ''*tw\u0101ri'' \"substance\" > LCS ''*tvar\u044c'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c#Old Church Slavonic|tvar\u044c]]'') vs. Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*tw\u00e1r\u012b\u02c0tei'' > Early Slavic ''*twar\u012btei'' \"to form, create\" > ''*tvoriti'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438#Old Church Slavonic|tvoriti]]'')\n\nThese are similar examples in Lithuanian:\n* Lithuanian ''pr\u00f5tas'' \"intellect, mind\" (< ''*pr\u0101tas'') vs. ''pr\u00e0sti'' \"to understand\"\n* Lithuanian ''g\u0117\u0303ris'' \"goodness\" (< ''*g\u0113ris'') vs. ''[[wikt:geras#Lithuanian|g\u1ebdras]]'' \"good\"\n\nOn the basis of the existing length alternations inherited from Proto-Indo-European, new alternations arose between the long ''*\u012b'', ''*\u016b'' and the short ''*i'', ''*u''. This latter type of apophony was not productive in PIE. Compare:\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:m\u016b\u0161is#Lithuanian|m\u016b\u0303\u0161is]]'' \"battle\" versus ''m\u00f9\u0161ti'' \"to kill, hit\"\n* Lithuanian ''l\u1ef9kis'' \"remainder\" versus ''l\u00eckti'' \"to stay, keep\"\n\nThe new type of apophonic length was especially used in Pre-Proto-Slavic in the formation of durative, iterative and imperfective verbs. Compare:\n* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*d\u00edr\u0101\u02c0tei'' > Early Slavic ''*dir\u0101tei'' \"to tear (perfective)\" > LCS ''*d\u044crati'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0434\u044c\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438#Old Church Slavonic|d\u044crati]]'') vs. Early Slavic ''*arz-d\u012br\u0101tei'' (\"to tear (imperfective)\") > LCS ''*orzdirati'' (OCS ''razdirati'')\n* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*b\u00edr\u0101\u02c0tei'' > Early Slavic ''*bir\u0101tei'' \"to pick\" > LCS ''*b\u044crati'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0431\u044c\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438#Slavonic|b\u044crati]]'') vs. Early Slavic ''*b\u012br\u0101tei'' \"to choose\" > LCS ''*birati'' (OCS ''birati'')\n\nCertain pairs of words show a change of older initial ''*a-'' (from PIE {{PIE|*(H)a-}}, {{PIE|*(H)o-}}, {{PIE|*h\u2082e-}}, {{PIE|*h\u2083e-}}) to ''*e-'', which is sometimes called \"Rozwadowski's rule\". The exact conditioning of this change is currently not well understood, but led to alternations between ''*e-'' and ''*a-'' in related words or even as alternative forms of the same word. The alternations often gave rise to different initial vowels in different languages. Several words retained the alternation into Proto-Slavic times as well, which became an alternation between ''*(j)e-'' and ''*o-'':\n* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*elawa''/''*alawa'' \"lead\" > Bulgarian (dial.)

A number can be explained by regular sound laws, but some laws have been obscured by numerous [[Analogy#Linguistics|analogical]] developments. Others are argued to be borrowings from Centum languages.\n\nFor example, Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*k\u00e1r\u02c0w\u0101\u02c0'' 'cow' (Lithuanian ''[[wikt:karv\u0117#Lithuanian|k\u00e1rv\u0117]]'', OCS ''krava'', Russian ''[[wikt:\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430#Russian|kor\u00f3va]]'') is likely a feminine derivation of a lost masculine noun that was likely borrowed from [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*karwos'' \"deer\" (Middle Welsh ''carw'', Middle Breton ''karo'', Middle Cornish ''carow''), which in turn is a regular reflex of PIE {{PIE|''*\u1e31r\u0325h\u2082wos''}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eugen|first1=Hill|editor1-last=Nielsen Whitehead|editor1-first=Benedicte|editor2-last=Olander|editor2-first=Thomas|editor3-last=Olsen|editor3-first=Birgit Anette|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rasmussen|editor4-first=Jens Elmeg\u00e5rd|title=The Sound of Indo-European \u2013 Phonetics, Phonemics and Morphophonemics|date=2012|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|location=Copenhagen|page=190|url=https://www.academia.edu/3727224/Hidden_sound_laws_in_the_inflectional_morphology_of_Proto-Indo-European._A_phonological_account_of_the_primary_first_singular_of_thematic_verbs_and_the_instrumental_case_of_thematic_nouns_and_adjectives|accessdate=11 October 2015|chapter=Hidden sound laws in the inflectional morphology of Proto-Indo-European}}</ref>\n\nPIE palatovelars could also depalatalize in Balto-Slavic. Several depalatalization rules for Balto-Slavic have been proposed.<ref>For an alternative formulation, see {{Harvcoltxt|Kortlandt|1978|pp=12\u201324}}</ref> According to Matasovi\u0107,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2008|pp=86}}. For a more precise formulation of the rule, see {{Harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2005}}</ref> the depalatalization of palatovelars occurred before sonorant followed by a back vowel: \u1e30 > K/_RV<sup>back</sup>. That would explain Centum reflexes such as these ones:\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:akmuo#Lithuanian|akmu\u00f5]]'', Latvian ''[[wikt:akmens#Latvian|akmens]]'' and OCS ''[[wikt:\u043a\u0430\u043c\ua651#Old Church Slavonic|kamy]]'' would have regular {{IPA|/k/}} from Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*akm\u014d'' as opposed to Sanskrit ''[[wikt:\u0905\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d#Sanskrit|\u00e1\u015bm\u0101]]'' < PIE {{PIE|''*h\u2082\u00e9\u1e31m\u014d''}} \"stone\".\n* OCS ''[[wikt:\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0440\ua651#Old Church Slavonic|svekry]]'' < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*swekr\u016b\u02c0'' < PIE {{PIE|''*swe\u1e31r\u00fah\u2082''}} \"mother-in-law\".\n* Old Prussian ''balgnan'' < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*balgna'' < PIE {{PIE|''*b\u02b0ol\u01f5\u02b0nom''}} \"saddle\".\n\nAnother view is that satemization occurred in Baltic and Slavic independently after Slavic had split off.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Ruki law===\nPIE ''*s'' was preserved in Balto-Slavic in most positions. According to the [[Ruki sound law|Ruki law]], it became ''*\u0161'' when it was preceded by ''*r'', ''*u'', ''*k'' or ''*i''. It also included diphthongs ending in ''*u'' or ''*i'', the long vowels ''*\u016b'' and ''*\u012b'' (whether original or from a following laryngeal), and the voiced velar ''*g''.\n\nAmong the Balto-Slavic languages, the evidence of Ruki law is recognizable only in Lithuanian and Slavic because in the other languages ''*\u0161'', ''*\u015b'' and ''*s'' all merge into plain ''*s''. In Lithuanian, ''*\u0161'' and ''*\u015b'' are merged to ''*\u0161'' instead, remaining distinct from ''*s''. In Slavic, ''*\u015b'' merges with ''s'' but ''*\u0161'' remains distinct (and becomes ''*x'' before back vowels).\n\nMost handbooks, on the basis of Lithuanian material, state that in Baltic Ruki law has been applied only partially. The most common claim is that the law applied unconditionally in Lithuanian only after ''*r'', while after ''*u'', ''*k'' and ''*i'', both ''*s'' and ''*\u0161'' occur. Compare:\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:au\u0161ra#Lithuanian|au\u0161r\u00e0]]'' \"dawn\" < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*au\u0161r\u0101\u02c0'' < PIE {{PIE|''*h\u2082\u00e9wsreh\u2082''}} (compare Latin ''[[wikt:aurora#Latin|aur\u014dra]]'', Sanskrit ''[[wikt:\u0909\u0937\u0938\u094d#Sanskrit|u\u1e63\u00e1s]]''), with RUKI applied.\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:ausis#Lithuanian|aus\u00ecs]]'' \"ear\" < Pre-Lithuanian ''*ausis'' < PIE {{PIE|''*h\u2082\u00e9wsis''}} (compare Latin ''[[wikt:auris#Latin|auris]]'') reflects ''*s'' while Slavic ''*uxo'' < Pre-Slavic ''*au\u0161-'' reflects ''*\u0161'' instead.\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:mai\u0161as#Lithuanian|ma\u0129\u0161as]]'' \"sack\" < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*mai\u0161\u00e1s'' < PIE {{PIE|''*moys\u00f3s''}} (compare Sanskrit ''[[wikt:\u092e\u0947\u0937#Sanskrit|me\u1e63\u00e1]]'') reflects ''*\u0161'', matching Slavic ''*m\u011bx\u044a''.\n* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:teisus#Lithuanian|teis\u00f9s]]'' < Pre-Lithuanian ''*teisus'' reflects ''*s'' while Slavic ''*tix\u044a'' < Pre-Slavic ''*tei\u0161us'' reflects ''*\u0161''.\n\nThere is no simple solution to such double reflexes the Ruki law in Lithuanian and thus no simple answer to the question of whether Ruki law is a common Balto-Slavic isogloss or not. The most probable answer seems to be the assumption that PIE ''*s'' was changed to ''*\u0161'' after ''*r'', ''*u'', ''*k'', ''*i'' completely regularly within Balto-Slavic proper, but the traces of the effect of RUKI law were erased by subsequent changes in Lithuanian such as the change of word-final ''*-\u0161'' to ''*-s''.\n\nGenerally, it can be ascertained that Lithuanian shows the effect of Ruki law only in old words inherited from Balto-Slavic period so Lithuanian ''\u0161'' appears in words that have a complete formational and morphological correspondence in Slavic (ruling out the possibility of accidental, parallel formations).\n\nIt appears that palatovelars yielded fricatives in Proto-Balto-Slavic before the effect of RUKI law, so that {{PIE|''*\u1e31s''}} appears simply as ''*\u015b''.

The systems of the two languages are vastly different in detail, however. PIE mobility and Balto-Slavic mobility are unconnected; Balto-Slavic mobility is not inherited from Proto-Indo-European, but formed entirely anew. PIE mobility was entirely lost in the early stages of Proto-Balto-Slavic,<ref>{{citation|last=Kortlandt|first=Frederik|year=2002|title=From Proto-Indo-European to Slavic|page=3|url=https://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf}}</ref> by eliminating the accentual distinction between \"strong\" and \"weak\" forms (accented further to the left and right, respectively), usually in favour of the weak forms, i.e. accent on the suffix syllable for proterokinetic stems. Hysterokinetic stems already effectively had fixed accent on the first syllable after the root, and retained this. Amphikinetic stems joined this pattern.\n\nThe exact process by which the new Balto-Slavic type of mobility arose is still a hotly debated topic, although some details are clear. As a general rule, nouns that had the accent on the ending (\"oxytones\") became mobile, while those that had accent on the root (\"barytones\") retained their fixed accent. Words with mobile accent had accent on the leftmost syllable of the stem in some forms, accent on the rightmost syllable of the ending in others (modified by [[Hirt's law]]).\n\nThe following sections lay out the explanations for mobility given by various linguists. The explanations are very different in nature, and sometimes also give different results for different cases. The \"incorrect\" outcomes are in turn explained by each in their own way.\n\n====Jasanoff====\n[[Jay Jasanoff|J. Jasanoff]] proposes two rules explaining the rise of mobility.<ref>{{citation|last=Jasanoff|first=Jay|year=2017|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|pages=122\u2013130}}</ref>\n# Saussure-Pedersen's law: The accent was retracted one syllable to the left from a word-internal short open syllable. If the accent came onto an initial syllable, it received a special \"left-marginal\" accent contour.\n# Proto-Vasilev-Dolobko's law (Proto-VDL): In phonological words of four or more syllables headed by a left-marginal accent, the final syllable acquired a lexical accent and the left-marginal accent was lost.\nAfter these changes, analogical changes took place. The mobility pattern of prefixed verbs was extended to unprefixed verbs. The final accent of nouns with two syllables before the ending (resulting from Proto-VDL) was extended to nouns with one syllable before the ending, e.g. regular *''su\u1dc5Hnumos'' \u2192 analogical ''*suHnumo\u030ds'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*s\u016b\u02c0num\u00e1s'' based on regular ''*golHwinomo\u030ds''.\n\n====Kortlandt====\n[[Frederik Kortlandt|Kortlandt]] proposes three changes that created new mobility:<ref>{{citation|last=Kortlandt|first=Frederik|year=2002|title=From Proto-Indo-European to Slavic|page=4|url=https://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf}}</ref>\n# Pedersen's law: The accent was retracted from medial syllables in stems that remained \"mobile\", i.e. in hysterokonetic and amphikinetic consonant stems, in which the accent sometimes fell on the suffix and sometimes on the ending.

Thus, acc. sg. {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*suHn\u00fas|*suHn\u00fam}} > ''*s\u00faHnum'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*s\u016b\u0301\u02c0nun''.\n# Oxytonesis: The accent shifted from a medial syllable to the end of the word in paradigms with end-accented forms. This shifted the accent to the last syllable of multisyllabic endings.\n\n====Olander====\n[[Thomas Olander|Olander]]'s \u201cmobility law\u201d<ref>{{citation|last=Olander|first=Thomas|year=2009|title=Balto-Slavic accentual mobility|pages=155\u2013156}}</ref> presupposes some conditions, namely:\n* Accented short vowels had one mora, which was accented.\n* Accented long vowels (whether inherited or from laryngeals) had two moras, with accent on the first.\n* Accented hiatal long vowels (i.e. V\u0301HV) had two moras, with accent on the second.\nThe mobility law itself then states that the accent was deleted if it fell on the last mora of a word, and the word became inherently unaccented. Such words appeared with a default accent on the leftmost mora of the word.\n\n====Moscow accentological school====\n{{also|Proto-Indo-European accent#Valence theory}}\nThe [[Moscow accentological school]] considers the Proto-Balto-Slavic mobile accent paradigm to be a direct reflex of recessive [[Proto-Indo-European]] platforms. Whereas in the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] and [[Proto-Hellenic|Hellenic]] in a recessive platforms, there was a shift of accent to the right, thus moving from the paradigmatic of the accent system to the categorical of the accent system:<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2014|pp=18-86}}</ref>\n*  ''Proto-Indo-European'' *m\u00e9d\u02b0<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-u<sub>(\u2212)</sub> > (metatony a\u0441ut\u0435 \u21d2 circumflex) ''Proto-Balto-Slavic'' *med<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-\u00fas<sub>(\u00b1)</sub>; ''Proto-Hellenic'' *m\u00e9t\u02b0<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-u<sub>(\u2212)</sub>, ''Proto-Indo-Iranian'' *m\u00e1d\u02b0<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-u<sub>(\u2212)</sub>.\n*  ''Proto-Indo-European'' *d\u00e9yw<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-o<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-s<sub>(+)</sub> (metatony a\u0441ut\u0435 \u21d2 circumflex) > ''Proto-Balto-Slavic'' *deiw<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-\u00e1s<sub>(\u00b1)</sub>, ''Proto-Indo-Iranian'' *dayw<sub>(\u2212)</sub>-\u00e1s<sub>(\u00b1)</sub>.\n\n===Hirt's law===\n{{main|Hirt's law}}\nHirt's law caused the accent to retract to the previous syllable if the vowel in the preceding syllable was immediately followed by a laryngeal. It took place before the addition of epenthetic vowels before syllabic sonorants, so at the time of the change, syllabic sonorants still acted as a vocalic nucleus like the true vowels and could attract the accent as well.\n\nHirt's law took place after the creation of new accentual mobility, and served to modify it. Where endings of mobile-accented words had multiple syllables, it could shift the accent from the final syllable onto the preceding one, thus creating the non-final accent of Slavic ''*-\u00ecti'' (infinitive) and ''*-\u00e0x\u044a'' (locative plural). If the accent was shifted from the ending of a mobile-accent word onto the stem, the word was usually converted to a fixed-accent pattern:\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*duHm\u00f3s'' \"smoke\" > (by Hirt's law, then conversion to fixed accent) ''*d\u00faHmos'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*d\u016b\u0301\u02c0mas'' > Lithuanian ''d\u016b\u0301mai'' (AP 1), Late Common Slavic ''*d\u1ef3m\u044a'' (AP a)\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*griHw\u00e1H'' \"?\" > (by Hirt's law, then conversion to fixed accent) ''*gr\u00edHwaH'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*gr\u012b\u0301\u02c0w\u0101\u02c0'' > Latvian ''gr\u0129va'', Late Common Slavic ''*gr\u00ecva'' (AP a)\nHowever, in some cases, Hirt's law does not appear to have taken place where it would be expected, and the words remain mobile-accented:\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*suHn\u00fas'' \"son\" > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*s\u016b\u02c0n\u00fas'' > Lithuanian ''s\u016bn\u00f9s'' (AP 3), Late Common Slavic ''*sy\u0311n\u044a'' (AP c)\n* Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*giHw\u00f3s'' \"alive\" > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*g\u012b\u02c0w\u00e1s'' > Lithuanian ''g\u00fdvas'' (AP 3), Late Common Slavic ''*\u017e\u020bv\u044a'' (AP c)\n\n===Syllabic sonorants===\nThe Proto-Indo-European syllabic sonorants ''*l\u0325'', ''*r\u0325'', ''*m\u0325'' and ''*n\u0325'' (abbreviated ''*R\u0325'') developed a prothetic vowel in front of them, converting them into \"sonorant diphthongs\". This change occurred after Hirt's law, which operated on original syllabic sonorants but not on sonorant diphthongs.\n\nBoth ''*i'' and ''*u'' appear as prothetic vowels, yielding reflexes ''*im'', ''*in'', ''*ir'', ''*il'' (''*iR'') and ''*um'', ''*un'', ''*ur'', ''*ul'' (''*uR''). It has remained an unsolved problem to this day as to the exact phonological conditions that trigger which reflex. Regardless, analysis of their distribution has shown that ''*i'' appears much more often, suggesting that it is the default reflex, with ''*u'' appearing only in special cases. In a sample of 215 Balto-Slavic lexical items, 36 (17%) are attested only with ''*uR'' reflexes, 22 (10%) with both reflexes in the same language or branch or with one in Slavic and the other in Baltic, and the remaining 157 (73%) are attested only with ''*iR'' reflex.{{sfn|Andersen|2003|p=60}}\n\nSeveral theories have been proposed, the most notable being the one by [[Andr\u00e9 Vaillant]] from 1950.<ref>Vaillant, Andr\u00e9, \"Grammaire compar\u00e9e des langues slaves. Tome I, Phon\u00e9tique\", IAC, Lyon 1950, p. 171</ref> According to him, ''*u'' arose after PIE labiovelars. If true, it would be the only trace of PIE labiovelars in Balto-Slavic.\n\nAfter surveying [[Reinhold Trautmann]]'s 1924 Balto-Slavic dictionary, [[Jerzy Kury\u0142owicz]] in 1956 found no phonologically consistent distribution for the dual reflexes except in a single position: after PIE palatovelars Baltic and Slavic have only ''*iR'' reflex.<ref>c, Jerzy, 1956. \"L'apophonie en indo-europe\u00e9e\". Wroc\u0142aw: Ossolineum. Pages 227\u2013242.</ref>\n\n[[George Shevelov]] in 1965 inspected Slavic data in much detail, but in the end, he demonstrated only that the\ndistribution of the dual reflexes in Slavic is not reducible to phonological conditioning.<ref>Shevelov, George  Y. 1965. ''A  Prehistory  of  Slavic. The Historical Phonology  of  Common Slavic''. New York: Columbia University Press. Pages 86\u201391.</ref>\n\nAccording to an analysis by [[Christian Stang]] in 1966 Kury\u0142owicz's statistics proved only that ''*iR'' reflexes are much more frequent than ''*uR'' reflexes.{{sfn|Stang|1966|p=79}} Stang made several important observations:\n* Balto-Slavic grammatical morphemes have ''*iR'' reflexes, but no ''*uR'' reflexes\n* ''*iR'' reflexes are productive in ablaut alternations, while ''*uR'' are not\n* many words containing ''*uR'' diphthongs have an expressive meaning,{{sfn|Stang|1966|p=79-80}} meaning (i) \"fat\", \"dumb\", \"lazy\", \"clumsy\",  (ii) \"crooked, bent\",  (iii)  \"crippled, decrepit\", (iv) \"dark\",  \"dirty\",  or (v) they are of onomatopoeic origin. Such words could have been innovated at various times during the prehistory and have no relation to the Balto-Slavic reflexes of PIE ''*R\u0325''. Such ''u'' + sonorant combinations reflect a [[Sound symbolism|universal semantic category]];{{sfn|Andersen|2003|p=62}} compare English ''plump'', ''dumb'', ''bungle'', ''bulky'', ''clumsy'', ''glum'', ''dumpy'' etc.; German ''dumm'', ''dumpf'', ''stumm'', ''stumpf'', ''plump'' etc.\n\nStang's analysis indicates that ''*iR'' was the regular result of the diphthongization of PIE syllabic sonorants. Doublets with expressive meaning are then explained as expressively motivated ''*uR'' replacements of the original ''*iR'' reflex, or as borrowings from substratum dialects (such as Germanic) that regularly had the ''*R\u0325'' > ''*uR'' reflex, when (pre-)Balto-Slavic no longer had syllabic sonorants and were then used side by side with the original reflex.\n\nAccording to J\u0101nis Endzel\u012bns and Reinhold Trautmann ''*uR'' reflex resulted in zero-grade of morphemes that had PIE ''*o'' (> Balto-Slavic ''*a'') in normal grade.{{Clarify|date=November 2019}}\n\nMatasovi\u0107, in 2008,{{sfn|Matasovi\u0107|2008|p=111}} proposed the following rules:\n# At first, syllabic sonorants develop a prothetic schwa: ''*R\u0325'' > ''*\u0259R''.\n# ''*\u0259'' > ''*i'' in a final syllable.\n# ''*\u0259'' > ''*u'' after velars and before nasals.\n# ''*\u0259'' > ''*i'' otherwise.\n\n===Laryngeals and the acute===\nAccording to the traditional school, laryngeals disappeared as independent phonemes. Some linguists of the Leiden school, in particular Derksen and Kortlandt, reconstruct a glottal or laryngeal consonant for Proto-Balto-Slavic, as a direct reflex of original laryngeals. The remainder of this section thus only applies if one does not follow that idea.\n\nLike in almost all Indo-European branches, laryngeals in the syllable onset were lost, as were all word-initial laryngeals. Laryngeals between consonants disappeared as well, but in the first syllable, they are reflected as ''*a''. Compare:\n* PIE {{PIE|''*h\u2081rh\u0325\u2083d\u00e9h\u2082''}} \"heron, stork\" (Ancient Greek ''er\u014ddi\u00f3s'', Latin ''[[wikt:ardea#Latin|ardea]]'') > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*rad\u0101\u02c0'' > Slavic ''*roda'' (Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:roda#Serbo-Croatian|r\u00f3da]]'').\n* PIE {{PIE|''*sh\u0325\u2082l-''}} (oblique case stem of {{PIE|''*seh\u2082ls''}} \"salt\") > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*salis'' > Old Prussian ''sal'', Slavic ''*sol\u044c'' (OCS ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c#Old Church Slavonic|sol\u044c]]'', Polish ''[[wikt:s\u00f3l#Polish|s\u00f3l]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c#Russian|sol\u02b9]]'').\n\nOther laryngeals were lost in Proto-Balto-Slavic, but in some cases, the syllable was acuted as a \"leftover\" of the former laryngeal. The following outcomes can be noted, with H standing for a laryngeal, V for a vowel, R for a sonorant and C for any consonant:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Ronald|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|chapter=The phonology of Balto-Slavic|date=2018|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Boston|page=1982}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In other cases, the outcome is a long non-acute vowel.\n\nThe outcome of long vowels inherited directly from Proto-Indo-European, not lengthened by a laryngeal, is disputed. Traditional opinion holds that the acute is an automatic reflex of vowel length, and therefore all long vowels were automatically acuted, whether original or resulting from a following laryngeal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Ronald|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|chapter=The phonology of Balto-Slavic|date=2018|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Boston|page=1981}}</ref> Absolutely word-final long vowels of PIE origin were not acuted, but remained distinct from long vowels resulting from laryngeals, a distinction also found in [[Proto-Germanic]] \"overlong\" vowels. Kortlandt instead takes the position that the acute reflects laryngeals only; thus inherited long vowels do not trigger the acute. Regardless, the acute appears in all cases of vowel lengthening within Balto-Slavic. All long vowels that arose as part of word formations or sound changes within the Balto-Slavic period received the acute. This included the new alternations ''*u'' ~ ''*\u016b'' and ''*i'' ~ ''*\u012b'' that were innovated within Balto-Slavic.\n\nAside from acuteness, syllabic sonorants followed by laryngeals show the same outcome as syllabic sonorants in other environments. Balto-Slavic shares that characteristic with Germanic but no other Indo-European languages, which show clearly distinct reflexes in this case. Compare:\n* PIE ''*pl\u0325h\u2081n\u00f3s'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*p\u00edl\u02c0nas'' (Slavic ''*p\u044cln\u044a'', Lithuanian ''p\u00eclnas''), and Proto-Germanic ''*fullaz'' (< earlier ''*fulnaz'', with regular ''*l\u0325'' > ''*ul''; English ''full''), but Proto-Celtic ''*\u0278l\u0101nos'' (where ''*l\u0325'' > ''al'' normally).\n\n===Winter's law===\n{{main|Winter's law}}\nWinter's law caused lengthening of vowels if a plain voiced stop followed, and the new long vowels received the acute. According to some analyses, the change occurred only if the stop was in [[syllable coda]] (the syllable ending with that consonant).\n\nThe plain and aspirated stops merged in Balto-Slavic, but Winter's law operated before this merger had taken place. Consequently, the distinction between those two series has been indirectly preserved in Proto-Balto-Slavic by long acuted vowels. Furthermore, Winter's law took place before ''*o'' and ''*a'' merged, as it lengthened earlier ''*o'' to ''*\u014d\u02c0'' and ''*a'' to ''\u0101\u02c0''.\n\nOn the basis of relative chronology of sound changes, it has been ascertained that Winter's law acted rather late, after some other less prominent Balto-Slavic changes had occurred such as after the disappearance of laryngeals in prevocalic position.{{sfn|Matasovi\u0107|2008|p=83}} Compare:\n* PIE {{PIE|''*e\u01f5h\u2082\u00f3m''}} > Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*e\u017aHom'' > (Winter's law) ''*\u0113\u02c0\u017aHom'' > Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u0113\u02c0\u017aun'' > Common Slavic ''*(j)az\u044a\u0301'' > [[Old Church Slavonic|OCS]] ''[[wikt:\u0430\u0437\u044a#Old Church Slavonic|az\u044a]]'', Slovene ''[[wikt:jaz#Slovene|jaz]]''.\n\nThe rules governing the emergence of the acute from voiced stops seem complicated when they are formulated within the framework of \"classical\" Proto-Indo-European [[laryngeal theory]], as there is no obvious connection between laryngeals and voiced stops, both of which trigger the acute. [[Frederik Kortlandt]] has proposed an alternative, more elegant and economic rule for the derivation of Balto-Slavic acute by using the [[glottalic theory]] framework of Proto-Indo-European. He proposed that the acute is a reflex of a [[glottal stop]], which has two sources, the merger of PIE laryngeals and the dissolution of PIE pre-glottalized stop (\"voiced stops\" in traditional reconstruction) to glottal stop and voiced stop, according to the Winter's law.\n\nThough elegant, Kortlandt's theory also has some problems. The glottalic theory, which was proposed in the 1970s, is not generally accepted among linguists, and today only a small minority of linguists would consider it a reliable and self-supportive framework onto which to base modern Indo-European research. Also, there is a number of Balto-Slavic lexemes with the acute that are provably not of PIE laryngeal origin, and some of them were a result of apophonical lengthenings occurring only in Balto-Slavic period.\n\n===Nasals===\nWord-finally, ''*m'' became ''*n'' in Balto-Slavic. Final nasals are not directly preserved in most Balto-Slavic languages, however, making evidence mostly indirect. Old Prussian uniquely preserves final ''*-n'', and there is indeed a clear attestation of the change in the nominative-accusative of neuters, such as ''[[wikt:assaran#Old Prussian|assaran]]'' \"lake\" < Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u00e9\u017aeran''/''*\u00e1\u017aeran'' < PIE {{PIE|''*e\u01f5\u02b0erom''}}. In the other Baltic languages, no final nasals are retained. Lithuanian has vowel lengthening that reflects earlier nasal vowels, but they could conceivably come from either final ''-n'' or ''-m'' and thus do not provide evidence either way. In Slavic, all word-final consonants are lost in one way or another so there is no direct evidence there either.\n\nHowever, there is indirect evidence in the form of [[sandhi]] effects that were preserved in some Slavic pronouns. For example, Old Church Slavonic attests constructions like ''s\u044a nim\u044c'' \"with him\", which can be traced back to Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*\u015bun eimi\u0161'' where the first word reflects the common Proto-Indo-European preposition ''*\u1e31om'' \"with\" (compare Latin ''cum''), and the second reflects the PIE pronominal stem ''*ey-'' (Latin ''is'', German ''er''). In Slavic, in accordance with the \"[[Law of Open Syllables]]\", the final ''-n'' of the preposition was reinterpreted as belonging to the pronoun, which acted to preserve the nasal in its Balto-Slavic form, thus corroborating that it was indeed ''-n'': If the change of ''*-m'' to ''*-n'' had not taken place at an earlier stage, the phrase would have been ''*\u015bu'''m''' eimi\u0161'', which would have given ''*s\u044a '''m'''im\u044c'' in OCS instead.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe following changes to vowels in Proto-Balto-Slavic can be noted:\n\n* Long vowels are shortened before word-final ''*-n''. Thus, the \u0101-stem accusative singular, originally ''*-\u0101\u02c0m'', was shortened to ''*-an'': Lithuanian ''-\u0105'', Old Prussian ''-an'', Slavic ''*-\u01eb''. If the genitive plural ending was originally ''*-\u014dm'', it was shortened to ''*-on'' by this change.\n* Word-final ''*-os'' and ''*-on'' are raised to ''*-us'' and ''*-un'' when stressed, e.g. ''*e\u01f5h\u2082\u00f3m'' > Balto-Slavic ''*\u0113\u02c0\u017aun'' > Slavic ''*\u00e3z\u044a''. This causes a split in the o-stem paradigm, which is levelled in various ways later on. In Baltic, the nominals with original ending stress are transferred to the u-stem inflection. In Slavic, masculines of the two types are conflated and merge almost completely in most modern languages.\n* Word-final ''*-mi'' is reduced to ''*-n'' after a long vowel. This change occurred after the shortening, so that the vowel remained long and, if applicable, acuted. For example, the \u0101-stem instrumental singular ending ''*-\u0101mi'' was reduced to ''*-\u0101n'' > Lithuanian ''-\u00e0'', Slavic ''*-\u01eb'' (compared to the o-stem ending ''*-ami'' > Slavic ''*-om\u044c'').\n* ''*o'' > ''*a''\n* ''*un'' is lengthened to ''*\u016b\u02c0n'' (with acute) when a stop followed.{{clarify|reason=What about -\u016bns in the o-stem accusative plural?|date=November 2016}} In Slavic, it is reflected as ''*y'', with no nasal. For example: PIE ''*Hunk-'' \"to get used to\" > Balto-Slavic ''*\u016b\u02c0nktei'' > Lithuanian ''j\u00f9nkti'', Latvian ''j\u00fbkt'', OCS ''vykn\u01ebti'', Upper Sorbian ''wukny\u0107''. ''*in'' did not exhibit lengthening in such conditions, as older literature often states.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2008|pp=109}}</ref>\n\n==Morphology==\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained many of the grammatical features present in Proto-Indo-European.\n\n===Nominals===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\n====Grammatical categories====\nProto-Balto-Slavic made use of seven [[Grammatical case|cases]]:\n* [[Nominative case|Nominative]] - subject\n* [[Accusative case|Accusative]] - direct object\n* [[Genitive case|Genitive]] - possession, relation or association; direct object of negated verb\n* [[Locative case|Locative]] - stationary location\n* [[Dative case|Dative]] - indirect object\n* [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]] - tool, means by which, accompanying\n* [[Vocative case|Vocative]] - direct address\nThe eighth Proto-Indo-European case, the [[Ablative case|ablative]], had merged with the genitive case. Some of the inflectional endings for the genitive were replaced with those of the former ablative.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic also distinguished three [[Grammatical number|numbers]]:\n* singular (for one item)\n* dual (for two items)\n* plural (for three or more items)\nThe dual was retained into the early Slavic languages, but most modern Slavic languages have lost it. [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Chakavian]] (a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]]), and [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] are the only remaining Slavic languages that still make consistent use of the dual number. In most other Slavic languages, the dual number is not retained except for historically-paired nouns (eyes, ears, shoulders), certain fixed expressions, and agreement of nouns when used with numbers; it is synchronically often analyzed as genitive singular because of the resemblance in forms. The Baltic languages also used to have a dual number system, but it has become practically obsolete in modern Latvian and Lithuanian.\n\nFinally, Proto-Balto-Slavic nouns could also have one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Many originally neuter nouns in PIE had become masculine in Balto-Slavic so the group was somewhat reduced relative to the others. The modern Slavic languages largely continue the use of three grammatical genders, but modern Baltic languages have merged the neuter gender into the masculine. Lithuanian has no neuter-gender nouns, but in pronouns, participles and numerals, the neuter is retained. Latvian has no neuter gender at all.\n\nAn innovation within Balto-Slavic was the use of the genitive in place of the accusative for the direct object of a negative verb.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Matasovi\u0107|2008|pp=56\u201357}} ''\"Navedimo najva\u017enije baltoslavenske izoglose...Upotreba genitiva za izricanje objekta zanijekanog glagola\"''</ref> That feature is still present in its descendants:\n* \"I have read the book\": Russian ''{{lang|ru|(\u044f) \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0301\u043b \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0433'''\u0443'''}}'' (''(ja) \u010dit\u00e1l kn\u00edg'''u'''''), Slovene ''{{lang|sl|s\u00e8m br\u00e1l knj\u00edg'''o'''}}'', Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|kn\u1ef9g'''\u0105''' skai\u010diau}}''\n* \"I have not read the book\": Russian ''{{lang|ru|(\u044f) \u043d\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0301\u043b \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0433'''\u0438'''}}'' (''(ja) ne \u010dit\u00e1l kn\u00edg'''i'''''), Slovene ''{{lang|sl|n\u00edsem br\u00e1l knj\u00edg'''e'''}}'', Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|kn\u1ef9g'''os''' neskai\u010diau}}''\n\n====Nouns====\n{{empty section|date=May 2019}}\n\n====Adjectives====\nA Balto-Slavic innovation to the inflection of adjectives was the creation of a distinct \"definite\" inflection of adjectives by affixing forms of the pronoun ''*ja-'' to existing adjective forms. The inflection had a function resembling that of the definite article 'the' in English: Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|ger\u00e0sis}}'', Old Church Slavonic ''{{lang|cu|\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\ua651\u0438}}'' \"the good\" vs. ''{{lang|lt|g\u1ebdras}}'', ''{{lang|cu|\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044a}}'' \"good\". The distinction is no longer productive in most Slavic languages today, and most Slavic languages preserve a mixture of definite forms and indefinite forms in a single paradigm.\n\nRussian, Czech and Polish for example use the original definite nominative singular forms (Russian ''-\u044b\u0439, -\u0430\u044f, -\u043e\u0435'' (''-yj, -aja, -oje''), Polish ''-y, -a, -e'', Czech ''-\u00fd, -\u00e1, -\u00e9''). Czech and Polish have lost the indefinite forms except in a few limited uses, while Russian preserves the indefinite nominative forms as the so-called \"short forms\", used in some cases in [[predicative expression|predicate]] position. Serbo-Croatian and Slovene still distinguish the two types but only in the masculine nominative singular (definite ''-i'' versus indefinite with no ending). Bulgarian and Macedonian have innovated completely new forms, affixing forms of the demonstrative pronoun ''*t-'' instead.\n\n===Verbs===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\nThe distinction between athematic and thematic verbs was preserved, but athematic verbs were gradually reduced in number. The primary first-person singular endings, athematic ''*-mi'' and thematic ''*-oh\u2082'', were kept distinct, giving Balto-Slavic ''*-mi'' and ''*-\u014d\u02c0'' respectively. The thematic ending was occasionally extended by adding the athematic ending to it, apparently in Balto-Slavic times, resulting in a third ending: ''*-\u014d\u02c0mi'' > ''*-\u014d\u02c0m'' > ''*-\u014d\u02c0n'' > ''*-an'', replacing the original ending in Slavic, reflected as ''*-\u01eb'' (Russian ''-\u0443'' (''-u''), Polish ''-\u0119'', Bulgarian ''-a'').\n\nIn many Slavic languages, particularly South and West Slavic, the athematic ending was analogically extended to other verbs and even replaced the thematic ending completely in some languages (Slovene, Serbo-Croatian). In the Baltic languages, only the thematic ending was retained, as Lithuanian ''-\u00f9'' and Latvian ''-u'' (< East Baltic ''*-uo\u02c0'' < Balto-Slavic ''*-\u014d\u02c0''). In Latvian, the first-person singular form of ''b\u016bt'' \"to be\" is ''esmu'', which preserves the original ''*-m-'' of the athematic ending, but it was extended with the thematic ending.\n\nBalto-Slavic replaced the PIE second-person singular ending ''*-si'' with ''*-seHi'' > ''*-sei'' for which the origin is not fully understood. According to Kortlandt, the ending is a combination of the ending ''*-si'' with ''*-eHi'', which he considers to be the original thematic ending.<ref>Kortlandt(1979:58)</ref> The new ending, ''*-sei'', carried over into all three branches of Balto-Slavic and came to be used in all athematic root verbs in Baltic. In Old Church Slavonic, it completely ousted the older ending. In the other Slavic languages, the original ending generally survives except in the athematic verbs.\n\nThe aspectual distinction between present and aorist was retained and still productive in Proto-Balto-Slavic. It was preserved into early Slavic but was gradually replaced with an innovated aspectual distinction, with a variety of forms. Modern Bulgarian retained the aorist, however, alongside the innovated system, producing a four-way contrast. The Indo-European perfect/stative was falling out of use in Proto-Balto-Slavic and was likely already reduced to relics by Proto-Balto-Slavic times. It survives in Slavic only in the irregular Old Church Slavonic form ''v\u011bd\u011b'' \"I know\" (< Balto-Slavic ''*waidai'' < PIE ''*w\u00f3yde'', from ''*weyd-'' \"to see\"), which preserves an irregular first-person singular ending, presumed to originate in the perfect.\n\nProto-Indo-European did not originally have an [[infinitive]], but it did have several constructions that served as action nouns. Two of these, the ''-tis'' and ''-tus'' nouns, remained in use into Balto-Slavic and acquired verbal noun and infinitive-like functions. They were not fully integrated into the verb system by Balto-Slavic times, however, and the individual Balto-Slavic languages diverge on the details. In Slavic and the Eastern Baltic languages, the infinitive was formed from a case form of the ''-tis'' noun: Lithuanian ''-ti'', Latvian ''-t'', Proto-Slavic ''*-ti''. Old Prussian, however, has ''-t'' and ''-twei'' as infinitive endings, the latter of which comes from the ''-tus'' noun instead. The shorter ''-t'' could come from either type.\n\n===Accentual system===\n\nThe [[Proto-Indo-European accent]] was completely reworked in Balto-Slavic, with far-reaching consequences for accentual systems of the modern daughter languages. The development was conditioned by several delicate factors, such as the syllable length, presence of a laryngeal closing the syllable, and the position of PIE ictus. There is still no consensus among Balto-Slavists on the precise details of the development of Balto-Slavic accentual system. All modern research is based on the seminal study of Stang (1957), which basically instituted the field of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology. However, many laws and correspondences have been discovered and are now held to be true by the majority of researchers even if the exact details sometimes remain in dispute.\n\nEarly Balto-Slavic retained a simple accent in which only the placement of the accent was distinctive, but there were no pitch distinctions. The acute register was initially no more than an articulatory feature on certain syllables and could occur independently of accent placement. However, the acute was the trigger for several sound changes that affected the placement of the accent. For example, under [[Hirt's law]], the accent tended to shift leftwards onto a syllable that bore the acute.\n\nOn accented syllables, the acute came to be accompanied by a distinct pitch contour in late Proto-Balto-Slavic. Consequently, accented syllables of any type that could carry the acute register in Proto-Balto-Slavic (listed above) now differed in pitch contour as well as articulation; they had rising or falling pitch (whether accented acute syllables had rising or falling pitch differed by dialect). The tonal accents that emerged from this process are called \"acute accent\" and \"circumflex accent\" in Balto-Slavic linguistics.\n\nSyllables with a single short vowel could not bear the acute register and so also had no tonal distinctions. When accented, they had the same pitch contour (though nondistinctive) as a circumflex-accented syllable. The syllables are said to have \"short accent\".\n\nTo reconstruct the Balto-Slavic accent, the most important are those languages that have retained tonal oppositions: Lithuanian, Latvian, (probably) Old Prussian and the West South Slavic languages of Slovene and Serbo-Croatian. However, one should keep in mind that the prosodical systems of dialects in the aforementioned languages are sometimes very different from those of [[standard language]]s. For example, some Croatian dialects like [[\u010cakavian]] and Posavian dialects of [[Slavonia]]n \u0160tokavian are especially important for Balto-Slavic accentology, as they retain more archaic and complex tonal accentual system than the Neo\u0161tokavian dialect on which modern [[standard language|standard]] varieties of Serbo-Croatian ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) are based. On the other hand, many dialects have completely lost tonal oppositions (such as some [[Kajkavian]] varieties, the Zagreb spoken nonstandard idiom).\n\nA minority view, originating from [[Vladimir Dybo]], considers Balto-Slavic accentuation (based on correspondences in the Germanic, Celtic, and Italic languages) more archaic than Greek-Vedic and therefore closer to Proto-Indo-European.<ref>cf. Dybo, Nikolajev & Starostin:1978, Nikolaev:1989, Dybo 2007:47-50</ref>\n\n====Notation====\nWhat follows is a short overview of the commonly used diacritical marks for Balto-Slavic (BSl.) accents and/or prosodic features, all based on the example letter ''a''. In each case, there is a crude characterization of the pronunciation in terms of High, Mid, and Low-tone sequences.\n\n* Lithuanian: \"falling\"/HL (acute) ''\u00e1'', \"rising\"/H(L)H (circumflex) ''\u00e3'', \"short\"/H ''\u00e0''\n* Latvian (on ''all'' syllables): \"falling\"/HL ''\u00e0'', \"rising\"/LH (or \"lengthened\") ''\u00e3'', \"broken\"/L'H ''\u00e2''\n* Slovenian: \"falling\"/HL ''\u0203'', \"rising\"/LH ''\u00e1'', \"short\"/H ''\u0201''\n* Serbo-Croatian:<ref>All examples given for Serbo-Croatian are based on the standard language, stylised Neo\u0161tokavian dialect; they are accented according to the ''Rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga jezika'', F. Broz and I. Ivekovi\u0107, Zagreb 1901 and ''Akademijin Rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'', XXIII volumes, 1880\u20131976</ref> \"short falling\"/HL ''\u0201'', \"long falling\"/HML ''\u0203'', \"short rising\"/LH ''\u00e0'', \"long rising\"/LMH ''\u00e1'', \"posttonic length\" ''\u0101''\n* Common Slavic: \"short falling\"/HL (short circumflex) ''\u0201'', \"long falling\"/HML (long circumflex) ''\u0203'', \"acute\"/LH (old acute, old rising\") ''a\u030b'', \"neoacute\"/L(M)H (old acute, old rising\") ''\u00e1'' or ''\u00e3''\n\nIn Croatian dialects, especially \u010cakavian and Posavian, the \"neoacute\" (\"new acute\", a new rising tone) is usually marked with tilde, as ''\u00e3''. Short neoacute (\"short new rising\") is marked as ''\u00e0''. Neoacutes represent a post\u2013Proto-Slavic development.\n\nHere is a reverse key to help decode the various diacritical marks:\n\n* [[acute accent]] (''\u00e1''): Usually long rising and/or BSl. acute. Neoacute in some Slavic reconstructions. The default accent when a language has only one phonemic prosodic feature (such as stress in Russian, length in Czech). Marks long falling in Lithuanian because this derives from BSl. acute.\n* [[grave accent]] (''\u00e0''): Usually short rising or simply short.\n* [[circumflex accent]] (''\u00e2''): BSl. circumflex in reconstructions. Broken tone in modern Baltic (Latvian and [[\u017demaitian]] Lithuanian), a vowel with a glottal stop in the middle (derives from BSl. acute). Long falling in modern Slavic languages.\n* [[tilde]] (''\u00e3''): Alternative notation for BSl. circumflex in reconstructions. Long rising in various modern languages (Lithuanian, Latvian, archaic Serbo-Croatian dialects such as [[Chakavian]]). Derives from diverse sources: Lithuanian < BSl. circumflex, Latvian < BSl. acute, Serbo-Croatian dialects < long Common Slavic neoacute (from accentual retraction).\n* [[double grave accent]] (''\u0201''): Usually short falling (mostly in Slavic). Derived from circumflex (= long falling) by converting the \"acute\" portion of the accent to a grave, much as a simple acute (= long rising) is shortened by conversion to a grave.\n* [[double acute accent]] (''a\u030b''): Old acute in some Slavic reconstructions. (As opposed to a single acute for Slavic neoacute in reconstructions. Based on the fact that the old acute was shortened in Common Slavic.)\n* [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''\u0101''): Vowel length, particularly in syllables without tone (such as unstressed syllables in Slavic).\n* [[breve]] (''\u0103''): Vowel shortness.\n\nThere are multiple competing systems used for different languages and different periods. The most important are these:\n# Three-way system of Proto-Slavic, Proto-Balto-Slavic, modern Lithuanian: acute tone (''\u00e1'') vs. circumflex tone (''\u00e2'' or ''\u00e3'') vs. short accent (''\u00e0'').\n# Four-way Serbo-Croatian system, also used in Slovenian and often in Slavic reconstructions: long rising (''\u00e1''), short rising (''\u00e0''), long falling (''\u00e2''), short falling (''\u0201'').\n# Two-way length: long (''\u0101'') vs. short (''\u0103'').\n# Length only, as in Czech and Slovak: long (''\u00e1'') vs. short (''a'').\n# Stress only, as in Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian: stressed (''\u00e1'') vs. unstressed (''a'').\n\nMany nonprosodic marks are also found in various languages in combinations with certain letters. The various combinations of letter and diacritic should normally be viewed as single symbols (i.e. as equivalent to such simple symbols as ''a, b, c ...'').\n\nExamples on vowels:\n* [[ogonek]] (''\u0105''): With a rightward-curving hook unlike the leftward-curving [[cedilla]] (''\u00e7''): Vowel [[nasalization]]. In Standard Lithuanian, the nasalization is historical and the vowels are now simply reflected as long vowels, but some dialects still preserve nasalized vowels. Occasionally used to indicate [[low-mid]] quality in ''e, o''.\n* [[overdot]] (''\u0117 \u022f''), [[underdot]] (''\u1eb9 \u1ecd''): [[High-mid]] vowel quality {{IPA|[e o]}}, distinguished from plain ''e o'' indicating [[low-mid]] vowels {{IPA|[\u025b \u0254]}}. The overdot is normally found in Lithuanian, the underdot in Slovenian.\n* [[inverted breve]] below (''e\u032f i\u032f o\u032f u\u032f''), indicating nonsyllabic vowels (often, it is the second part of a diphthong).\n* [[h\u00e1\u010dek]] (''\u011b''): With a pointed ''v'' shape, rather than the rounded ''u'' shape of the [[breve]]: ''\u011b'', in Slavic reconstructions, is a vowel known as [[yat]], distinct in length and later quality from simple ''e'' (originally longer and lower; later, longer and higher in many dialects), but ''\u011b'', in Czech, sometimes indicates instead a simple ''e'', with palatalization of the preceding consonant (''d\u011b'' ''t\u011b'' ''n\u011b'').\n* ''\u00f4, \u00f3, \u016f'' originally indicated a [[high-mid]] {{IPA|[o]}} or diphthongized {{IPA|[uo]}} in various Slavic languages (respectively: Slovak/dialectal Russian; Polish/[[Upper Sorbian]]/[[Lower Sorbian]]; Czech). It now indicates {{IPA|[u]}} in Polish and long {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} in Czech.\n\nExamples in consonants:\n* Most diacritics on consonants indicate various sorts of palatal sounds such as an [[acute accent]] (''\u0107 \u01f5 \u1e31 \u013a \u0144 \u0155 \u015b \u017a''), a [[comma]] (''\u0123 \u0137 \u013c \u0146''), a [[ha\u010dek]] (''\u010d \u010f \u013e \u0148 \u0159 \u0161 \u0165 \u017e'') or an [[overbar]] (''\u0111''). They can indicate three:\n**[[palatoalveolar]]s (''\u010d \u0161 \u017e''): They have a \"hushing\" pronunciation {{IPA|[t\u0283 \u0283 \u0292]}}, as in English ''kitchen, mission, vision'' and are less palatal than the sounds indicated by ''\u0107 \u015b \u017a'';\n**[[alveolopalatal]]s (''\u0107 \u0111 \u015b \u017a'', as in Polish and Serbo-Croatian);\n**[[palatal stop]]s (voiceless ''\u1e31/\u0137/\u0165'' and voiced ''\u01f5/\u0123/\u010f\" in Macedonian, Latvian and Czech, respectively);\n**a [[palatal nasal]] (''\u0144 \u0146 \u0148'');\n**a [[palatal lateral]] (''\u013a \u013c \u013e''); or\n**a palatalized trill (''\u0155'', also ''\u0159'' in Czech specifically for a [[fricative trill]]).\n* In Slovak,'' \u013a'' and ''\u0155'' indicate doubled rather than palatal(ized) consonants (v\u0155ba=willow, h\u013abka=depth).\n* In western West Slavic (Polish, Kashubian, [[Upper Sorbian]] and [[Lower Sorbian]]), ''\u017c'' indicates a [[voiced retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0290]}}. (Other such sibilants are indicated by digraphs like ''cz'', ''sz''.)\n* In western West Slavic, ''\u0142'' indicates a sound that was once a dark (velarized) ''l'' but is now usually pronounced [w].\n\n====Accent paradigms==== <!--LINKED FROM REDIRECTS [[Mobile paradigm]] and [[Fixed paradigm]]-->\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n{{missing information|section|verb accent paradigms|date=April 2014}}\nProto-Balto-Slavic, just like Proto-Indo-European, had a class of nominals with so called \"mobile\" accentuation in which accent alternated between the word stem and the ending. The classes of nominals are usually reconstructed on the basis of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] and [[Ancient Greek]], which have retained the position of the original PIE accent almost unchanged. However, by comparing the Balto-Slavic evidence, it was discovered that the PIE rules on accent alternations, devised on the basis of Vedic and Greek, do not match those found in Balto-Slavic.\n\nMoreover, nominals that belong to mobile paradigms in Balto-Slavic belong to declension classes that always had fixed accent in PIE paradigms: \u0101-stems and o-stems. For a long time, the exact relationships between the accentuation of nominals in Balto-Slavic and PIE was one of the most mysterious questions of Indo-European studies, and some parts of the puzzle are still missing.\n\nResearch conducted by [[Christian Stang]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Vladimir Dybo]] has led to a conclusion that Balto-Slavic nominals, with regard to accentuation, could be reduced to two paradigms: fixed and mobile. Nominals of the fixed paradigm had accent on one of the stem syllables, and in the nominals of the mobile paradigm, the accent alternated between the stem and the ending. As shown by Illi\u010d-Svity\u010d, Balto-Slavic nominals of the fixed paradigm correspond to the PIE nominals with accent on the root (PIE barytones). The only exception were nominals with the accent on the ending (PIE oxytones) when it was shifted onto the root in Balto Slavic in accordance with [[Hirt's law]]; such nominals also have fixed accent in Balto-Slavic.\n\nThe origin of the Balto-Slavic nominals of the mobile paradigm has not been completely determined, with several proposed theories of origin. According to Illi\u010d-Svity\u010d, they originate as an analogical development from fixed-accent PIE oxytones. That theory has been criticized as leaving unclear why PIE nominals with fixed accent on the ending would become mobile, as analogies usually lead to uniformity and regularity. According to [[Antoine Meillet|Meillet]] and [[Christian Schweigaard Stang|Stang]], Balto-Slavic accentual mobility was inherited from PIE consonant and vowel-stems but not for o-stems, where they represent Balto-Slavic innovation. Vedic and Greek lost the accentual mobility in vowel stems, retaining it only in consonant stems. [[Ferdinand de Saussure|De Saussure]] explained it as a result of accent retraction in the medially stressed syllables of consonant-stems exhibiting the hysterokinetic paradigm, with vocalic stems subsequently imitating the new accentual patterns by analogy. According to [[Vladimir Dybo|Dybo]] the position of Balto-Slavic accent is determined by a formula from PIE tones according to the ''valence theory'' developed by the Moscow school, which presupposes [[PIE accent#Modern theories|lexical tone in PIE]]. Kortlandt up to 2006 supported the theory of Balto-Slavic losing PIE consonant-stem accentual mobility in nominals, and innovating everywhere else, but after 2006 maintains that the original PIE accentual mobility was preserved in Balto-Slavic in \u0101-stems (eh\u2082-stems), i-stems, u-stems and consonant-stems.\n\nThe Balto-Slavic accentual system was further reworked during the Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic period ([[Dybo's law]], [[Meillet's law]], [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]], etc.), resulting in three Common Slavic accentual paradigms (conventionally indicated using the letters ''A'', ''B'', ''C''), corresponding to four Lithuanian accentual paradigms (indicated with the numbers ''1'', ''2'', ''3'', ''4'') in a simple scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=2 rowspan=2 |\n| colspan=2 | Acute register on the root\n|-\n| yes\n| no\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | fixed accent\n| yes\n| a.p.&nbsp;1/a.p.

B\n|-\n| no\n| a.p.&nbsp;3/a.p.&nbsp;C\n| a.p.&nbsp;4/a.p.&nbsp;C\n|}\n\n=====Fixed paradigm with acuted root=====\nThe simplest accentuation is that of nominals which were acuted on the root in Balto-Slavic. They remain accented on the root (''root'' here is understood in the Proto-Balto-Slavic, not the PIE sense) throughout the paradigm in Baltic (Lithuanian ''first accentual paradigm'') and Slavic (''accent paradigm a'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n!

An acute-accented liquid diphthong yields accent on the epenthetic vowel; a circumflex-accented one results in accent on the first (original) vowel (''-\u00e1r\u02c0-'' > ''-or\u00f3-'', ''-ar-'' > ''-\u00f3ro-''). Serbo-Croatian and Slovene show metathesis instead.\n* Serbo-Croatian does not reflect the acute as a tonal distinction but shows short falling accent consistently for all words with post-Slavic initial accent regardless of tone. The short falling accent in the genitive plural has been lengthened due to the loss of a [[yer]]. The addition of ''-\u0101'' is a later innovation.\n* Slovene has a rising vowel, which reflects the original acute. All short accented vowels in non-final syllables were lengthened, which eliminated the length distinction in the genitive plural.\n\n=====Fixed paradigm with non-acuted root=====\nIn the nouns with non-mobile initial accent, which did not have an acuted root syllable, both Lithuanian and Slavic had an independent accent shift occur, from the root to the ending.

In the forms that had an acuted ending (nominative, vocative and instrumental singular, accusative plural), the accent shifted onto the ending, in accordance with the rule discovered by de Saussure. Later, that acuted syllable was shortened by Leskien's law.\n* In Slavic, the accent shifted from the root onto the ending in accordance with [[Dybo's law]], regardless of the syllable nature (whether it was acuted in Balto-Slavic or not) so the nouns of the B paradigm are consistently accented on the ending (oxytonic, except in the instrumental plural).\n* In the Neo\u0161tokavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian, which are used as the basis for standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, the so-called \"Neo\u0161tokavian retraction\" occurred: the accent was retracted from the ending onto the root syllable and became rising. Old \u0160tokavian and \u010cakavian dialects preserved the original ending-stressed paradigm.\n* Slovene also has retraction of the accent, which results in a long rising tone.\n\n=====Mobile paradigm=====\nNominals with mobile accent had in some cases an accented first syllable, in others an accented ending.\n\nLithuanian distinguishes two accent paradigms of these nominals, depending on whether the root was acuted, as in the fixed paradigm, or not.\n* If the root was acuted, it is said to belong to ''third accent paradigm''.\n* If the root was not acuted, then, by the operation of de Saussure's law, the accent shifted onto all the acuted endings in the paradigm, and these nouns are accounted as belonging to the ''fourth accent paradigm''.\n\nIn Proto-Slavic, the operation of [[Meillet's law]] converted acute roots to circumflexed in mobile nominals, so that the split found in Lithuanian does not occur.

All non-accented vowels were shortened, and all non-final accented vowels were lengthened.\n\n==Post-Balto-Slavic developments==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\nIn the later Balto-Slavic languages, the acute articulation itself was often lost, leaving only the pitch distinction on accented syllables as the reflex. There, \"acute\" is only a type of pitch accent, rather than a specific articulatory feature. The Slavic languages have no trace of the acute articulation and preserve only tonal distinctions although most have since lost even those, in their development from Proto-Slavic. The East Baltic languages preserve some traces of the original acute articulation, in the form of the so-called \"broken tone\", the is a long vowel with a glottal stop in the middle of it, typically denoted by a circumflex diacritic, not to be confused with the circumflex accent: ''\u00e2'' {{IPA|[a\u02c0a]}}. The broken tone is preserved in syllables in certain dialects of Latvian and Lithuanian. The broken tone can occur on unaccented syllables so it is not actually a tone but a [[register (phonology)|register]] distinction, much like the [[Danish language|Danish]] ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' or the ''ng\u00e3'' tone in Northern [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].\n\nThe short accent was preserved as such in both the Baltic and Slavic languages, but its lengthening could be triggered by certain conditions. For example, in Lithuanian, vowels /a/ and /e/ were lengthened when they initially bore short accent in open syllable, and rising tone emerged, marked with tilde sign ''\u00e3''. Compare:\n* PIE {{PIE|''*k\u02b7\u00e9k\u02b7lo-''}} \"circle, wheel\" > Balto-Slavic ''*k\u00e1kla-'' > Lithuanian ''[[wikt:kaklas#Lithuanian|k\u00e3klas]]'' \"neck\", Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:kolo#Serbo-Croatian|k\u020dlo]]''.\n* PIE {{PIE|''*d\u00e9\u1e31m\u0325t''}} \"ten\" > Balto-Slavic ''*d\u00e9\u015bimt'' > Lithuanian ''[[wikt:de\u0161imt#Lithuanian|d\u1ebd\u0161imt]]'', Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:deset#Serbo-Croatian|d\u0205set]]''.\n\n===Latvian===\nThe most direct continuation of the acute is in Latvian, particularly in the three-tone central dialects. There, the acute register is directly continued as a broken tone (''lauzt\u0101'') in originally unstressed syllables, marked with a circumflex diacritic: ''lu\u00f4gs'' \"window\". In originally-stressed syllables, the acute register is continued as a rising or lengthened intonation (''stiept\u0101''), marked with a [[tilde]]: ''lu\u00f5ks'' \"spring onion\". The circumflex register is generally continued as a falling intonation (''kr\u012bto\u0161\u0101''), marked with a [[grave accent]]:  ''l\u00f9oks'' \"arch, bow\". It can occur on all syllables: [[locative]] plural ''gal\u0302v\u00e2s'' \"on the heads\" (compare: Lithuanian ''galvos\u00e8'' with stress on a short final vowel, deleted in Latvian), including monosyllables: ''d\u00eat'' \"to lay eggs\" < ''*d\u00eat\u00ec''.<ref name=\"derksen12\">Derksen, Rick (2008). ''Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon''. Leiden: Brill. p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lithuanian===\nIn Lithuanian, the distinction between acute and circumflex is not preserved in unstressed syllables. In Standard Lithuanian, based on the [[Auk\u0161taitian dialect]], the acute becomes a falling tone (so-called \"Lithuanian metatony\") and is marked with an [[acute accent]], and the circumflex becomes a rising tone, marked with a [[tilde]]. In diphthongs, the acute accent is placed on the first letter of the diphthong while the tilde marking rising tone (the original circumflex) is placed on the second letter. In diphthongs with a sonorant as a second part, the same convention is used, but the acute accent is replaced with a [[grave accent]]: Lithuanian ''[[wikt:pilnas#Lithuanian|p\u00eclnas]]'' 'full' < PIE {{PIE|*plh\u2081nos}}). Word-finally, the acute was regularly shortened: ''[[wikt:geras#Lithuanian|ger\u00e0]]'' 'good' (indefinite adjective) : ''ger\u00f3ji'' 'the good' (definite adjective). That rule is called '''Leskien's law''' after the German neogrammarian [[August Leskien]].\n\nThe shortening operated according to Leskien's law after the Lithuanian metatony. In monosyllabic words, the acute became circumflexed. Metatonical retraction of the accent from the final syllable to the penultimate syllable also created a circumflex automatically.\n\nIn the [[\u017demaitian]] (Samogitian) dialects of Lithuanian, the usual reflex of Balto-Slavic acute in a stressed syllable is a broken tone like Latvian: \u017demaitian (Kretinga) ''\u1ed9m\u017e\u0301i\u1ecds'' \"age, century\" = standard ''\u00e1m\u017eius''.<ref name=\"derksen12\"/>\n\n===Old Prussian===\nIn Old Prussian, the acute was reflected probably as a rising tone and circumflex as a falling tone. The marks on long vowels and diphthongs in [[Abel Will]]'s translation of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion|Enchiridion]]'' point to that conclusion. It is the only accented Old Prussian text preserved. Diphthongs that correspond to a reconstructable Balto-Slavic acute are generally long in the second part of the diphthong, and those corresponding to a Balto\u2013Slavic circumflex are generally long in the first part.\n\n===Slavic===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n{{main|Proto-Slavic accent}}\nIn Proto-Slavic, the acute was lost as an articulatory feature and retained only as a tonal distinction on accented syllables. The acute produced a rising tone and the circumflex a falling tone, as in Latvian and Old Prussian.\n\nSeveral developments in Late Common Slavic affected vowel length. Syllables that were originally short could lengthen, and those originally long could shorten. However, the long vowels also acquired different quality from the short ones so lengthenings and shortenings did not cause them to merge.\n\nInstead, the vowels remained separate, causing the number of distinct vowels to almost double. Thus, differences vowel quality reflected older length distinctions while new vowel length distinctions were conditioned by accent type and placement. Consequently, in the Slavic languages that retain it, vowel length is often a [[suprasegmental]] feature tied to the accentual system rather phonemes. In Czech, Slovak and Old Polish, the mobile accent was lost in favour of fixed stress, which rephonemicised the older accentual length distinctions. Thus, the languages have long vowels as distinct phonemes, but they do not reflect the original Proto-Slavic length distinctions.\n\nIn all Slavic languages, the acute was shortened when it fell on a long vowel. A new rising accent (the \"neoacute\"), generally long, developed from retraction of the stress from a weak [[yer]] vowel (later usually lost). The short rising accent that developed from the old acute (and in some circumstances, the neoacute) was later lengthened again in a number of Slavic languages (such as Russian, Czech, Slovenian). The circumflex was shortened in some dialects as well (such as Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovak). Direct continuation of the acute vs. circumflex difference as a tonal distinction occurs only in archaic Serbo\u2013Croatian dialects (such as [[Chakavian]]) and, to some extent, Slovenian (although the relationship between Slovenian and Proto-Slavic tones and accent position is complex).\n\nIn addition, the Proto-Slavic tonal distinction on liquid diphthongs is reflected fairly directly in Russian as a multisyllable accent shape ([[pleophony]]): *\u00f4r (falling) > ''\u00f3ro'', *\u00f3r (rising) > ''or\u00f3''. In some other languages (most notably Czech and standard [[Neoshtokavian]] Serbo-Croatian), the acute vs. circumflex distinction is continued as a length distinction (although in all languages, both long and short vowels have other sources as well). The length-from-tone distinction no longer exists in Russian.\n\nHere is a table of basic accentual correspondences of the first syllable of a word:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

In 1802 the influential German scholar of Slavic languages and history [[August Ludwig von Schl\u00f6zer]] described how his understanding of this relationship had changed over the years: whereas previously he had argued that the 'Latvian' or 'Old-Prussian' peoples spoke languages that belonged to the Slavic group, he had come to see them as an independent language family.<ref>Schl\u00f6zer, August Ludwig, [Nestor in Russian] Russische Annalen in ihrer Slavonischen GrundSprache verglichen, \u00fcbersetzt, und erkl\u00e4rt, vol.2: Ru\u00dflands VorGeschichte.

(G\u00f6ttingen: Dieterich, 1802), pp.xii-xiii</ref>\n\nIt was formerly thought that Balto-Slavic split into two branches, Baltic and Slavic, which both developed as a single common language for some time afterwards. More recently, scholarship suggests that Baltic was not a single branch of Balto-Slavic.<ref>{{citation |last=Kortlandt |first=Frederik |author-link=Frederik Kortlandt |year=2009 |title=Baltica & Balto-Slavica |page=5 |quote=Though Prussian is undoubtedly closer to the East Baltic languages than to Slavic, the characteristic features of the Baltic languages seem to be either retentions or results of parallel development and cultural interaction.

{"title_page": "Very large database", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{About|databases which are very large|the VLDB conference|International Conference on Very Large Data Bases}}\n\nA '''very large database''', (originally written '''very large data base''') or '''VLDB''',<ref name=\"11gR1\"/> is a database that contains a very large amount of data, so much that it can require specialized architectural, management, processing and maintenance methodologies.<ref name=\"TechnoP\"/><ref name=\"Gaines\"/><ref name=\"DPmag\"/><ref name=\"Widlake\"/>\n\n==Definition==\nThe vague adjectives of ''very'' and ''large'' allow for a broad and subjective interpretation, but attempts at defining a metric and threshold have been made. Early metrics were the size of the database in a [[canonical form]] via [[database normalization]] or the time for a full database operation like a [[backup]]. Technology improvements has continually changed what is considered ''very large''.<ref name=\"EncycCSTech\"/><ref name=\"Metrics\"/>\n\nOne definition has suggested that a database has become a VLDB when it is \"too large to be maintained within the window of opportunity\u2026 the time when the database is quiet\".<ref name=\"Unleashed2K\"/>\n\n==Sizes of a VLDB database==\nThere is no absolute amount of data that can be cited. For example, one '''cannot''' say that any database with more than 1&nbsp;TB of data is considered a VLDB. This absolute amount of data has varied over time as computer processing, storage and backup methods have become better able to handle larger amounts of data.<ref name=\"Widlake\"/>  That said, VLDB issues may start to appear when 1&nbsp;TB is approached,<ref name=\"Unleashed2K\"/><ref name=\"VLDBpartIntro18c\"/> and are more than likely to have appeared as 30&nbsp;TB or so is exceeded.<ref name=\"VLDBprobPaper\"/>\n\n==VLDB challenges==\nKey areas where a VLDB may present challenges include configuration, storage, performance, maintenance, administration, availability and server resources.<ref name=\"AIOUG-SJH\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\n===Configuration===\nCareful configuration of databases that lie in the VLDB realm is necessary to alleviate or reduce issues raised by VLDB databases.<ref name=\"AIOUG-SJH\"/>{{rp|36\u201453}}<ref name=\"MustDoVLDB-WC\"/>\n\n===Administration===\nThe complexities of managing a VLDB can increase exponentially for the [[database administrator]] as database size increases.<ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/>\n\n===Availability and maintenance===\nWhen dealing with VLDB operations relating to maintenance and recovery such as database reorganizations and file copies which were quite practical on a non-VLDB become take very significant amounts of time and resource for a VLDB database.<ref name=\"RedBrick1996\"/>.  In particular it typically infeasible to meet a typical [[recovery time objective]] (RTO), the maximum expected time a database is expected to be unavailable due to interruption, by methods which involve copying files from disk or other storage archives.<ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/>  To overcome these issues techniques such as clustering, cloned/replicated/standby databases, file-snapshots, storage snapshots or a backup manager may help achieve the RTO and availability, although individual methods may have limitations, caveats, license, and infrastructure requirements while some may risk data loss and not meet the recovery point objective (RPO).<ref name=\"Crouch-CluDes\"/><ref name=\"Crouch-XDCR\"/><ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/><ref name=\"SnapNotBack\"/><ref name=\"DB2-SMBI\"/>  For many systems only geographically remote solutions may be acceptable.<ref name=\"MYSQL-HA-SCALE\"/>\n\n====Backup and recovery====\nBest practice is for backup and recovery to be architectured in terms of the overall availability and business continuity solution.<ref name=\"IBM-stor-cont-bk\"/><ref name=\"ISACA-BKBP\"/>\n\n===Performance===\nGiven the same infrastructure there may typically be a decrease in performance, that is increase in [[Response time (technology)|response time]] as database size increases.  Some accesses will simply have more data to process (scan) which will take proportionally longer ([[linear time]]); while the indexes used to access data may grow slightly in height requiring perhaps an extra storage access to reach the data ([[sub-linear time]]).<ref name=\"GrogBplus\"/>  Other effects can be [[Cache (computing)|caching]] becoming less efficient because proportionally less data can be cached and while some [[Database index|indexes]] such the [[B+ tree|B+]] automatically sustain well with growth others such as a [[hash table]] may need to be rebuilt.\n\nShould an increase in database size cause the number of accessors of the database to increase then more server and network resources may be consumed, and the risk of [[Block contention|contention]] will increase.  Some solutions to regaining performance include [[Partition (database)|partitioning]], [[Computer cluster|clustering]], possibly with [[Shard (database architecture)|sharding]], or use of a [[database machine]].<ref name=\"Shrestha\"/>{{rp|390}}<ref name=\"PCmagDefDM\"/>\n\n====Partitioning====\nPartitioning may be able assist the performance of bulk operations on a VLDB including backup and recovery.<ref name=\"BC-BackVLDBtips\"/>, bulk movements due to [[information lifecycle management]] (ILM)<ref name=\"OraPart12cR2WP\"/>{{rp|3}}<ref name=\"CERN-ORA-PART\"/>{{rp|105\u2014118}}, reducing contention<ref name=\"CERN-ORA-PART\"/>{{rp|327\u2014329}} as well as allowing optimization of some query processing.<ref name=\"CERN-ORA-PART\"/>{{rp|215\u2014230}}\n\n===Storage===\nIn order to satisfy needs of a VLDB the database [[Computer data storage#performance|storage]] needs to have low access [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and [[Resource contention|contention]], high [[throughput]], and [[high availability]].\n\n===Server resources===\nThe increasing size of a VLDB may put pressure on server and network resources and a bottleneck may appear that may require infrastructure investment to resolve.<ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/><ref name=\"MS-srv-perf-qa\"/>\n\n==Relationship to big data==\nVLDB is not the same as ''[[big data]]'', however the storage aspect of ''big data'' may involve a VLDB database.<ref name=\"TechnoP\"/>  That said some of the storage solutions supporting ''big data'' were designed from the start to support large volumes of data, so database administrators may not encounter VLDB issues that older versions of traditional [[RDBMS]]'s might encounter.<ref name=\"Li-Manoharan\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[XLDB]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Unleashed2K\">{{cite book|title=Microsoft SQL Server 2000|first1=Ray|last1=Rankins|first2=Paul|last2=Jensen|first3=Paul|last3=Bertucci|chapter=21|id=Administering Very Large SQL Server Databases|edition=2nd|publisher=SAMS|isbn=978-0672324673|date=18 December 2002|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftsqlserv00rayr|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftsqlserv00rayr}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"11gR1\">{{cite web|title=Oracle Database Online Documentation 11g Release 1 (11.1) / Database Administration Database Concepts|url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/partconc.htm#CNCPT011\n|id=18 Very Large Databases (VLDB)|website=oracle|access-date=3 October 2018|url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"VLDBpartIntro18c\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/vldbg/partition-intro.html\n|title=Oracle Database Release 18 - VLDB and Partitioning Guide|id=1 Introduction to Very Large Databases|access-date=3 October 2018|website=Oracle|url-access=limited\n|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003205734/https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/vldbg/partition-intro.html|archive-date=3 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TechnoP\">{{cite web|website=Technopedia|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14731/very-large-database-vldb|access-date=3 October 2018|title=Very Large Database (VLDB)\n|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704224849/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14731/very-large-database-vldb|archive-date=4 July 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gaines\">Gaines, R.

Early metrics were the size of the database in a [[canonical form]] via [[database normalization]] or the time for a full database operation like a [[backup]]. Technology improvements has continually changed what is considered ''very large''.<ref name=\"EncycCSTech\"/><ref name=\"Metrics\"/>\n\nOne definition has suggested that a database has become a VLDB when it is \"too large to be maintained within the window of opportunity\u2026 the time when the database is quiet\".<ref name=\"Unleashed2K\"/>\n\n==Sizes of a VLDB database==\nThere is no absolute amount of data that can be cited. For example, one '''cannot''' say that any database with more than 1 TB of data is considered a VLDB. This absolute amount of data has varied over time as computer processing, storage and backup methods have become better able to handle larger amounts of data.<ref name=\"Widlake\"/>  That said, VLDB issues may start to appear when 1TB is approached,<ref name=\"Unleashed2K\"/><ref name=\"VLDBpartIntro18c\"/> and are more than likely to have appeared as 30TB or so is exceeded.<ref name=\"VLDBprobPaper\"/>\n\n==VLDB challenges==\nKey areas where a VLDB may present challenges include configuration, storage, performance, maintenance, administration, availability and server resources.<ref name=\"AIOUG-SJH\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\n===Configuration===\nCareful configuration of databases that lie in the VLDB realm is necessary to alleviate or reduce issues raised by VLDB databases.<ref name=\"AIOUG-SJH\"/>{{rp|36\u201453}}<ref name=\"MustDoVLDB-WC\"/>\n\n===Administration===\nThe complexities of managing a VLDB can increase exponentially for the [[database administrator]] as database size increases.<ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/>\n\n===Availability and maintenance===\nWhen dealing with VLDB operations relating to maintenance and recovery such as database reorganizations and file copies which were quite practical on a non-VLDB become take very significant amounts of time and resource for a VLDB database.<ref name=\"RedBrick1996\"/>.  In particular it typically infeasible to meet a typical [[recovery time objective]] (RTO), the maximum expected time a database is expected to be unavailable due to interruption, by methods which involve copying files from disk or other storage archives.<ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/>  To overcome these issues techniques such as clustering, cloned/replicated/standby databases, file-snapshots, storage snapshots or a backup manager may help achieve the RTO and availability, although individual methods may have limitations, caveats, license, and infrastructure requirements while some may risk data loss and not meet the recovery point objective (RPO).<ref name=\"Crouch-CluDes\"/><ref name=\"Crouch-XDCR\"/><ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/><ref name=\"SnapNotBack\"/><ref name=\"DB2-SMBI\"/>  For many systems only geographically remote solutions may be acceptable.<ref name=\"MYSQL-HA-SCALE\"/>\n\n====Backup and recovery====\nBest practice is for backup and recovery to be architectured in terms of the overall availability and business continuity solution.<ref name=\"IBM-stor-cont-bk\"/><ref name=\"ISACA-BKBP\"/>\n\n===Performance===\nGiven the same infrastructure there may typically be a decrease in performance, that is increase in [[Response time (technology)|response time]] as database size increases.  Some accesses will simply have more data to process (scan) which will take proportionally longer ([[linear time]]); while the indexes used to access data may grow slightly in height requiring perhaps an extra storage access to reach the data ([[sub-linear time]]).<ref name=\"GrogBplus\"/>  Other effects can be [[Cache (computing)|caching]] becoming less efficient because proportionally less data can be cached and while some [[Database index|indexes]] such the [[B+ tree|B+]] automatically sustain well with growth others such as a [[Hash table]] may need to be rebuilt.\n\nShould an increase in database size cause the number of accessors of the database to increase then more server and network resources may be consumed, and the risk of [[Block contention|contention]] will increase.  Some solutions to regaining performance include [[Partition (database)|partitioning]], [[Computer cluster|clustering]], possibly with [[Shard (database architecture)|sharding]], or use of a [[database machine]].<ref name=\"Shrestha\"/>{{rp|390}}<ref name=\"PCmagDefDM\"/>\n\n====Partitioning====\nPartitioning may be able assist the performance of bulk operations on a VLDB including backup and recovery.<ref name=\"BC-BackVLDBtips\"/>, bulk movements due to [[information lifecycle management]] (ILM)<ref name=\"OraPart12cR2WP\"/>{{rp|3}}<ref name=\"CERN-ORA-PART\"/>{{rp|105\u2014118}}, reducing contention<ref name=\"CERN-ORA-PART\"/>{{rp|327\u2014329}} as well as allowing optimization of some query processing.<ref name=\"CERN-ORA-PART\"/>{{rp|215\u2014230}}\n\n===Storage===\nIn order to satisfy needs of a VLDB the database [[Computer data storage#performance|storage]] needs to have low access [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and [[Resource contention|contention]], high [[throughput]], and [[high availability]].\n\n===Server resources===\nThe increasing size of a VLDB may put pressure on server and network resources and a bottleneck may appear that may require infrastructure investment to resolve.<ref name=\"MSazureVLDB\"/><ref name=\"MS-srv-perf-qa\"/>\n\n==Relationship to big data==\nVLDB is not the same as ''[[big data]]'', however the storage aspect of ''big data'' may involve a VLDB database.<ref name=\"TechnoP\"/>  That said some of the storage solutions supporting ''big data'' were designed from the start to support large volumes of data, so database administrators may not encounter VLDB issues that older versions of traditional [[RDBMS]]'s might encounter.<ref name=\"Li-Manoharan\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[XLDB]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Unleashed2K\">{{cite book|title=Microsoft SQL Server 2000|first1=Ray|last1=Rankins|first2=Paul|last2=Jensen|first3=Paul|last3=Bertucci|chapter=21|id=Administering Very Large SQL Server Databases|edition=2nd|publisher=SAMS|isbn=978-0672324673|date=18 December 2002|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftsqlserv00rayr|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftsqlserv00rayr}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"11gR1\">{{cite web|title=Oracle Database Online Documentation 11g Release 1 (11.1) / Database Administration Database Concepts|url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/partconc.htm#CNCPT011\n|id=18 Very Large Databases (VLDB)|website=oracle|access-date=3 October 2018|url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"VLDBpartIntro18c\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/vldbg/partition-intro.html\n|title=Oracle Database Release 18 - VLDB and Partitioning Guide|id=1 Introduction to Very Large Databases|access-date=3 October 2018|website=Oracle|url-access=limited\n|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003205734/https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/vldbg/partition-intro.html|archive-date=3 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TechnoP\">{{cite web|website=Technopedia|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14731/very-large-database-vldb|access-date=3 October 2018|title=Very Large Database (VLDB)\n|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704224849/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14731/very-large-database-vldb|archive-date=4 July 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gaines\">Gaines, R.

Odinga is commonly known as \"Baba\", coincidentally: he was an MP at the same time as his father between 1992 and 1994. Other nicknames that have been associated with the premier are such as \"Nyundo\" which is hammer in [[Kiswahili]], \"Tinga\" which means tractor in Kiswahili a symbol of his National Development Party, NDP, \"Agwambo\" meaning a man who is unpredictable and 'BABA' which means the political father.\n\nOdinga first ran as a presidential contender in the 1997 elections, coming third after President [[Daniel arap Moi]] of KANU and [[Mwai Kibaki]] of the [[Democratic Party (Kenya)|Democratic Party]]. He contested for President again in the December 2007 elections on an [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM) ticket.\n\nIn readiness for that poll, on 1 September 2007, Odinga was picked as ODM's presidential nominee to face off with PNU's Kibaki in the current General Election. He managed to garner significant support in the 2007 general election. According to the electoral body at the time (the ECK), he swept the majority of the votes in [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] (Kenya's most populous area), [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]], his native [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]], and [[Coast Province|Coast]]. Kibaki on the other hand won majority votes in [[Nairobi County|Nairobi]] (the capital), [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern province]], [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central province]] and [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern province]], taking 4 provinces against Odinga's 4. Odinga's ODM party got 99 out of the 210 seats in the parliament, making it the single largest party in parliament.\n\nThe Kriegler report, commissioned to investigate the violent aftermath of the 2007 elections and alleged vote-rigging, stated that about 1.2 million dead voters existed in the voters register, raising serious doubts to the integrity of the election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000008868/in-kisumu-dead-voters-showed-up-at-the-polls |title=In Kisumu, dead voters 'showed up' at the polls |publisher=The Standard |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2017-09-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903080047/https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000008868/in-kisumu-dead-voters-showed-up-at-the-polls |archivedate=3 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 30 December 2007, the chairman of the Kenyan [[Electoral Commission of Kenya|election commission]] declared Odinga's opponent, incumbent president Kibaki, the winner of the presidential election by a slim margin of about 230,000 votes. Odinga disputed the results, alleging [[electoral fraud|fraud]] by the election commission. However he refused to follow due process of petitioning the courts, believing that the courts were under manipulation by Kibaki and so could not give a fair and impartial hearing.\n\nMost opinion polls had speculated that Odinga would defeat the president, though the margin kept narrowing as election day neared.

He however retained his position as the Langata MP.<ref name=\"multiparty\"/>\n\nIn a surprise move, Odinga decided to support Moi, his arch-enemy, even entering into a political merger between his party, NDP, and Moi's much-hated [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]] party, which many Kenyans likened to the yoke of oppression. The merger was called New KANU. Previous admirers of Odinga now saw him as a sell-out to a cause he had once championed by closing ranks with a despot. He accepted a position in Moi's cabinet as Energy Minister, serving from June 2001 to 2002, during Moi's final term.\n\nIn the subsequent KANU elections held later that year, he was elected the party's Secretary General (replacing [[Joseph Kamotho]]).<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200208060047.html Kenya: Saitoti, Raila And Kamotho Hold Breakfast Meeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917071057/http://allafrica.com/stories/200208060047.html |date=17 September 2002 }}. allafrica.com. 6 August 2002</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Joe Khamisi|title=The Politics of Betrayal: Diary of a Kenyan Legislator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saw3XU7VaI4C+|date= 2011|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4269-8676-5|page=15}}</ref> It was apparent to many that Odinga hoped to ascend to the presidency through KANU and with Moi's support.\n\nIn 2002, much to the chagrin of Odinga and many other hopefuls in the party, Moi endorsed [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] \u2013 son of Kenya's first president [[Jomo Kenyatta]] but a relative newcomer in politics \u2013 to be his successor.

Odinga and other KANU members, including [[Kalonzo Musyoka]], [[George Saitoti]] and [[Joseph Kamotho]], opposed this step arguing that the then 38-year-old Uhuru was politically inexperienced and lacked the leadership qualities needed to govern. Moi stood his ground, maintaining that the country's leadership needed to pass to the younger generation.\n\nDissent ran through the party with some members openly disagreeing with Moi, despite his reputation as an autocrat. It was then that the Rainbow Movement was founded, comprising disgruntled KANU members who exited KANU. The exodus, led by Odinga, saw most big names fleeing the party. Moi was left with his handpicked successor almost alone with a party reduced to an empty shell with poor electoral prospects. The Rainbow Movement went on to join the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), which later teamed up with opposition Mwai Kibaki's [[National Alliance Party of Kenya]] (NAK), a coalition of several other parties, to form the [[National Rainbow Coalition]] ([[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]]).\n\nAmid fears that this opposition \"super alliance\", would fail to unite and rally behind a common candidate as in previous occasions thus easily hand victory to the government, Odinga declared \"''Kibaki tosha''\", Swahili for \"Kibaki is sufficient\", an endorsement of a Kibaki ticket. This resolved the matter of candidacy and Narc went on to defeat Moi's protege, Uhuru Kenyatta. The opposition won a landslide 67% of the vote, dealing a humiliating blow to Moi.

(Kenya's constitution had no provision for Prime minister yet); neither did he give LDP (Odinga's faction) half of the cabinet positions as per the MOU. He instead sought to entrench and increase his own NAK's side in cabinet, even appointing MPs from the opposition parties (KANU and FORD people) to the cabinet.<ref>BBC News, 30 September 2003: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3356431.stm Uproar over Kenya leader's decree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040720215552/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3356431.stm |date=20 July 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe perceived \"betrayal\" started a simmering disquiet which in time led to an open rebellion and a split within the cabinet. A key point of disagreement was a proposed new constitution for the country, which was a major campaign issue that had united Kibaki's NAK and Odinga's LDP in the campaign. This constitution included provisions to trim presidential powers to rein in what was seen as an autocratic presidency, a feature of both the Moi and first president Jomo Kenyatta's regimes which had led to a lot of power abuse and an unaccountable leadership.\n\nOnce in power however, Kibaki's government instituted a Constitutional Committee which turned around and submitted a draft constitution that was perceived to consolidate presidential powers and weaken regional governments, contrary to the pre-election draft.\n\nOdinga opposed this and went on to campaign with his LDP cabinet colleagues on the referendum 'No' side, opposing the President and his lieutenants in a bruising countrywide campaign. When the document was put to a [[2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum|referendum]] on 21 November 2005, the government lost by a 57% to 43% margin. Embarrassingly for Kibaki, out of 8 provinces, only one ( Central Province where his tribe the Kikuyu are dominant) voted \"yes\" for the document, isolating his own tribe from the rest of Kenya and exposing his campaign as ethnic- based.\n\nA shell-shocked and disappointed President Kibaki sacked the entire cabinet on 23 November 2005. When it was reconstituted two weeks later, Odinga and the entire LDP group were left out.\n\nThis led to the formation of a new opposition outfit, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) \u2013 an Orange was the symbol for the \"No\" vote in the constitutional referendum.\n\nIn January 2006, Odinga was reported to have told police that he believed his life was in danger, having received assassination threats.<ref>BBC News, 10 January 2006: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4599834.stm Kenyan opponent 'fears for life'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113105542/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4599834.stm |date=13 January 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==2007 presidential election==\nOn 12 July 2007, with Kibaki's reelection bid drawing close, Odinga alleged that the government was withholding [[Identity document|identity cards]] from voters in opposition strongholds with intention to skew the election in favour of Kibaki.

He stated that the results that were being transmitted by IEBC were false because they had been manipulated via a computer algorithm designed to maintain an 11% gap between him and Uhuru's votes. As such, he proved the votes were not real votes cast by human voters but the outcome of a computer generated formula producing artificial values. This intrusion into IEBC's system, he further said, affected not just the presidential results but the entire election, including the votes cast for MPs, Senators, Governors and Women Representatives. He called the alleged intrusion \"the biggest vote theft in Kenya\u2019s history.\" Later while vote tallying was still in progress and the country was awaiting announcement of the final results, Odinga revealed that his team had received information from a confidential source in IEBC indicating that results from its server showed him leading with an unassailable 8 million votes over Uhuru's 7 million votes. Based on this, he demanded he be declared the 5th [[President of Kenya]].\n\nThe IEBC however rejected Odinga's contention, saying the winner could not be announced before the tallying was complete and also being an independent body it could not be compelled by one of the candidates to announce the results.\n\nThe IEBC finally announced the results declaring Uhuru the winner with 8.2 million votes against Odinga's 6.7 million. The results showed massive losses for NASA, with Jubilee invading traditional NASA strongholds. NASA refused to recognize the results.\n\nShortly after Uhuru's declared victory, violence was reported in some parts of the country which are opposition strongholds. However the violence was not of the scale witnessed in the 2007 election aftermath and broke out only sporadically.

His position was once in favour of a parliamentary system as seen when he initially backed a Constitution giving executive powers to a Prime Minister but he subsequently changed to a presidential system with a devolved power structure, which is reflected in Kenya's current constitution.\n\nOdinga is seen as the main force behind devolution now enshrined in Kenya's constitution as an essential part of Kenya's governance system. This was inspired by a feeling that all successive governments under the centralized power structure had consistently abused that power to favour certain areas along political or ethnic lines while denying many regions access to resources and development because of their ethnicity or perceived disloyalty. Devolution aimed to address this and guarantee regions their fair share of resources regardless of their political affiliation or ethnicity.\n\nDue to an economic downturn and extreme drought, Odinga has called for the suspension of taxes on fuels and certain foods that disproportionately impact the poor.\n<ref>Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, 1 June 2011: [http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=70521 Principles Unite in Addressing High Cost of Living] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321070428/http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=70521 |date=21 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOdinga has supported an element of state welfare in the form of cash-transfer programs to low-income people.

Odinga is commonly known as \"Baba\", coincidentally: he was an MP at the same time as his father between 1992 and 1994. Other nicknames that have been associated with the premier are such as \"Nyundo\" which is hammer in [[Kiswahili]], \"Tinga\" which means tractor in Kiswahili a symbol of his National Development Party, NDP, \"Agwambo\" meaning a man who is unpredictable and 'BABA' which means the political father.\n\nOdinga first ran as a presidential contender in the 1997 elections, coming third after President [[Daniel arap Moi]] of KANU and [[Mwai Kibaki]] of the [[Democratic Party (Kenya)|Democratic Party]]. He contested for President again in the December 2007 elections on an [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM) ticket.\n\nIn readiness for that poll, on 1 September 2007, Odinga was picked as ODM's presidential nominee to face off with PNU's Kibaki in the current General Election. He managed to garner significant support in the 2007 general election. According to the electoral body at the time (the ECK), he swept the majority of the votes in [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] (Kenya's most populous area), [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]], his native [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]], and [[Coast Province|Coast]]. Kibaki on the other hand won majority votes in [[Nairobi County|Nairobi]] (the capital), [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern province]], [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central province]] and [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern province]], taking 4 provinces against Odinga's 4. Odinga's ODM party got 99 out of the 210 seats in the parliament, making it the single largest party in parliament.\n\nThe Kriegler report, commissioned to investigate the violent aftermath of the 2007 elections and alleged vote-rigging, stated that about 1.2 million dead voters existed in the voters register, raising serious doubts to the integrity of the election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000008868/in-kisumu-dead-voters-showed-up-at-the-polls |title=In Kisumu, dead voters 'showed up' at the polls |publisher=The Standard |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2017-09-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903080047/https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000008868/in-kisumu-dead-voters-showed-up-at-the-polls |archivedate=3 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 30 December 2007, the chairman of the Kenyan [[Electoral Commission of Kenya|election commission]] declared Odinga's opponent, incumbent president Kibaki, the winner of the presidential election by a slim margin of about 230,000 votes.

Odinga and other KANU members, including [[Kalonzo Musyoka]], [[George Saitoti]] and [[Joseph Kamotho]], opposed this step arguing that the then 38-year-old Uhuru was politically inexperienced and lacked the leadership qualities needed to govern. Moi stood his ground, maintaining that the country's leadership needed to pass to the younger generation.\n\nDissent ran through the party with some members openly disagreeing with Moi, despite his reputation as an autocrat. It was then that the Rainbow Movement was founded, comprising disgruntled KANU members who exited KANU. The exodus, led by Odinga, saw most big names fleeing the party. Moi was left with his handpicked successor almost alone with a party reduced to an empty shell with poor electoral prospects. The Rainbow Movement went on to join the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), which later teamed up with opposition Mwai Kibaki's [[National Alliance Party of Kenya]] (NAK), a coalition of several other parties, to form the [[National Rainbow Coalition]] ([[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]]).\n\nAmid fears that this opposition \"super alliance\", would fail to unite and rally behind a common candidate as in previous occasions thus easily hand victory to the government, Odinga declared \"''Kibaki tosha''\", Swahili for \"Kibaki is sufficient\", an endorsement of a Kibaki ticket. This resolved the matter of candidacy and Narc went on to defeat Moi's protege, Uhuru Kenyatta. The opposition won a landslide 67% of the vote, dealing a humiliating blow to Moi. Odinga led the campaign for Kibaki throughout the country while Kibaki was bedridden and incapacitated following an accident in which he sustained injuries.\n\n==Dissent from within==\n[[File:Gordon Brown Raila Odinga.JPG|thumb|Odinga with [[Gordon Brown]] at [[Kibera]]]]\nOn assuming office, President Kibaki did not appoint Odinga as Prime Minister in the new government, contrary to a pre-election MOU. (Kenya's constitution had no provision for Prime minister yet); neither did he give LDP (Odinga's faction) half of the cabinet positions as per the MOU. He instead sought to entrench and increase his own NAK's side in cabinet, even appointing MPs from the opposition parties (KANU and FORD people) to the cabinet.<ref>BBC News, 30 September 2003: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3356431.stm Uproar over Kenya leader's decree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040720215552/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3356431.stm |date=20 July 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe perceived \"betrayal\" started a simmering disquiet which in time led to an open rebellion and a split within the cabinet. A key point of disagreement was a proposed new constitution for the country, which was a major campaign issue that had united Kibaki's NAK and Odinga's LDP in the campaign. This constitution included provisions to trim presidential powers to rein in what was seen as an autocratic presidency, a feature of both the Moi and first president Jomo Kenyatta's regimes which had led to a lot of power abuse and an unaccountable leadership.\n\nOnce in power however, Kibaki's government instituted a Constitutional Committee which turned around and submitted a draft constitution that was perceived to consolidate presidential powers and weaken regional governments, contrary to the pre-election draft.\n\nOdinga opposed this and went on to campaign with his LDP cabinet colleagues on the referendum 'No' side, opposing the President and his lieutenants in a bruising countrywide campaign. When the document was put to a [[2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum|referendum]] on 21 November 2005, the government lost by a 57% to 43% margin. Embarrassingly for Kibaki, out of 8 provinces, only one ( Central Province where his tribe the Kikuyu are dominant) voted \"yes\" for the document, isolating his own tribe from the rest of Kenya and exposing his campaign as ethnic- based.\n\nA shell-shocked and disappointed President Kibaki sacked the entire cabinet on 23 November 2005. When it was reconstituted two weeks later, Odinga and the entire LDP group were left out.\n\nThis led to the formation of a new opposition outfit, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) \u2013 an Orange was the symbol for the \"No\" vote in the constitutional referendum.\n\nIn January 2006, Odinga was reported to have told police that he believed his life was in danger, having received assassination threats.<ref>BBC News, 10 January 2006: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4599834.stm Kenyan opponent 'fears for life'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113105542/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4599834.stm |date=13 January 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==2007 presidential election==\nOn 12 July 2007, with Kibaki's reelection bid drawing close, Odinga alleged that the government was withholding [[Identity document|identity cards]] from voters in opposition strongholds with intention to skew the election in favour of Kibaki.

He stated that the results that were being transmitted by IEBC were false because they had been manipulated via a computer algorithm designed to maintain an 11% gap between him and Uhuru's votes. As such, he proved the votes were not real votes cast by human voters but the outcome of a computer generated formula producing artificial values. This intrusion into IEBC's system, he further said, affected not just the presidential results but the entire election, including the votes cast for MPs, Senators, Governors and Women Representatives. He called the alleged intrusion \"the biggest vote theft in Kenya\u2019s history.\" Later while vote tallying was still in progress and the country was awaiting announcement of the final results, Odinga revealed that his team had received information from a confidential source in IEBC indicating that results from its server showed him leading with an unassailable 8 million votes over Uhuru's 7 million votes. Based on this, he demanded he be declared the 5th [[President of Kenya]].\n\nThe IEBC however rejected Odinga's contention, saying the winner could not be announced before the tallying was complete and also being an independent body it could not be compelled by one of the candidates to announce the results.\n\nThe IEBC finally announced the results declaring Uhuru the winner with 8.2 million votes against Odinga's 6.7 million. The results showed massive losses for NASA, with Jubilee invading traditional NASA strongholds. NASA refused to recognize the results.\n\nShortly after Uhuru's declared victory, violence was reported in some parts of the country which are opposition strongholds. However the violence was not of the scale witnessed in the 2007 election aftermath and broke out only sporadically. Both Odinga and President Kenyatta called for public calm.\n\n===Annulment of the presidential election===\nAfter initially declining to take his case to court on the grounds that the court had previously made an unfavourable judgment against him, Odinga reconsidered and lodged a petition.\n\nAfter 2 days of hearing, the judges in a majority 4\u20132 decision returned a verdict on 1 September annulling the presidential results and ordered a new election to be held within 60 days. The court decision, read by Chief Justice David Maraga and widely viewed as unprecedented both in Africa and globally held that the IEBC failed to conduct the election in the manner provided by the Constitution and so could not stand.<ref>{{cite web|last1=FREYTAS-TAMURA|first1=KIMIKO|title=Kenya Supreme Court Nullifies Presidential Election|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/world/africa/kenya-election-kenyatta-odinga.html?_r=0|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901210458/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/world/africa/kenya-election-kenyatta-odinga.html?_r=0|archivedate=1 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDespite the Supreme Court ruling, Odinga announced his withdrawal from the Presidential election, scheduled for 26 October,<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Raila Odinga takes a gamble by threatening to boycott Kenya\u2019s election|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730121-first-poll-was-annulled-second-may-be-violently-disrupted-raila-odinga|work=[[The Economist]]|date=11 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061227/https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730121-first-poll-was-annulled-second-may-be-violently-disrupted-raila-odinga|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> on 10 October.<ref name=odingwithd>http://ntv.co.ug/news/international/10/oct/2017/i-will-not-be-forced-participate-election-re-run-says-raila-odinga#sthash.Cjs9fhpG.dpbs {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010142116/http://www.ntv.co.ug/news/international/10/oct/2017/i-will-not-be-forced-participate-election-re-run-says-raila-odinga |date=10 October 2017 }}</ref> The reason for his withdrawal was his belief that the election would again not be free or fair, since no electoral process reforms had been made since the annulment of the last election,<ref name=\"veconomist\" /> as well as various defections which occurred from his coalition.<ref name=odingwithd />\n\nIEBC later stated that Odinga had not officially withdrawn from the race for presidency and his would still appear on the ballot on 26 October among other candidates who contested in the 8 August General Elections.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/iebc-raila-not-withdrawn-presidential-race/|title=IEBC: Raila has not withdrawn from presidential race - Nairobi News|date=2017-10-11|work=Nairobi News|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012203220/http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/iebc-raila-not-withdrawn-presidential-race/|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThis resulted to violent uproar in various parts of the country some few days before and after the repeat polls especially in the NASA dominated zones.

His position was once in favour of a parliamentary system as seen when he initially backed a Constitution giving executive powers to a Prime Minister but he subsequently changed to a presidential system with a devolved power structure, which is reflected in Kenya's current constitution.\n\nOdinga is seen as the main force behind devolution now enshrined in Kenya's constitution as an essential part of Kenya's governance system. This was inspired by a feeling that all successive governments under the centralized power structure had consistently abused that power to favour certain areas along political or ethnic lines while denying many regions access to resources and development because of their ethnicity or perceived disloyalty. Devolution aimed to address this and guarantee regions their fair share of resources regardless of their political affiliation or ethnicity.\n\nDue to an economic downturn and extreme drought, Odinga has called for the suspension of taxes on fuels and certain foods that disproportionately impact the poor.\n<ref>Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, 1 June 2011: [http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=70521 Principles Unite in Addressing High Cost of Living] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321070428/http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=70521 |date=21 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOdinga has supported an element of state welfare in the form of cash-transfer programs to low-income people.
