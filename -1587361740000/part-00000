Having made his fortune in the railroad business, James Jerome Hill was a great patron of the arts.  All of his heirs were exposed to and owned great collections, presumably having a strong influence on Beard\u2019s interests in the arts and beauty.\n\nBeard married his first wife (Minnie Cushing Beard Coleman) in 1967; their marriage lasted only briefly. His second wife was [[supermodel]] [[Cheryl Tiegs]], from 1982 to 1986.\n\nIn 1986, he married Nejma Khanum.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Ed Skrein]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Luke Evans]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Tadanobu Asano]], and [[Woody Harrelson]].\n\nA passion project of Emmerich's, he had trouble getting financial support for the film before finally fundraising most of the budget and officially announcing it in 2017. Much of the cast joined in summer 2018, and filming began in [[Hawaii]] that September, also taking place in [[Montreal]]. With a production budget of $100 million, it is one of the most expensive [[independent films]] of all time.\n\n''Midway'' was theatrically released by [[Lionsgate]] in the United States on November 8, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $125 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film follows the story of US Navy sailors and aviators who persevere through the [[Battle of Midway]], a turning point in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]]. It follows two threads: one centered on naval aviator Ensign [[Richard Halsey Best|Dick Best]] and the Air Group (CAG) of the carrier [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'']], and the other on intelligence officer [[Edwin T. Layton]].\n\nThe film starts with the US Naval attach\u00e9 in [[Tokyo]] and his counterpart discussing the US and Japanese positions in the Pacific Ocean during a state function in December 1937. Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] warns Layton that if the Japanese oil supply is threatened by the US, the Japanese will take immediate action. The story then goes on briefly to show the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] (December 1941), the [[Marshalls-Gilberts raids]] (February 1942), [[Doolittle Raid]] (April 1942), and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] (May 1942). It finally describes the planning for the Battle of Midway (June 1942), depicting the creation of a complicated battle plan. [[Joseph Rochefort]] and his cryptology team begin intercepting messages concerning a location the Japanese identify as \"AF\". Layton speaks with Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], who informs him that Washington believes \"AF\" to be a target in the South Pacific. Layton disagrees, believing the intended target to be [[Midway Atoll]]. \n\nAfter meeting with Rochefort, Nimitz instructs the team to find a way to definitively prove that \"AF\u201d is Midway. After Layton instructs Midway to telegraph in the clear (unencrypted) that they are suffering a water shortage, cryptologists working for Rochefort intercept Japanese communications concerning water shortages on \u201cAF\u201d, confirming that \"AF\" is indeed Midway. In preparation for an ambush of the Japanese fleet, Nimitz orders carriers [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']] and ''Enterprise'' recalled from the Coral Sea and demands that the damaged [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|'' Yorktown'']] be made ready for combat operations. \n\nDuring the first stages of the battle, the submarine USS Nautilus manages to slip through the defensive row of Japanese destroyers and fire a torpedo at a carrier. The torpedo misses, and Admiral [[Tamon Yamaguchi]] orders the IJN Arashi to sink the Nautilus while the Japanese carriers make a quick getaway. While Arashi is headed back to the fleet, the US carrier dive bombers led by [[C. Wade McClusky]] follow the destroyer's wake. The gamble pays off and three of the Japanese carriers are destroyed in the first attack during the Battle of Midway. \n\nSpruance then orders what is remaining of the US Air Group to finish off the last carrier. Along their route, they are intercepted by Japanese fighters and bombers on their way to destroy American carriers. A huge [[dogfight]] ensues and many planes from both sides are destroyed. The remaining American planes attack the Hiryu with Lieutenant Best scoring a critical hit with a 500-pound bomb; Hiryu is later scuttled by torpedoes from a Japanese destroyer. Half of the U.S. planes are destroyed in the battle, including most of the [[torpedo bomber]] squadrons.\n\nIn Pearl Harbor, Rochefort intercepts the Japanese order to withdraw and passes it to Layton, who then informs Nimitz and his elated staff. The movie ends with a scene revealing the fates of the principal characters.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Allies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Ed Skrein]]\n|[[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] [[Richard Halsey Best|Richard \"Dick\" Best]]||[[Executive officer]], Bombing Squadron Six, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}\n|-\n|[[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]\n|[[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Edwin T.

When no major studio would bankroll the project, he cut down on potential battle sequences and turned to individuals for the funds, resulting in $76 million; he then got an additional $24 million in equity, mostly from Chinese investors, resulting in the film's $100 million budget. It is one of the most costly [[independent films]] ever made.<ref name=Budget/> Emmerich has previously attempted to mount the film at [[Sony Pictures]] in the '90s, with [[William Goldman]] becoming interested in the project.

Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press. {{ISBN|1-59114-471-X}}.</ref> Instead, the film shows Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance as the tactical commander during the Battle of Midway.\n\nThe air battle during the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids]] is portrayed in the film to take place over a mountainous terrain. However, [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Gilbert Islands]], where the actual raids took place, are [[atoll]]s with very low terrain [[elevation]].\n\nWhile the film shows [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters present during the Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids, [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] units stationed in the area ([[Chitose Air Group]] and [[Yokohama Air Group]]) did not possess the new Zero type of fighters at the time but operated only the older [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighters.<ref name=\"Lundstrom\" /> Likewise, there were few Judys on the Japanese carriers; the bombers were more likely to be the [[Aichi D3A|D3A Vals]].\n\nAn inaccuracy was also depicted with the USS [[USS Nautilus (SS-168)|'' Nautilus'']] attacking an enemy carrier but the torpedo missing its target. The destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Arashi|'' Arashi'']] keeps the submarine pinned down so that the carriers can escape; in fact the submarine was actually targeting the [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|Japanese battleship ''Kirishima'']]. \n\nThe film shows some [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] planes carrying both bombs and torpedoes at the same time.  While the Devastator could be equipped with bombs or torpedoes, strike packages were commonly geared to either torpedo attack or level bombing due to the aircraft's low maximum takeoff weight. The TBD-1 Devastator would normally mount a single Mark 13 torpedo in its torpedo bomber configuration, however some of the aircraft are depicted carrying two additional 100 LB GP bombs in sling racks along with the torpedo. These two racks were commonly used for 500 LB GP bombs when the aircraft was not carrying a torpedo. Although nearly all of the 41 TBD-1s present at Midway were armed solely with the Mark 13 torpedo, a select few pilots did attach additional ordinance to their aircraft, however they were the exception and not the norm.<ref name=\"AI Mar90 p152\">{{cite journal |title=Devastator...The Not-so-Devastating TBD-1 |journal=Air International |date=March 1990 |page=152}}</ref><ref>Buell 1987, p. 494.</ref>\n\nThe film depicts the deaths of O'Flaherty and Gaido as happening on the day of the battle just after the loss of the aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']]'', [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']]'' and [[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|''S\u014dry\u016b'']], whereas in reality, it happened after two weeks. The film shows Gaido as being thrown overboard with an anchor by the Japanese for refusing to answer questions, but O'Flaherty's death is not shown. In reality, they were interrogated and tortured. After two weeks, they were then killed by being tied to water-filled kerosene cans and thrown overboard to drown.<ref>{{harvnb|Barde|1983|pp=188\u2013192}}</ref><ref name=\"Battle 360\">{{citation|title=Battle 360 - Vengeance at Midway|agency=The History Channel}}</ref>\n\nIn another scene Admiral Yamamoto speaks aloud [[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote|\"We have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with terrible resolve\"]], a quote which was spoken in the 1970 film ''[[Tora!

The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Ed Skrein]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Luke Evans]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Tadanobu Asano]], and [[Woody Harrelson]].\n\nA passion project of Emmerich's, he had trouble getting financial support for the film before finally fundraising most of the budget and officially announcing it in 2017. Much of the cast joined in summer 2018, and filming began in [[Hawaii]] that September, also taking place in [[Montreal]]. With a production budget of $100 million, it is one of the most expensive [[independent films]] of all time.\n\n''Midway'' was theatrically released by [[Lionsgate]] in the United States on November 8, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $125 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film follows the story of US Navy sailors and aviators who persevere through the [[Battle of Midway]], a turning point in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]]. It follows two threads: one centered on naval aviator Ensign [[Richard Halsey Best|Dick Best]] and the Air Group (CAG) of the carrier [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'']], and the other on intelligence officer [[Edwin T. Layton]].\n\nThe film starts with the US Naval attach\u00e9 in [[Tokyo]] and his counterpart discussing the US and Japanese positions in the Pacific Ocean during a state function in December 1937. Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] warns Layton that if the Japanese oil supply is threatened by the US, the Japanese will take immediate action. The story then goes on briefly to show the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] (December 1941), the [[Marshalls-Gilberts raids]] (February 1942), [[Doolittle Raid]] (April 1942), and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] (May 1942). It finally describes the planning for the Battle of Midway (June 1942), depicting the creation of a complicated battle plan. [[Joseph Rochefort]] and his cryptology team begin intercepting messages concerning a location the Japanese identify as \"AF\". Layton speaks with Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], who informs him that Washington believes \"AF\" to be a target in the South Pacific. Layton disagrees, believing the intended target to be [[Midway Atoll]]. \n\nAfter meeting with Rochefort, Nimitz instructs the team to find a way to definitively prove that \"AF\u201d is Midway. After Layton instructs Midway to telegraph in the clear (unencrypted) that they are suffering a water shortage, cryptologists working for Rochefort intercept Japanese communications concerning water shortages on \u201cAF\u201d, confirming that \"AF\" is indeed Midway. In preparation for an ambush of the Japanese fleet, Nimitz orders carriers [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']] and ''Enterprise'' recalled from the Coral Sea and demands that the damaged [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|'' Yorktown'']] be made ready for combat operations. \n\nDuring the first stages of the battle, the submarine USS Nautilus manages to slip through the defensive row of Japanese destroyers and fire a torpedo at a carrier. The torpedo misses, and Admiral [[Tamon Yamaguchi]] orders the IJN Arashi to sink the Nautilus while the Japanese carriers make a quick getaway. While Arashi is headed back to the fleet, the US carrier dive bombers led by [[C. Wade McClusky]] follow the destroyer's wake. The gamble pays off and three of the Japanese carriers are destroyed in the first attack during the Battle of Midway. \n\nSpruance then orders what is remaining of the US Air Group to finish off the last carrier. Along their route, they are intercepted by Japanese fighters and bombers on their way to destroy American carriers. A huge [[dogfight]] ensues and many planes from both sides are destroyed. The remaining American planes attack the Hiryu with Lieutenant Best scoring a critical hit with a 500-pound bomb; Hiryu is later scuttled by torpedoes from a Japanese destroyer. Half of the U.S. planes are destroyed in the battle, including most of the [[torpedo bomber]] squadrons.\n\nIn Pearl Harbor, Rochefort intercepts the Japanese order to withdraw and passes it to Layton, who then informs Nimitz and his elated staff. The movie ends with a scene revealing the fates of the principal characters.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Allies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Ed Skrein]]\n|[[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] [[Richard Halsey Best|Richard \"Dick\" Best]]||[[Executive officer]], Bombing Squadron Six, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}\n|-\n|[[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]\n|[[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Edwin T.

It is one of the most costly [[independent films]] ever made.<ref name=Budget/> Emmerich has previously attempted to mount the film at [[Sony Pictures]] in the '90s, with [[William Goldman]] becoming interested in the project.

Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press. {{ISBN|1-59114-471-X}}.</ref> Instead, the film shows Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance as the tactical commander during the Battle of Midway.\n\nThe air battle during the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids]] is portrayed in the film to take place over a mountainous terrain. However, [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Gilbert Islands]], where the actual raids took place, are [[atoll]]s with very low terrain [[elevation]].\n\nWhile the film shows [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters present during the Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids, [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] units stationed in the area ([[Chitose Air Group]] and [[Yokohama Air Group]]) did not possess the new Zero type of fighters at the time but operated only the older [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighters.<ref name=\"Lundstrom\" />\n\nAn inaccuracy was also depicted with the USS [[USS Nautilus (SS-168)|'' Nautilus'']] attacking an enemy carrier but the torpedo missing its target. The destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Arashi|'' Arashi'']] keeps the submarine pinned down so that the carriers can escape; in fact the submarine was actually targeting the [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|Japanese battleship ''Kirishima'']]. \n\nThe film shows some [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] planes carrying both bombs and torpedoes at the same time.  While the Devastator could be equipped with bombs or torpedoes, strike packages were commonly geared to either torpedo attack or level bombing due to the aircraft's low maximum takeoff weight. The TBD-1 Devastator would normally mount a single Mark 13 torpedo in its torpedo bomber configuration, however some of the aircraft are depicted carrying two additional 100 LB GP bombs in sling racks along with the torpedo. These two racks were commonly used for 500 LB GP bombs when the aircraft was not carrying a torpedo. Although nearly all of the 41 TBD-1s present at Midway were armed solely with the Mark 13 torpedo, a select few pilots did attach additional ordinance to their aircraft, however they were the exception and not the norm.<ref name=\"AI Mar90 p152\">{{cite journal |title=Devastator...The Not-so-Devastating TBD-1 |journal=Air International |date=March 1990 |page=152}}</ref><ref>Buell 1987, p. 494.</ref>\n\nThe film depicts the deaths of O'Flaherty and Gaido as happening on the day of the battle just after the loss of the aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']]'', [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']]'' and [[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|''S\u014dry\u016b'']], whereas in reality, it happened after two weeks. The film shows Gaido as being thrown overboard with an anchor by the Japanese for refusing to answer questions, but O'Flaherty's death is not shown. In reality, they were interrogated and tortured. After two weeks, they were then killed by being tied to water-filled kerosene cans and thrown overboard to drown.<ref>{{harvnb|Barde|1983|pp=188\u2013192}}</ref><ref name=\"Battle 360\">{{citation|title=Battle 360 - Vengeance at Midway|agency=The History Channel}}</ref>\n\nIn another scene Admiral Yamamoto speaks aloud [[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote|\"We have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with terrible resolve\"]], a quote which was spoken in the 1970 film ''[[Tora!
