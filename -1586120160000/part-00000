The earliest peoples had migrated from northern areas of North America after leaving Siberia via the [[Bering Land Bridge]]. Artifacts and architecture demonstrate ancient complex cultures in this region.\n\nThe first written records of the region were made by the Spanish [[Conquistadors]], who encountered Native American [[Pueblo]]s when they explored the area in the 16th century. Since that time, the [[Spanish Empire]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]] (since 1848) have claimed [[Territorial evolution of New Mexico|control of the area]].\n\nThe area was governed as [[New Mexico Territory]] until 1912, when it was admitted as a state. The relatively isolated state had an economy dependent on mining. Its residents and government suffered from a reputation for corruption and extreme traditionalism. New Mexico introduced the atomic age in 1945, as the first [[nuclear weapons]] were developed by the federal government in the research center it established at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Ethnically the state has historically been divided among Native American, Hispanic and Anglo elements\u2014the latter mostly migrants from Texas in the late years.\n\n==Native American settlements==\nHuman occupation of [[New Mexico]] stretches back at least 11,000 years to the hunter-gatherer [[Clovis culture]].<ref name=fagan1987>\nFagan, Brian M.

After the invention of agriculture, the land was inhabited by the [[Ancestral Puebloans]], who built houses out of stone or adobe bricks. They experienced a [[Golden Age]] around AD 1000, but climate change led to migration and cultural evolution. From those people arose the historic [[Pueblo people]]s who lived primarily along the few major rivers. The most important rivers are the [[Rio Grande]], the [[Pecos River|Pecos]], the [[Canadian River|Canadian]], the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]], and the [[Gila River|Gila]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n'''PREHISTORIC NEW MEXICANS'''\n|-\n!

By 1050 AD, they had developed planned villages composed of large terraced buildings, each with many rooms. These apartment-house villages were often constructed on defensive sites- on ledges of massive rock, on flat summits, or on steep-sided mesas, locations that would afford the Anasazi protection from their Northern enemies. The largest of these villages, [[Pueblo Bonito]], in the [[Chaco Canyon]] of New Mexico, contained around 700 rooms in five stories and may have housed as many as 1000 persons.<ref>Nash, Gary B. ''Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America'' Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, pg. 4</ref> No larger apartment-house type construction would be seen on the continent until 19th century Chicago and New York. Then, around 1150, Chaco Anasazi society began to unravel. Long before the Spanish arrival, descendants of the Anasazi were using irrigation canals, check dams and hillside terracing as techniques for bringing water to what had for centuries been an arid, agriculturally marginal area. At the same time, the ceramic industry became more elaborate, cotton replaced yucca fiber as the main clothing material and basket weaving became more artistic.<ref name=\"Nash, Gary B. 2015. pg. 5\">Nash, Gary B.

[[Cabeza de Vaca]] in 1535, one of only four survivors of the [[Panfilo de Narvaez]] expedition of 1527, tells of hearing Indians talk about fabulous cities somewhere in New Mexico. [[Marcos de Niza|Fray Marcos de Niza]] enthusiastically identified these as the fabulously rich [[Quivira and C\u00edbola|Seven Cities of C\u00edbola]], the mythical seven cities of gold. [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] led a massive expedition to find these cities in 1540\u20131542. Coronado camped near an excavated pueblo today preserved as [[Coronado National Memorial]] in 1541. The Spanish maltreatment of the Pueblo and [[Athabaskan]] people that started with their explorations of the upper Rio Grande valley led to hostility that impeded the Spanish conquest of New Mexico for centuries.<ref>Herbert Eugene Bolton, ''Coronado: Knight of Pueblos and Plains'' (1949) [https://www.questia.com/read/3724526/coronado-knight-of-pueblos-and-plains online]</ref>\n\nThe three largest pueblos of New Mexico are [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zu\u00f1i]], [[Santo Domingo Pueblo, New Mexico|Santo Domingo]], and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]]. There are three different languages spoken by the pueblos.\n\n==Athabaskans-Apachean==\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] peoples are members of the large [[Athabaskan]] language family, which includes peoples in Alaska and Canada, and along the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe historic peoples encountered by the Europeans did not make up unified tribes in the modern sense, as they were highly decentralized, operating in bands of a size adapted to their semi-nomadic cultures. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, the European explorers, missionaries, traders and settlers referred to the different groups of Apache and Navajo by various names, often associated with distinctions of language or geography. These Athabaskan peoples identified themselves as ''Din\u00e9'', which means \"the people\". The Navajo and Apache made up the largest non-Pueblo Indian group in the Southwest. These two tribes led nomadic lifestyles and spoke the same language.<ref>R. M. Underhill, ''The Navahos'' (1956)</ref><ref>James J. Hester, ''Early Navajo Migrations and Acculturation in the Southwest.''

Spanish records indicated that they traded with the Pueblo. Various bands or tribes participated in the Southwestern Revolt against the Spanish in the 1680s. By the early 18th century the Spanish had built a series of over 25 forts to protect themselves and subjugated populations from the traditional raiding parties of the Athabaskan.<ref>Lynda A.

He traveled mostly overland from Florida to Mexico. Cabeza de Vaca and three companions were the only survivors of the [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] expedition of June 17, 1527 to Florida, losing 80 horses and several hundred explorers. These four survivors had spent eight arduous years getting to Sinaloa, Mexico on the Pacific coast and had visited many Indian tribes.\n\nCoronado and his supporters sank a fortune in this ill-fated enterprise. They took 1300 horses and mules for riding and packing, and hundreds of head of sheep and cattle as a portable food supply. Coronado's men found several [[adobe]] pueblos (towns) in 1541 but no rich cities of gold. Further widespread expeditions<ref>[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/national_parks/coronado_expedition.jpg]</ref> found no fabulous cities anywhere in the Southwest or Great Plains. A dispirited and now poor Coronado and his men began their journey back to Mexico, leaving New Mexico behind. it is likely that some of Coronado's horses escaped, to be captured and adopted for use by Plains Indians. Over the next two centuries, they made horses at the center of their nomadic cultures. Only two of Coronado's horses were mares.<ref>Haines, Francis. \"The Northward Spread of Horses among the Plains Indians\". ''American Anthropologist'', Vol 40, No. 3 (1988)</ref>\n\nMore than 50 years after Coronado, [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] came north from the Valley of Mexico with 500 Spanish settlers and soldiers and 7,000 head of livestock, founding the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico on July 11, 1598.<ref>Simmons, Marc, ''The Last Conquistador'' Norman: U of OK Press, 1992, pp.96, 111</ref> The governor named the settlement ''[[San Juan de los Caballeros]]''. This means \"Saint John of the Knights\". San Juan was in a small valley. Nearby the [[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama River]] flows into the Rio Grande. O\u00f1ate pioneered [[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]], \"The Royal Road of the Interior Land,\" a 700-mile (1,100&nbsp;km) trail from the rest of [[New Spain]] to his remote colony. O\u00f1ate was appointed as the first [[Spanish governors of New Mexico|governor]] of the new province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. Although he Intended to achieve the total subjugation of the Natives, O\u00f1ate noted in 1599 that the Pueblo \"live very much the same as [the Spanish] do, in houses with two and three terraces.\" <ref name=\"Nash, Gary B. 2015. pg. 5\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The Native Americans at [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]] revolted against this Spanish encroachment but faced severe suppression. In battles with the Acomas, O\u00f1ate lost 11 soldiers and two servants, killed hundreds of Indians, and punished every man over 25 years of age by the amputation of their left foot. The Franciscans found the pueblo people increasingly unwilling to consent to baptism by newcomers who continued to demand food, clothing and labor. Acoma is also known as the oldest continually inhabited city in the United States.<ref name=\"Nash, Gary B. 2015. pg. 5\"/></blockquote>\n \nO\u00f1ate's capital of San Juan proved to be vulnerable to \"Apache\" (probably Navajo) attacks. Governor [[Pedro de Peralta]] moved the capital and established the settlement of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1610 at the foot of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]].<ref>McNitt, Frank.  ''Navajo Wars: Military Campaigns, Slave Raids, and Reprisals.'' Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1972, pp. 10-11</ref> Santa Fe is the oldest capital city in the United States. Peralta built the [[Palace of the Governors]] in 1610. Although the colony failed to prosper, some Catholic missions survived. Spanish settlers arrived at the site of Albuquerque in the mid-17th century. Missionaries attempted to convert the natives to Christianity, but had little success.<ref>[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/pueblo/indianpueblohistory.htm]</ref>\n\nContemporary scholars believe that the objective of Spanish rule of New Mexico (and all other northern lands) was the full exploitation of the native population and resources. As Frank McNitt writes,\n\n<blockquote>Governors were a greedy and rapacious lot whose single-minded interest was to wring as much personal wealth from the province as their terms allowed. They exploited Indian labor for transport, sold Indian slaves in New Spain, and sold Indian products ... and other goods manufactured by Indian slave labor.<ref>McNitt, Frank. ''Navajo Wars: Military Campaigns, Slave Raids, and Reprisals.'' Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1972, p. 13</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe exploitative nature of Spanish rule resulted in their conducting nearly continuous raids and reprisals against the nomadic Indian tribes on the borders, especially the [[Apache]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and [[Comanche]].\n\n[[Franciscan]] missionaries accompanied O\u00f1ate to New Mexico; afterward there was a continuing struggle between secular and religious authorities. Both colonists and the Franciscans depended upon Indian labor, mostly the Pueblo, and competed with each other to control a decreasing Indian population. They suffered high mortality   because of infectious European diseases, to which they had no acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], and exploitation that disrupted their societies. The struggle between the Franciscans and the civil government came to a head in the late 1650s. Governor [[Bernardo Lopez de Mendizabal]] and his subordinate [[Nicolas de Aguilar]] forbade the Franciscans to punish Indians or employ them without pay. They granted the Pueblo permission to practice their traditional dances and religious ceremonies. After the Franciscans protested, Lopez and Aguilar were arrested, turned over to the [[Inquisition]], and tried in Mexico City. Thereafter, the Franciscans reigned supreme in the province. Pueblo dissatisfaction with the rule of the clerics was the main cause of the Pueblo revolt.<ref>Sanchez, Joseph P. \"Nicolas de Aguilar and the Jurisdiction of Salinas in the Province of New Mexico, 1659-1662,\" ''Revista Compultense de Historia de America'' Vol. 22, Servicio de Publicaciones, UCM, Madrid, 1996</ref>\n\nThe Spanish in New Mexico were never able to gain dominance over the Indian peoples, who lived among and surrounded them. The isolated colony of New Mexico was characterized by \"elaborate webs of ethnic tension, friendship, conflict, and kinship\" among Indian groups and Spanish colonists. Because of the weakness of New Mexico, \"rank-and-file settlers in outlying areas had to learn to coexist with Indian neighbors without being able to keep them subordinate.\"<ref>James F. Brooks, ''Captives and Cousins: Slavery, Kindship, and Community in the Southwest Borderlands.'' (U of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 32</ref> The Pueblo Indians were the first group to challenge Spanish rule significantly. Later the nomadic Indians, especially the [[Comanche]], mounted attacks that weakened the Spanish.\n\n==Pueblo Revolt of 1680==\n{{Main|Pueblo Revolt}}\nMany of the Pueblo people harbored hostility toward the Spanish, due to their oppression of the Indians and prohibition of their practice of traditional religion. The economies of the pueblos were disrupted, as the people were forced to labor on the [[encomienda]]s of the colonists. The Spanish introduced new farming implements which the Pueblo adopted and provided some measure of security against [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] raiding parties. The Pueblo lived in relative peace with the Spanish from the founding of the Northern New Mexican colony in 1598.<ref>Andrew L. Knaut, ''The Pueblo Revolt of 1680'' (1995)</ref>\n\nIn the 1670s, drought swept the region, causing famine among the Pueblo, and attracting increased attacks from neighboring nomadic tribes trying to gain food supplies. Spanish soldiers were unable to defend the settlements adequately. At the same time, European-introduced diseases caused high mortality among the natives, decimating their communities. Dissatisfied with the protective powers of the Spanish crown and its god of the Catholic Church, the Pueblo returned to their old gods. This provoked a wave of repression on the part of [[Franciscan]] missionaries. Following his arrest on a charge of witchcraft and subsequent release, [[Pop\u00e9]] (or Po-pay) planned and orchestrated the Pueblo Revolt.\n\nAfter being freed, Pop\u00e9 moved to Taos and planned a Pueblo war against the Spaniards. He dispatched runners to all the Pueblos carrying knotted cords, the knots signifying the number of days remaining until the appointed day for them to rise together against the Spaniards. Hearing that the Spaniards had learned of these plans, Pop\u00e9 ordered the attacks advanced to August 13. The Spanish were driven from all but the southern portion of New Mexico. They set up a temporary capital at [[El Paso]] while making preparations to reconquer the rest of the province.<ref>Pedro Ponce, \"Trouble for the Spanish, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680\" [http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2002-11/pueblorevolt.html ''Humanities'', November/December 2002, Volume 23/Number 6] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916111244/http://neh.gov/news/humanities/2002-11/pueblorevolt.html |date=2008-09-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe retreat of the Spaniards left New Mexico controlled by the Indians. Pop\u00e9 ordered the Indians, under penalty of death, to burn or destroy crosses and other Catholic religious imagery, as well as any other vestige of the Spanish culture. He also wanted to destroy Spanish livestock and fruit trees. [[Kivas]] (rooms for religious rituals) were reopened, and Pop\u00e9 ordered all Indians to bathe in soap made of yucca root. He  forbade the planting of Spanish crops of wheat and barley. Pop\u00e9 commanded those Indians married by the rites of the Catholic Church to dismiss their wives, and to take others under their traditional ways. He took over control of the Governor's Palace as ruler of the Pueblo, and collected tribute from each Pueblo until his death in 1688.\n\nFollowing their success, the different Pueblo tribes, separated by hundreds of miles and six different languages, quarreled as to who would occupy Santa Fe and rule over the territory. These power struggles, combined with raids from nomadic tribes and a seven-year drought, weakened the Pueblo strength. In July 1692, [[Diego de Vargas]] led Spanish forces that surrounded Santa Fe, where he called on the Indians to surrender, promising clemency if they would swear allegiance to the King of Spain and return to the Christian faith. The Indian leaders gathered in Santa Fe, met with De Vargas, and agreed to peace.<ref name=\"Knaut, 1995\">Knaut, ''The Pueblo Revolt of 1680'' (1995)</ref>\n\nWhile developing Santa Fe as a trade center, the returning settlers founded [[Albuquerque]] in 1706, naming for the viceroy of New Spain, the Duke of Albuquerque. Prior to its founding, Albuquerque consisted of several [[hacienda]]s and communities along the lower Rio Grande. The settlers constructed the ''Iglesia de San Felipe Neri'' (1706). Development of ranching and some farming in the 18th century were the basis for the culture of many of the state's still-flourishing Hispanics.<ref name=\"Knaut, 1995\"/>\n\nWhile the Pueblo achieved a short-lived independence from the Spaniards, they gained a measure of freedom from future Spanish efforts to impose their culture and religion following the reconquest. The Spanish issued substantial land grants to each Pueblo, and appointed a public defender to protect the rights of the Indians and argue their legal cases in the Spanish courts.<ref name=\"Knaut, 1995\"/>\n\n==Spanish relations with nomadic Indians==\n\nFrom the date of the founding of New Mexico, the Pueblo Indians and Spanish settlers were plagued by hostile relationships with nomadic and semi-nomadic Navajo, Apache, [[Ute people|Ute]], and Comanche Indians.<ref>Charles F. Kenner, ''A History of New Mexican-Plains Indians Relations.''  (U of Oklahoma Press, 1969), p. 18</ref> These tribes raided the more sedentary peoples for livestock, food supplies and stores, and captives to ransom or use as slaves.\n\nThe southwestern Indians developed a horse culture, raiding Spanish ranches and missions for their horses, and ultimately breeding and raising their own herds. The Indian horse culture quickly spread throughout western America. Navajo and Apache raids for horses on Spanish and Pueblo settlements began in the 1650s or earlier.<ref>McNitt, 11</ref> Through the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Indians acquired many horses. By the 1750s the Plains Indians horse culture was well established from [[Texas]] to [[Alberta]], Canada. The Navajo, in addition to being among the first mounted Indians in the U.S., were unique in developing a [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] culture based on sheep stolen from the Spanish. By the early 18th century, the Navajo households typically owned herds of sheep.<ref>McNitt, 23</ref>\n\n===Comancheria===\n[[File:Comancheria.jpg|thumb|''Comancheria prior to 1850.'']]\n\nAfter the Pueblo revolt, the Comanche posed the most serious threat to the Spanish settlers. Scholar H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2008) argues that from the 1750s to the 1850s, the Comanche were the dominant group in the Southwest, and they ruled a domain known as [[Comancheria]]. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen calls it an empire. Confronted with Spanish, Mexican, French, and American outposts on their periphery in New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and Mexico, they worked to increase their own safety, prosperity and power. The Comanche used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Americans, Mexicans, and Indians through cunning, tribute, and kidnappings. The Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanche created a decentralized political system, based on a raiding, hunting and pastoral economy. They created a hierarchical social organization in which young men could advance through their success in war.<ref name=\"Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008 p. 2\">Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, ''The Comanche Empire'' (2008) p. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1706, colonists in New Mexico first recorded the Comanche; by 1719 they were raiding the colony as well as the other Indian tribes. The other tribes had primarily raided for plunder, but the Comanche introduced a new level of violence to the conflict. They preyed on other Indians. The Comanche were pure nomads, well mounted by the 1730s.<ref>\"Frank McLynn, on The Comanche Empire by Pekka Hamalainen.\" ''Literary Review.'' literaryreview.co.uk/mclynn_06_08.html, accessed 16 Nov 2011</ref> They were more elusive and mobile than the semi-nomadic Apache and Navajo, who were dependent upon agriculture or herding for part of their livelihoods.<ref>Kenner, 32</ref> The Comanche both raided and traded with the New Mexicans. They were especially prominent at the annual [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] trade fair, where they peacefully exchanged hides, meat and captive, often before or after raiding other settlements. They endangered the survival of colonial New Mexico, stripping the settlements of horses, forcing the abandonment of many settlements, and in 1778 killing 127 Spanish settlers and Pueblo Indians.<ref>Kenner, 49</ref> Punitive expeditions by the Spanish and their Indian allies against the Comanche were usually ineffective. In 1779 a Spanish and Pueblo Indian force of 560 men, led by [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], surprised a Comanche village near [[Pueblo, Colorado]] and killed Cuerno Verde (Green Horn), the most prominent of the Comanche war leaders.<ref>John, Elizabeth A. H. ''Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds''. Lincoln: U of NE Press, 1975, pp. 584\u2013592</ref> The Comanche subsequently sued for peace with New Mexico, joined the New Mexicans in expedition against their common enemy, the Apache, and turned their attention to raiding Spanish settlements in Texas and northern Mexico. The New Mexicans on their part took care not to re-antagonize the Comanche and lavished gifts on them. The peace between New Mexico and the Comanche endured until the United States conquest of the province in 1846 during the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref>John, pp. 662\u2013676; Kenner pp. 53\u201377</ref>\n\nPeace with the Comanche stimulated a growth in the population of New Mexico; settlements expanded eastward on to the [[Great Plains]]. The inhabitants of these new settlements were mostly ''genizaros'', Indians and the descendants of Indians who had been ransomed from the Comanche.<ref>Kenner 63\u201364</ref> Navajo and Apache raids continued to affect the territory. The Navajo were defeated in 1864 by [[Kit Carson]], but the Apache leader [[Geronimo]] did not surrender until 1886. The Ute had earlier allied with the New Mexicans for mutual protection against the Comanche.\n\nThe Comanche empire collapsed after their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[cholera]], especially in 1849; their population plunged from about 20,000 in the 18th century to 1,500 by 1875, when they surrendered to the U.S. Government. The Comanche no longer had the manpower to deal with the U.S. Army and the wave of white settlers who encroached on their region in the decades after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] ended in 1848.<ref name=\"Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008 p. 2\"/>\n\n==U.S. exploration==\nFollowing [[Lewis and Clark]] many men started exploring and trapping in the western parts of the United States. Sent out in 1806, Lt. [[Zebulon Pike]]'s orders were to find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and [[Red River of the South|Red]] rivers. He was to explore the southwestern part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In 1807, when Pike and his men crossed into the [[San Luis Valley]] of northern New Mexico they were arrested and taken to Santa Fe, and then sent south to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] where they appeared before the Commandant General Salcedo. After four months of diplomatic negotiations, Pike and his men were returned to the United States, under protest, across the Red River at [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]].<ref>For Zebulon Pike's route, see Gerlach, Arch C.

In 1810 catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo instigated a war for independence in central Mexico, a struggle that quickly took on the character of a class war. The following year, military captain Las Casas instigated a coup within the Imperial regime. Sympathizing with the poor underclass, Las Casas opened up a line of dialogue with the revolutionaries. This caused the Spanish elite to instigate its own counter coup and executed Las Casas. For years afterward the regime failed to regain coherency and the mandate to administrate. These ideological struggles affected peripheral New Mexico much less than they did the national center, but it resulted in a sense of alienation with central authority.\n\nFurthermore, in 1818 a longstanding peace between the settled communities of New Mexico and the neighboring nomadic Indian tribes broke down. Just a month after swearing loyalty to the new Mexican government in 1821, governor Melgares led a raid into Navajo country. Isolated from other settled regions and surrounded on all sides by nomadic Indian tribes, New Mexicans tended to a communal sense of imperilment and the placement of security above all other concerns.\n\nFor these reasons it is highly surprising that the transition from Spanish to Mexican rule occurred as peacefully as it did. In New Mexico the event passed with few shows of enthusiasm or partisanship.  Festivals were largely a lackluster affair and held only at the behest of the revolutionary government which expressed that they should be held, \"in all the form and with the magnificence that the oaths of allegiance to the Kings have previously been read\". But there was no renewed civil war and the provisional government was given the grudging support of most of society.\n\nTrade along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] was opened following Mexican independence. With this trade came a new influx of citizens from the United States. Prior to independence, the ''estranjeros'' (foreigners) were not allowed to participate in receiving [[Spanish land grants in New Mexico|land grants]], but now, along with the open trade, a few would become participating owners of these ''merceds'' (grants).<ref>Malcolm Ebright, ''Land Grants and Lawsuits in Northern New Mexico'' University of New Mexico Press (1994)</ref>\n\n===Federalist stage===\n{{Main|Provisional Government of Mexico (1823\u201324)|1824 Constitution of Mexico|First Mexican Republic}}\nIn 1824 a new constitution was drafted, that established Mexico as a federalist republic. A generally liberal minded atmosphere that had pervaded Mexico since independence led to generous grants of local autonomy and limited central power. New Mexico in particular was able to take advantage and to carve out significant privileges in this new system. Classified as a territory as opposed to a state, it had reduced representation in the national government but broad local autonomy.  Because of the advanced age of New Mexican society and its relative sophistication,  it was uniquely placed to take advantage of its position as a frontier but still effecting influence in the rest of the country.\n\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|240px|Province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]] when it belonged to Mexico in 1824]]\nOne of the defining features of the Mexican period in the history of New Mexico was the attempt to instill a nationalist sentiment.  This was a tremendous challenge considering the nature of identity in Mexico during the Spanish empire. Under the official dictates of the empire, subjects were classified in terms of ethnicity, class and position in society. Between these legal distinctions kept groups separate and movement between groups was regulated. Ethnic Europeans of course made up the upper crust of this system with Peninsulars, those born in Spain itself, comprising the true elite while Mexican born Europeans, the creoles, were ranked just below them. At the bottom were the masses of Indians and Mestizos, who had few legal rights and protections against the abuse of their superiors.\n\nIn contrast the new 'Mexican' elite attempted to create a common identity between all classes and ethnicities.  Embracing an incredibly wide range of peoples and cultures, from nomadic Indians to the high society of Mexico City, this was incredibly ambitious and met with mixed success. In New Mexico, there was already a highly structured and differentiated society at the time of independence, unique along the Mexican frontier. At the top were ethnic Europeans who then merged with a large community of Hispanics. The more Indian blood you possessed, the lower on the social scale you tended to reside until the bottom was made of settled Pueblo communities and the nomadic Indians who existed outside of the polity.\n\nNationalists attempted to establish equality, if only legally, between these disparate groups. The local autonomy New Mexicans had established inhibited these endeavors and throughout the Mexican period the elite continued to maintain their privileges. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of New Mexico were able to adapt their old identity as Spanish subjects to Mexican nationals. Instead of a purely modern liberal sense of identity, this adapted Spanish feudalism to a geographic area. The evidence of this success in nationalism can be seen in the Pueblo myth of Montezuma. This held that the original Aztec homeland lay in New Mexico, and the original king of the Aztecs was a Pueblo. This creates a symbolic, and completely artificial, connection between the Mexican center and an isolated frontier society.\n\n===Centralist stage and collapse===\n{{Main|Siete Leyes|Centralist Republic of Mexico}}\nThe federalist and liberal atmosphere that pervaded Mexican thought since independence fell apart in the mid-1830s. Across the political spectrum there was the perception that the previous system had failed and needed readjustment. This led to the dissolution of the 1824 constitution and the drafting of a new one based on centralist lines. As Mexico drifted farther and farther toward despotism, the national project began to fail and the nation fell into a crisis.\n\nAlong the frontier, formerly autonomous societies reacted aggressively to a newly assertive central government. The most independent province, Texas, declared its independence in 1835, triggering the sequence of events that led directly to Mexico's collapse. The [[Revolt of 1837 (New Mexico)|Revolt of 1837]] in New Mexico itself overthrew and executed the centrally appointed governor and demanded increased regional authority. This revolt was defeated within New Mexican society itself by [[Manuel Armijo]]. This was motivated not by nationalist sentiment but by the class antagonism within New Mexican society. When central rule was reestablished, it was done so on Armijo's lines (he became governor) and he ruled the province with even greater autonomy than any other time during the Mexican period.\n\nAs the situation within central Mexico fell further and further into confusion, New Mexico began to draw closer economically to the United States. This was epitomized in the growth in traffic and prominence of the [[Santa Fe Trail]] as a means of communication and trade. In the mid-1830s New Mexico began to function as a trading hub between the United States, central [[Mexico]] and [[Mexican California]]. Merchants making their way over the [[Great Plains]] would stop in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], where they would meet with their counterparts from Los Angeles and Mexico City. The result was that as central Mexico fell into turmoil, New Mexico grew economically and trade ties strengthened with the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1845 the governorship of Armijo was interrupted when the regime of [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] replaced him as governor with political outsider [[Mariano Mart\u00ednez de Lejanza]]. In the growing threat of war with the United States, the national center sought to bring the frontier under tight control as it is there that any war would be fought. Most New Mexicans distrusted the central government by now but that soon turned to fury when, one year into his reign, Martinez sparked a needless war with a neighboring Indian tribe out of incompetence and na\u00efvet\u00e9. To prevent revolution, Martinez was swiftly removed and Armijo reinstated, but any confidence the central government still enjoyed was completely destroyed.\n\nThe following year rumors arrived in New Mexico that the Mexican government was planning on selling the territory to the United States. There was so little trust in the central government by this point that instead of investigating these rumors (which were completely false) leading members of New Mexican society drafted a threat of secession to the government. This stated that if any such actions were taken then New Mexico would declare independence as ''[[La Rep\u00fablica Mexicana del Norte]]''. It was not until invading American troops reached New Mexico in August 1846 that they learned of war with the United States.\n\n===Texas===\n{{Main|Republic of Texas|Texas annexation}}\nThe Republic of Texas seceded from Mexico in 1836 and claimed but never controlled territory as far south and west as the [[Rio Grande]]. While most of the northwestern territory was then the [[Comancheria]], it would have included Santa Fe and divided New Mexico. The only attempt to realize the claim was [[Texian]] [[Presidents of the Republic of Texas|President]] [[Mirabeau Lamar]]'s [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|Santa Fe Expedition]], which failed spectacularly. The wagon train, supplied for a journey of about half the actual distance between Austin and Santa Fe, followed the wrong river, back-tracked, and arrived in New Mexico to find the Mexican governor restored and hostile. Surrendering peaceably upon a pledge to be allowed to return the way they came, the Texians found themselves bound at gunpoint and their execution put to a vote of the garrison. By one vote, they were spared and marched south to [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and then [[Mexico City]].\n\n==United States control==\n[[File:Tierra o muerte.jpg|thumb|128px|left|Tierra O Muerte \u2013 Land or Death. Some New Mexicans express dissatisfaction over land grant issues which date back to the Mexican War.]]\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\nIn 1846, during the Mexican\u2013American War, American General [[Stephen W. Kearny]] marched down the Santa Fe Trail and entered [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] without opposition to establish a joint civil and military government. Kearny's invasion force consisted of his army of 300 cavalry men of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|First Dragoons]], about 1600 Missouri volunteers in the First and Second Regiments of Fort Leavenworth, Missouri Mounted Cavalry, and the 500 man [[Mormon Battalion]]. Kearny appointed Charles Bent, a Santa Fe trail trader living in Taos, as acting civil governor. He then divided his forces into four commands: one, under Colonel [[Sterling Price]], appointed military governor, was to occupy and maintain order in New Mexico with his approximately 800 men; a second group under Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan]], with a little over 800 men was ordered to capture [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico and then join up with [[John E. Wool|General Wool]];<ref>[http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/dawdon.html Joseph G.

The [[Mormon Battalion]], mostly marching on foot under Lt. Col. [[Philip St. George Cooke]], was directed to follow Kearny with wagons to establish a new southern route to California.\n\n[[File:Kearny-Las-Vegas-Aug-1846-engraving-1882.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Gen. Kearny's [[annexation]] of New Mexico, August 15, 1846]]\nWhen Kearny encountered [[Kit Carson]], traveling East and bearing messages that California had already been subdued, he sent nearly 200 of his dragoons back to New Mexico. In California about 400 men of the [[California Battalion]] under [[John C. Fremont]] and another 400 men under Commodore [[Robert Stockton]] of the U.S. Navy and Marines had taken control of the approximately 7,000 Californios from [[San Diego]] to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. New Mexico territory, which then included present-day Arizona, was under undisputed United States control, but the exact boundary with Texas was uncertain. Texas initially claimed all land North of the Rio Grande; but later agreed to the present boundaries.\n\nKearny protected citizens in the new US territories under a form of martial law called the [[Kearny code|Kearny Code]]; it was essentially Kearny and the U.S. Army's promise that the US would respect existing religious and legal claims, and maintain law and order. The Kearny Code became one of the bases of New Mexico's legal code during its territorial period, which was one of the longest in United States history. Many of the provisions remain substantially unchanged today.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nKearny's arrival in New Mexico had been essentially without conflict; the governor surrendered without battle, and the Mexican authorities took the money they could find and retreated south into Mexico. However, the U.S. occupation was resented by the New Mexicans. Provisional governor [[Charles Bent]], a longtime resident of New Mexico, implored U.S. army officers to \"respect the rights of the inhabitants\" and predicted \"serious consequences\" if measures were not taken to prevent abuses.<ref>Lavender, David. ''Bent's Fort.'' Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, p. 273</ref> His warning was prophetic, as New Mexican and Pueblo Indian rebels were soon to begin the [[Taos Revolt]].\n\nOn January 19, 1847 rebels attacked and killed acting Governor Bent and about ten other American officials. The wives of Bent and Kit Carson, however, managed to escape. Reacting quickly, a U.S. detachment under Colonel [[Sterling Price]] marched on Taos and attacked. The rebels retreated to a thick-walled [[adobe]] church. U.S. forces breached a wall and directed concentrated cannon fire into the church. About 150 of the rebels were killed, and 400 captured, following close fighting. During one trial, six rebels were arraigned and tried, of whom five were convicted of murder and one of treason. All six were hanged in April, 1847. A young traveler and later author, [[Lewis Hector Garrard]], wrote the only eyewitness account of this trial and hanging. He criticized, \"It certainly did appear to be a great assumption on the part of the Americans to conquer a country, and then arraign the revolting inhabitants for treason ... Treason, indeed! What did the poor devil know about his new allegiance? But so it was; and, as the jail was overstocked with others awaiting trial, it was deemed expedient to hasten the execution ... I left the room, sick at heart. Justice! out upon the word, when its distorted meaning is the warrant for murdering those who defend to the last their country and their homes.\"<ref>Garrard, Lewis H.[https://archive.org/stream/wahtoyahtaostrai00garr/wahtoyahtaostrai00garr_djvu.txt ''Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail.''] H. W. Derby & Co., A. S. Barnes & Co. (1850) p. 197\u2013198</ref> Additional executions followed to total at least 28.\n\nPrice fought three more engagements with the rebels, which included many Pueblo Indians, who wanted to push the Americans from the territory. By mid-February he had the revolt well under control. President [[James K. Polk]] promoted Price to a [[Brevet (military)|brevet rank]] of Brigadier General for his service. Total fatalities amounted to more than 300 New Mexican native rebels and about 30 ''Anglos'', as non-Latino whites are commonly called in the southwest to this day.\n\n===Provisional government===\n{{main|U.S. provisional government of New Mexico}}\n\n===Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo===\n{{Main|Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo}}\nUnder the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, Mexico ceded much of its mostly unsettled northern holdings, today known as the [[American Southwest]] and [[California]], to the United States of America in exchange for an end to hostilities, and the American evacuation of Mexico City and many other areas under its control. Under this treaty, Mexico recognized Texas as a part of the United States. Mexico also received $15 million cash, plus the assumption of slightly more than $3 million in outstanding Mexican debts.\n\nNew Mexico, the new name for the region between Texas and California, became a US territory. The Senate struck out Article X of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which said that vast land grants in New Mexico (nearly always gifts by the local authorities to their friends) would all be recognized. The treaty promised to protect the ownership rights of the heirs of the land grants. The decision to strike down Article X eventually led to court cases in which the US removed millions of acres of land, timber, and water from Mexican-issued land grants and placed them back in the public domain.<ref>Richard Griswold del Castillo, ''The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: A Legacy of Conflict'' (1992)</ref> But, Correia points out that the lands involved had typically never been occupied or controlled by the men who had the grants; most were in Indian-controlled areas.<ref>David Correia, ''Properties of Violence: Law and Land Grant Struggle in Northern New Mexico'' (2013)</ref>\n\nThe residents could choose whether they remain and receive United States citizenship or remove to Mexico and retain (or gain) Mexican citizenship. All but 1000 or so settlers\u2014who were mostly Mexican government officials\u2014chose American citizenship, which included full voting rights.<ref>Linda C. Noel,  \"'I am an American': Anglos, Mexicans, Nativos, and the National Debate over Arizona and New Mexico Statehood,\" ''Pacific Historical Review'', (Aug 2011) 80#3 pp 430-467, at p 436</ref> Because at the time only white men could vote in most states, the Mexicans were considered white under the law.\n\nIn later decades, as discrimination by whites increased in numerous areas in relation to growth in the number of Mexican immigrants, some states tried to classify Hispanics as black or colored, and thus exclude them from voting because of barriers to voter registration. These practices were challenged in the mid-20th century and resolved in a case that reached the US Supreme Court.\n\n===American Territory===\n{{Main|New Mexico Territory|Gadsden Purchase}}\n\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|right|Proposals for Texas northwestern boundary]]\n[[File:Boundaries of State of New Mexico proposed in 1850.png|thumb|right|[[New Mexico]] proposed boundary before [[Compromise of 1850]]]]The Congressional [[Compromise of 1850]] halted a bid for statehood under a proposed antislavery constitution. Texas transferred eastern New Mexico to the federal government, settling a lengthy boundary dispute. Under the compromise, the American government established the [[New Mexico Territory]] on September 9, 1850. The territory, which included all of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]] and parts of [[Colorado]], officially established its capital at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1851. The U.S. territorial New Mexico census of 1850 found 61,547 people living in all the territory of New Mexico. The people of New Mexico would determine whether to permit slavery under a proposed constitution at statehood, but the status of slavery during the territorial period provoked considerable debate. The granting of statehood was up to a Congress sharply divided on the slavery issue. Some (including [[Stephen A. Douglas]]) maintained that the territory could not restrict slavery, as under the earlier [[Missouri Compromise]], while others (including [[Abraham Lincoln]]) insisted that older Mexican legal traditions, which forbade slavery, took precedence. Regardless of its official status, black slavery was rarely seen in New Mexico although Indian slavery was common. Statehood was finally granted to New Mexico on January 6, 1912.\n\nNavajo and Apache raids and plundering led [[Kit Carson]] to abandon his intent to retire to a sheep ranch near [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] after the Mexican\u2013American War. Carson accepted an 1853 appointment as U.S. Indian agent with a headquarters at Taos, and fought the Indians with notable success.\n\nThe United States acquired the southwestern boot heel of the state and southern Arizona below the Gila river in the mostly desert [[Gadsden Purchase]] of 1853. This purchase was desired when it was found that a much easier route for a proposed transcontinental railroad was located slightly south of the Gila river. This territory had not been explored or mapped when the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was negotiated in 1848. The ever-present Santa Anna was in power again in 1853 and needed the money from the Gadsden Purchase to fill his coffers and to pay the Mexican Army for that year. The Southern Pacific built the second transcontinental railroad though this purchased land in 1881.\n\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives]] the [[Corwin amendment|Committee of Thirty-Three]] on January 14, 1861 reported that it had reached majority agreement on a [[constitutional amendment]] to protect slavery where it existed and the immediate admission of [[New Mexico Territory]] as a [[slave state]]. This latter proposal would result in a de facto extension of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line for all existing territories below the line.<ref>Klein, Maury. ''Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War.''  (1997) {{ISBN|0-679-44747-4}}. pg.405-410</ref>\nAfter the [[Peace Conference of 1861]], a bill for New Mexico statehood was tabled by a vote of 115 to 71 with opposition coming from both Southerners and Republicans.\n\n====Media====\nThe first newspaper in New Mexico was ''El Crepusculo de la Libertad''  (\"The Dawn of Liberty\"), a Spanish-language paper founded in 1834 at Taos. The Santa Fe ''Republican'', founded in 1847, was the first English-language newspaper. By 2000 the state had 18 daily newspapers, 13 Sunday newspapers, and 25 weekly newspapers. Today's daily papers include the ''Albuquerque Journal'', the ''Santa Fe New Mexican'' (founded in 1849), the ''Las Cruces Sun-News'', the ''Roswell Record'', the ''Farmington Daily Times'', and the ''Deming Headlight''. The most widely broadcast radio station since its founding in 1922 has been [[KKOB (AM)]] in Albuquerque. With 50,000 watts of transmitter power on a clear channel it reaches audiences in most of New Mexico and parts of neighboring states.<ref>Paul L. Hain et al.,  ''New Mexico Government'' (1994) p. 257</ref> There are at least five television stations, based in Albuquerque, representing ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, and Fox.\n\n====Civil War====\n{{Main|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War}}\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Confederate troops from Texas commanded by Gen. [[Henry Hopkins Sibley|Henry Sibley]] briefly occupied southern New Mexico in July 1861, pushing up the Rio Grande valley as far as [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] by February 1862. Defeated in the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], they were forced to withdraw south. Union troops from California under Gen. [[James Carleton]] re-captured the territory in August 1862. As Union troops were withdrawn to fight elsewhere, [[Kit Carson]] helped to organize and command the [[1st New Mexican Volunteers]] to engage in campaigns against the [[Apache]], [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], and [[Comanche]] in New Mexico and Texas as well as participating in the [[Battle of Valverde]] against the Confederates. Confederate troops withdrew after the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] where [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regulars, Colorado Volunteers (The Pikes Peakers), and New Mexican Volunteers defeated them. The [[Arizona Territory]] was split off as a separate territory in 1863.\n\n[[File:AZ-NM1867.jpg|300px|thumb|left|1867 map]]\n\n====Indians====\nCenturies of continued conflict with the [[Apache]] and the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] continued to plague New Mexico. In 1864, the U.S. Army trapped and captured the main Navajo forces, forcing them onto a small reservation in eastern New Mexico in what is called the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]], also called the '''Long Walk to Bosque Redondo.''' This put an end to their livestock raids on New Mexican farms, ranches, and Indian pueblos. After several years of severe hardships, during which many Navajos died, they were allowed in 1868 to return to most of their lands. Sporadic Apache small-scale raiding continued until Apache chief [[Geronimo]] finally was captured and imprisoned in 1886.<ref>Thompson, Gerald Thompson, ''The Army and the Navajo: The Bosque Redondo Reservation Experiment 1863\u20131868'' (1976)</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Army set up a chain of forts to protect the people and the caravans of commerce. Most tribes were relocated on reservations near the forts, where they were given food and supplies by the federal government. Often supplies and annuities were late, or food spoiled.\n\n====The new legal system and the legal profession====\nIn the first half of the 19th century, Mexico set up a judicial system for its northernmost districts, in present-day New Mexico and California. There were no professionally trained lawyers or judges. Instead, there were numerous low-ranking legal roles such as ''notario, escribano, asesor, auditor de Querra, justicia mayor, procurador,'' and ''juez receptor.'' With the annexation by the United States in 1848, Congress set up an entirely new territorial legal systems, one that used the English language and American laws, forms, and procedures.  Practically all the lawyers and judges were new arrivals from the United States, as there was no place in the new system for the old Hispanic roles.<ref>Joseph Webb McKnight, \"Law Without Lawyers on the Hispano-Mexican Frontier\" ''West Texas Historical Association'' (1990), Vol. 66, pp 51-65.</ref>\n\n[[Elfego Baca]] (1865 \u2013 1945) was an outlaw-turned-lawman, lawyer, and politician in New Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1888, after serving as a County Sheriff, Baca became a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]]. He served for two years and then began studying law. In December 1894, he was admitted to the bar and practice law in New Mexico until 1904. he held numerous local political offices, and when New Mexico became a state in 1912, he was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress. In the late 1950s, Walt Disney turned Baca into the first Hispanic popular culture hero in the United States, on 10 television shows, in six comic books, in a feature film, and in related merchandising. However, Disney deliberately avoided ethnic tension by presenting Baca as a generalized Western hero, portraying a standard hero similar to [[Davy Crockett]], in Hispanic dress.<ref>Ferenc Morton Szasz, \"A New Mexican\" Davy Crockett\": Walt Disney's version of the Life and Legend of Elfego Baca.\" ''Journal of the Southwest'' (2006) 48#3: 261-274. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40170324  excerpt]</ref>\n\n====Las Gorras Blancas====\nAfter the Mexican\u2013American War, Anglo Americans began migrating in large numbers to all of the newly acquired territory. Anglos began taking lands from both [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and Nuevomexicanos by different means, most notably by [[squatting]]. Squatters often then sold these lands to land speculators for huge profits, especially after the passage of the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] encouraging development in the West. Nuevomexicanos demanded the return of their lands, but the governments did not respond favorably. For example, the Surveyor of General Claims Office on [[New Mexico]] would at times take up to fifty years to process a claim, meanwhile, the lands were being grabbed up by the newcomers. The first Surveyor General, William Pelham, had two translators assisting him: David Miller and David Whiting. But these two men seemingly did not cut into the fifty years needed to translate.\n\nWhile the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], and [[Topeka]] railroad was built in the 1890s, speculators known as the [[Santa Fe Ring]], orchestrated schemes to dislodge natives from their lands. In response, Nuevomexicanos gathered to reclaim lands taken by [[Anglos]].<ref>Rosales, F. Arturo. ''Chicano: The History of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement'' (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1997) p. 7-9</ref> Hoping to scare off the new immigrants, they eventually used [[intimidation]] and [[Raid (military)|raid]]s to accomplish their goals. They sought to develop a class-based consciousness among local people through the everyday tactics of resistance to the economic and social order confronting common property land grant communities. They called themselves [[Las Gorras Blancas]], a name referring to the [[white]] [[head covering]]s many wore.\n\n====Gilded Age====\n[[File:Lamy Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Bronze statue of Archbishop Lamy in front of St. Francis Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1851 the Vatican appointed [[Jean-Baptiste Lamy]] (1814\u20131888), a French cleric, as bishop of  the diocese of Sante Fe. There were only nine priests at first; Lamy brought in many more. In 1875 it was upgraded to the status of archdiocese, with supervision over Catholic affairs in  New Mexico and Arizona. Lamy had St. Francis Cathedral built in a French style; the work was conducted between 1869 and 1886.<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Lamy of Santa Fe'' (2003)</ref>\n\nTo provide the forts and reservations with food, the federal government contracted for thousands of head of cattle, and Texas cattlemen began entering New Mexico with their herds. Rancher Charles Goodnight blazed the first cattle trail through New Mexico in 1866, extending from the Pecos River northward into Colorado and Wyoming. Over it more than 250,000 head of cattle trailed to market. [[John Chisum]] also brought his herds up the Pecos. As employer of the desperado [[Billy the Kid]], he figured prominently in the [[Lincoln County War]] of 1878\u20131880. This was one of the many struggles between cattle herders and territorial officials, among rival cattle barons, and between sheep ranchers and cattle ranchers during this period. The [[Butterfield Trail]], the longest of the cattle trails, had its first important stop in New Mexico at Fort Fillmore. It began operations in 1858 and was superseded by railroad operations in 1881.\n\nThe [[Santa Fe Railroad]] reached New Mexico in 1878, with the first locomotive crossing Raton Pass that December. It reached [[Lamy, New Mexico]], 16 miles (26&nbsp;km) from Santa Fe in 1879 and Santa Fe itself in 1880, and Deming in 1881, thereby replacing the storied [[Santa Fe Trail]] as a way to ship cattle to market. The new town of Albuquerque, platted in 1880 as the Santa Fe Railroad extended westward, quickly enveloped the old town. The rival [[Southern Pacific]] was completed between the Rio Grande valley and the Arizona border in 1881.\n\nFrom 1880 to 1910 the territory grew rapidly. With the coming of the railroad, many homesteaders moved to New Mexico. In 1886 the New Mexico Education Association of school teachers was organized; in 1889 small state colleges were established at Albuquerque, Las Cruces, and Socorro; and in 1891 the first effective public school law was passed. An irrigation project in the Pecos River valley in 1889 marked the first of many such projects to irrigate farms in the dry state. Discovery of artesian waters at Roswell in 1890 gave both farming and mining a boost. The power of the cattle barons faded as much land was fenced in at the expense of the open range. The cattle ranchers and sheep ranchers also learned to tolerate one other, and both the cattle and sheep industries expanded. Mining became even more important, especially gold and silver. Coal mining developed during the 1890s, primarily to supply the railroads, and oil was discovered in Eddy County in 1909. The population of New Mexico reached 195,000 in 1910.\n\nConflicting land claims led to bitter quarrels among the original Spanish inhabitants, cattle ranchers, and newer homesteaders. Despite destructive overgrazing, ranching survived as a mainstay of the New Mexican economy.\n\n==Statehood==\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\nOn January 6, 1912, after years of debate on whether the population of New Mexico was fully assimilated into American culture, or too immersed in corruption, President [[William Howard Taft]] twisted arms in Congress and it approved admission of New Mexico as the 47th state of the Union.<ref>David V. Holtby, ''Forty-Seventh Star: New Mexico's Struggle for Statehood'' (2013)</ref> The admission of neighboring Arizona on February 14, 1912 completed the contiguous 48 states. Thousands of Mexicans fled north during the extremely bloody civil war that broke out in Mexico in 1911. In 1916 Mexican military leader [[Pancho Villa]] led an invasion across the border into [[Columbus, New Mexico]], where they burned some homes and killed several Americans.\n\nNew Mexico contributed some 17,000 men to the armed services during World War I. Thousands more from the state fought for the Allies during World War II.\n\n===Artists and writers===\nWhen the mainline of the railroad bypassed Santa Fe, the city lost businesses and population. In the 20th century, American and British artists and writers, and retirees were attracted to the cultural richness of the area, the beauty of the landscapes, and dry warm climate. Local leaders took the opportunity to promote the city's heritage making it a tourist attraction. The city sponsored bold architectural restoration projects and erected new buildings according to traditional techniques and styles, thus creating the \"Santa Fe style.\"   Edgar L. Hewett, founder and first director of the School of American Research and the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, was a leading promoter. He began the Santa Fe Fiesta in 1919 and the Southwest Indian Fair in 1922 (now known as the Indian Market). When he tried to attract a summer program for Texas women, many artists rebelled saying the city should not promote artificial tourism at the expense of its artistic culture. The writers and artists formed the Old Santa Fe Association and defeated the plan. The old \"mud city\" - which short-sighted modernizers laughed at for its adobe houses - was transformed into a city proud of its peculiarities and its blend of tradition and modernity.<ref>Carter Jones Meyer, \"The Battle between 'Art' and 'Progress': Edgar L. Hewett and the Politics of Region in the Early-Twentieth-Century Southwest,\" ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'', September 2006, Vol. 56 Issue 3, pp 47-61</ref>\n\n===Nuevomexicanos===\n{{Main|Nuevomexicanos}}\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Anglos tried to regulate the Hispanics living in New Mexico to second-class social status, due to xenophobia and prejudice. Some of these Anglos were ethnocentric, deprecating Hispanic/Mexican culture and disputing the rights of the original inhabitants. Richard Nostrand strongly disputes claims that this treatment caused the Hispanics to construct a \"Spanish American\" identity in response, in an early instance of expressing being American through ethnic identity.<ref>Richard L. Nostrand, ''The Hispano Homeland'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1996)</ref>\n\n[[United States home front during World War I|World War I]] gave the Hispanics the opportunity to demonstrate American citizenship by participating in the war effort. Like the \"new immigrants\" in northeastern cities, who also constructed dual identities, members of the [[Nuevomexicano]] middle class exuberantly participated in the war effort. They melded images of their heritage with patriotic symbols of America, especially in the Spanish-language press. Nuevomexicano politicians and community leaders recruited the rural masses into the war cause overseas and on the home front, including the struggle for woman suffrage. Support from New Mexico's Anglo establishment aided their efforts. Their wartime contributions improved the conditions of minority citizenship for Nuevomexicanos but did not entirely eliminate social inequality. For example, no Hispanics \u2014not even the son of a politician\u2014 were allowed to be a member of a fraternity at the state university.<ref>Phillip Gonzales and Ann Massmann, \"Loyalty Questioned: Nuevomexicanos in the Great War.\" ''Pacific Historical Review'', November 2006, Vol. 75 Issue 4, pp 629-666</ref><ref>Phillip B. Gonzales, \"Spanish Heritage and Ethnic Protest in New Mexico: The Anti-Fraternity Bill of 1933,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1986, Vol. 61 Issue 4, pp 281-299</ref>\n\nThe Anglos and Hispanics cooperated because both prosperous and poor Hispanics could vote and they outnumbered the Anglos. Around 1920, the term \"Spanish-American\" replaced \"Mexican\" in polite society and in political debate. The new term served both the interests of both groups. For Spanish speakers, it evoked Spain, not Mexico, recalling images of a romantic colonial past and suggesting a future of equality in Anglo-dominated America. For Anglos, on the other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a \"Mexican\" land suggested the violence and disorder associated with that country's civil war in the early 20th century. This had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign. The new term gave the impression that \"Spanish Americans\" belonged to a true \"American\" political culture, making the established order appear all the more democratic.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27502746?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Charles Montgomery, \"Becoming 'Spanish-American': Race and Rhetoric in New Mexico Politics, 1880\u20131928\"], ''Journal of American Ethnic History'', Summer 2001, Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp. 59-84; via JSTOR; accessed 18 July 2016</ref>\n\n===New arrivals===\n[[File:Russellpiea.jpg|thumb|230px|Serving food in [[Pie Town, New Mexico]], 1940]]\nIn the 20th century immigrants and migrants brought new skills, outlooks and values, modernizing the highly traditional culture of the state. They included Midwestern farmers who tried to cultivate humid-area crops to the desert climate, Texas oilmen, [[tuberculosis]] patients who sought healing in the dry air (before an appropriate antibiotic was discovered),<ref>Nancy Owen Lewis, \"High and Dry in New Mexico: Tuberculosis and the Politics of Health,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', 87 (Spring 2012), 129\u201366.</ref> artists who made Taos a national cultural center, [[New Deal]]ers who sought to modernize the state as fast as possible and improve infrastructure, soldiers and airmen from all over who came for training at the many military bases, noted scientists who came to Los Alamos to build a super weapon, and stayed on, and retirees from colder climes. They brought money and new ideas. The state residents gradually adopted more of a standard national culture, losing some of its unique qualities.<ref>Michael Welsh, \"New Mexico at Seventy Five: A Historical Commentary,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1987, Vol. 62 Issue 4, pp 387-396</ref>\n\nThe building for the State Supreme Court was constructed during the [[Great Depression]] as a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project, completed in 1937. It's an example of the numerous projects which the Democratic administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] collaborated on with states in order to improve infrastructure, invest in facilities, and put people to work. Prior to that project, the Supreme Court met in the basement of the state capitol.\n\n===Women's suffrage===\nThe suffrage movement in the state worked hard to get women the vote but were stymied by the conservatism of politicians and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe|Catholic Church]]. New Mexico's legislature was one of the last in 1920 to ratify the [[19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. After it passed, there was quickly a dramatic increase in political participation by both Anglo and Hispanic women, as well as strong mobilization efforts by the major parties to gain the support of the female voters.<ref>Joan Jensen, \"Disfranchisement is a Disgrace\": Women and Politics in New Mexico, 1900\u20131940,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Winter 1981, Vol. 56 Issue 1, pp 5-35</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nNew Mexico proportionately suffered the loss of more servicemen than any other state in the nation. The state led in the national war bond drive and had fifty federal installations, including glider and bombardier training schools. The state rapidly modernized during the war, as 65,000 young men (and 700 young women) joined the services, where they received a wide range of technical training and saw the outside world, many for the first time. Federal spending brought wartime prosperity, along with high wages, jobs for everyone, rationing and shortages. Federal facilities have continued to be major contributors to the state's economy in the postwar years.<ref>Ferenc M. Szasz and George E. Webb, \"The New Mexican Response to the End of the Second World War,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Winter 2008, Vol. 83 Issue 1, pp 1-37</ref>\n\nThe top secret remote [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Research Center]] was developed in the mountains of New Mexico as a research facility, opening in 1943 for the purpose of developing the world's first [[atomic bomb]]. Teams of scientists and engineers were recruited to work on this project. The first test at Trinity Site in the desert of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, now known as [[White Sands Missile Range]], 28 miles southeast of [[San Antonio]], New Mexico, on July 16, 1945 ushered in the atomic age. New Mexico had become a center of world-class science.  High-altitude balloon experiments from [[Holloman Air Force Base]] caused debris found near [[Roswell, New Mexico]] ([[The Roswell Incident]]) in 1947. This reputedly led to the persistent (but unproven) claims by a few individuals that the government had captured and concealed extraterrestrial corpses and equipment.\n\nAlbuquerque expanded rapidly after the war. The state quickly emerged as a leader in nuclear, solar, and geothermal energy research and development. The [[Sandia National Laboratories]], founded in 1949, carried out nuclear research and special weapons development at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] south of Albuquerque and at [[Livermore, California]].\n\n===Environmentalism===\nSince the late 19th century, New Mexico and other arid Western states have sought to assert sovereign control over water allocation policies within their boundaries. In the 1990s the legislature debated H.R. 128, the proposed State Water Sovereignty Protection Act. Since the passage of the [[Newlands Act]] in 1902, Western states have benefited from federal water projects. In spite of these projects, water allocation remained a politically charged issue throughout the 20th century. Most states have sought to limit federal control over water distribution, preferring instead to allocate water under the discredited doctrine of prior appropriation.<ref>Hana Samek Norton, \"'Fantastical Assumptions': A Centennial Overview of Water Use in New Mexico,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1998, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp 371-387</ref>\n\nAs a state dependent on both smokestack industry and scenic tourism, New Mexico was at the center of the debates over clean air legislation, particularly the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1967  and its amendments in 1970 and 1977. The [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]], which operated a large smelter at [[Hurley, New Mexico]], generating as a byproduct thick clouds of air pollution, led the opposition to the environmentalists, represented by the [[New Mexico Citizens for Clean Air and Water]]. Eventually the company was forced to comply with fairly strict federal standards. They often delayed the compliance process for years by threatening economic repercussions, such as plant closings and unemployment, if forced to comply with standards.<ref>\nChristopher J.

The earliest peoples had migrated from northern areas of North America after leaving Siberia via the [[Bering Land Bridge]]. Artifacts and architecture demonstrate ancient complex cultures in this region.\n\nThe first written records of the region were made by the Spanish [[Conquistadors]], who encountered Native American [[Pueblo]]s when they explored the area in the 16th century. Since that time, the [[Spanish Empire]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]] (since 1848) have claimed [[Territorial evolution of New Mexico|control of the area]].\n\nThe area was governed as [[New Mexico Territory]] until 1912, when it was admitted as a state. The relatively isolated state had an economy dependent on mining. Its residents and government suffered from a reputation for corruption and extreme traditionalism. New Mexico introduced the atomic age in 1945, as the first [[nuclear weapons]] were developed by the federal government in the research center it established at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]].

After the invention of agriculture, the land was inhabited by the [[Ancestral Puebloans]], who built houses out of stone or adobe bricks.

From those people arose the historic [[Pueblo people]]s who lived primarily along the few major rivers.

By 1050 AD, they had developed planned villages composed of large terraced buildings, each with many rooms. These apartment-house villages were often constructed on defensive sites- on ledges of massive rock, on flat summits, or on steep-sided mesas, locations that would afford the Anasazi protection from their Northern enemies. The largest of these villages, [[Pueblo Bonito]], in the [[Chaco Canyon]] of New Mexico, contained around 700 rooms in five stories and may have housed as many as 1000 persons.<ref>Nash, Gary B.

Chapter 1, pg. 4</ref> No larger apartment-house type construction would be seen on the continent until 19th century Chicago and New York. Then, around 1150, Chaco Anasazi society began to unravel. Long before the Spanish arrival, descendants of the Anasazi were using irrigation canals, check dams and hillside terracing as techniques for bringing water to what had for centuries been an arid, agriculturally marginal area. At the same time, the ceramic industry became more elaborate, cotton replaced yucca fiber as the main clothing material and basket weaving became more artistic.<ref name=\"Nash, Gary B. 2015. pg. 5\">Nash, Gary B.

[[Cabeza de Vaca]] in 1535, one of only four survivors of the [[Panfilo de Narvaez]] expedition of 1527, tells of hearing Indians talk about fabulous cities somewhere in New Mexico. [[Marcos de Niza|Fray Marcos de Niza]] enthusiastically identified these as the fabulously rich [[Quivira and C\u00edbola|Seven Cities of C\u00edbola]], the mythical seven cities of gold. [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] led a massive expedition to find these cities in 1540\u20131542. Coronado camped near an excavated pueblo today preserved as [[Coronado National Memorial]] in 1541. The Spanish maltreatment of the Pueblo and [[Athabaskan]] people that started with their explorations of the upper Rio Grande valley led to hostility that impeded the Spanish conquest of New Mexico for centuries.<ref>Herbert Eugene Bolton, ''Coronado: Knight of Pueblos and Plains'' (1949) [https://www.questia.com/read/3724526/coronado-knight-of-pueblos-and-plains online]</ref>\n\nThe three largest pueblos of New Mexico are [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zu\u00f1i]], [[Santo Domingo Pueblo, New Mexico|Santo Domingo]], and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]]. There are three different languages spoken by the pueblos.\n\n==Athabaskans-Apachean==\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] peoples are members of the large [[Athabaskan]] language family, which includes peoples in Alaska and Canada, and along the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe historic peoples encountered by the Europeans did not make up unified tribes in the modern sense, as they were highly decentralized, operating in bands of a size adapted to their semi-nomadic cultures. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, the European explorers, missionaries, traders and settlers referred to the different groups of Apache and Navajo by various names, often associated with distinctions of language or geography. These Athabaskan peoples identified themselves as ''Din\u00e9'', which means \"the people\". The Navajo and Apache made up the largest non-Pueblo Indian group in the Southwest. These two tribes led nomadic lifestyles and spoke the same language.<ref>R. M. Underhill, ''The Navahos'' (1956)</ref><ref>James J.

Spanish records indicated that they traded with the Pueblo. Various bands or tribes participated in the Southwestern Revolt against the Spanish in the 1680s. By the early 18th century the Spanish had built a series of over 25 forts to protect themselves and subjugated populations from the traditional raiding parties of the Athabaskan.<ref>Lynda A. Sanchez, ''Apache Legends & Lore of Southern New Mexico'' (2014)</ref>\n\nThe [[Navajo Nation]], with more than 300,000 citizens the largest federally recognized tribe in the United States, is concentrated in present-day northwestern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona.

He traveled mostly overland from Florida to Mexico. Cabeza de Vaca and three companions were the only survivors of the [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] expedition of June 17, 1527 to Florida, losing 80 horses and several hundred explorers. These four survivors had spent eight arduous years getting to Sinaloa, Mexico on the Pacific coast and had visited many Indian tribes.\n\nCoronado and his supporters sank a fortune in this ill-fated enterprise. They took 1300 horses and mules for riding and packing, and hundreds of head of sheep and cattle as a portable food supply. Coronado's men found several [[adobe]] pueblos (towns) in 1541 but no rich cities of gold. Further widespread expeditions<ref>[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/national_parks/coronado_expedition.jpg]</ref> found no fabulous cities anywhere in the Southwest or Great Plains. A dispirited and now poor Coronado and his men began their journey back to Mexico, leaving New Mexico behind. it is likely that some of Coronado's horses escaped, to be captured and adopted for use by Plains Indians. Over the next two centuries, they made horses at the center of their nomadic cultures. Only two of Coronado's horses were mares.<ref>Haines, Francis. \"The Northward Spread of Horses among the Plains Indians\". ''American Anthropologist'', Vol 40, No. 3 (1988)</ref>\n\nMore than 50 years after Coronado, [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] came north from the Valley of Mexico with 500 Spanish settlers and soldiers and 7,000 head of livestock, founding the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico on July 11, 1598.<ref>Simmons, Marc, ''The Last Conquistador'' Norman: U of OK Press, 1992, pp.96, 111</ref> The governor named the settlement ''[[San Juan de los Caballeros]]''. This means \"Saint John of the Knights\". San Juan was in a small valley. Nearby the [[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama River]] flows into the Rio Grande. O\u00f1ate pioneered [[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]], \"The Royal Road of the Interior Land,\" a 700-mile (1,100&nbsp;km) trail from the rest of [[New Spain]] to his remote colony. O\u00f1ate was appointed as the first [[Spanish governors of New Mexico|governor]] of the new province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. Although he Intended to achieve the total subjugation of the Natives, O\u00f1ate noted in 1599 that the Pueblo \"live very much the same as [the Spanish] do, in houses with two and three terraces.\" <ref name=\"Nash, Gary B. 2015. pg. 5\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The Native Americans at [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]] revolted against this Spanish encroachment but faced severe suppression. In battles with the Acomas, O\u00f1ate lost 11 soldiers and two servants, killed hundreds of Indians, and punished every man over 25 years of age by the amputation of their left foot. The Franciscans found the pueblo people increasingly unwilling to consent to baptism by newcomers who continued to demand food, clothing and labor. Acoma is also known as the oldest continually inhabited city in the United States.<ref name=\"Nash, Gary B. 2015. pg. 5\"/></blockquote>\n \nO\u00f1ate's capital of San Juan proved to be vulnerable to \"Apache\" (probably Navajo) attacks. Governor [[Pedro de Peralta]] moved the capital and established the settlement of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1610 at the foot of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]].<ref>McNitt, Frank.  ''Navajo Wars: Military Campaigns, Slave Raids, and Reprisals.'' Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1972, pp. 10-11</ref> Santa Fe is the oldest capital city in the United States. Peralta built the [[Palace of the Governors]] in 1610. Although the colony failed to prosper, some Catholic missions survived. Spanish settlers arrived at the site of Albuquerque in the mid-17th century. Missionaries attempted to convert the natives to Christianity, but had little success.<ref>[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/pueblo/indianpueblohistory.htm]</ref>\n\nContemporary scholars believe that the objective of Spanish rule of New Mexico (and all other northern lands) was the full exploitation of the native population and resources. As Frank McNitt writes,\n\n<blockquote>Governors were a greedy and rapacious lot whose single-minded interest was to wring as much personal wealth from the province as their terms allowed. They exploited Indian labor for transport, sold Indian slaves in New Spain, and sold Indian products ... and other goods manufactured by Indian slave labor.<ref>McNitt, Frank.

Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1972, p. 13</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe exploitative nature of Spanish rule resulted in their conducting nearly continuous raids and reprisals against the nomadic Indian tribes on the borders, especially the [[Apache]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and [[Comanche]].\n\n[[Franciscan]] missionaries accompanied O\u00f1ate to New Mexico; afterward there was a continuing struggle between secular and religious authorities. Both colonists and the Franciscans depended upon Indian labor, mostly the Pueblo, and competed with each other to control a decreasing Indian population. They suffered high mortality   because of infectious European diseases, to which they had no acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], and exploitation that disrupted their societies. The struggle between the Franciscans and the civil government came to a head in the late 1650s. Governor [[Bernardo Lopez de Mendizabal]] and his subordinate [[Nicolas de Aguilar]] forbade the Franciscans to punish Indians or employ them without pay. They granted the Pueblo permission to practice their traditional dances and religious ceremonies. After the Franciscans protested, Lopez and Aguilar were arrested, turned over to the [[Inquisition]], and tried in Mexico City. Thereafter, the Franciscans reigned supreme in the province. Pueblo dissatisfaction with the rule of the clerics was the main cause of the Pueblo revolt.<ref>Sanchez, Joseph P. \"Nicolas de Aguilar and the Jurisdiction of Salinas in the Province of New Mexico, 1659-1662,\" ''Revista Compultense de Historia de America'' Vol. 22, Servicio de Publicaciones, UCM, Madrid, 1996</ref>\n\nThe Spanish in New Mexico were never able to gain dominance over the Indian peoples, who lived among and surrounded them. The isolated colony of New Mexico was characterized by \"elaborate webs of ethnic tension, friendship, conflict, and kinship\" among Indian groups and Spanish colonists. Because of the weakness of New Mexico, \"rank-and-file settlers in outlying areas had to learn to coexist with Indian neighbors without being able to keep them subordinate.\"<ref>James F. Brooks, ''Captives and Cousins: Slavery, Kindship, and Community in the Southwest Borderlands.'' (U of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 32</ref> The Pueblo Indians were the first group to challenge Spanish rule significantly. Later the nomadic Indians, especially the [[Comanche]], mounted attacks that weakened the Spanish.\n\n==Pueblo Revolt of 1680==\n{{Main|Pueblo Revolt}}\nMany of the Pueblo people harbored hostility toward the Spanish, due to their oppression of the Indians and prohibition of their practice of traditional religion. The economies of the pueblos were disrupted, as the people were forced to labor on the [[encomienda]]s of the colonists. The Spanish introduced new farming implements which the Pueblo adopted and provided some measure of security against [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] raiding parties. The Pueblo lived in relative peace with the Spanish from the founding of the Northern New Mexican colony in 1598.<ref>Andrew L. Knaut, ''The Pueblo Revolt of 1680'' (1995)</ref>\n\nIn the 1670s, drought swept the region, causing famine among the Pueblo, and attracting increased attacks from neighboring nomadic tribes trying to gain food supplies. Spanish soldiers were unable to defend the settlements adequately. At the same time, European-introduced diseases caused high mortality among the natives, decimating their communities. Dissatisfied with the protective powers of the Spanish crown and its god of the Catholic Church, the Pueblo returned to their old gods. This provoked a wave of repression on the part of [[Franciscan]] missionaries. Following his arrest on a charge of witchcraft and subsequent release, [[Pop\u00e9]] (or Po-pay) planned and orchestrated the Pueblo Revolt.\n\nAfter being freed, Pop\u00e9 moved to Taos and planned a Pueblo war against the Spaniards. He dispatched runners to all the Pueblos carrying knotted cords, the knots signifying the number of days remaining until the appointed day for them to rise together against the Spaniards. Hearing that the Spaniards had learned of these plans, Pop\u00e9 ordered the attacks advanced to August 13. The Spanish were driven from all but the southern portion of New Mexico. They set up a temporary capital at [[El Paso]] while making preparations to reconquer the rest of the province.<ref>Pedro Ponce, \"Trouble for the Spanish, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680\" [http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2002-11/pueblorevolt.html ''Humanities'', November/December 2002, Volume 23/Number 6] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916111244/http://neh.gov/news/humanities/2002-11/pueblorevolt.html |date=2008-09-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe retreat of the Spaniards left New Mexico controlled by the Indians. Pop\u00e9 ordered the Indians, under penalty of death, to burn or destroy crosses and other Catholic religious imagery, as well as any other vestige of the Spanish culture. He also wanted to destroy Spanish livestock and fruit trees. [[Kivas]] (rooms for religious rituals) were reopened, and Pop\u00e9 ordered all Indians to bathe in soap made of yucca root. He  forbade the planting of Spanish crops of wheat and barley. Pop\u00e9 commanded those Indians married by the rites of the Catholic Church to dismiss their wives, and to take others under their traditional ways. He took over control of the Governor's Palace as ruler of the Pueblo, and collected tribute from each Pueblo until his death in 1688.\n\nFollowing their success, the different Pueblo tribes, separated by hundreds of miles and six different languages, quarreled as to who would occupy Santa Fe and rule over the territory. These power struggles, combined with raids from nomadic tribes and a seven-year drought, weakened the Pueblo strength. In July 1692, [[Diego de Vargas]] led Spanish forces that surrounded Santa Fe, where he called on the Indians to surrender, promising clemency if they would swear allegiance to the King of Spain and return to the Christian faith. The Indian leaders gathered in Santa Fe, met with De Vargas, and agreed to peace.<ref name=\"Knaut, 1995\">Knaut, ''The Pueblo Revolt of 1680'' (1995)</ref>\n\nWhile developing Santa Fe as a trade center, the returning settlers founded [[Albuquerque]] in 1706, naming for the viceroy of New Spain, the Duke of Albuquerque. Prior to its founding, Albuquerque consisted of several [[hacienda]]s and communities along the lower Rio Grande. The settlers constructed the ''Iglesia de San Felipe Neri'' (1706). Development of ranching and some farming in the 18th century were the basis for the culture of many of the state's still-flourishing Hispanics.<ref name=\"Knaut, 1995\"/>\n\nWhile the Pueblo achieved a short-lived independence from the Spaniards, they gained a measure of freedom from future Spanish efforts to impose their culture and religion following the reconquest. The Spanish issued substantial land grants to each Pueblo, and appointed a public defender to protect the rights of the Indians and argue their legal cases in the Spanish courts.<ref name=\"Knaut, 1995\"/>\n\n==Spanish relations with nomadic Indians==\n\nFrom the date of the founding of New Mexico, the Pueblo Indians and Spanish settlers were plagued by hostile relationships with nomadic and semi-nomadic Navajo, Apache, [[Ute people|Ute]], and Comanche Indians.<ref>Charles F. Kenner, ''A History of New Mexican-Plains Indians Relations.''  (U of Oklahoma Press, 1969), p. 18</ref> These tribes raided the more sedentary peoples for livestock, food supplies and stores, and captives to ransom or use as slaves.\n\nThe southwestern Indians developed a horse culture, raiding Spanish ranches and missions for their horses, and ultimately breeding and raising their own herds. The Indian horse culture quickly spread throughout western America. Navajo and Apache raids for horses on Spanish and Pueblo settlements began in the 1650s or earlier.<ref>McNitt, 11</ref> Through the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Indians acquired many horses. By the 1750s the Plains Indians horse culture was well established from [[Texas]] to [[Alberta]], Canada. The Navajo, in addition to being among the first mounted Indians in the U.S., were unique in developing a [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] culture based on sheep stolen from the Spanish. By the early 18th century, the Navajo households typically owned herds of sheep.<ref>McNitt, 23</ref>\n\n===Comancheria===\n[[File:Comancheria.jpg|thumb|''Comancheria prior to 1850.'']]\n\nAfter the Pueblo revolt, the Comanche posed the most serious threat to the Spanish settlers. Scholar H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2008) argues that from the 1750s to the 1850s, the Comanche were the dominant group in the Southwest, and they ruled a domain known as [[Comancheria]]. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen calls it an empire. Confronted with Spanish, Mexican, French, and American outposts on their periphery in New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and Mexico, they worked to increase their own safety, prosperity and power. The Comanche used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Americans, Mexicans, and Indians through cunning, tribute, and kidnappings. The Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanche created a decentralized political system, based on a raiding, hunting and pastoral economy. They created a hierarchical social organization in which young men could advance through their success in war.<ref name=\"Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008 p. 2\">Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, ''The Comanche Empire'' (2008) p. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1706, colonists in New Mexico first recorded the Comanche; by 1719 they were raiding the colony as well as the other Indian tribes. The other tribes had primarily raided for plunder, but the Comanche introduced a new level of violence to the conflict. They preyed on other Indians. The Comanche were pure nomads, well mounted by the 1730s.<ref>\"Frank McLynn, on The Comanche Empire by Pekka Hamalainen.\" ''Literary Review.'' literaryreview.co.uk/mclynn_06_08.html, accessed 16 Nov 2011</ref> They were more elusive and mobile than the semi-nomadic Apache and Navajo, who were dependent upon agriculture or herding for part of their livelihoods.<ref>Kenner, 32</ref> The Comanche both raided and traded with the New Mexicans. They were especially prominent at the annual [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] trade fair, where they peacefully exchanged hides, meat and captive, often before or after raiding other settlements. They endangered the survival of colonial New Mexico, stripping the settlements of horses, forcing the abandonment of many settlements, and in 1778 killing 127 Spanish settlers and Pueblo Indians.<ref>Kenner, 49</ref> Punitive expeditions by the Spanish and their Indian allies against the Comanche were usually ineffective. In 1779 a Spanish and Pueblo Indian force of 560 men, led by [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], surprised a Comanche village near [[Pueblo, Colorado]] and killed Cuerno Verde (Green Horn), the most prominent of the Comanche war leaders.<ref>John, Elizabeth A. H. ''Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds''. Lincoln: U of NE Press, 1975, pp. 584\u2013592</ref> The Comanche subsequently sued for peace with New Mexico, joined the New Mexicans in expedition against their common enemy, the Apache, and turned their attention to raiding Spanish settlements in Texas and northern Mexico. The New Mexicans on their part took care not to re-antagonize the Comanche and lavished gifts on them. The peace between New Mexico and the Comanche endured until the United States conquest of the province in 1846 during the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref>John, pp. 662\u2013676; Kenner pp. 53\u201377</ref>\n\nPeace with the Comanche stimulated a growth in the population of New Mexico; settlements expanded eastward on to the [[Great Plains]]. The inhabitants of these new settlements were mostly ''genizaros'', Indians and the descendants of Indians who had been ransomed from the Comanche.<ref>Kenner 63\u201364</ref> Navajo and Apache raids continued to affect the territory. The Navajo were defeated in 1864 by [[Kit Carson]], but the Apache leader [[Geronimo]] did not surrender until 1886. The Ute had earlier allied with the New Mexicans for mutual protection against the Comanche.\n\nThe Comanche empire collapsed after their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[cholera]], especially in 1849; their population plunged from about 20,000 in the 18th century to 1,500 by 1875, when they surrendered to the U.S. Government. The Comanche no longer had the manpower to deal with the U.S. Army and the wave of white settlers who encroached on their region in the decades after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] ended in 1848.<ref name=\"Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008 p. 2\"/>\n\n==U.S. exploration==\nFollowing [[Lewis and Clark]] many men started exploring and trapping in the western parts of the United States. Sent out in 1806, Lt. [[Zebulon Pike]]'s orders were to find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and [[Red River of the South|Red]] rivers. He was to explore the southwestern part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In 1807, when Pike and his men crossed into the [[San Luis Valley]] of northern New Mexico they were arrested and taken to Santa Fe, and then sent south to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] where they appeared before the Commandant General Salcedo. After four months of diplomatic negotiations, Pike and his men were returned to the United States, under protest, across the Red River at [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]].<ref>For Zebulon Pike's route, see Gerlach, Arch C.

In 1810 catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo instigated a war for independence in central Mexico, a struggle that quickly took on the character of a class war. The following year, military captain Las Casas instigated a coup within the Imperial regime. Sympathizing with the poor underclass, Las Casas opened up a line of dialogue with the revolutionaries. This caused the Spanish elite to instigate its own counter coup and executed Las Casas. For years afterward the regime failed to regain coherency and the mandate to administrate. These ideological struggles affected peripheral New Mexico much less than they did the national center, but it resulted in a sense of alienation with central authority.\n\nFurthermore, in 1818 a longstanding peace between the settled communities of New Mexico and the neighboring nomadic Indian tribes broke down. Just a month after swearing loyalty to the new Mexican government in 1821, governor Melgares led a raid into Navajo country. Isolated from other settled regions and surrounded on all sides by nomadic Indian tribes, New Mexicans tended to a communal sense of imperilment and the placement of security above all other concerns.\n\nFor these reasons it is highly surprising that the transition from Spanish to Mexican rule occurred as peacefully as it did. In New Mexico the event passed with few shows of enthusiasm or partisanship.  Festivals were largely a lackluster affair and held only at the behest of the revolutionary government which expressed that they should be held, \"in all the form and with the magnificence that the oaths of allegiance to the Kings have previously been read\". But there was no renewed civil war and the provisional government was given the grudging support of most of society.\n\nTrade along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] was opened following Mexican independence. With this trade came a new influx of citizens from the United States. Prior to independence, the ''estranjeros'' (foreigners) were not allowed to participate in receiving [[Spanish land grants in New Mexico|land grants]], but now, along with the open trade, a few would become participating owners of these ''merceds'' (grants).<ref>Malcolm Ebright, ''Land Grants and Lawsuits in Northern New Mexico'' University of New Mexico Press (1994)</ref>\n\n===Federalist stage===\n{{Main|Provisional Government of Mexico (1823\u201324)|1824 Constitution of Mexico|First Mexican Republic}}\nIn 1824 a new constitution was drafted, that established Mexico as a federalist republic. A generally liberal minded atmosphere that had pervaded Mexico since independence led to generous grants of local autonomy and limited central power. New Mexico in particular was able to take advantage and to carve out significant privileges in this new system. Classified as a territory as opposed to a state, it had reduced representation in the national government but broad local autonomy.  Because of the advanced age of New Mexican society and its relative sophistication,  it was uniquely placed to take advantage of its position as a frontier but still effecting influence in the rest of the country.\n\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|240px|Province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]] when it belonged to Mexico in 1824]]\nOne of the defining features of the Mexican period in the history of New Mexico was the attempt to instill a nationalist sentiment.  This was a tremendous challenge considering the nature of identity in Mexico during the Spanish empire. Under the official dictates of the empire, subjects were classified in terms of ethnicity, class and position in society. Between these legal distinctions kept groups separate and movement between groups was regulated. Ethnic Europeans of course made up the upper crust of this system with Peninsulars, those born in Spain itself, comprising the true elite while Mexican born Europeans, the creoles, were ranked just below them. At the bottom were the masses of Indians and Mestizos, who had few legal rights and protections against the abuse of their superiors.\n\nIn contrast the new 'Mexican' elite attempted to create a common identity between all classes and ethnicities.  Embracing an incredibly wide range of peoples and cultures, from nomadic Indians to the high society of Mexico City, this was incredibly ambitious and met with mixed success. In New Mexico, there was already a highly structured and differentiated society at the time of independence, unique along the Mexican frontier. At the top were ethnic Europeans who then merged with a large community of Hispanics. The more Indian blood you possessed, the lower on the social scale you tended to reside until the bottom was made of settled Pueblo communities and the nomadic Indians who existed outside of the polity.\n\nNationalists attempted to establish equality, if only legally, between these disparate groups. The local autonomy New Mexicans had established inhibited these endeavors and throughout the Mexican period the elite continued to maintain their privileges. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of New Mexico were able to adapt their old identity as Spanish subjects to Mexican nationals. Instead of a purely modern liberal sense of identity, this adapted Spanish feudalism to a geographic area. The evidence of this success in nationalism can be seen in the Pueblo myth of Montezuma. This held that the original Aztec homeland lay in New Mexico, and the original king of the Aztecs was a Pueblo. This creates a symbolic, and completely artificial, connection between the Mexican center and an isolated frontier society.\n\n===Centralist stage and collapse===\n{{Main|Siete Leyes|Centralist Republic of Mexico}}\nThe federalist and liberal atmosphere that pervaded Mexican thought since independence fell apart in the mid-1830s. Across the political spectrum there was the perception that the previous system had failed and needed readjustment. This led to the dissolution of the 1824 constitution and the drafting of a new one based on centralist lines. As Mexico drifted farther and farther toward despotism, the national project began to fail and the nation fell into a crisis.\n\nAlong the frontier, formerly autonomous societies reacted aggressively to a newly assertive central government. The most independent province, Texas, declared its independence in 1835, triggering the sequence of events that led directly to Mexico's collapse. The [[Revolt of 1837 (New Mexico)|Revolt of 1837]] in New Mexico itself overthrew and executed the centrally appointed governor and demanded increased regional authority. This revolt was defeated within New Mexican society itself by [[Manuel Armijo]]. This was motivated not by nationalist sentiment but by the class antagonism within New Mexican society. When central rule was reestablished, it was done so on Armijo's lines (he became governor) and he ruled the province with even greater autonomy than any other time during the Mexican period.\n\nAs the situation within central Mexico fell further and further into confusion, New Mexico began to draw closer economically to the United States. This was epitomized in the growth in traffic and prominence of the [[Santa Fe Trail]] as a means of communication and trade. In the mid-1830s New Mexico began to function as a trading hub between the United States, central [[Mexico]] and [[Mexican California]]. Merchants making their way over the [[Great Plains]] would stop in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], where they would meet with their counterparts from Los Angeles and Mexico City. The result was that as central Mexico fell into turmoil, New Mexico grew economically and trade ties strengthened with the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1845 the governorship of Armijo was interrupted when the regime of [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] replaced him as governor with political outsider [[Mariano Mart\u00ednez de Lejanza]]. In the growing threat of war with the United States, the national center sought to bring the frontier under tight control as it is there that any war would be fought. Most New Mexicans distrusted the central government by now but that soon turned to fury when, one year into his reign, Martinez sparked a needless war with a neighboring Indian tribe out of incompetence and na\u00efvet\u00e9. To prevent revolution, Martinez was swiftly removed and Armijo reinstated, but any confidence the central government still enjoyed was completely destroyed.\n\nThe following year rumors arrived in New Mexico that the Mexican government was planning on selling the territory to the United States. There was so little trust in the central government by this point that instead of investigating these rumors (which were completely false) leading members of New Mexican society drafted a threat of secession to the government. This stated that if any such actions were taken then New Mexico would declare independence as ''[[La Rep\u00fablica Mexicana del Norte]]''. It was not until invading American troops reached New Mexico in August 1846 that they learned of war with the United States.\n\n===Texas===\n{{Main|Republic of Texas|Texas annexation}}\nThe Republic of Texas seceded from Mexico in 1836 and claimed but never controlled territory as far south and west as the [[Rio Grande]]. While most of the northwestern territory was then the [[Comancheria]], it would have included Santa Fe and divided New Mexico. The only attempt to realize the claim was [[Texian]] [[Presidents of the Republic of Texas|President]] [[Mirabeau Lamar]]'s [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|Santa Fe Expedition]], which failed spectacularly. The wagon train, supplied for a journey of about half the actual distance between Austin and Santa Fe, followed the wrong river, back-tracked, and arrived in New Mexico to find the Mexican governor restored and hostile. Surrendering peaceably upon a pledge to be allowed to return the way they came, the Texians found themselves bound at gunpoint and their execution put to a vote of the garrison. By one vote, they were spared and marched south to [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and then [[Mexico City]].\n\n==United States control==\n[[File:Tierra o muerte.jpg|thumb|128px|left|Tierra O Muerte \u2013 Land or Death. Some New Mexicans express dissatisfaction over land grant issues which date back to the Mexican War.]]\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\nIn 1846, during the Mexican\u2013American War, American General [[Stephen W. Kearny]] marched down the Santa Fe Trail and entered [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] without opposition to establish a joint civil and military government. Kearny's invasion force consisted of his army of 300 cavalry men of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|First Dragoons]], about 1600 Missouri volunteers in the First and Second Regiments of Fort Leavenworth, Missouri Mounted Cavalry, and the 500 man [[Mormon Battalion]]. Kearny appointed Charles Bent, a Santa Fe trail trader living in Taos, as acting civil governor. He then divided his forces into four commands: one, under Colonel [[Sterling Price]], appointed military governor, was to occupy and maintain order in New Mexico with his approximately 800 men; a second group under Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan]], with a little over 800 men was ordered to capture [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico and then join up with [[John E. Wool|General Wool]];<ref>[http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/dawdon.html Joseph G.

The [[Mormon Battalion]], mostly marching on foot under Lt. Col. [[Philip St. George Cooke]], was directed to follow Kearny with wagons to establish a new southern route to California.\n\n[[File:Kearny-Las-Vegas-Aug-1846-engraving-1882.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Gen. Kearny's [[annexation]] of New Mexico, August 15, 1846]]\nWhen Kearny encountered [[Kit Carson]], traveling East and bearing messages that California had already been subdued, he sent nearly 200 of his dragoons back to New Mexico. In California about 400 men of the [[California Battalion]] under [[John C. Fremont]] and another 400 men under Commodore [[Robert Stockton]] of the U.S. Navy and Marines had taken control of the approximately 7,000 Californios from [[San Diego]] to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. New Mexico territory, which then included present-day Arizona, was under undisputed United States control, but the exact boundary with Texas was uncertain. Texas initially claimed all land North of the Rio Grande; but later agreed to the present boundaries.\n\nKearny protected citizens in the new US territories under a form of martial law called the [[Kearny code|Kearny Code]]; it was essentially Kearny and the U.S. Army's promise that the US would respect existing religious and legal claims, and maintain law and order. The Kearny Code became one of the bases of New Mexico's legal code during its territorial period, which was one of the longest in United States history. Many of the provisions remain substantially unchanged today.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nKearny's arrival in New Mexico had been essentially without conflict; the governor surrendered without battle, and the Mexican authorities took the money they could find and retreated south into Mexico. However, the U.S. occupation was resented by the New Mexicans. Provisional governor [[Charles Bent]], a longtime resident of New Mexico, implored U.S. army officers to \"respect the rights of the inhabitants\" and predicted \"serious consequences\" if measures were not taken to prevent abuses.<ref>Lavender, David. ''Bent's Fort.'' Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, p. 273</ref> His warning was prophetic, as New Mexican and Pueblo Indian rebels were soon to begin the [[Taos Revolt]].\n\nOn January 19, 1847 rebels attacked and killed acting Governor Bent and about ten other American officials. The wives of Bent and Kit Carson, however, managed to escape. Reacting quickly, a U.S. detachment under Colonel [[Sterling Price]] marched on Taos and attacked. The rebels retreated to a thick-walled [[adobe]] church. U.S. forces breached a wall and directed concentrated cannon fire into the church. About 150 of the rebels were killed, and 400 captured, following close fighting. During one trial, six rebels were arraigned and tried, of whom five were convicted of murder and one of treason. All six were hanged in April, 1847. A young traveler and later author, [[Lewis Hector Garrard]], wrote the only eye witness account of this trial and hanging. He criticized, \"It certainly did appear to be a great assumption on the part of the Americans to conquer a country, and then arraign the revolting inhabitants for treason ... Treason, indeed! What did the poor devil know about his new allegiance? But so it was; and, as the jail was overstocked with others awaiting trial, it was deemed expedient to hasten the execution ... I left the room, sick at heart. Justice! out upon the word, when its distorted meaning is the warrant for murdering those who defend to the last their country and their homes.\"<ref>Garrard, Lewis H.[https://archive.org/stream/wahtoyahtaostrai00garr/wahtoyahtaostrai00garr_djvu.txt ''Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail.''] H. W. Derby & Co., A. S. Barnes & Co. (1850) p. 197\u2013198</ref> Additional executions followed to total at least 28.\n\nPrice fought three more engagements with the rebels, which included many Pueblo Indians, who wanted to push the Americans from the territory. By mid-February he had the revolt well under control. President [[James K. Polk]] promoted Price to a [[Brevet (military)|brevet rank]] of Brigadier General for his service. Total fatalities amounted to more than 300 New Mexican native rebels and about 30 ''Anglos'', as non-Latino whites are commonly called in the southwest to this day.\n\n===Provisional government===\n{{main|U.S. provisional government of New Mexico}}\n\n===Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo===\n{{Main|Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo}}\nUnder the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, Mexico ceded much of its mostly unsettled northern holdings, today known as the [[American Southwest]] and [[California]], to the United States of America in exchange for an end to hostilities, and the American evacuation of Mexico City and many other areas under its control. Under this treaty, Mexico recognized Texas as a part of the United States. Mexico also received $15 million cash, plus the assumption of slightly more than $3 million in outstanding Mexican debts.\n\nNew Mexico, the new name for the region between Texas and California, became a US territory. The Senate struck out Article X of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which said that vast land grants in New Mexico (nearly always gifts by the local authorities to their friends) would all be recognized. The treaty promised to protect the ownership rights of the heirs of the land grants. The decision to strike down Article X eventually led to court cases in which the US removed millions of acres of land, timber, and water from Mexican-issued land grants and placed them back in the public domain.<ref>Richard Griswold del Castillo, ''The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: A Legacy of Conflict'' (1992)</ref> But, Correia points out that the lands involved had typically never been occupied or controlled by the men who had the grants; most were in Indian-controlled areas.<ref>David Correia, ''Properties of Violence: Law and Land Grant Struggle in Northern New Mexico'' (2013)</ref>\n\nThe residents could choose whether they remain and receive United States citizenship or remove to Mexico and retain (or gain) Mexican citizenship. All but 1000 or so settlers\u2014who were mostly Mexican government officials\u2014chose American citizenship, which included full voting rights.<ref>Linda C. Noel,  \"'I am an American': Anglos, Mexicans, Nativos, and the National Debate over Arizona and New Mexico Statehood,\" ''Pacific Historical Review'', (Aug 2011) 80#3 pp 430-467, at p 436</ref> Because at the time only white men could vote in most states, the Mexicans were considered white under the law.\n\nIn later decades, as discrimination by whites increased in numerous areas in relation to growth in the number of Mexican immigrants, some states tried to classify Hispanics as black or colored, and thus exclude them from voting because of barriers to voter registration. These practices were challenged in the mid-20th century and resolved in a case that reached the US Supreme Court.\n\n===American Territory===\n{{Main|New Mexico Territory|Gadsden Purchase}}\n\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|right|Proposals for Texas northwestern boundary]]\n[[File:Boundaries of State of New Mexico proposed in 1850.png|thumb|right|[[New Mexico]] proposed boundary before [[Compromise of 1850]]]]The Congressional [[Compromise of 1850]] halted a bid for statehood under a proposed antislavery constitution. Texas transferred eastern New Mexico to the federal government, settling a lengthy boundary dispute. Under the compromise, the American government established the [[New Mexico Territory]] on September 9, 1850. The territory, which included all of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]] and parts of [[Colorado]], officially established its capital at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1851. The U.S. territorial New Mexico census of 1850 found 61,547 people living in all the territory of New Mexico. The people of New Mexico would determine whether to permit slavery under a proposed constitution at statehood, but the status of slavery during the territorial period provoked considerable debate. The granting of statehood was up to a Congress sharply divided on the slavery issue. Some (including [[Stephen A. Douglas]]) maintained that the territory could not restrict slavery, as under the earlier [[Missouri Compromise]], while others (including [[Abraham Lincoln]]) insisted that older Mexican legal traditions, which forbade slavery, took precedence. Regardless of its official status, black slavery was rarely seen in New Mexico although Indian slavery was common. Statehood was finally granted to New Mexico on January 6, 1912.\n\nNavajo and Apache raids and plundering led [[Kit Carson]] to abandon his intent to retire to a sheep ranch near [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] after the Mexican\u2013American War. Carson accepted an 1853 appointment as U.S. Indian agent with a headquarters at Taos, and fought the Indians with notable success.\n\nThe United States acquired the southwestern boot heel of the state and southern Arizona below the Gila river in the mostly desert [[Gadsden Purchase]] of 1853. This purchase was desired when it was found that a much easier route for a proposed transcontinental railroad was located slightly south of the Gila river. This territory had not been explored or mapped when the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was negotiated in 1848. The ever-present Santa Anna was in power again in 1853 and needed the money from the Gadsden Purchase to fill his coffers and to pay the Mexican Army for that year. The Southern Pacific built the second transcontinental railroad though this purchased land in 1881.\n\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives]] the [[Corwin amendment|Committee of Thirty-Three]] on January 14, 1861 reported that it had reached majority agreement on a [[constitutional amendment]] to protect slavery where it existed and the immediate admission of [[New Mexico Territory]] as a [[slave state]]. This latter proposal would result in a de facto extension of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line for all existing territories below the line.<ref>Klein, Maury. ''Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War.''  (1997) {{ISBN|0-679-44747-4}}. pg.405-410</ref>\nAfter the [[Peace Conference of 1861]], a bill for New Mexico statehood was tabled by a vote of 115 to 71 with opposition coming from both Southerners and Republicans.\n\n====Media====\nThe first newspaper in New Mexico was ''El Crepusculo de la Libertad''  (\"The Dawn of Liberty\"), a Spanish-language paper founded in 1834 at Taos. The Santa Fe ''Republican'', founded in 1847, was the first English-language newspaper. By 2000 the state had 18 daily newspapers, 13 Sunday newspapers, and 25 weekly newspapers. Today's daily papers include the ''Albuquerque Journal'', the ''Santa Fe New Mexican'' (founded in 1849), the ''Las Cruces Sun-News'', the ''Roswell Record'', the ''Farmington Daily Times'', and the ''Deming Headlight''. The most widely broadcast radio station since its founding in 1922 has been [[KKOB (AM)]] in Albuquerque. With 50,000 watts of transmitter power on a clear channel it reaches audiences in most of New Mexico and parts of neighboring states.<ref>Paul L. Hain et al.,  ''New Mexico Government'' (1994) p. 257</ref> There are at least five television stations, based in Albuquerque, representing ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, and Fox.\n\n====Civil War====\n{{Main|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War}}\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Confederate troops from Texas commanded by Gen. [[Henry Hopkins Sibley|Henry Sibley]] briefly occupied southern New Mexico in July 1861, pushing up the Rio Grande valley as far as [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] by February 1862. Defeated in the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], they were forced to withdraw south. Union troops from California under Gen. [[James Carleton]] re-captured the territory in August 1862. As Union troops were withdrawn to fight elsewhere, [[Kit Carson]] helped to organize and command the [[1st New Mexican Volunteers]] to engage in campaigns against the [[Apache]], [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], and [[Comanche]] in New Mexico and Texas as well as participating in the [[Battle of Valverde]] against the Confederates. Confederate troops withdrew after the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] where [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regulars, Colorado Volunteers (The Pikes Peakers), and New Mexican Volunteers defeated them. The [[Arizona Territory]] was split off as a separate territory in 1863.\n\n[[File:AZ-NM1867.jpg|300px|thumb|left|1867 map]]\n\n====Indians====\nCenturies of continued conflict with the [[Apache]] and the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] continued to plague New Mexico. In 1864, the U.S. Army trapped and captured the main Navajo forces, forcing them onto a small reservation in eastern New Mexico in what is called the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]], also called the '''Long Walk to Bosque Redondo.''' This put an end to their livestock raids on New Mexican farms, ranches, and Indian pueblos. After several years of severe hardships, during which many Navajos died, they were allowed in 1868 to return to most of their lands. Sporadic Apache small-scale raiding continued until Apache chief [[Geronimo]] finally was captured and imprisoned in 1886.<ref>Thompson, Gerald Thompson, ''The Army and the Navajo: The Bosque Redondo Reservation Experiment 1863\u20131868'' (1976)</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Army set up a chain of forts to protect the people and the caravans of commerce. Most tribes were relocated on reservations near the forts, where they were given food and supplies by the federal government. Often supplies and annuities were late, or food spoiled.\n\n====The new legal system and the legal profession====\nIn the first half of the 19th century, Mexico set up a judicial system for its northernmost districts, in present day New Mexico and California. There were no professionally trained lawyers or judges. Instead, there were numerous low-ranking legal roles such as ''notario, escribano, asesor, auditor de Querra, justicia mayor, procurador,'' and ''juez receptor.'' With the annexation by the United States in 1848, Congress set up an entirely new territorial legal systems, one that used the English language and American laws, forms, and procedures.  Practically all the lawyers and judges were new arrivals from the United States, as there was no place in the new system for the old Hispanic roles.<ref>Joseph Webb McKnight, \"Law Without Lawyers on the Hispano-Mexican Frontier\" ''West Texas Historical Association'' (1990), Vol. 66, pp 51-65.</ref>\n\n[[Elfego Baca]] (1865 \u2013 1945) was an outlaw-turned-lawman, lawyer, and politician in New Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1888, after serving as a County Sheriff, Baca became a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]]. He served for two years and then began studying law. In December 1894, he was admitted to the bar and practice law in New Mexico until 1904. he held numerous local political offices, and when New Mexico became a state in 1912, he was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress. In the late 1950s, Walt Disney turned Baca into the first Hispanic popular culture hero in the United States, on 10 television shows, in six comic books, in a feature film, and in related merchandising. However, Disney deliberately avoided ethnic tension by presenting Baca as a generalized Western hero, portraying a standard hero similar to [[Davy Crockett]], in Hispanic dress.<ref>Ferenc Morton Szasz, \"A New Mexican\" Davy Crockett\": Walt Disney's version of the Life and Legend of Elfego Baca.\" ''Journal of the Southwest'' (2006) 48#3: 261-274. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40170324  excerpt]</ref>\n\n====Las Gorras Blancas====\nAfter the Mexican\u2013American War, Anglo Americans began migrating in large numbers to all of the newly acquired territory. Anglos began taking lands from both [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and Nuevomexicanos by different means, most notably by [[squatting]]. Squatters often then sold these lands to land speculators for huge profits, especially after the passage of the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] encouraging development in the West. Nuevomexicanos demanded the return of their lands, but the governments did not respond favorably. For example, the Surveyor of General Claims Office on [[New Mexico]] would at times take up to fifty years to process a claim, meanwhile, the lands were being grabbed up by the newcomers. The first Surveyor General, William Pelham, had two translators assisting him: David Miller and David Whiting. But these two men seemingly did not cut into the fifty years needed to translate.\n\nWhile the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], and [[Topeka]] railroad was built in the 1890s, speculators known as the [[Santa Fe Ring]], orchestrated schemes to dislodge natives from their lands. In response, Nuevomexicanos gathered to reclaim lands taken by [[Anglos]].<ref>Rosales, F. Arturo. ''Chicano: The History of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement'' (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1997) p. 7-9</ref> Hoping to scare off the new immigrants, they eventually used [[intimidation]] and [[Raid (military)|raid]]s to accomplish their goals. They sought to develop a class-based consciousness among local people through the everyday tactics of resistance to the economic and social order confronting common property land grant communities. They called themselves [[Las Gorras Blancas]], a name referring to the [[white]] [[head covering]]s many wore.\n\n====Gilded Age====\n[[File:Lamy Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Bronze statue of Archbishop Lamy in front of St. Francis Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1851 the Vatican appointed [[Jean-Baptiste Lamy]] (1814\u20131888), a French cleric, as bishop of  the diocese of Sante Fe. There were only nine priests at first; Lamy brought in many more. In 1875 it was upgraded to the status of archdiocese, with supervision over Catholic affairs in  New Mexico and Arizona. Lamy had St. Francis Cathedral built in a French style; the work was conducted between 1869 and 1886.<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Lamy of Santa Fe'' (2003)</ref>\n\nTo provide the forts and reservations with food, the federal government contracted for thousands of head of cattle, and Texas cattlemen began entering New Mexico with their herds. Rancher Charles Goodnight blazed the first cattle trail through New Mexico in 1866, extending from the Pecos River northward into Colorado and Wyoming. Over it more than 250,000 head of cattle trailed to market. [[John Chisum]] also brought his herds up the Pecos. As employer of the desperado [[Billy the Kid]], he figured prominently in the [[Lincoln County War]] of 1878\u20131880. This was one of the many struggles between cattle herders and territorial officials, among rival cattle barons, and between sheep ranchers and cattle ranchers during this period. The [[Butterfield Trail]], the longest of the cattle trails, had its first important stop in New Mexico at Fort Fillmore. It began operations in 1858 and was superseded by railroad operations in 1881.\n\nThe [[Santa Fe Railroad]] reached New Mexico in 1878, with the first locomotive crossing Raton Pass that December. It reached [[Lamy, New Mexico]], 16 miles (26&nbsp;km) from Santa Fe in 1879 and Santa Fe itself in 1880, and Deming in 1881, thereby replacing the storied [[Santa Fe Trail]] as a way to ship cattle to market. The new town of Albuquerque, platted in 1880 as the Santa Fe Railroad extended westward, quickly enveloped the old town. The rival [[Southern Pacific]] was completed between the Rio Grande valley and the Arizona border in 1881.\n\nFrom 1880 to 1910 the territory grew rapidly. With the coming of the railroad, many homesteaders moved to New Mexico. In 1886 the New Mexico Education Association of school teachers was organized; in 1889 small state colleges were established at Albuquerque, Las Cruces, and Socorro; and in 1891 the first effective public school law was passed. An irrigation project in the Pecos River valley in 1889 marked the first of many such projects to irrigate farms in the dry state. Discovery of artesian waters at Roswell in 1890 gave both farming and mining a boost. The power of the cattle barons faded as much land was fenced in at the expense of the open range. The cattle ranchers and sheep ranchers also learned to tolerate one other, and both the cattle and sheep industries expanded. Mining became even more important, especially gold and silver. Coal mining developed during the 1890s, primarily to supply the railroads, and oil was discovered in Eddy County in 1909. The population of New Mexico reached 195,000 in 1910.\n\nConflicting land claims led to bitter quarrels among the original Spanish inhabitants, cattle ranchers, and newer homesteaders. Despite destructive overgrazing, ranching survived as a mainstay of the New Mexican economy.\n\n==Statehood==\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\nOn January 6, 1912, after years of debate on whether the population of New Mexico was fully assimilated into American culture, or too immersed in corruption, President [[William Howard Taft]] twisted arms in Congress and it approved admission of New Mexico as the 47th state of the Union.<ref>David V. Holtby, ''Forty-Seventh Star: New Mexico's Struggle for Statehood'' (2013)</ref> The admission of neighboring Arizona on February 14, 1912 completed the contiguous 48 states. Thousands of Mexicans fled north during the extremely bloody civil war that broke out in Mexico in 1911. In 1916 Mexican military leader [[Pancho Villa]] led an invasion across the border into [[Columbus, New Mexico]], where they burned some homes and killed several Americans.\n\nNew Mexico contributed some 17,000 men to the armed services during World War I. Thousands more from the state fought for the Allies during World War II.\n\n===Artists and writers===\nWhen the mainline of the railroad bypassed Santa Fe, the city lost businesses and population. In the 20th century, American and British artists and writers, and retirees were attracted to the cultural richness of the area, the beauty of the landscapes, and dry warm climate. Local leaders took the opportunity to promote the city's heritage making it a tourist attraction. The city sponsored bold architectural restoration projects and erected new buildings according to traditional techniques and styles, thus creating the \"Santa Fe style.\"   Edgar L. Hewett, founder and first director of the School of American Research and the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, was a leading promoter. He began the Santa Fe Fiesta in 1919 and the Southwest Indian Fair in 1922 (now known as the Indian Market). When he tried to attract a summer program for Texas women, many artists rebelled saying the city should not promote artificial tourism at the expense of its artistic culture. The writers and artists formed the Old Santa Fe Association and defeated the plan. The old \"mud city\" - which short-sighted modernizers laughed at for its adobe houses - was transformed into a city proud of its peculiarities and its blend of tradition and modernity.<ref>Carter Jones Meyer, \"The Battle between 'Art' and 'Progress': Edgar L. Hewett and the Politics of Region in the Early-Twentieth-Century Southwest,\" ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'', September 2006, Vol. 56 Issue 3, pp 47-61</ref>\n\n===Nuevomexicanos===\n{{Main|Nuevomexicanos}}\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Anglos tried to regulate the Hispanics living in New Mexico to second-class social status, due to xenophobia and prejudice. Some of these Anglos were ethnocentric, deprecating Hispanic/Mexican culture and disputing the rights of the original inhabitants. Richard Nostrand strongly disputes claims that this treatment caused the Hispanics to construct a \"Spanish American\" identity in response, in an early instance of expressing being American through ethnic identity.<ref>Richard L. Nostrand, ''The Hispano Homeland'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1996)</ref>\n\n[[United States home front during World War I|World War I]] gave the Hispanics the opportunity to demonstrate American citizenship by participating in the war effort. Like the \"new immigrants\" in northeastern cities, who also constructed dual identities, members of the [[Nuevomexicano]] middle class exuberantly participated in the war effort. They melded images of their heritage with patriotic symbols of America, especially in the Spanish-language press. Nuevomexicano politicians and community leaders recruited the rural masses into the war cause overseas and on the home front, including the struggle for woman suffrage. Support from New Mexico's Anglo establishment aided their efforts. Their wartime contributions improved the conditions of minority citizenship for Nuevomexicanos but did not entirely eliminate social inequality. For example, no Hispanics \u2014not even the son of a politician\u2014 were allowed to be a member of a fraternity at the state university.<ref>Phillip Gonzales and Ann Massmann, \"Loyalty Questioned: Nuevomexicanos in the Great War.\" ''Pacific Historical Review'', November 2006, Vol. 75 Issue 4, pp 629-666</ref><ref>Phillip B. Gonzales, \"Spanish Heritage and Ethnic Protest in New Mexico: The Anti-Fraternity Bill of 1933,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1986, Vol. 61 Issue 4, pp 281-299</ref>\n\nThe Anglos and Hispanics cooperated because both prosperous and poor Hispanics could vote and they outnumbered the Anglos. Around 1920, the term \"Spanish-American\" replaced \"Mexican\" in polite society and in political debate. The new term served both the interests of both groups. For Spanish speakers, it evoked Spain, not Mexico, recalling images of a romantic colonial past and suggesting a future of equality in Anglo-dominated America. For Anglos, on the other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a \"Mexican\" land suggested the violence and disorder associated with that country's civil war in the early 20th century. This had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign. The new term gave the impression that \"Spanish Americans\" belonged to a true \"American\" political culture, making the established order appear all the more democratic.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27502746?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Charles Montgomery, \"Becoming 'Spanish-American': Race and Rhetoric in New Mexico Politics, 1880\u20131928\"], ''Journal of American Ethnic History'', Summer 2001, Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp. 59-84; via JSTOR; accessed 18 July 2016</ref>\n\n===New arrivals===\n[[File:Russellpiea.jpg|thumb|230px|Serving food in [[Pie Town, New Mexico]], 1940]]\nIn the 20th century immigrants and migrants brought new skills, outlooks and values, modernizing the highly traditional culture of the state. They included Midwestern farmers who tried to cultivate humid-area crops to the desert climate, Texas oilmen, [[tuberculosis]] patients who sought healing in the dry air (before an appropriate antibiotic was discovered),<ref>Nancy Owen Lewis, \"High and Dry in New Mexico: Tuberculosis and the Politics of Health,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', 87 (Spring 2012), 129\u201366.</ref> artists who made Taos a national cultural center, [[New Deal]]ers who sought to modernize the state as fast as possible and improve infrastructure, soldiers and airmen from all over who came for training at the many military bases, noted scientists who came to Los Alamos to build a super weapon, and stayed on, and retirees from colder climes. They brought money and new ideas. The state residents gradually adopted more of a standard national culture, losing some of its unique qualities.<ref>Michael Welsh, \"New Mexico at Seventy Five: A Historical Commentary,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1987, Vol. 62 Issue 4, pp 387-396</ref>\n\nThe building for the State Supreme Court was constructed during the [[Great Depression]] as a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project, completed in 1937. It's an example of the numerous projects which the Democratic administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] collaborated on with states in order to improve infrastructure, invest in facilities, and put people to work. Prior to that project, the Supreme Court met in the basement of the state capitol.\n\n===Women's suffrage===\nThe suffrage movement in the state worked hard to get women the vote but were stymied by the conservatism of politicians and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe|Catholic Church]]. New Mexico's legislature was one of the last in 1920 to ratify the [[19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. After it passed, there was quickly a dramatic increase in political participation by both Anglo and Hispanic women, as well as strong mobilization efforts by the major parties to gain the support of the female voters.<ref>Joan Jensen, \"Disfranchisement is a Disgrace\": Women and Politics in New Mexico, 1900\u20131940,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Winter 1981, Vol. 56 Issue 1, pp 5-35</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nNew Mexico proportionately suffered the loss of more servicemen than any other state in the nation. The state led in the national war bond drive and had fifty federal installations, including glider and bombardier training schools. The state rapidly modernized during the war, as 65,000 young men (and 700 young women) joined the services, where they received a wide range of technical training and saw the outside world, many for the first time. Federal spending brought wartime prosperity, along with high wages, jobs for everyone, rationing and shortages. Federal facilities have continued to be major contributors to the state's economy in the postwar years.<ref>Ferenc M. Szasz and George E. Webb, \"The New Mexican Response to the End of the Second World War,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Winter 2008, Vol. 83 Issue 1, pp 1-37</ref>\n\nThe top secret remote [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Research Center]] was developed in the mountains of New Mexico as a research facility, opening in 1943 for the purpose of developing the world's first [[atomic bomb]]. Teams of scientists and engineers were recruited to work on this project. The first test at Trinity Site in the desert of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, now known as [[White Sands Missile Range]], 28 miles southeast of [[San Antonio]], New Mexico, on July 16, 1945 ushered in the atomic age. New Mexico had become a center of world-class science.  High-altitude balloon experiments from [[Holloman Air Force Base]] caused debris found near [[Roswell, New Mexico]] ([[The Roswell Incident]]) in 1947. This reputedly led to the persistent (but unproven) claims by a few individuals that the government had captured and concealed extraterrestrial corpses and equipment.\n\nAlbuquerque expanded rapidly after the war. The state quickly emerged as a leader in nuclear, solar, and geothermal energy research and development. The [[Sandia National Laboratories]], founded in 1949, carried out nuclear research and special weapons development at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] south of Albuquerque and at [[Livermore, California]].\n\n===Environmentalism===\nSince the late 19th century, New Mexico and other arid Western states have sought to assert sovereign control over water allocation policies within their boundaries. In the 1990s the legislature debated H.R. 128, the proposed State Water Sovereignty Protection Act. Since the passage of the [[Newlands Act]] in 1902, Western states have benefited from federal water projects. In spite of these projects, water allocation remained a politically charged issue throughout the 20th century. Most states have sought to limit federal control over water distribution, preferring instead to allocate water under the discredited doctrine of prior appropriation.<ref>Hana Samek Norton, \"'Fantastical Assumptions': A Centennial Overview of Water Use in New Mexico,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1998, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp 371-387</ref>\n\nAs a state dependent on both smokestack industry and scenic tourism, New Mexico was at the center of the debates over clean air legislation, particularly the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1967  and its amendments in 1970 and 1977. The [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]], which operated a large smelter at [[Hurley, New Mexico]], generating as a byproduct thick clouds of air pollution, led the opposition to the environmentalists, represented by the [[New Mexico Citizens for Clean Air and Water]]. Eventually the company was forced to comply with fairly strict federal standards. They often delayed the compliance process for years by threatening economic repercussions, such as plant closings and unemployment, if forced to comply with standards.<ref>\nChristopher J. Huggard, \"Mining and the Environment: The Clean Air Issue in New Mexico, 1960\u20131980,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1994, Vol. 69 Issue 4, pp 369-388</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History|North America|United States}}\n{{main|Historical outline of New Mexico}}\n* [[Governors of New Mexico Territory]]\n* [[History of slavery in New Mexico]]\n* [[History of the Colorado Plateau]]\n* [[History of the Great Plains]]\n* [[History of the Rocky Mountains]]\n* [[History of the Western United States]]\n* [[List of Governors of New Mexico]]\n* [[New Mexico Territory]]\n* [[Spanish governors of New Mexico]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of New Mexico]]\n* [[Timeline of Albuquerque, New Mexico]]\n* [[Timeline of New Mexico]]<ref>{{Cite book |location = NY |publisher=Hastings House |series=American Guide Series |title = New Mexico: a Guide to the Colorful State |author = [[Federal Writers' Project]] |date = 1940 |chapter=Chronology |page=423+ |chapterurl=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012922400?urlappend=%3Bseq=545}}</ref>\n* [[U.S. provisional government of New Mexico]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Surveys===\n* Bancroft, Hubert Howe.

He was appointed [[First Junior Treasury Counsel (Common Law)]] in 1984, and a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] in 1985, holding both positions until his appointment to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in 1992.\n\n===Judicial career===\nLaws was appointed a [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court Judge]] in 1992, serving in the [[High Court of Justice#Queen's Bench Division|Queen's Bench Division]], and was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] at this time. He served until 1998, and in 1999 was appointed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] as a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] and appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].\n\n====Notable decisions====\n\n[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]] 2002 - Perhaps Sir John's most famous decision, and extremely controversial in the public law sphere. In it he recognises principles in common law contrary to parliamentary sovereignty. The foundation of his decision was on four propositions:<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2002/195.html bailii.org - England and Wales High Court (Administrative Court) Decisions: 2002 EWHC 195 (Admin)]</ref>\n<blockquote>\n# All the specific rights and obligations which EU law creates are by the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|ECA]] incorporated into our domestic law and rank supreme: that is, anything in our substantive law inconsistent with any of these rights and obligations is abrogated or must be modified to avoid the inconsistency. This is true even where the inconsistent municipal provision is contained in [[primary legislation]]. \n# The ECA is a constitutional statute: that is, it cannot be [[Implied repeal|impliedly repealed]]. A constitutional statute can, however, be explicitly repealed by a subsequent statute.\n# The truth of (2) is derived, not from EU law, but purely from the law of England: the common law recognises a category of [[constitutional statutes]]. \n# The fundamental legal basis of the United Kingdom's relationship with the EU rests with the domestic, not the European, legal powers. In the event, which no doubt would never happen in the real world, that a European measure was seen to be repugnant to a fundamental or constitutional right guaranteed by the law of England, a question would arise whether the general words of the ECA were sufficient to incorporate the measure and give it overriding effect in domestic law. But that is very far from this case. \n</blockquote>\n\n[[R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings]] - Sir John sat in the first instance hearing of this historic case, concerning the legality of a decision made to prohibit hunting on a small area of land which the Council had acquired and was argued to maintain under s120(1)(b) [[Local Government Act 1972]].\n\n[[McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd]] - Sir John attracted considerable press attention for stating \"The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds [...] is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary.\" This was in response to a witness statement submitted by former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[George Carey|Lord Carey]] that Christians should be afforded special protections under equality legislation on the grounds of earnestly held religious belief.\n\n==Constitutional theory==\nSir John Laws is noted for his extrajudicial writings in the [[Law review|journal]], ''[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]]''. His most notable contribution, \"Law and Democracy\", asserts that the constitution would be undemocratic if it gave all the power under it to the elected government. Therefore, it is the constitution, and not Parliament, that should be sovereign in the British constitution.  He posits that the constitution must create a \"higher-order law\"  in which human rights and constitutional fundamentals in a democracy can be protected by the courts against the abuses of government. This position stems from a fundamental distrust of the political constitution in holding the executive to account. It is similar in form to [[Lord Hailsham]]'s claim that in Britain there is an \"''[[elective dictatorship]]''\". Sir John does not see this shift to the legal sphere as being anti-democratic because judges uphold apolitical values that no politician would contest and are above the arguments that take place in the political sphere between politicians of political parties.\n\nThese statements are certainly controversial and have been fiercely contested by academics such as John Griffith and Martin Loughlin, both professors at the [[London School of Economics]]. The essential arguments made by these authors are to the effect that the metaphysical principles that Sir John cites are highly contentious. A good example of this is Laws' love of freedom of expression. When is it right for racist or sexist comments to be illegal? Whilst for Griffith it should be up to a democratically elected legislature to decide such tricky moral issues, for Laws it is firmly a matter of law for the judges to decide. The problem with the latter approach, according to Griffith, stems from the fact that judges cannot be removed if the decisions they make are judged to be wrong by citizens of a polity. For Laws, on the other hand, such counter-majoritarianism is a beneficial aspect of the law, which acts to protect those that are vulnerable in society against the tyranny of the majority.\n\n==Personal life==\nSir John married Sophie Susan Sydenham Cole Marshall in 1973, with whom he has one daughter.

It is unclear whether another 30 million was withdrawn. It was also discovered Manuel Zelaya spent more than 100,000 lempiras in veterinarian's fees for his horse, Coffee. This was criticized.

Apparently either the BBC, ''La Tribuna'' (the BBC's source), or Micheletti are in error. The quote from Micheletti, copied and pasted from the BBC article, is: \"El art\u00edculo 374 dice que no se podr\u00e1 utilizar el plebiscito y el referendo para reformar los art\u00edculos p\u00e9treos que establece el art\u00edculo 384 y que se refiere a la forma de gobierno, al territorio nacional, al per\u00edodo presidencial, a la prohibici\u00f3n para ser nuevamente Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica al ciudadano que lo haya desempe\u00f1ado bajo cualquier tipo y referente.\" (BBC's source was La Tribuna.)

''porque eso, incluso, anunciarlo privadamente es un delito.''\")\n\n==May 27, 2009==\nIn late May, the administrative court ruled Zelaya's plan illegal. On May 27, Micheletti announced that he had submitted evidence to the public prosecutor that the Executive branch had put out a contract to have him killed.  He said that for more than a month he'd been followed and menaced with death and placed responsibility on the Executive branch.

The quote from Micheletti, copied and pasted from the BBC article, is: \"El art\u00edculo 374 dice que no se podr\u00e1 utilizar el plebiscito y el referendo para reformar los art\u00edculos p\u00e9treos que establece el art\u00edculo 384 y que se refiere a la forma de gobierno, al territorio nacional, al per\u00edodo presidencial, a la prohibici\u00f3n para ser nuevamente Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica al ciudadano que lo haya desempe\u00f1ado bajo cualquier tipo y referente.\" (BBC's source was La Tribuna.) He stated that even to announce such a referendum privately is a crime (\" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ''porque eso, incluso, anunciarlo privadamente es un delito.''\")\n\n==May 27, 2009==\nIn late May, the administrative court ruled Zelaya's plan illegal. On May 27, Micheletti announced that he had submitted evidence to the public prosecutor that the Executive branch had put out a contract to have him killed.  He said that for more than a month he'd been followed and menaced with death and placed responsibility on the Executive branch.  Zelaya responded that \"whoever made these claims had swine flu and was delirious.\"<ref>Quienes hacen esas denuncias tienen fiebre porcina y est\u00e1n deliriando\"</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://elheraldo.hn/Sucesos/Ediciones/2009/05/27/Noticias/Roberto-Micheletti-presenta-pruebas-de-atentado-en-su-contra |title=Roberto Micheletti presenta pruebas de atentado en su contra |newspaper=[[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]] | language=Spanish |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==June 2009==\n\n===June 3===\nCongress passes a resolution warning Zelaya to correct his administrative conduct.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=1868 | title=Diputados imprueban la conducta del Ejecutivo y le recomiendan que rectifique | date=2009-06-04 | newspaper=[[La Tribuna]] | language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===June 10===\nThe council of the [[Bar Association of Honduras]] unanimously agreed that Zelaya's plan is illegal.
