The book has themes of [[terminal illness]], based on Lowry's own experiences with her sister Helen.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Lowry continued to write about difficult topics in her next publication, ''[[Autumn Street]]'' (1979), which explores themes of coping with [[racism]], [[grief]], and [[fear]] at a young age.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> The novel is told from the perspective of a young girl who is sent to live with her grandfather during [[World War II]], based on by Lowry's own experiences during the war.<ref name=\"Biography\" />\nThe same year she published ''[[Autumn Street]]'', Lowry also published her novel ''[[Anastasia Krupnik]]'', the first installment in the Anastasia series.<ref name=\"Biography\" /> The series continued until 1995.\n\nLowry's work ''[[Number the Stars]]'' was published in 1989, and received multiple awards, including the 1990 Newbery medal.<ref name=\"newbery\" /> Lowry received the Newbery medal again in 1994, for ''[[The Giver]]'' (1993).<ref name=\"newbery\" /> After writing ''[[The Giver]]'', she published two companion novels which take place in the same universe: ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004).

As a set, they are considered ''[[The Giver Quartet]]''.<ref name=\"Biography\" />\n===Critical reception===\nIn her works, Lowry has explored such complex issues as [[racism]], [[terminal illness]], [[murder]], [[the Holocaust]], and the questioning of [[authority]], among other challenging topics. Her writing on such matters has brought her both praise and criticism. In particular, ''[[The Giver]]'' (the first novel in the Quartet) has been met with a diversity of reactions from [[American schools|schools in America]] since its release in 1993; some schools have adopted it as a part of the mandatory curriculum, while others have prohibited the book's inclusion in classroom studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Awards ==\nLowry won the [[Newbery Medal]] in 1990 for her novel ''[[Number the Stars]]'', and again in 1994 for ''[[The Giver]]''.<ref name=newbery/> For ''[[Number the Stars]]'', Lowry has also received the [[National Jewish Book Award]] in 1990, in the Children's Literature category<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners|title=Past Winners|website=Jewish Book Council|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>, and the [[Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award]] in 1991.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1994, Lowry was awarded the [[Regina Medal]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2002, her book ''[[Gooney Bird Greene]]'' won the Rhode Island Children's Book [https://guides.rilinkschools.org/c.php?g=269052&p=1794336 Award.]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nLowry has been nominated three times for the biennial international [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the highest recognition available to creators of children's books.<ref name=\"ibby2004\" /><ref name=\"ibby-nominee\" />  She was a finalist in 2000, a U.S. nominee in 2004, and a finalist in 2016.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn 2007, she received the [[Margaret Edwards Award]] from the [[American Library Association]] for her contributions writing for teens.<ref name=\"edwards\" /> The ALA [[Margaret Edwards Award]] recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for \"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Lowry won the annual award in 2007 for ''The Giver'' (published 1993).

In the case of only two random variables, this is called a '''bivariate distribution''', but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables, giving a '''multivariate distribution'''.\n\nThe joint probability distribution can be expressed either in terms of a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] or in terms of a joint [[probability density function]] (in the case of [[continuous variable]]s) or joint [[probability mass function]] (in the case of [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] variables). These in turn can be used to find two other types of distributions: the [[marginal density|marginal distribution]] giving the probabilities for any one of the variables with no reference to any specific ranges of values for the other variables, and the [[conditional probability distribution]] giving the probabilities for any subset of the variables conditional on particular values of the remaining variables.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Draws from an urn===\n\nSuppose each of  two urns contains twice as many red balls as blue balls, and no others, and suppose one ball is randomly selected from each urn, with the two draws independent of each other. Let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the draw from the first urn and second urn respectively. The probability of drawing a red ball from either of the urns is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a blue ball is 1/3. We can present the joint probability distribution as the following table:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! A=Red !! A=Blue !! P(B)\n|-\n! B=Red\n| (2/3)(2/3)=4/9 || (1/3)(2/3)=2/9 || 4/9+2/9=2/3\n|-\n! B=Blue\n|(2/3)(1/3)=2/9 || (1/3)(1/3)=1/9 || 2/9+1/9=1/3\n|-\n! P(A)\n| 4/9+2/9=2/3 || 2/9+1/9=1/3 ||\n|}\n\nEach of the four inner cells shows the probability of a particular combination of results from the two draws; these probabilities are the joint distribution. In any one cell the probability of a particular combination occurring is (since the draws are independent) the product of the probability of the specified result for A and the probability of the specified result for B. The probabilities in these four cells sum to 1, as it is always true for probability distributions.\n\nMoreover, the final row and the final column give the [[marginal probability distribution]] for A and the marginal probability distribution for B respectively. For example, for A the first of these cells gives the sum of the probabilities for A being red, regardless of which possibility for B in the column above the cell occurs, as 2/3. Thus the marginal probability distribution for <math>A</math> gives <math>A</math>'s probabilities ''unconditional'' on <math>B</math>, in a margin of the table.\n\n===Coin flips===\nConsider the flip of two [[fair coin]]s; let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the first and second coin flips respectively. Each coin flip is a [[Bernoulli trial]] and has a [[Bernoulli distribution]]. If a coin displays \"heads\" then the associated random variable takes the value 1, and it takes the value 0 otherwise. The probability of each of these outcomes is 1/2, so the marginal (unconditional) density functions are\n\n:<math>P(A)=1/2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad A\\in \\{0, 1\\};</math>\n:<math>P(B)=1/2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad B\\in \\{0, 1\\}.</math>\n\nThe joint probability density function of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> defines probabilities for each pair of outcomes. All possible outcomes are\n:<math>\n(A=0,B=0),\n(A=0,B=1),\n(A=1,B=0),\n(A=1,B=1).\n</math>\nSince each outcome is equally likely the joint probability density function becomes\n:<math>P(A,B)=1/4 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad A,B\\in\\{0,1\\}.</math>\n\nSince the coin flips are independent, the joint probability density function is the product\nof the marginals:\n:<math>P(A,B)=P(A)P(B) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad A,B \\in\\{0,1\\}.</math>\n\n===Rolling a dize===\nConsider the roll of a fair {{dice|die}} and let <math>A=1</math> if the number is even (i.e. 2, 4, or 6) and <math>A=0</math> otherwise. Furthermore, let <math>B=1</math> if the number is prime (i.e. 2, 3, or 5) and <math>B=0</math> otherwise.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6\n|-\n| A || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| B || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0\n|}\n\nThen, the joint distribution of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, expressed as a probability mass function, is\n:<math>\n  \\mathrm{P}(A=0,B=0)=P\\{1\\}=\\frac{1}{6},\\quad \\quad \\mathrm{P}(A=1,B=0)=P\\{4,6\\}=\\frac{2}{6},\n</math>\n:<math>\n  \\mathrm{P}(A=0,B=1)=P\\{3,5\\}=\\frac{2}{6},\\quad \\quad \\mathrm{P}(A=1,B=1)=P\\{2\\}=\\frac{1}{6}.\n</math>\n\nThese probabilities necessarily sum to 1, since the probability of ''some'' combination of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> occurring is 1.\n\n===Real life example: ===\nConsider a production facility that fills plastic bottles with laundry detergent. The weight of each bottle (Y) and the volume of laundry detergent it contains (X) are measured. \n\n==Marginal probability distribution ==\nIf more than one random variable is defined in a random experiment, it is important to distinguish between the joint probability distribution of X and Y and the probability distribution of each variable individually. The individual probability distribution of a random variable is referred to as its marginal probability distribution. In general, the marginal probability distribution of X can be determined from the joint probability distribution of X and other random variables.\n\nIf the joint probability density function of random variable X and Y is  <math>f_{X,Y}(x,y)</math> , the marginal probability density function of X and Y are:\n\n<math>f_{X}(x)= \\int f_{XY}(x,y) \\; dy    </math>   ,  <math>f_{Y}(y)= \\int f_{XY}(x,y)

\"mixed joint density\" may be defined where one or more random variables are continuous and the other random variables are discrete. With one variable of each type we have\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_{X \\mid Y}(x \\mid y)\\mathrm{P}(Y=y)= \\mathrm{P}(Y=y \\mid X=x) f_X(x).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nOne example of a situation in which one may wish to find the cumulative distribution of one random variable which is continuous and another random variable which is discrete arises when one wishes to use a [[logistic regression]] in predicting the probability of a binary outcome Y conditional on the value of a continuously distributed outcome <math>X</math>. One ''must'' use the \"mixed\" joint density when finding the cumulative distribution of this binary outcome because the input variables <math>(X,Y)</math> were initially defined in such a way that one could not collectively assign it either a probability density function or a probability mass function.  Formally, <math>f_{X,Y}(x,y)</math> is the probability density function of <math>(X,Y)</math> with respect to the [[product measure]] on the respective [[support (measure theory)|supports]] of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. Either of these two decompositions can then be used to recover the joint cumulative distribution function:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nF_{X,Y}(x,y)&=\\sum\\limits_{t\\le y}\\int_{s=-\\infty}^x f_{X,Y}(s,t)\\;ds.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe definition generalizes to a mixture of arbitrary numbers of discrete and continuous random variables.\n\n==Additional properties==\n===Joint distribution for independent variables===\nIn general two random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[statistical independence|independent]] if and only if the joint cumulative distribution function satisfies\n:<math> F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x) \\cdot F_Y(y) </math>\n\nTwo discrete random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are independent if and only if the joint probability mass function satisfies\n:<math> P(X = x \\ \\mbox{and} \\ Y = y ) = P( X = x) \\cdot P( Y = y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\nWhile the number of independent random events grows, the related joint probability value decreases rapidly to zero, according to a negative exponential law.\n\nSimilarly, two absolutely continuous random variables are independent if and only if\n:<math> f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) \\cdot f_Y(y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. This means that acquiring any information about the value of one or more of the random variables leads to a conditional distribution of any other variable that is identical to its unconditional (marginal) distribution; thus no variable provides any information about any other variable.\n\n===Joint distribution for conditionally dependent variables===\nIf a subset <math>A</math> of the variables <math>X_1,\\cdots,X_n</math> is [[conditional dependence|conditionally dependent]] given another subset <math>B</math> of these variables, then the  probability mass function of the joint distribution is <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math>.  <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math> is equal to <math>P(B)\\cdot P(A\\mid B)</math>. Therefore, it can be efficiently represented by the lower-dimensional probability distributions <math>P(B)</math> and <math>P(A\\mid B)</math>. Such conditional independence relations can be represented with a [[Bayesian network]] or [[Copula (probability theory)|copula functions]].\n\n=== [[Covariance]] ===\nWhen two or more random variables are defined on a probability space, it is useful to describe how they vary together; that is, it is useful to measure the relationship between the variables. A common measure of the relationship between two random variables is the covariance. Covariance is a measure of linear relationship between the random variables. If the relationship between the random variables is nonlinear, the covariance might not be sensitive to the relationship.\n\nThe covariance between the random variable X and Y, denoted as cov(X,Y), is :\n\n<math>\\sigma_{XY}=E[(X-\\mu_x)(Y-\\mu_y)]=E(XY)-\\mu_x\\mu_y</math><ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied statistics and probability for engineers|last=Montgomery, Douglas C.|others=Runger, George C.|isbn=978-1-118-53971-2|edition=Sixth|location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=861273897|date = 19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Correlation and dependence|Correlation]] ===\nThere is another measure of the relationship between two random variables that is often easier to interpret than the covariance.\n\nThe correlation just scales the covariance by the product of the standard deviation of each variable. Consequently, the correlation is a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the linear relationships between pairs of variables in different units. If the points in the joint probability distribution of X and Y that receive positive probability tend to fall along a line of positive (or negative) slope, \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> is near +1 (or \u22121). If \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> equals +1 or \u22121, it can be shown that the points in the joint probability distribution that receive positive probability fall exactly along a straight line. Two random variables with nonzero correlation are said to be correlated. Similar to covariance, the correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between random variables.\n\nThe correlation between random variable X and Y, denoted as  \n\n<math>\\rho_{XY}=\\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{XY}}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y}</math>\n\n==Important named distributions==\n\nNamed joint distributions that arise frequently in statistics include the [[multivariate normal distribution]], the [[multivariate stable distribution]], the [[multinomial distribution]], the [[negative multinomial distribution]], the [[multivariate hypergeometric distribution]], and the [[elliptical distribution]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bayesian programming]]\n* [[Chow\u2013Liu tree]]\n* [[Conditional probability]]\n* [[Copula (probability theory)]]\n* [[Disintegration theorem]]\n* [[Multivariate statistics]]\n* [[Statistical interference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Joint distribution|id=p/j054260}}\n* {{springer|title=Multi-dimensional distribution|id=p/m065120}}\n*''A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how''.

In the case of only two random variables, this is called a '''bivariate distribution''', but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables, giving a '''multivariate distribution'''.\n\nThe joint probability distribution can be expressed either in terms of a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] or in terms of a joint [[probability density function]] (in the case of [[continuous variable]]s) or joint [[probability mass function]] (in the case of [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] variables). These in turn can be used to find two other types of distributions: the [[marginal density|marginal distribution]] giving the probabilities for any one of the variables with no reference to any specific ranges of values for the other variables, and the [[conditional probability distribution]] giving the probabilities for any subset of the variables conditional on particular values of the remaining variables.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Draws from an urn===\n\nSuppose each of  two urns contains twice as many red balls as blue balls, and no others, and suppose one ball is randomly selected from each urn, with the two draws independent of each other. Let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the draw from the first urn and second urn respectively. The probability of drawing a red ball from either of the urns is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a blue ball is 1/3. We can present the joint probability distribution as the following table:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! A=Red !! A=Blue !! P(B)\n|-\n! B=Red\n| (2/3)(2/3)=4/9 || (1/3)(2/3)=2/9 || 4/9+2/9=2/3\n|-\n! B=Blue\n|(2/3)(1/3)=2/9 || (1/3)(1/3)=1/9 || 2/9+1/9=1/3\n|-\n! P(A)\n| 4/9+2/9=2/3 || 2/9+1/9=1/3 ||\n|}\n\nEach of the four inner cells shows the probability of a particular combination of results from the two draws; these probabilities are the joint distribution. In any one cell the probability of a particular combination occurring is (since the draws are independent) the product of the probability of the specified result for A and the probability of the specified result for B. The probabilities in these four cells sum to 1, as it is always true for probability distributions.\n\nMoreover, the final row and the final column give the [[marginal probability distribution]] for A and the marginal probability distribution for B respectively. For example, for A the first of these cells gives the sum of the probabilities for A being red, regardless of which possibility for B in the column above the cell occurs, as 2/3. Thus the marginal probability distribution for <math>A</math> gives <math>A</math>'s probabilities ''unconditional'' on <math>B</math>, in a margin of the table.\n\n===Coin flips===\nConsider the flip of two [[fair coin]]s; let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the first and second coin flips respectively. Each coin flip is a [[Bernoulli trial]] and has a [[Bernoulli distribution]]. If a coin displays \"heads\" then the associated random variable takes the value 1, and it takes the value 0 otherwise. The probability of each of these outcomes is 1/2, so the marginal (unconditional) density functions are\n\n:<math>P(A)=1/2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad A\\in \\{0, 1\\};</math>\n:<math>P(B)=1/2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad B\\in \\{0, 1\\}.</math>\n\nThe joint probability density function of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> defines probabilities for each pair of outcomes.

<math>f_{X\\mid Y}(x\\mid y)</math> are the [[conditional distribution]]s of <math>Y</math> given <math>X=x</math> and of <math>X</math> given <math>Y=y</math> respectively, and <math>f_X(x)</math> and <math>f_Y(y)</math> are the [[marginal distribution]]s for <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> respectively.\n\nThe definition extends naturally to more than two random variables:\n\n{{Equation box

x_n}</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.6}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nAgain, since these are probability distributions, one has\n:<math>\\int_x \\int_y f_{X,Y}(x,y) \\; dy \\; dx= 1</math>\nrespectively\n:<math>\\int_{x_1} \\ldots \\int_{x_n} f_{X_1,\\ldots,X_n}(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\; dx_1 \\ldots \\; dx_n = 1</math>\n\n===Mixed case===\nThe \"mixed joint density\" may be defined where one or more random variables are continuous and the other random variables are discrete. With one variable of each type we have\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_{X \\mid Y}(x \\mid y)\\mathrm{P}(Y=y)= \\mathrm{P}(Y=y \\mid X=x) f_X(x).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nOne example of a situation in which one may wish to find the cumulative distribution of one random variable which is continuous and another random variable which is discrete arises when one wishes to use a [[logistic regression]] in predicting the probability of a binary outcome Y conditional on the value of a continuously distributed outcome <math>X</math>. One ''must'' use the \"mixed\" joint density when finding the cumulative distribution of this binary outcome because the input variables <math>(X,Y)</math> were initially defined in such a way that one could not collectively assign it either a probability density function or a probability mass function.  Formally, <math>f_{X,Y}(x,y)</math> is the probability density function of <math>(X,Y)</math> with respect to the [[product measure]] on the respective [[support (measure theory)|supports]] of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. Either of these two decompositions can then be used to recover the joint cumulative distribution function:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nF_{X,Y}(x,y)&=\\sum\\limits_{t\\le y}\\int_{s=-\\infty}^x f_{X,Y}(s,t)\\;ds.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe definition generalizes to a mixture of arbitrary numbers of discrete and continuous random variables.\n\n==Additional properties==\n===Joint distribution for independent variables===\nIn general two random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[statistical independence|independent]] if and only if the joint cumulative distribution function satisfies\n:<math> F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x) \\cdot F_Y(y) </math>\n\nTwo discrete random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are independent if and only if the joint probability mass function satisfies\n:<math> P(X = x \\ \\mbox{and} \\ Y = y ) = P( X = x) \\cdot P( Y = y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\nWhile the number of independent random events grows, the related joint probability value decreases rapidly to zero, according to a negative exponential law.\n\nSimilarly, two absolutely continuous random variables are independent if and only if\n:<math> f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) \\cdot f_Y(y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. This means that acquiring any information about the value of one or more of the random variables leads to a conditional distribution of any other variable that is identical to its unconditional (marginal) distribution; thus no variable provides any information about any other variable.\n\n===Joint distribution for conditionally dependent variables===\nIf a subset <math>A</math> of the variables <math>X_1,\\cdots,X_n</math> is [[conditional dependence|conditionally dependent]] given another subset <math>B</math> of these variables, then the  probability mass function of the joint distribution is <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math>.  <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math> is equal to <math>P(B)\\cdot P(A\\mid B)</math>. Therefore, it can be efficiently represented by the lower-dimensional probability distributions <math>P(B)</math> and <math>P(A\\mid B)</math>. Such conditional independence relations can be represented with a [[Bayesian network]] or [[Copula (probability theory)|copula functions]].\n\n=== [[Covariance]] ===\nWhen two or more random variables are defined on a probability space, it is useful to describe how they vary together; that is, it is useful to measure the relationship between the variables. A common measure of the relationship between two random variables is the covariance. Covariance is a measure of linear relationship between the random variables. If the relationship between the random variables is nonlinear, the covariance might not be sensitive to the relationship.\n\nThe covariance between the random variable X and Y, denoted as cov(X,Y), is :\n\n<math>\\sigma_{XY}=E[(X-\\mu_x)(Y-\\mu_y)]=E(XY)-\\mu_x\\mu_y</math><ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied statistics and probability for engineers|last=Montgomery, Douglas C.|others=Runger, George C.|isbn=978-1-118-53971-2|edition=Sixth|location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=861273897|date = 19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Correlation and dependence|Correlation]] ===\nThere is another measure of the relationship between two random variables that is often easier to interpret than the covariance.\n\nThe correlation just scales the covariance by the product of the standard deviation of each variable. Consequently, the correlation is a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the linear relationships between pairs of variables in different units. If the points in the joint probability distribution of X and Y that receive positive probability tend to fall along a line of positive (or negative) slope, \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> is near +1 (or \u22121). If \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> equals +1 or \u22121, it can be shown that the points in the joint probability distribution that receive positive probability fall exactly along a straight line. Two random variables with nonzero correlation are said to be correlated. Similar to covariance, the correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between random variables.\n\nThe correlation between random variable X and Y, denoted as  \n\n<math>\\rho_{XY}=\\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{XY}}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y}</math>\n\n==Important named distributions==\n\nNamed joint distributions that arise frequently in statistics include the [[multivariate normal distribution]], the [[multivariate stable distribution]], the [[multinomial distribution]], the [[negative multinomial distribution]], the [[multivariate hypergeometric distribution]], and the [[elliptical distribution]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bayesian programming]]\n* [[Chow\u2013Liu tree]]\n* [[Conditional probability]]\n* [[Copula (probability theory)]]\n* [[Disintegration theorem]]\n* [[Multivariate statistics]]\n* [[Statistical interference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Joint distribution|id=p/j054260}}\n* {{springer|title=Multi-dimensional distribution|id=p/m065120}}\n*''A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how''.

They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].\n\nRepresentative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">\n  \"The Saint Lucia Constitution\" (1978-December-20 effective\n  1979-February-22), Government of St. Lucia, December 2008,\n  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1901/made\n</ref> Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,<ref>[http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/sys-juri/class-poli/sys-mixtes.php Mixed Legal Systems]. juriglobe.ca</ref> meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[English common law]].

The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200\u2013400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>\n\nThe more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}\n\n===Early European period===\n[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|c\u00e9dula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.\n\nIn the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16\u201321}}\n\n===French colony===\n{{Main|French West Indies}}\n\nIn 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\nBoth the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.\n\nIn January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60\u201365}}\n\nA short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.\n\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>\n\nThe slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.\n\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.\n\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\n\nCastries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888\u20131890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Saint Lucia (1939\u20131967).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Saint Lucia]] 1939\u20131967]]\nThe best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]].

However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.\n\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2011, economic fundamentals remain solid, and GDP growth should recover in the future.\n\nInflation has been relatively low, averaging 5.5 percent between 2006 and 2008.

Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either saut\u00e9ed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.\n\nOne popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.\n\nDue to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.\n\n===LGBTQ non-acceptance===\n[[LGBT rights in Saint Lucia|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail.

In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].\n\nRepresentative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">\n  \"The Saint Lucia Constitution\" (1978-December-20 effective\n  1979-February-22), Government of St. Lucia, December 2008,\n  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1901/made\n</ref> Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,<ref>[http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/sys-juri/class-poli/sys-mixtes.php Mixed Legal Systems]. juriglobe.ca</ref> meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[English common law]].

The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200\u2013400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>\n\nThe more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}\n\n===Early European period===\n[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|c\u00e9dula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.\n\nIn the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16\u201321}}\n\n===French colony===\n{{Main|French West Indies}}\n\nIn 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\nBoth the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.\n\nIn January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60\u201365}}\n\nA short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.\n\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>\n\nThe slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.\n\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.\n\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\n\nCastries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888\u20131890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Saint Lucia (1939\u20131967).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Saint Lucia]] 1939\u20131967]]\nThe best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]].

However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.\n\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry.

The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either saut\u00e9ed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.\n\nOne popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.\n\nDue to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.\n\n===LGBTQ non-acceptance===\n[[LGBT rights in Saint Lucia|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail.

Its corporate headquarters are located in [[Pontedera]], Italy. The company was founded by [[Rinaldo Piaggio]] in 1884, initially producing locomotives and railway carriages.\n\nPiaggio's subsidiaries employ a total of 7,053 employees and produced a total of 519,700 vehicles in 2014.<ref name=\"Annual Results 2015\" /> The manufacturer has six research-and-development centers and operates in over 50 countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://piaggio2012.message-asp.com/en/piaggio-and-research-and-development |title=Annual Report 2012 \u2013 Piaggio Group |access-date=3 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221733/http://piaggio2012.message-asp.com/en/piaggio-and-research-and-development |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1882, Enrico Piaggio purchased land in [[Sestri Ponente]] ([[Genoa]]) to set up a timber yard. Two years later, in 1884, his 20-year-old son, [[:it:Rinaldo Piaggio|Rinaldo Piaggio]], founded Piaggio & C. The company initially built locomotives and railway carriages but in 1917, towards the end of [[World War I|World War]], Rinaldo Piaggio turned to the military sector. To begin with, the company produced MAS anti-[[submarine]] motorboats, [[aeroplanes]] and [[seaplane]]s under [[Ansaldo STS|Ansaldo]], [[Macchi]], [[Caproni]], and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] [[license]]s but later progressed to vehicles constructed according Piaggio's own drawings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZleYU_uSeAC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=rinaldo+piaggio+submarine+motorboats,+and+aeroplanes+and+seaplanes&source=bl&ots=Hf6rYhK9I3&sig=Ncl-FMw1S8gIo-MwKlRb1VjqgsE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjrh4_N79rcAhXGsY8KHTCaBuwQ6AEwDXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=rinaldo%20piaggio%20submarine%20motorboats,%20and%20aeroplanes%20and%20seaplanes&f=false|title=Vespa|last=Sarti|first=Giorgio|date=2006|publisher=Motorbooks|isbn=9780760325773|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1937 and 1939 Piaggio achieved 21 world records with its aircraft and engines built at the company's new factory in [[Pontedera]], culminating in the four-engine [[Piaggio P.108]] bomber.\n\nRinaldo died in 1938, by which time Piaggio was owned by multiple shareholders within the family, along with the entrepreneur [[:it:Attilio Odero|Attilio Odero]]. Management of the company passed to his sons [[Enrico Piaggio|Enrico]] and Armando.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/83/Piaggio-C-S-p-A.html |title = History of Piaggio & C. S.p.A.}}</ref>\n\nBy 1940 Piaggio was manufacturing trains, [[nautical]] fittings, [[aircraft engine]]s, aeroplanes, trucks, trams, buses, [[funicular]]s and aluminium windows and doors. The [[Pontedera]] plant was destroyed by Allied bombing and production activities were relocated to the [[Biella]] area. After the war, Enrico Piaggio decided to diversify the company's activities outside the aeronautical industry to address a perceived need for a modern, affordable mode of transport for the Italian mass market. The first attempt, based on a small [[motorcycle]] made for [[Parachuting|parachutists]], was known as the MP5 and nicknamed the \"[[Paperino]]\" (the Italian name for [[Donald Duck]]) because of its strange shape. Ultimately Enrico Piaggio did not like it and asked [[Corradino D'Ascanio]] to redesign it.\n\nD'Ascanio, an aeronautical engineer responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by [[Agusta]], was not naturally enthusiastic about [[motorcycle]]s, judging them to be uncomfortable and bulky, with wheels that were difficult to change after a puncture. When asked to design a motorcycle for [[Ferdinando Innocenti]], D'Ascanio had come up with a step through scooter design but D'Ascanio and Innocenti disagreed over use of pressings rather than tubing so D'Ascanio brought his design to Piaggio. Innocenti would ultimately use D'Ascanio's original design for their [[Lambretta]] scooter.\n\nPiaggio asked D'Ascanio to create a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. The [[motorcycle]] had to be easy to drive for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger, and not get its driver's clothes dirty. The engineer's drawings proved a significant departure from the Paperino. With the help of [[Mario D'Este]] he prepared the first Vespa project, manufactured at Piaggio newly-rebuilt Pontedera headquarters in April 1946. Piaggio launched the [[Vespa]] (Italian for \"wasp\") and within ten years more than a million units had been produced. The Italian language gained a new word, \"vespare\", meaning to go somewhere on a Vespa.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://ultimatemotorcycling.com/2010/08/29/piaggio-origins-and-vespa-history/ |title = Piaggio Origins & Vespa History}}</ref>\n\n===Ownership===\n[[File:Vespa a Todi.JPG|thumbnail|[[Vespa]] in a Todi street]]\nVespa thrived until 1992 when [[Gianni Agnelli]] became CEO. Agnelli was already suffering from cancer and died in 2003. In 1999 [[Morgan Grenfell Private Equity]] acquired Piaggio, but hopes for a quick sale were dashed by a failed joint venture in China.{{Clarify|date=February 2013}} In Italy, Piaggio invested 15 million euros ($19.4&nbsp;million) in a new motorcycle but dropped it after building a prototype. By the end of 2002, the company had run up 577&nbsp;million Euros in debt on revenues of 945&nbsp;million Euros, and booked a loss of 129&nbsp;million Euros.\n\nIn 2003 Piaggio's debt was reduced a 100 million Euro investment made by [[:it:IMMSI|IMMSI]], a holding company of the Colaninno family. 150&nbsp;million shares were also converted by creditor banks. Reflecting on his investment, [[:it:Roberto Colaninno|Roberto Colaninno]] said,\n\n\"A lot of people told me I was crazy. Piaggio wasn't dying. It just needed to be treated better.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114947493428871213|title=Vespa's Builder Scoots Back To Profitability}}</ref>\"\n\n[[Roberto Colaninno|Colannino]] became the new chairman of Piaggio, while Dr. Rocco Sabelli becoming the managing director. Sabelli redesigned the production line according to Japanese principles so that every Piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line. Contrary to expectations, Mr. Colaninno did not fire a single worker \u2013 a move which helped seduce the company's skeptical unions. \"Everyone in a company is part of the value chain,\" said Colaninno. All bonuses for blue-collar workers and management were based on the same criteria: profit margins and customer satisfaction. Air conditioning was installed in the factory for the first time, increasing productivity. He also gave the company's engineers, who had been idled by the company's financial crisis, deadlines for projects. They rolled out two world firsts in 2004: a gas-electric hybrid scooter and a sophisticated tilting scooter with two wheels in front and one in back to grip the road better.\n\nOne of Piaggio's problems Mr. Colaninno couldn't fix from the inside was its scale. Even though Piaggio was the European market leader, it was dwarfed by rivals [[Honda]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]]. A year after restoring Piaggio's health, Colaninno directed Piaggio's takeover of the Italian scooter and motorcycle manufacturer [[Aprilia]], and with it the Aprilia-owned [[Moto Guzzi]], a storied Italian manufacturer of motorcycles.\n\nIn 2006, Piaggio floated on the [[Milan Stock Exchange]], becoming a public company.\n\n===Production Development===\nIn 1956, with production of the millionth [[Vespa]] scooter, Italy had its first mass-produced motorised vehicle. Taking advantage of increased cash flow thanks to the success of the Vespa, Piaggio developed other products, including the 1957 [[Vespa 400]], a compact passenger car.\n\nIn 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the [[Agnelli family]], the owners of car maker [[Fiat|Fiat SpA]].\n\nBy 1960 Vespa had produced and sold 4 million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|language = en|url = http://www.museopiaggio.it/en/history/|title = Piaggio History}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964 the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions of Piaggio split to become two independent companies as a result of the wide ownership by Fiat in Italian industry.{{Clarify|date=February 2013}} The aeronautical division was named IAM Rinaldo Piaggio. The aircraft company [[Piaggio Aero]] was controlled by the family of Piero Ferrari, who still hold 10% of [[Ferrari]].\n\nIn 1969 Piaggio purchased the motorcycle company [[Gilera]], one of the oldest European motorcycle manufacturers (founded in 1909), famous for its sporting achievements and world titles in the [[Motocycle World Championship|Motorcycle World Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|language = en|url = https://www.autoevolution.com/moto/gilera/|title = Gilera \u2013 Models and History}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 a steering wheel was added to the [[Piaggio Ape]], a model first produced in 1948, culminating in the Ape Car.

Its corporate headquarters are located in [[Pontedera]], Italy. The company was founded by [[Rinaldo Piaggio]] in 1884, initially producing locomotives and railway carriages.\n\nPiaggio's subsidiaries employ a total of 7,053 employees and produced a total of 519,700 vehicles in 2014.<ref name=\"Annual Results 2015\" /> The manufacturer has six research-and-development centers and operates in over 50 countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://piaggio2012.message-asp.com/en/piaggio-and-research-and-development |title=Annual Report 2012 \u2013 Piaggio Group |access-date=3 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221733/http://piaggio2012.message-asp.com/en/piaggio-and-research-and-development |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1882, Enrico Piaggio purchased land in [[Sestri Ponente]] ([[Genoa]]) to set up a timber yard. Two years later, in 1884, his 20-year-old son, [[:it:Rinaldo Piaggio|Rinaldo Piaggio]], founded Piaggio & C. The company initially built locomotives and railway carriages but in 1917, towards the end of [[World War I|World War]], Rinaldo Piaggio turned to the military sector. To begin with, the company produced MAS anti-[[submarine]] motorboats, [[aeroplanes]] and [[seaplane]]s under [[Ansaldo STS|Ansaldo]], [[Macchi]], [[Caproni]], and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] [[license]]s but later progressed to vehicles constructed according Piaggio's own drawings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZleYU_uSeAC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=rinaldo+piaggio+submarine+motorboats,+and+aeroplanes+and+seaplanes&source=bl&ots=Hf6rYhK9I3&sig=Ncl-FMw1S8gIo-MwKlRb1VjqgsE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjrh4_N79rcAhXGsY8KHTCaBuwQ6AEwDXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=rinaldo%20piaggio%20submarine%20motorboats,%20and%20aeroplanes%20and%20seaplanes&f=false|title=Vespa|last=Sarti|first=Giorgio|date=2006|publisher=Motorbooks|isbn=9780760325773|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1937 and 1939 Piaggio achieved 21 world records with its aircraft and engines built at the company's new factory in [[Pontedera]], culminating in the four-engine [[Piaggio P.108]] bomber.\n\nRinaldo died in 1938, by which time Piaggio was owned by multiple shareholders within the family, along with the entrepreneur [[:it:Attilio Odero|Attilio Odero]]. Management of the company passed to his sons [[Enrico Piaggio|Enrico]] and Armando.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/83/Piaggio-C-S-p-A.html |title = History of Piaggio & C. S.p.A.}}</ref>\n\nBy 1940 Piaggio was manufacturing trains, [[nautical]] fittings, [[aircraft engine]]s, aeroplanes, trucks, trams, buses, [[funicular]]s and aluminium windows and doors. The [[Pontedera]] plant was destroyed by Allied bombing and production activities were relocated to the [[Biella]] area. After the war, Enrico Piaggio decided to diversify the company's activities outside the aeronautical industry to address a perceived need for a modern, affordable mode of transport for the Italian mass market. The first attempt, based on a small [[motorcycle]] made for [[Parachuting|parachutists]], was known as the MP5 and nicknamed the \"[[Paperino]]\" (the Italian name for [[Donald Duck]]) because of its strange shape. Ultimately Enrico Piaggio did not like it and asked [[Corradino D'Ascanio]] to redesign it.\n\nD'Ascanio, an aeronautical engineer responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by [[Agusta]], was not naturally enthusiastic about [[motorcycle]]s, judging them to be uncomfortable and bulky, with wheels that were difficult to change after a puncture. When asked to design a motorcycle for [[Ferdinando Innocenti]], D'Ascanio had come up with a step through scooter design but D'Ascanio and Innocenti disagreed over use of pressings rather than tubing so D'Ascanio brought his design to Piaggio. Innocenti would ultimately use D'Ascanio's original design for their [[Lambretta]] scooter.\n\nPiaggio asked D'Ascanio to create a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. The [[motorcycle]] had to be easy to drive for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger, and not get its driver's clothes dirty. The engineer's drawings proved a significant departure from the Paperino. With the help of [[Mario D'Este]] he prepared the first Vespa project, manufactured at Piaggio newly-rebuilt Pontedera headquarters in April 1946. Piaggio launched the [[Vespa]] (Italian for \"wasp\") and within ten years more than a million units had been produced. The Italian language gained a new word, \"vespare\", meaning to go somewhere on a Vespa.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://ultimatemotorcycling.com/2010/08/29/piaggio-origins-and-vespa-history/ |title = Piaggio Origins & Vespa History}}</ref>\n\n===Ownership===\n[[File:Vespa a Todi.JPG|thumbnail|[[Vespa]] in a Todi street]]\nVespa thrived until 1992 when [[Gianni Agnelli]] became CEO. Agnelli was already suffering from cancer and died in 2003. In 1999 [[Morgan Grenfell Private Equity]] acquired Piaggio, but hopes for a quick sale were dashed by a failed joint venture in China.{{Clarify|date=February 2013}} In Italy, Piaggio invested 15 million euros ($19.4&nbsp;million) in a new motorcycle but dropped it after building a prototype. By the end of 2002, the company had run up 577&nbsp;million Euros in debt on revenues of 945&nbsp;million Euros, and booked a loss of 129&nbsp;million Euros.\n\nIn 2003 Piaggio's debt was reduced a 100 million Euro investment made by [[:it:IMMSI|IMMSI]], a holding company of the Colaninno family. 150&nbsp;million shares were also converted by creditor banks. Reflecting on his investment, [[:it:Roberto Colaninno|Roberto Colaninno]] said,\n\n\"A lot of people told me I was crazy. Piaggio wasn't dying. It just needed to be treated better.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114947493428871213|title=Vespa's Builder Scoots Back To Profitability}}</ref>\"\n\n[[Roberto Colaninno|Colannino]] became the new chairman of Piaggio, while Dr. Rocco Sabelli becoming the managing director. Sabelli redesigned the production line according to Japanese principles so that every Piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line. Contrary to expectations, Mr. Colaninno did not fire a single worker \u2013 a move which helped seduce the company's skeptical unions. \"Everyone in a company is part of the value chain,\" said Colaninno. All bonuses for blue-collar workers and management were based on the same criteria: profit margins and customer satisfaction. Air conditioning was installed in the factory for the first time, increasing productivity. He also gave the company's engineers, who had been idled by the company's financial crisis, deadlines for projects. They rolled out two world firsts in 2004: a gas-electric hybrid scooter and a sophisticated tilting scooter with two wheels in front and one in back to grip the road better.\n\nOne of Piaggio's problems Mr. Colaninno couldn't fix from the inside was its scale. Even though Piaggio was the European market leader, it was dwarfed by rivals [[Honda]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]]. A year after restoring Piaggio's health, Colaninno directed Piaggio's takeover of the Italian scooter and motorcycle manufacturer [[Aprilia]], and with it the Aprilia-owned [[Moto Guzzi]], a storied Italian manufacturer of motorcycles.\n\nIn 2006, Piaggio floated on the [[Milan Stock Exchange]], becoming a public company.\n\n===Production Development===\nIn 1956, with production of the millionth [[Vespa]] scooter, Italy had its first mass-produced motorised vehicle. Taking advantage of increased cash flow thanks to the success of the Vespa, Piaggio developed other products, including the 1957 [[Vespa 400]], a compact passenger car.\n\nIn 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the [[Agnelli family]], the owners of car maker [[Fiat|Fiat SpA]].\n\nBy 1960 Vespa had produced and sold 4 million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|language = en|url = http://www.museopiaggio.it/en/history/|title = Piaggio History}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964 the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions of Piaggio split to become two independent companies as a result of the wide ownership by Fiat in Italian industry.{{Clarify|date=February 2013}} The aeronautical division was named IAM Rinaldo Piaggio. The aircraft company [[Piaggio Aero]] was controlled by the family of Piero Ferrari, who still hold 10% of [[Ferrari]].\n\nIn 1969 Piaggio purchased the motorcycle company [[Gilera]], one of the oldest European motorcycle manufacturers (founded in 1909), famous for its sporting achievements and world titles in the [[Motocycle World Championship|Motorcycle World Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|language = en|url = https://www.autoevolution.com/moto/gilera/|title = Gilera \u2013 Models and History}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 a steering wheel was added to the [[Piaggio Ape]], a model first produced in 1948, culminating in the Ape Car.

Some of these organizations can accept [[Graduate school|graduate]] students as well as undergraduates, per constitutional provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phikappatau.org/learning/chapter-management/constitution-and-bylaws.html|title=For example, Phi Kappa Tau and Alpha Xi Delta both have provisions in their respective Constitutions that they can accept graduate students as well as undergraduates|publisher=|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306131926/http://phikappatau.org/learning/chapter-management/constitution-and-bylaws.html|archive-date=2016-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alphaxidelta.org/clientuploads/Academic/2012%20Academic%20Achievement%20Chair%20Breakout%20Workbook.pdf|title=Alpha Xi Delta|publisher=|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703134737/http://www.alphaxidelta.org/clientuploads/Academic/2012%20Academic%20Achievement%20Chair%20Breakout%20Workbook.pdf|archive-date=2017-07-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIndividual fraternities and sororities vary in organization and purpose, but most share five common elements:\n\n# [[#Secrecy and ritual|Secrecy]]\n# [[#Gender exclusivity|Single-sex membership]]\n# [[#Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)|Selection]] of new members on the basis of a two-part vetting and probationary process known as ''rushing'' and ''pledging''\n# Ownership and occupancy of a [[#Residency|residential property]] where undergraduate members live\n# A set of complex identification symbols that may include Greek letters, [[armorial achievement]]s, ciphers, badges, grips, hand signs, passwords, flowers and colors\n\nFraternities and sororities engage in philanthropic activities, host parties, provide \"finishing\" training for new members such as instruction on etiquette, dress and manners, and create networking opportunities for their newly graduated members.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Fraternity#History}}\n\n===Establishment and early history===\n[[File:Rear view of the Wren Building, College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA (2008-04-23).jpg|thumb|The fraternity system in North America began at the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1750.]]\n\nThe first fraternity in North America to incorporate most of the elements of modern fraternities was [[Phi Beta Kappa]], founded at the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1775. The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]]. The further birthing of [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841) and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) collectively established Union College as the [[Mother of Fraternities]].\nThe social fraternity [[Chi Phi]], although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiphi.dynamic.omegafi.com/about-chi-phi/|title=History of Chi Phi|author=|date=|website=www.chiphi.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldest.org/culture/fraternities-north-america/|title=7 Oldest Fraternities in North America|author=|date=|website=www.oldest.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFraternities represented the intersection between [[dining club]]s, [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and secret initiatory orders such as [[Freemasonry]]. Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\".

The Adelphean, founded in 1851 eventually became [[Alpha Delta Pi]], while The Philomathean, begun in 1852, eventually became [[Phi Mu]]. Together, these sororities are known as the \"Macon Magnolias\". Several other unrelated \"Philomathean Societies\" emerged during the 19th Century, most notably a literary society at UPenn and another, unrelated, at NYU.</ref> though fraternity-like organizations for women didn't take their current form until the establishment of [[Pi Beta Phi]] in 1867 and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] in 1870. The term \"sorority\" was invented by a professor of Latin who felt the word \"fraternity\" was inappropriate for a group of ladies. The first organization to use the term \"sorority\" was [[Gamma Phi Beta]], established in 1874.<ref name=\"bairdtwo\"/>\n\nThe development of \"fraternities for women\" during this time was a major accomplishment in the way of women's rights and equality. By mere existence, these organizations were defying the odds; the founding women were able to advance their organizations despite many factors working against them. The first \"Women's Fraternities\" not only had to overcome \"restrictive social customs, unequal status under the law and the underlying presumption that they were less able than men,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/Adventures%20in%20Friendship.pdf|title = Adventure in Friendship: A History of The National Panhellenic Conference|date = |accessdate = October 12, 2015|website = National Panhellenic Conference|publisher = National Panhellenic Conference|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130628024619/https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/Adventures%20in%20Friendship.pdf|archive-date = June 28, 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> but at the same time had to deal with the same challenges as fraternities with college administrations. Today, both social and multicultural sororities are present on more than 650 college campuses across the United States and Canada. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) serves as the \"umbrella organization\" for 26 (inter)national sororities. Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines. The first fraternities were established in the [[University of the Philippines]]. The now defunct Patriotic and Progressive Rizal Center Academic Brotherhood (Rizal Center Fraternity), a brotherhood of Jose Rizal followers, was founded in 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xiaochua.net/2013/06/19/xiao-time-18-june-2013-ika-105-na-anibersaryo-ng-unibersidad-ng-pilipinas/ |title=XIAO TIME, 18 June 2013: Ika-105 na Anibersaryo ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas | accessdate=2018-08-09|date=2013-06-19 }}</ref> This was followed by the Rizal Center Sorority.

While these limitations have since been abolished by both the [[Interfraternity Conference]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], students of various ethnicities have come together to form a council of multicultural Greek organizations. The Multicultural Greek Council, officially formed in 1998, is a coordinating body of 19 Greek organizations, including nine fraternities, and ten sororities with cultural affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MGC|url=http://mgc.tamu.edu/history|website=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first multicultural sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, was established in November 1981 at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=\"nationalmgc.org\">{{cite web|title=EMERGENCE OF MULTICULTURAL FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS|url=http://nationalmgc.org/about/|website=National Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=National Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  The formation of this Greek organization allowed for the emergence of a multicultural fraternity and sorority movement, giving birth to a multicultural movement.\n\n==Structure and organization==\n===Common elements===\n====Gender exclusivity====\nFraternities and sororities traditionally have been single-sex organizations, with fraternities consisting exclusively of men and sororities consisting exclusively of women. In the United States, fraternities and sororities have a statutory exemption from [[Title IX]] legislation prohibiting this type of gender exclusion within student groups, and organizations such as the [[Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee]] lobby to maintain it.<ref name=\"bi1\">{{cite news|title=Why One School Decided To Make All Of Its Fraternities And Sororities Co-Ed |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-college-fraternities-sororities-co-ed-2014-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=9 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"bl\">{{cite news|title=Fraternities Lobby Against Campus Rape Investigations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/fraternities-lobby-against-campus-rape-investigations|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-20th century a small number of fraternities, such as [[Alpha Theta]] and [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]], have opted to become co-educational and admit female members; however, these generally represent a minority of Greek-letter organizations and no such fraternity is currently a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, the largest international association of fraternities.<ref name=\"bi1\" /><ref name=\"bl\" />  The first coed fraternity was Pi Alpha Tau (1963\u20131991) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pi Alpha Tau Papers, 1963\u20131991, UIC Archives|url = http://findingaids.library.uic.edu/ead/lhsc/059-07-16.pdf|website = uic.edu|accessdate = 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nMuch more commonly, coed fraternities exist in the form of \"service\" fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]], Alpha Tau Mu [[Service fraternities and sororities|and others]]. These organizations are similar to \"social\" fraternities and sororities, with the exception of being coed and non-residential.\n\nIn 2016, [[Chi Phi]] began allowing transgender members, or those identifying as male, to join the social fraternity.<ref>http://college.usatoday.com/2016/07/08/chi-phi-transgender-pledges/</ref> Several sororities have adjusted their policies to confirm that transgender prospective members are allowable.\n\nImportantly, all these variants have stemmed from a process of ''self-determination,'' without challenge by other Greeks. But in a [[bellwether]] case, in 2016 Harvard University changed its student conduct code to bar members of single-sex groups from leading campus groups, serving as captains of sports teams or participating in valuable academic fellowships. This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters. These federal structures are largely governed by alumni members of the fraternity, though with some input from the active (student) members.<ref>{{cite web|title=GOVERNANCE OF UNDERGRADUATE SOCIAL FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES|url=http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|website=upenn.edu|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=4 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727030604/http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|archive-date=27 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ERM, ORSA and Corporate Governance: The Small Company Challenges|url=http://www.firstconsulting.com/erm-orsa-and-corporate-governance-small-company-challenges|website=firstconsulting.com|publisher=First Consulting}}</ref>\n\n====Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)====\n{{See also|Sorority recruitment}}\n[[File:Adphicornell.jpg|thumb|left|The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at [[Cornell University]]]]\n[[File:Zeta Psi Fraternity House, Lafayette College 01.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Zeta Psi]] chapter house at [[Lafayette College]]]]\nMost Greek letter organizations select potential members through a two-part process of vetting and probation, called rushing and pledging, respectively. During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delta Upsilon Ode2.ogg|thumb|\"Delta Upsilon Ode,\" a traditional [[Delta Upsilon]] song written in 1884 by Edward La Wall Seip (sample)]]\n[[File:\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir\".ogg|thumb|\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir,\" a traditional Sigma Chi song written in 1885 by Charles Eldridge (sample)]]\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\n\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority. Such prospective candidates are known as \"legacies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |title=Glossary of Greek Life Terms |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=gmu.edu |publisher=George Mason University Interfraternity Council |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325043212/http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/fraternity-legacy/ |title=Fraternity Legacies |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=thefraternityadvisor.com |publisher=The Fraternity Advisor |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nMembership in more than one fraternity or sorority is almost always prohibited. Recently, some Greek-letter organizations have replaced the term \"pledge\" with that of \"associate member\" or \"new member\".  [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], in 2014, abolished pledging altogether.

A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities. \n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\n[[File:Phi Kappa Sigma 1872 W&J College.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] at [[Washington & Jefferson College]] in 1872]]\n[[File:Fraternity Initiation.png|thumb|right|A dramatized depiction of a fraternity initiation ritual]]\n[[File:The Model Chapter Room (526839509).jpg|thumb|A \"model chapter room\" of [[Kappa Sigma]]]]\n\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies. While the identity of members or officers is rarely concealed, fraternities and sororities initiate members following the pledge period through sometimes elaborate private rituals, frequently drawn or adopted from Masonic ritual practice or that of the Greek mysteries.<ref name=handbook/>\n\nAt the conclusion of an initiation ritual, the organization's secret motto, secret purpose and secret identification signs, such as handshakes and passwords, are usually revealed to its new members.

Most fraternities also have assumed heraldic achievements. Members of fraternities and sororities address members of the same organization as \"brother\" (in the case of fraternities) or \"sister\" (in the case of sororities). The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].

Hazing during the pledge period can sometimes culminate in an event commonly known as \"Hell Week\" in which a week-long series of physical and mental torments are inflicted on pledges. Common hazing practices include sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and other types of spanking, use of [[stress positions]], forced runs, [[Busy work#Military settings|busy work]], forced drinking and [[mind games]]. Rarer incidents involving [[human branding|branding]], [[enemas]], urination on pledges and the forced consumption of [[spoiled food]] have been reported. Hazing, in many cases, has been reported and has led to the permanent disposal of particular chapters of fraternities and sororities across the country.\n\n[[File:Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of fraternity hazing from the early 20th century]]\nSupporters of fraternities note that hazing is almost universally prohibited by national fraternity organizations, and the occurrence of hazing in undergraduate fraternity chapters goes against official policy. Supporters of fraternities also note that hazing is not unique to Greek-letter organizations and is often reported in other student organizations, such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 2007, an anti-hazing hotline was set up to report incidents of hazing on college campuses. Currently, 46 national fraternity and sorority organizations support the toll-free number, which generates automatic email messages regarding hazing and sends them to the national headquarters directly from the National Anti-Hazing Hotline.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fraternal Law \u00bb Anti-Hazing Hotline|url = http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|website = fraternallaw.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027112504/http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|archive-date = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead}}</ref> Every year, the last week of September is considered to be National Hazing Prevention Week (NHPW).

In modern usage, \"Greek letter organization\" is often synonymous with the terms \"fraternity\" and \"sorority\".

The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]]. The further birthing of [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841) and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) collectively established Union College as the [[Mother of Fraternities]].\nThe social fraternity [[Chi Phi]], although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiphi.dynamic.omegafi.com/about-chi-phi/|title=History of Chi Phi|author=|date=|website=www.chiphi.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldest.org/culture/fraternities-north-america/|title=7 Oldest Fraternities in North America|author=|date=|website=www.oldest.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFraternities represented the intersection between [[dining club]]s, [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and secret initiatory orders such as [[Freemasonry]]. Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\".

The Adelphean, founded in 1851 eventually became [[Alpha Delta Pi]], while The Philomathean, begun in 1852, eventually became [[Phi Mu]]. Together, these sororities are known as the \"Macon Magnolias\". Several other unrelated \"Philomathean Societies\" emerged during the 19th Century, most notably a literary society at UPenn and another, unrelated, at NYU.</ref> though fraternity-like organizations for women didn't take their current form until the establishment of [[Pi Beta Phi]] in 1867 and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] in 1870. The term \"sorority\" was invented by a professor of Latin who felt the word \"fraternity\" was inappropriate for a group of ladies. The first organization to use the term \"sorority\" was [[Gamma Phi Beta]], established in 1874.<ref name=\"bairdtwo\"/>\n\nThe development of \"fraternities for women\" during this time was a major accomplishment in the way of women's rights and equality. By mere existence, these organizations were defying the odds; the founding women were able to advance their organizations despite many factors working against them.

Today, both social and multicultural sororities are present on more than 650 college campuses across the United States and Canada. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) serves as the \"umbrella organization\" for 26 (inter)national sororities. Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines.

This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters. These federal structures are largely governed by alumni members of the fraternity, though with some input from the active (student) members.<ref>{{cite web|title=GOVERNANCE OF UNDERGRADUATE SOCIAL FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES|url=http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|website=upenn.edu|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=4 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727030604/http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|archive-date=27 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ERM, ORSA and Corporate Governance: The Small Company Challenges|url=http://www.firstconsulting.com/erm-orsa-and-corporate-governance-small-company-challenges|website=firstconsulting.com|publisher=First Consulting}}</ref>\n\n====Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)====\n{{See also|Sorority recruitment}}\n\nMost Greek letter organizations select potential members through a two-part process of vetting and probation, called rushing and pledging, respectively. During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delta Upsilon Ode2.ogg|thumb|\"Delta Upsilon Ode,\" a traditional [[Delta Upsilon]] song written in 1884 by Edward La Wall Seip (sample)]]\n[[File:\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir\".ogg|thumb|\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir,\" a traditional Sigma Chi song written in 1885 by Charles Eldridge (sample)]]\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\n[[File:Adphicornell.jpg|thumb|left|The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at [[Cornell University]]]]\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority.

Recently, some Greek-letter organizations have replaced the term \"pledge\" with that of \"associate member\" or \"new member\".  [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], in 2014, abolished pledging altogether.

A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities. \n\n[[File:Zeta Psi Fraternity House, Lafayette College 01.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Zeta Psi]] chapter house at [[Lafayette College]]]]\n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\n[[File:Phi Kappa Sigma 1872 W&J College.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] at [[Washington & Jefferson College]] in 1872]]\n[[File:Fraternity Initiation.png|thumb|right|A dramatized depiction of a fraternity initiation ritual]]\n[[File:The Model Chapter Room (526839509).jpg|thumb|A \"model chapter room\" of [[Kappa Sigma]]]]\n\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies.

Most fraternities also have assumed heraldic achievements. Members of fraternities and sororities address members of the same organization as \"brother\" (in the case of fraternities) or \"sister\" (in the case of sororities). The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].
