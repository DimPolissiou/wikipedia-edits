The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

John Michael Falcone (Bass guitar, Vocals) replaced Leo in 1996.  Fulano de Tal recorded two full-length [[albums]]. The name of the band is the Portuguese/Spanish variant of the American term \"[[John Doe]]\". The first album was called ''Normal'' and it was released in April 1997 through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]/[[RCA]] records. At the time, Fulano was the first north-American latin rock band to be signed to a major label.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The band toured extensively throughout the [[United States]] and some [[Latin American]] countries during the years of 1997 and 1999. In 2000, the band released their sophomore effort, ''Etc.'' through the independent label: Radio Vox/DLN. It was also in 2000 that the band separated. Brendan and Julian joined pop/superstar [[Shakira]] as part of her touring band. [[Elsten Torres]] released the Grammy nominated album, ''Individual'' in 2006 under the name \"Fulano\", but it was his first solo album although both Brendan and Julian joined in the production and performance of the album.\n\n== Discography ==\n\n===Revoluci\u00f3n===\n''Revoluci\u00f3n'' (in English \u2013 Revolution) is the first recording by singer/songwriter; [[Elsten Torres]] under the artistic name of \"Fulano De Tal\". Released in 1994 under the independent label, \"Radio Vox\". This EP contained one song in different genres. The version called, \"mix de la tierra\" was released as a single and also as a music video. The song received a great deal of critical and commercial attention because of its theme. The song was a protest song, regarding the Cuban rafters situation of the mid 1990s. There are also two English versions of the song, as well as a more pop version of the song in both English and Spanish.\n\n#Revoluci\u00f3n \u2013 (Elsten Torres) \u2013 4:06 (mix de la tierra)\n#Revoluci\u00f3n \u2013 (Elsten Torres) \u2013 5:30 (mix del cielo)\n#Revolution - (Elsten Torres) \u2013 4:06 (acoustic pissed off mix)\n#Revolution - (Elsten Torres) \u2013 5:32 (the island is gonna blow mix)\n#Revoluci\u00f3n \u2013 (Elsten Torres) \u2013 3:37 (version sangre)\n\n====Personnel====\n*Guitars & Lead Vocals: [[Elsten Torres]] aka Fulano De Tal\n*Percussion & chants: [[Frank Lord]]\n*Electric guitars: [[Cesar Lemos]]\n*Bass: [[Julio Hernandez]]\n*Programming and Keyboards: [[Rodolfo Castillo]]\n\n=== Normal===\n''Normal'' is the major label debut album of Fulano De Tal.

The original band members were: [[Elsten Torres]] ([[Lead Vocals]], [[Guitar]], & [[Songwriter]]), Brendan Buckley ([[Drummer]], programming, [[vocals]]), Julian Adam Zimmon (Guitars), and Leo Nobre (Bass guitar, Background vocals). John Michael Falcone (Bass guitar, Vocals) replaced Leo in 1996.  Fulano de Tal recorded two full-length [[albums]]. The name of the band is the Portuguese/Spanish variant of the American term \"[[John Doe]]\". The first album was called ''Normal'' and it was released in April 1997 through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]/[[RCA]] records. At the time, Fulano was the first north-American latin rock band to be signed to a major label.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The band toured extensively throughout the [[United States]] and some [[Latin American]] countries during the years of 1997 and 1999. In 2000, the band released their sophomore effort, ''Etc.'' through the independent label: Radio Vox/DLN. It was also in 2000 that the band separated. Brendan and Julian joined pop/superstar [[Shakira]] as part of her touring band. [[Elsten Torres]] released the Grammy nominated album, ''Individual'' in 2006 under the name \"Fulano\", but it was his first solo album although both Brendan and Julian joined in the production and performance of the album.\n\n== Discography ==\n\n===Revoluci\u00f3n===\n''Revoluci\u00f3n'' (in English \u2013 Revolution) is the first recording by singer/songwriter; [[Elsten Torres]] under the artistic name of \"Fulano De Tal\". Released in 1994 under the independent label, \"Radio Vox\". This EP contained one song in different genres. The version called, \"mix de la tierra\" was released as a single and also as a music video. The song received a great deal of critical and commercial attention because of its theme. The song was a protest song, regarding the Cuban rafters situation of the mid 90's. There are also two English versions of the song, as well as a more pop version of the song in both English and Spanish.\n\n#Revoluci\u00f3n \u2013 (Elsten Torres) \u2013 4:06 (mix de la tierra)\n#Revoluci\u00f3n \u2013 (Elsten Torres) \u2013 5:30 (mix del cielo)\n#Revolution - (Elsten Torres) \u2013 4:06 (acoustic pissed off mix)\n#Revolution - (Elsten Torres) \u2013 5:32 (the island is gonna blow mix)\n#Revoluci\u00f3n \u2013 (Elsten Torres) \u2013 3:37 (version sangre)\n\n====Personnel====\n*Guitars & Lead Vocals: [[Elsten Torres]] aka Fulano De Tal\n*Percussion & chants: [[Frank Lord]]\n*Electric guitars: [[Cesar Lemos]]\n*Bass: [[Julio Hernandez]]\n*Programming and Keyboards: [[Rodolfo Castillo]]\n\n=== Normal===\n''Normal'' is the major label debut album of Fulano De Tal. Released in 1997 under the BMG/RCA label, this album was the first major release of any Latin Rock artist from the U.S.A. Songs released from the album included ''Cristina Maria'', ''No Soy Gringo'', and ''Los Demas''. The band members were: [[Elsten Torres]], Brendan Buckley, [[Julian Adam Zimmon]], and [[John M. Falcone]]. They began touring throughout the U.S., Canada and Latin America for over 2 years until the release of their next album.\n\n# Cristina Maria - 4:39\n# No soy gringo - 3:30\n# Los Demas - 4:51\n# Estados Unidos - 4:38\n# Inquietud - 3:39\n# Afuera de mi cabeza - 3:22\n# Duele - 4:02\n# Complicated - 3:38\n# Selfish - 5:29\n# No quiero trabajar - 3:48\n# Normal - 6:48\n# Cuando me muera yo - 4:45\n\n====Personnel ====\n*Guitars & Lead Vocals: [[Elsten Torres]]\n*Drums, Percussion & Background vocals: Brendan Buckley\n*Electric guitars: [[Julian Adam Zimmon]]\n*Bass: [[John M.

After the success of the band's major label debut, the band was disappointed with the labels direction, so they opted out of their contract and released the Indie album, '''\"Etc\"''', shortening its name to \"Fulano\". \"Etc\", was also very well received by the critics and fans. It consists of recordings done in both large studios and home studios. Shortly after the albums\u2019 release the band went back out on the road for a short summer tour but the band broke up right after the end of the tour.

It\u2019s not the subject matter of these games that attracts\u2026it\u2019s the reward system\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, he argues for the support of video games because they also require one to make decisions, whereas books and other forms of art may conjure up imagination and emotions but don't require decision-making.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJohnson acknowledges that although the video game industry is growing, the literature on the subject is limited at best. Johnson offers several sources for information on [[Game studies|ludology]]; [http://www.ludology.org/ Ludology.org] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120919061609/http://seriousgames.org/ seriousgames.org] as well as the books ''Got Game'' by John Beck and Mitchell Wade and ''The Play Ethic'' by [[Pat Kane]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|224\u2013225}}\n\n=== Television and film ===\nJohnson admits that television and film demand less decision-making skills than video games, but also says that the benefits from reading (attention, patience, retention, the parsing of narrative threads, etc.) are making a rise in television and film as well, despite its lack of translating letters to meaning or activating the imagination in quite the same way that books do.<ref name=\":1\" /> He discusses three principles of television and film: \"multiple threading,\" \"flashing arrow,\" and \"social networks.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \"Multiple threading\", according to Johnson, is marrying complex narrative structure to complex subject matter with multiple plots and subplots (for example, he states that shows like ''ER'' & ''24'' have up to 10 threads per episode).<ref name=\":1\" /> He states that a \"Flashing Arrow\" is a kind of narrative signpost purposely planted to help the audience keep track of what's going on, but there has been an increasing lack of arrows over the years both, and this lack of arrows is used to draw on intricate plotlines and obscure references.<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, he states that \"reality shows demand that we track multiple relationships, since the action of these shows revolves around the shifting feuds and alliances between more than a dozen individuals\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Johnson says this activates social intelligence, defining it as \u201cour ability to monitor and recall many distinct vectors of interaction in the population around us\u201d and, thus, watchers shall be able to better understand social networks.<ref name=\":1\" /> He asserts that television is a \"brilliant medium\" for determining how skilled people are at understanding interpersonal connections, or their [[Autism-spectrum quotient|Autism Quotient]] (the higher a person's emotional intelligence, the lower their \"AQ\"),<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|98\u201399}} and that [[Reality television|reality shows]] in particular realistically display the complexity of \"[[social network]] maps\" in human relations, where a group of people have complex and intertwined engagement.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|108}}\n\nEarlier television, Johnson says, simplified narrative and human relationships, while modern trends not only in reality shows but in \"multiple [[Narrative thread|threading]]\" in scripted programs such as ''[[The Sopranos]]'' improve the audience's cognitive skills.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|67, 72}} He suggests too that modern television and films have reduced the number of \"[[flashing arrow]]s\", narrative clues to help the audience understand the plot, and require audiences to do more cognitive work paying attention to background detail and information if they wish to follow what they are viewing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|73\u201374, 77\u201378}}\n\nLater in the book, he mentions that these features of television are also prevalent in film, too.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== The internet ===\nJohnson argues that the internet \u201chas challenged our minds in three fundamental and related ways: by being participatory, by forcing users to learn new interfaces, and by creating new channels for social interaction.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> He uses blogs and utilizing Google to learn things as examples of participation.<ref name=\":1\" /> He declares that \u201caccelerating pace of new platforms and software applications forces users to probe and master new environments\u201d such as \u201clearning the tricks of a new e-mail client, configuring the video chat software properly, getting your bearings after installing a new operating system.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, he points out that \u201cin the past few years [the Web has] been [a tool] for augmenting social connection\u201d naming \u201conline personals, social and business network sites such as Friendster, the meetup.com service so central to the political organization of the 2004 campaign.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Overall, he presents evidence to buttress the Internet's benefits.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe book has received mixed critical reviews. In one ''[[The New York Times]]'' review, [[Janet Maslin]] was primarily negative, dismissing the book's \"facile argument\" and sparsity of hard evidence and claiming that \"The reader rattles around within the book's narrow universe and repeatedly bumps into the same thing: reiterations of Mr. Johnson's one big idea.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Absolution for Couch Potatoes and Gamers | first = Janet | last = Maslin | date = 26 May 2005 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/books/26masl.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 22 March 2011}}</ref> In another, [[Walter Kirn]], while acknowledging a lack of science and questioning some of the book's premises with regards to the benefits of reality TV, praised Johnson's \"elegant polemic\", concluding that \"[c]onsidered purely on its own terms, Johnson's thesis holds up despite these quibbles.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = 'Everything Bad Is Good for You': The Couch Potato Path to a Higher I.Q. | first = Walter | last = Kirn | date = 22 May 2005 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/books/review/22KIRNL.html |accessdate= 22 March 2011}}</ref> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' gave the book an overall positive review, describing it as \"chock-full of interesting insights that are clearly the reflection of an agile and catholic intellect\", but also suggested that the book is largely built around a [[straw man]] argument and thus \"largely misses the point of the more valid critique of today's pop culture\".<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/05/67611 |title = Everything Bad's Not Bad | first = Suneel |last = Ratan | date = 24 May 2005 | accessdate = 22 March 2011 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' found part of Johnson's thesis \u2014 that some elements of pop culture have grown more complex \u2014 persuasive, but not the second claim that this greater complexity offers any tangible benefits for the public aside from preparing them to handle more complex pop culture;

Johnson offers several sources for information on [[Game studies|ludology]]; [http://www.ludology.org/ Ludology.org] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120919061609/http://seriousgames.org/ seriousgames.org] as well as the books ''Got Game'' by John Beck and Mitchell Wade and ''The Play Ethic'' by [[Pat Kane]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|224\u2013225}}\n\n=== Television and film ===\nJohnson admits that television and film demand less decision-making skills than video games, but also says that the benefits from reading (attention, patience, retention, the parsing of narrative threads, etc.) are making a rise in television and film as well, despite its lack of translating letters to meaning or activating the imagination in quite the same way that books do.<ref name=\":1\" /> He discusses three principles of television and film: \"multiple threading,\" \"flashing arrow,\" and \"social networks.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \"Multiple threading\", according to Johnson, is marrying complex narrative structure to complex subject matter with multiple plots and subplots (for example, he states that shows like ''ER'' & ''24'' have up to 10 threads per episode).<ref name=\":1\" /> He states that a \"Flashing Arrow\" is a kind of narrative signpost purposely planted to help the audience keep track of what\u2019s going on, but there has been an increasing lack of arrows over the years both, and this lack of arrows is used to draw on intricate plotlines and obscure references.<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, he states that \"reality shows demand that we track multiple relationships, since the action of these shows revolves around the shifting feuds and alliances between more than a dozen individuals\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Johnson says this activates social intelligence, defining it as \u201cour ability to monitor and recall many distinct vectors of interaction in the population around us\u201d and, thus, watchers shall be able to better understand social networks.<ref name=\":1\" /> He asserts that television is a \"brilliant medium\" for determining how skilled people are at understanding interpersonal connections, or their [[Autism-spectrum quotient|Autism Quotient]] (the higher a person's emotional intelligence, the lower their \"AQ\"),<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|98\u201399}} and that [[Reality television|reality shows]] in particular realistically display the complexity of \"[[social network]] maps\" in human relations, where a group of people have complex and intertwined engagement.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|108}}\n\nEarlier television, Johnson says, simplified narrative and human relationships, while modern trends not only in reality shows but in \"multiple [[Narrative thread|threading]]\" in scripted programs such as ''[[The Sopranos]]'' improve the audience's cognitive skills.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|67, 72}} He suggests too that modern television and films have reduced the number of \"[[flashing arrow]]s\", narrative clues to help the audience understand the plot, and require audiences to do more cognitive work paying attention to background detail and information if they wish to follow what they are viewing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|73\u201374, 77\u201378}}\n\nLater in the book, he mentions that these features of television are also prevalent in film, too.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== The internet ===\nJohnson argues that the internet \u201chas challenged our minds in three fundamental and related ways: by being participatory, by forcing users to learn new interfaces, and by creating new channels for social interaction.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> He uses blogs and utilizing Google to learn things as examples of participation.<ref name=\":1\" /> He declares that \u201caccelerating pace of new platforms and software applications forces users to probe and master new environments\u201d such as \u201clearning the tricks of a new e-mail client, configuring the video chat software properly, getting your bearings after installing a new operating system.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, he points out that \u201cin the past few years [the Web has] been [a tool] for augmenting social connection\u201d naming \u201conline personals, social and business network sites such as Friendster, the meetup.com service so central to the political organization of the 2004 campaign.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Overall, he presents evidence to buttress the Internet's benefits.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe book has received mixed critical reviews. In one ''[[The New York Times]]'' review, [[Janet Maslin]] was primarily negative, dismissing the book's \"facile argument\" and sparsity of hard evidence and claiming that \"The reader rattles around within the book's narrow universe and repeatedly bumps into the same thing: reiterations of Mr. Johnson's one big idea.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Absolution for Couch Potatoes and Gamers | first = Janet | last = Maslin | date = 26 May 2005 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/books/26masl.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 22 March 2011}}</ref> In another, [[Walter Kirn]], while acknowledging a lack of science and questioning some of the book's premises with regards to the benefits of reality TV, praised Johnson's \"elegant polemic\", concluding that \"[c]onsidered purely on its own terms, Johnson's thesis holds up despite these quibbles.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = 'Everything Bad Is Good for You': The Couch Potato Path to a Higher I.Q. | first = Walter | last = Kirn | date = 22 May 2005 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/books/review/22KIRNL.html |accessdate= 22 March 2011}}</ref> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' gave the book an overall positive review, describing it as \"chock-full of interesting insights that are clearly the reflection of an agile and catholic intellect\", but also suggested that the book is largely built around a [[straw man]] argument and thus \"largely misses the point of the more valid critique of today's pop culture\".<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/05/67611 |title = Everything Bad's Not Bad | first = Suneel |last = Ratan | date = 24 May 2005 | accessdate = 22 March 2011 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' found part of Johnson's thesis \u2014 that some elements of pop culture have grown more complex \u2014 persuasive, but not the second claim that this greater complexity offers any tangible benefits for the public aside from preparing them to handle more complex pop culture; it criticized the shortage of hard science and the conclusions drawn from what science exists and also the application of [[literary theory]] to visual arts media.<ref>{{cite news | title = What Zelda Did | first = Steven | last= Poole |authorlink = Steven Poole| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/02/highereducation.news | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2 July 2005 | accessdate = 22 March 2011}}</ref> The [[Associated Press]] review praised the book overall as \"an engaging read\", although it noted that the book was uneven, with TV and video game discussions better than those on film and the internet, and repetitive in presenting its theme.<ref>{{cite news | title = Shelf Life | first = Julie | last = Reed | date = 16 August 2005 | agency = Associated Press | newspaper = [[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]] | accessdate = 22 March 2011 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qRMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4334,1941545&dq=everything-bad-is-good-for-you+johnson&hl=en | page = C1, C2}}</ref> [[Salon.com]] described it simply as \"a fine contrarian defense of pop culture\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Hillary, Player Hater | first = Farhad | last = Manjoo | work = [[Salon.com]] | date = 22 July 2005 | accessdate = 22 March 2011 | url = http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2005/07/22/grandtheft/ }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225044/http://www.handheldlearning2008.com/handheld-learning-conference-and-exhibition/video/905-video/122-steven-johnson-author Steven Johnson keynote talk] Everything Bad is Good for You, London October 2008\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/magazine/24TV.html Watching TV Makes You Smarter], New York Times Magazine\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4663852 Interview], [[National Public Radio]]\n* [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/braincandy.html Interview], [[CBC.ca]]\n\n{{Steven Berlin Johnson}}\n\n[[Category:2005 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Books about the media]]\n[[Category:Popular culture books]]\n[[Category:Books about video games]]\n[[Category:Books about television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: don\u2019t \u2192 don't, what\u2019s \u2192 what's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Bad_Is_Good_for_You"}
