Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience.

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

Some of the movie\u2019s best jokes don\u2019t fully land in their delivery...It\u2019s not shocking that 'Mean Girls' is a fast-paced fancy fun time, but it\u2019s a real treat to find that it\u2019s still witty, worldly, and wise.\"<ref>Holdren, Sara.

Mr. Richmond and Ms. Benjamin\u2019s many (many) musical numbers are passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards, yet they rarely capture either the tone or the time of being a certain age in a certain era... the show weighs in at two and a half hours, as opposed to the movie\u2019s zippy 97 minutes.\" However, he ultimately stated he enjoyed parts of the performance, saying: \"There\u2019s a reason the show is called 'Mean Girls.' They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience.

They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status. If this was to be done, it would presumably require that the boundaries of the regions be slightly modified so that they correspond exactly with their constituent districts.\n\n* [[Regions of Assam]]\n* [[Regions of Gujarat]]\n\n== Districts ==\n{{main|List of districts in India}}\nStates and territories (or divisions) are further subdivided into [[Districts of India|districts]] (''zilla''), of which there are 722 (as of 2018).

They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status.

He was [[Don Bal\u00f3n Award|La Liga Best Foreign Player]] in 1997, when he also won the [[European Golden Boot]] after scoring 34 goals in La Liga, and he was named [[Serie A Footballer of the Year]] in 1998. One of the most marketable sportsmen in the world, the first [[Nike Mercurial Vapor|Nike Mercurial]] boots\u2013R9\u2013were commissioned for Ronaldo in 1998. He was named in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by [[Pel\u00e9]], and was inducted into the [[Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame]] and the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nRonaldo played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals, and is the [[Brazil national football team#Top goalscorers|second-highest goalscorer]] for his national team, trailing only Pel\u00e9. At age 17, Ronaldo was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he received the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] for player of the tournament, helping Brazil reach [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] where he suffered a [[seizure|convulsive fit]] hours before the defeat to France. He won a second World Cup in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] where he starred in a front three with [[Rivaldo]] and [[Ronaldinho]]. Ronaldo scored twice in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], and received the [[FIFA World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as the tournament's top goalscorer. At the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Ronaldo scored his [[List of FIFA World Cup goalscorers#Top goalscorers|15th World Cup goal]], which was a World Cup record at the time. He also won the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in [[1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1997]], where he was player of the tournament, and [[1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1999]], where he was top goalscorer.\n\nHaving suffered further injuries, Ronaldo retired from professional football in 2011. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, he has been the outstanding influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. Post-retirement, Ronaldo has continued his work as a [[UNDP Goodwill Ambassador|United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador]], a position to which he was appointed in 2000. He served as an ambassador for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Ronaldo became the majority owner of La Liga club [[Real Valladolid]] in September 2018 after buying 51% of the club's shares.\n\n==Early life==\nRonaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima was born on 18 September 1976 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, the third child of N\u00e9lio Naz\u00e1rio de Lima, Snr. and S\u00f4nia dos Santos Barata.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ronaldo's return to glory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sports_personality_2002/2556663.stm |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=BBC |date=8 December 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"Mosley\"/> Ronaldo has a brother, N\u00e9lio Jr.<ref name=\"Mosley\">{{cite book|title=Ronaldo: The Journey of a Genius|first1=James|last1=Mosley|year=2005|isbn=1-84018-964-9|publisher=Mainstream Publishing}}</ref><ref>Ronaldo: Manual de Vuelo (Brazil Documentary film) 1997</ref> His parents separated when he was 11, and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a career in football.<ref name=\"Wash post\"/> He played on the streets of [[Bento Ribeiro]], a suburb of Rio de Janeiro.

In the 1990s, Ronaldo starred at club level for [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]], [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[Inter Milan]]. His moves to Spain and Italy made him only the second player, after [[Diego Maradona]], to [[List of most expensive association football transfers#Historical progression|break the world transfer record twice]], all before his 21st birthday. By 23, he had scored over 200 goals for club and country. After almost three years of inactivity due to serious knee injuries and recuperation, Ronaldo joined [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 2002, which was followed by spells at [[A.C.

He was [[Don Bal\u00f3n Award|La Liga Best Foreign Player]] in 1997, when he also won the [[European Golden Boot]] after scoring 34 goals in La Liga, and he was named [[Serie A Footballer of the Year]] in 1998. One of the most marketable sportsmen in the world, the first [[Nike Mercurial Vapor|Nike Mercurial]] boots\u2013R9\u2013were commissioned for Ronaldo in 1998. He was named in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by [[Pel\u00e9]], and was inducted into the [[Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame]] and the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nRonaldo played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals, and is the [[Brazil national football team#Top goalscorers|second-highest goalscorer]] for his national team, trailing only Pel\u00e9. At age 17, Ronaldo was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he received the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] for player of the tournament, helping Brazil reach [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] where he suffered a [[seizure|convulsive fit]] hours before the defeat to France. He won a second World Cup in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] where he starred in a front three with [[Rivaldo]] and [[Ronaldinho]].

As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, he has been the outstanding influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. Post-retirement, Ronaldo has continued his work as a [[UNDP Goodwill Ambassador|United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador]], a position to which he was appointed in 2000. He served as an ambassador for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].
