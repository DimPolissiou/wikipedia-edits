The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]]. Therefore, there were previously unsuccessful attempts to propose an extension to Changi Airport.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT Link to Airport: Not in next 10 years|date=17 May 1991|work=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=No MRT Line to Changi yet|date=20 March 1992|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 was being built.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT extension to airport reconsidered.|date=2 August 1994|work=The Straits Times}}</ref> The earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing [[East West MRT line|East West line]] at [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]],<ref>{{Cite news|title=Next Stop:Changi Airport?|date=2 August 1994|work=The New Paper}}</ref> with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the east coast of the island.

The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely [[Expo MRT station|Expo]], and the Changi Airport station, the underground station built between Terminal 2 and [[Changi Airport Terminal 3|Terminal 3]]. The alignment of the station at the airport has been switched perpendicularly to an east\u2013west direction, such that the station leads to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19961212-1.2.51.7 |title=MRT Line will not go beyond passenger terminals |website=The Straits Times |access-date=17 October 2019 |date=12 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=changi+airport+mrt&KA=changi+airport+mrt&DF=02%2F01%2F1990&DT=01%2F09%2F2010&Display=0&NPT=&L=English&CTA=Article|title=Changi Airport MRT line details|date=12 December 1996|work=The Business Times|access-date=}}</ref> As part of the President's Challenge 2001, a part of a charity walk goes through the tunnel between Expo and Changi Airport stations.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Seng Kim|first=Lim|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Chairty walk to talk place underground|date=12 August 2001|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Perfectly legal, and for a good cause!|date=9 September 2001|work=The New Paper|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Tan|first=Terence|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Tunnel walk a hit|date=9 September 2001|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe Contract 504 for the construction of Changi Airport MRT station and its associated tunnels was awarded to Kumagai-Sembawang Joint Venture in October 1998.

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]]. Therefore, there were previously unsuccessful attempts to propose an extension to Changi Airport.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT Link to Airport: Not in next 10 years|date=17 May 1991|work=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=No MRT Line to Changi yet|date=20 March 1992|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 was being built.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT extension to airport reconsidered.|date=2 August 1994|work=The Straits Times}}</ref> The earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing [[East West MRT line|East West line]] at [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]],<ref>{{Cite news|title=Next Stop:Changi Airport?|date=2 August 1994|work=The New Paper}}</ref> with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the east coast of the island.

The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely [[Expo MRT station|Expo]], and the Changi Airport station, the underground station built between Terminal 2 and [[Changi Airport Terminal 3|Terminal 3]].
