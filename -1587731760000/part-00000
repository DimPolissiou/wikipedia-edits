It is one of the most important musical instruments of the [[Mongols|Mongol people]], and is considered a symbol of the Mongolian nation. The morin khuur is one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] identified by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]]. It is also associated with the youtube channel blad3x ez. I has been around for a long time now\n\n== Name ==\nIn English usually called '''''morin khuur''''' (approx \"MORE-een HOOR\") or translated as \"horsehead fiddle\" (although the more literal translation would be just \"horse fiddle\" (or \"horse stringed-instrument\") --\"'Morin'\"=\"horse\", \"'khuur'\"=\"fiddle\"/\"stringed-instrument\").\n\nThe full [[Classical Mongolian]] name for the morin khuur is ''morin tolo\u03b3ai tai qu\u03b3ur'',  {{MongolUnicode|\u182e\u1823\u1837\u1822\u1828<br />\u1832\u1823\u182f\u1823\u182d\u1820\u1822 \u1832\u1820\u1822<br />\u182c\u1823\u182d\u1823\u1837}}, (which in modern [[Khalkh]] [[cyrillic]] is \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d \u0442\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0443\u0440) meaning ''fiddle with a horse's head''.

Accessed 23 April 2010.</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\nThe instrument consists of a [[trapezoid|trapeziform]] wooden-framed sound box to which two strings are attached.  It is held nearly upright with the sound box in the musician's lap or between the musician's legs. The strings are made from hairs from nylon or horses' tails,<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Morin khuur\n| url = http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| publisher = www.silkroadproject.org\n| accessdate = 2010-04-24\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019144259/http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| archive-date = 2013-10-19\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> strung parallel, and run over a wooden bridge on the body up a long neck, past a second smaller bridge, to the two tuning pegs in the scroll, which is usually carved into the form of a horse's head.\n[[File:Horsehair fiddles.jpg|alt=WOMADelaide festival Adelaide, Australia 2012|thumb|At WOMADelaide festival in [[Adelaide, Australia]] in 2012.]]\nThe bow is loosely strung with horse hair coated with [[larch]] or cedar wood resin, and is held from underneath with the right hand.  The underhand grip enables the hand to tighten the loose hair of the bow, allowing very fine control of the instrument's [[timbre]].\n\nThe larger of the two strings (the \"male\" string) has 130 hairs from a [[stallion (horse)|stallion]]'s tail, while the \"female\" string has 105 hairs from a [[mare (horse)|mare]]'s tail. Nowadays the strings are made of nylon. Traditionally, the strings were tuned a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] apart, though in modern music they are more often tuned a [[perfect fourth|fourth]] apart, usually to B-flat and F. The strings are stopped either by pinching them in the joints of the index and middle fingers, or by pinching them between the nail of the little finger and the pad of the ring finger.\n\nTraditionally, the frame is covered with [[camel]], [[goat]], or [[sheep]] skin, in which case a small opening would be left in the back. However, since the 1970s, new completely wooden sound box instruments have appeared, with carved [[f-hole]]s similar to European stringed instruments.<ref>CD booklet notes, ''Mongolia: Traditional Music'', 1991, Auvidis-UNESCO D 8207</ref>\n\nThe modern standard height is {{convert|1.15|m|abbr=on}}; the distance between the upper bridge and the lower bridge is about {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}, but the upper bridge especially can be adapted to match smaller player's fingers. The sound box usually has a depth of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|cm|abbr=on}}; the width of the soundbox is about {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} at the top and {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}} at the bottom. Good quality instruments can achieve a strength of 85&nbsp;dBA, which allows it to be played (if desired) even in [[mezzo forte (musical notation)|mezzoforte]] or [[crescendo]]. When horsehair is used, the luthiers prefer to use the hair of white stallions. In general the quality of a horse hair string depends on its preparation, the climate conditions and the nutrition of the animals. That gives a wide area of quality differences.\n\nQuality nylon strings (Khalkh Mongolian: {{lang|mn|\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0445\u044f\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0441}}) last for up to 2 years, but only if prepared and placed properly on the instrument. Most beginners don't comb the strings, then the sound quality worsens quickly. Good strings nearly sound like steel strings, and in spectrograms they show about 7-8 harmonics.\n\nMorin khuur vary in form depending on region. Instruments from central [[Mongolia]] tend to have larger bodies and thus possess more volume than the smaller-bodied instruments of [[Inner Mongolia]]. Also the Inner Mongolian instruments have mostly mechanics for tightening the strings, where Mongolian luthiers mostly use wooden pegs in a slightly conic shape.  In [[Tuva]], the morin khuur is sometimes used in place of the [[igil]].\n\n== Origin ==\n{{Listen\n| pos         = left\n| filename    = Morin_khuur_sound.ogg\n| title       = \"Buyant Altai Khairkhan\" (Altai Khairkhan, 2000)\n| description = The sound of a morin khuur\n}}\n\n[[Image:Morin Khuur, South Mongolian Style.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Morin khuur, [[Inner Mongolia]]n style in China]]\n\nOne legend about the origin of the morin khuur is that a shepherd named Namjil the Cuckoo received the gift of a flying horse; he would mount it at night and fly to meet his beloved. A jealous woman had the horse's wings cut off, so that the horse fell from the air and died. The grieving shepherd made a horsehead fiddle from the now-wingless horse's skin and tail hair, and used it to play poignant songs about his horse.\n\nAnother legend credits the invention of the morin khuur to a boy named S\u00fckhe (or Suho). After a wicked lord slew the boy's prized white horse, the horse's spirit came to S\u00fckhe in a dream and instructed him to make an instrument from the horse's body, so the two could still be together and neither would be lonely. So the first morin khuur was assembled, with horse bones as its neck, horsehair strings, horse skin covering its wooden soundbox, and its scroll carved into the shape of a horse head.\n\nThe fact that most of the eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] neighbors of the [[Mongols]] possess similar horse hair instruments (such as the [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[igil]], the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[kobyz]], or the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] [[Kyl kyyak]]), though not western [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], may point to a possible origin amongst peoples that once inhabited the [[Mongolian Steppe]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and migrated to what is now Tuva, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n\nThe [[gusle]] from [[Southeastern Europe]] (Serbia, Croatia & Albania) is a very similar instrument, and may indicate this is an extremely ancient instrument perhaps even dating back to the outward migration of people out of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] some 40,000 years ago. Often these instruments are depicted with a goat head instead of a horse in Europe.\n\n== Playing technique ==\n[[File:Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia.jpg|thumb|Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia]]\n\nThe modern style Morin Khuur is played with nearly natural finger [[position (music)|positions]]. That means, the distance between two fingers usually make the distance of a [[semitone|half tone]] on the lower section of the instrument. On the tune F / B{{music|b}} the index finger hits on the low (F)  string the G, the middle finger hits the G{{music|#}}, the ring finger hits the A, the little finger the B flat. Identical positions are on the high strings - C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}. The little finger tips the B strings under the F string, while all other fingers touch the strings from the top.\n\nMelodies are usually played from F to F' on the F string, then the player switches to the B{{music|b}} string and continues with G, A, B{{music|b}}. There are 3 hand positions on the F string, and 2 positions on the B{{music|b}} strings a musician must memorize. The idea is that without moving the string hand too much the sound quality improves. The 2nd hand position on the B string is used to play C, D, E{{music|b}}, then moves a little bit for hitting the F' with the little finger, then without moving the G position can be reached with the 1st finger.\n\nIt is also possible to touch the B{{music|b}} string with the thumb to get a C, and use the ring finger under the F string to achieve the D{{music|#}}.\n\nOn the F strings only the first [[harmonic]] is used, so the scale ranges from F to F'. On the B{{music|b}} strings several harmonics are available: B{{music|b}}', F\", B\", also often players accompanying the F' on the F string with an F\" [[overtone]] at the F' position on the B{{music|b}} string.\n\nSome parts of the bowing technique is unique - the little and the ring finger of the right hand usually touch the bow hair, which is used for setting accents. The other two fingers maintain a slight pressure on the strings. A common technique with other string instruments is the \"Kist\". When the bow direction changes, the right hand moves a little bit in advance to the opposite direction to avoid scratchy sounds and for achieving a better voice. When pushing the bow the hand closes a little bit in direction of a fist, when pulling it the hand opens - nearly to a right angle between the arm and the fingers.\n\nThe instrument can be used for playing western style classical music, or Mongolian style pieces. The primary education is to learn the scales, to train the ear for achieving the \"[[muscle memory]]\", the ability to automatically adapt the finger position when a note wasn't hit properly. The main goal is to achieve a \"clear\" sound, that means no change in volume or frequency is desired. That depends on three main facts:\n\n- finger force used for touching the strings\n- pressure of the bow\n- constant sound after bow direction changes\n\nAs variation are usually used the \"[[accent (music)|accent]]\" and the \"[[vibrato]]\". Other techniques like the \"[[Col legno]]\", the \"[[Pizzicato]]\" or the \"[[Martellato]]\" are generally not used on the Morin Huur.\n\nBecause of its standard tune to Bb and F mostly western music is transposed for being played in one of the four most common scales: F major, F minor, B{{music|b}} Major, E{{music|b}} major. When used as a solo instrument the Morin Huur is often tuned a half tone higher or lower.\n\nNearly all of the Mongolian style pieces are in F minor, and often the instrument is tuned 1-2 notes lower for coming closer to the tunes used in the deep past. The instruments in the pre-socialist era of Mongolia were usually covered with skin, which mostly doesn't allow the Bb and F tune - usually tuned 2-4 notes deeper.\n\nOn the contemporary Morin Khuur the deep string is placed at the right side and the high string is placed at the left side, seen from the front of the instrument. The Igil has the opposite placement of strings, so a player has to adapt in order to play pieces made for the other one. For contemporary teaching the modern style is in use.\n\n== Education ==\n\nIn Mongolia the morin khuur can be learned at three schools:\n* The SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0443\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0433\u044b\u043d \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}), engl. \"university of arts and culture\". Here students enter in adult age for obtaining a bachelor's degree after 2 years and a master's degree after 5 years of musical education. After the master's degree the students are considered to be professional musicians, and can play at one of the state ensembles or later become a teacher at the SUIS.\n* Mongolian State Conservatory ({{lang|mn|\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0423\u043b\u0441\u044b\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438}}). Accepting students who are not older than 10 years old for the morin khuur class at the conservatory and since September 2017, the conservatory has been offering Bachelor of Music and Master of Music in Morin Khuur Performance degree.\n* The culture school of the SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0421\u0423\u0418\u0421\u044b, \u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}). Here several qualification courses are available. Graduates from this school mostly become teachers or enter the SUIS.\n\nAlso many amateur players acquired reasonable skills by taking lessons from private teachers, or being taught by their parents or other relatives.\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n\nThe morin khuur is the national instrument in Mongolia. Many festivals are held for celebrating the importance of this instrument on the Mongolian culture, like the biannual \"International Morin Huur Festival and competition\", which is organized by the \"World Morinhuur Association\". First held in 2008, second in 2010 - with 8 participating countries (Mongolia, Korea, China, Russia, USA, Germany, France, Japan) - and planned for May 2012. Here many amateurs come and play freestyle pieces, but also a professional contest is held and an instrument making competition.\n\nDuring June the \"roaring hooves\" festival is held. This is a small festival for professional skilled players - but unfortunately a closed festival. These recordings are often shown in TV reports later.\n\nOn the national festival \"Naadam\" praise songs are played for the most magnificent horse and for the highest ranked wrestler and archer. The songs are called \"Magtaal\" and accompanied by a unique style of praise and morin khuur.\n\nMany Mongolians have the instrument in their home because it is a symbol for peace and happiness.\n\nDuring the winter time, but also in beginning of the spring time a morin khuur player is called in for the \"\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u04af\u0440\u0433\u044d\u044d\u0445\", the \"ceremony for scaring away the frost\". In general many traditional pieces are played, divided in the different styles: \"\u0443\u0440\u0442\u044b\u043d \u0434\u0443\u0443\", \"urtiin duu\" (long song), \"\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0442\u0430\u0430\u043b\", \"magtaal\" (praise songs) and \"\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\", \"tatlaga\" (solo pieces, mostly imitiating horses or camels).\n\nThe fourth style, the \"\u0431\u0438\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0435\u0435\" is rarely played in these ceremonies, but in western Mongolia it is common for accompanying \"tatlaga dancing\" in 3 times - like a waltz, but with dance movements imitating daily tasks of a nomad's family.\n\nA number of folk metal and folk rock bands from Mongolia and the Chinese autonomous region of [[Inner Mongolia]] have combined heavy metal and rock music with traditional Mongolian lyrical themes and instruments, including the morin khuur; some of these bands include [[Nine Treasures]], [[Tengger Cavalry]], [[Hanggai (band)|Hanggai]], and [[the Hu]].\n\n==Gobi farmers animal psychology healing use==\nIn the Mongolian Gobi farmer's daily life the Morin Khuur has another important use. When a mother camel gives birth to a calf sometimes it rejects her calf due to various natural stress situations and Mongolian camel farmers use Morin Khuur-based melodies alongside special low harmonic types of songs called \"Khoosloh\" to heal mother camels' stress and encourage it to re-adopt its calf. This re-adoption of farm animal practice is widely used in various nomadic civilizations worldwide but for Mongolian Gobi farmers' cases, only this instrument is used on camels. In other cases if a mother camel dies after giving birth to a calf, a farmer would use this Khoosloh technique alongside Morin Khuur melodies to encourage another mother camel who has its own calf to adopt the new one. The practice is well documented on documentary called ''Ingen Egshig'' directed by Badraa J. in 1986<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/arts/A_MNG5.html|title=Asia-Pacific Database on Intangible Cultural Heritage(ICH)|website=www.accu.or.jp|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref> and was also remade in 2003 by director [[Byambasuren Davaa]] with a different title of ''[[The Story of the Weeping Camel]]'' which nominated for 2005 [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.<ref>[[77th Academy Awards]]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Music of Mongolia]]\n* [[List of Mongolian musical instruments]]\n* [[Topshur]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Marsh, Peter K.

Accessed 23 April 2010.</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\nThe instrument consists of a [[trapezoid|trapeziform]] wooden-framed sound box to which two strings are attached.  It is held nearly upright with the sound box in the musician's lap or between the musician's legs. The strings are made from hairs from nylon or horses' tails,<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Morin khuur\n| url = http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| publisher = www.silkroadproject.org\n| accessdate = 2010-04-24\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019144259/http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| archive-date = 2013-10-19\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> strung parallel, and run over a wooden bridge on the body up a long neck, past a second smaller bridge, to the two tuning pegs in the scroll, which is usually carved into the form of a horse's head.\n[[File:Horsehair fiddles.jpg|alt=WOMADelaide festival Adelaide, Australia 2012|thumb|At WOMADelaide festival in [[Adelaide, Australia]] in 2012.]]\nThe bow is loosely strung with horse hair coated with [[larch]] or cedar wood resin, and is held from underneath with the right hand.  The underhand grip enables the hand to tighten the loose hair of the bow, allowing very fine control of the instrument's [[timbre]].\n\nThe larger of the two strings (the \"male\" string) has 130 hairs from a [[stallion (horse)|stallion]]'s tail, while the \"female\" string has 105 hairs from a [[mare (horse)|mare]]'s tail. Nowadays the strings are made of nylon. Traditionally, the strings were tuned a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] apart, though in modern music they are more often tuned a [[perfect fourth|fourth]] apart, usually to B-flat and F. The strings are stopped either by pinching them in the joints of the index and middle fingers, or by pinching them between the nail of the little finger and the pad of the ring finger.\n\nTraditionally, the frame is covered with [[camel]], [[goat]], or [[sheep]] skin, in which case a small opening would be left in the back. However, since the 1970s, new completely wooden sound box instruments have appeared, with carved [[f-hole]]s similar to European stringed instruments.<ref>CD booklet notes, ''Mongolia: Traditional Music'', 1991, Auvidis-UNESCO D 8207</ref>\n\nThe modern standard height is {{convert|1.15|m|abbr=on}}; the distance between the upper bridge and the lower bridge is about {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}, but the upper bridge especially can be adapted to match smaller player's fingers. The sound box usually has a depth of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|cm|abbr=on}}; the width of the soundbox is about {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} at the top and {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}} at the bottom. Good quality instruments can achieve a strength of 85&nbsp;dBA, which allows it to be played (if desired) even in [[mezzo forte (musical notation)|mezzoforte]] or [[crescendo]]. When horsehair is used, the luthiers prefer to use the hair of white stallions. In general the quality of a horse hair string depends on its preparation, the climate conditions and the nutrition of the animals. That gives a wide area of quality differences.\n\nQuality nylon strings (Khalkh Mongolian: {{lang|mn|\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0445\u044f\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0441}}) last for up to 2 years, but only if prepared and placed properly on the instrument. Most beginners don't comb the strings, then the sound quality worsens quickly. Good strings nearly sound like steel strings, and in spectrograms they show about 7-8 harmonics.\n\nMorin khuur vary in form depending on region. Instruments from central [[Mongolia]] tend to have larger bodies and thus possess more volume than the smaller-bodied instruments of [[Inner Mongolia]]. Also the Inner Mongolian instruments have mostly mechanics for tightening the strings, where Mongolian luthiers mostly use wooden pegs in a slightly conic shape.  In [[Tuva]], the morin khuur is sometimes used in place of the [[igil]].\n\n== Origin ==\n{{Listen\n| pos         = left\n| filename    = Morin_khuur_sound.ogg\n| title       = \"Buyant Altai Khairkhan\" (Altai Khairkhan, 2000)\n| description = The sound of a morin khuur\n}}\n\n[[Image:Morin Khuur, South Mongolian Style.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Morin khuur, [[Inner Mongolia]]n style in China]]\n\nOne legend about the origin of the morin khuur is that a shepherd named Namjil the Cuckoo received the gift of a flying horse; he would mount it at night and fly to meet his beloved. A jealous woman had the horse's wings cut off, so that the horse fell from the air and died. The grieving shepherd made a horsehead fiddle from the now-wingless horse's skin and tail hair, and used it to play poignant songs about his horse.\n\nAnother legend credits the invention of the morin khuur to a boy named S\u00fckhe (or Suho). After a wicked lord slew the boy's prized white horse, the horse's spirit came to S\u00fckhe in a dream and instructed him to make an instrument from the horse's body, so the two could still be together and neither would be lonely. So the first morin khuur was assembled, with horse bones as its neck, horsehair strings, horse skin covering its wooden soundbox, and its scroll carved into the shape of a horse head.\n\nThe fact that most of the eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] neighbors of the [[Mongols]] possess similar horse hair instruments (such as the [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[igil]], the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[kobyz]], or the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] [[Kyl kyyak]]), though not western [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], may point to a possible origin amongst peoples that once inhabited the [[Mongolian Steppe]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and migrated to what is now Tuva, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n\nThe [[gusle]] from [[Southeastern Europe]] (Serbia, Croatia & Albania) is a very similar instrument, and may indicate this is an extremely ancient instrument perhaps even dating back to the outward migration of people out of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] some 40,000 years ago. Often these instruments are depicted with a goat head instead of a horse in Europe.\n\n== Playing technique ==\n[[File:Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia.jpg|thumb|Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia]]\n\nThe modern style Morin Khuur is played with nearly natural finger [[position (music)|positions]]. That means, the distance between two fingers usually make the distance of a [[semitone|half tone]] on the lower section of the instrument. On the tune F / B{{music|b}} the index finger hits on the low (F)  string the G, the middle finger hits the G{{music|#}}, the ring finger hits the A, the little finger the B flat. Identical positions are on the high strings - C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}. The little finger tips the B strings under the F string, while all other fingers touch the strings from the top.\n\nMelodies are usually played from F to F' on the F string, then the player switches to the B{{music|b}} string and continues with G, A, B{{music|b}}. There are 3 hand positions on the F string, and 2 positions on the B{{music|b}} strings a musician must memorize. The idea is that without moving the string hand too much the sound quality improves. The 2nd hand position on the B string is used to play C, D, E{{music|b}}, then moves a little bit for hitting the F' with the little finger, then without moving the G position can be reached with the 1st finger.\n\nIt is also possible to touch the B{{music|b}} string with the thumb to get a C, and use the ring finger under the F string to achieve the D{{music|#}}.\n\nOn the F strings only the first [[harmonic]] is used, so the scale ranges from F to F'. On the B{{music|b}} strings several harmonics are available: B{{music|b}}', F\", B\", also often players accompanying the F' on the F string with an F\" [[overtone]] at the F' position on the B{{music|b}} string.\n\nSome parts of the bowing technique is unique - the little and the ring finger of the right hand usually touch the bow hair, which is used for setting accents. The other two fingers maintain a slight pressure on the strings. A common technique with other string instruments is the \"Kist\". When the bow direction changes, the right hand moves a little bit in advance to the opposite direction to avoid scratchy sounds and for achieving a better voice. When pushing the bow the hand closes a little bit in direction of a fist, when pulling it the hand opens - nearly to a right angle between the arm and the fingers.\n\nThe instrument can be used for playing western style classical music, or Mongolian style pieces. The primary education is to learn the scales, to train the ear for achieving the \"[[muscle memory]]\", the ability to automatically adapt the finger position when a note wasn't hit properly. The main goal is to achieve a \"clear\" sound, that means no change in volume or frequency is desired. That depends on three main facts:\n\n- finger force used for touching the strings\n- pressure of the bow\n- constant sound after bow direction changes\n\nAs variation are usually used the \"[[accent (music)|accent]]\" and the \"[[vibrato]]\". Other techniques like the \"[[Col legno]]\", the \"[[Pizzicato]]\" or the \"[[Martellato]]\" are generally not used on the Morin Huur.\n\nBecause of its standard tune to Bb and F mostly western music is transposed for being played in one of the four most common scales: F major, F minor, B{{music|b}} Major, E{{music|b}} major. When used as a solo instrument the Morin Huur is often tuned a half tone higher or lower.\n\nNearly all of the Mongolian style pieces are in F minor, and often the instrument is tuned 1-2 notes lower for coming closer to the tunes used in the deep past. The instruments in the pre-socialist era of Mongolia were usually covered with skin, which mostly doesn't allow the Bb and F tune - usually tuned 2-4 notes deeper.\n\nOn the contemporary Morin Khuur the deep string is placed at the right side and the high string is placed at the left side, seen from the front of the instrument. The Igil has the opposite placement of strings, so a player has to adapt in order to play pieces made for the other one. For contemporary teaching the modern style is in use.\n\n== Education ==\n\nIn Mongolia the morin khuur can be learned at three schools:\n* The SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0443\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0433\u044b\u043d \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}), engl. \"university of arts and culture\". Here students enter in adult age for obtaining a bachelor's degree after 2 years and a master's degree after 5 years of musical education. After the master's degree the students are considered to be professional musicians, and can play at one of the state ensembles or later become a teacher at the SUIS.\n* Mongolian State Conservatory ({{lang|mn|\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0423\u043b\u0441\u044b\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438}}). Accepting students who are not older than 10 years old for the morin khuur class at the conservatory and since September 2017, the conservatory has been offering Bachelor of Music and Master of Music in Morin Khuur Performance degree.\n* The culture school of the SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0421\u0423\u0418\u0421\u044b, \u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}). Here several qualification courses are available. Graduates from this school mostly become teachers or enter the SUIS.\n\nAlso many amateur players acquired reasonable skills by taking lessons from private teachers, or being taught by their parents or other relatives.\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n\nThe morin khuur is the national instrument in Mongolia. Many festivals are held for celebrating the importance of this instrument on the Mongolian culture, like the biannual \"International Morin Huur Festival and competition\", which is organized by the \"World Morinhuur Association\". First held in 2008, second in 2010 - with 8 participating countries (Mongolia, Korea, China, Russia, USA, Germany, France, Japan) - and planned for May 2012. Here many amateurs come and play freestyle pieces, but also a professional contest is held and an instrument making competition.\n\nDuring June the \"roaring hooves\" festival is held. This is a small festival for professional skilled players - but unfortunately a closed festival. These recordings are often shown in TV reports later.\n\nOn the national festival \"Naadam\" praise songs are played for the most magnificent horse and for the highest ranked wrestler and archer. The songs are called \"Magtaal\" and accompanied by a unique style of praise and morin khuur.\n\nMany Mongolians have the instrument in their home because it is a symbol for peace and happiness.\n\nDuring the winter time, but also in beginning of the spring time a morin khuur player is called in for the \"\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u04af\u0440\u0433\u044d\u044d\u0445\", the \"ceremony for scaring away the frost\". In general many traditional pieces are played, divided in the different styles: \"\u0443\u0440\u0442\u044b\u043d \u0434\u0443\u0443\", \"urtiin duu\" (long song), \"\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0442\u0430\u0430\u043b\", \"magtaal\" (praise songs) and \"\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\", \"tatlaga\" (solo pieces, mostly imitiating horses or camels).\n\nThe fourth style, the \"\u0431\u0438\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0435\u0435\" is rarely played in these ceremonies, but in western Mongolia it is common for accompanying \"tatlaga dancing\" in 3 times - like a waltz, but with dance movements imitating daily tasks of a nomad's family.\n\nA number of folk metal and folk rock bands from Mongolia and the Chinese autonomous region of [[Inner Mongolia]] have combined heavy metal and rock music with traditional Mongolian lyrical themes and instruments, including the morin khuur; some of these bands include [[Nine Treasures]], [[Tengger Cavalry]], [[Hanggai (band)|Hanggai]], and [[the Hu]].\n\n==Gobi farmers animal psychology healing use==\nIn the Mongolian Gobi farmer's daily life the Morin Khuur has another important use. When a mother camel gives birth to a calf sometimes it rejects her calf due to various natural stress situations and Mongolian camel farmers use Morin Khuur-based melodies alongside special low harmonic types of songs called \"Khoosloh\" to heal mother camels' stress and encourage it to re-adopt its calf. This re-adoption of farm animal practice is widely used in various nomadic civilizations worldwide but for Mongolian Gobi farmers' cases, only this instrument is used on camels. In other cases if a mother camel dies after giving birth to a calf, a farmer would use this Khoosloh technique alongside Morin Khuur melodies to encourage another mother camel who has its own calf to adopt the new one. The practice is well documented on documentary called ''Ingen Egshig'' directed by Badraa J. in 1986<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/arts/A_MNG5.html|title=Asia-Pacific Database on Intangible Cultural Heritage(ICH)|website=www.accu.or.jp|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref> and was also remade in 2003 by director [[Byambasuren Davaa]] with a different title of ''[[The Story of the Weeping Camel]]'' which nominated for 2005 [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.<ref>[[77th Academy Awards]]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Music of Mongolia]]\n* [[List of Mongolian musical instruments]]\n* [[Topshur]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Marsh, Peter K.

You shall send away the mother, and take the offspring for yourself, so that it be good for you, and your days be long.\n\n==Theological ramifications==\n===Theodicy===\nAs this is one of the few individual commandments for which a specific reward is promised in the text, it became a ''[[wikt:locus classicus|locus classicus]]'' in Talmudic literature for discussion of [[theodicy]].\n\nOne example of this is in [http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/b/l/l3701_039b.htm Kiddushin 39b] which discusses the problem whether the reward for commandments is in this world or the next. The explanation given in [[Pirkei Avot]], is that the reward may not translate in this world, but rather in [[Olam Habah]], the next world.\n\nIn addition, the Talmud famously records that [[Elisha ben Abuyah]] saw a child fall off the ladder while performing this commandment (at the behest of his parents: so, while performing two [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]], both of which are notable for their unique promise of a reward of longevity). This irreconcilable lack of theodicy led him away from Judaism.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe metaphor of Shiluach haken is used in David Vollach's 2007  movie [[My Father My Lord]], where the main character, Avraham, shoos away a mother bird just before the death of his son Menachem after the mother was \"sent away\" from the boy.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* http://hebrewbooks.org/41298\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/Tanach/tora/shiluah-2.htm List of sources on the reasoning behind Shiluach haken (Hebrew)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091031052650/http://torahsearch.com/page.cfm/1810 The Mitzvah of Shiluach Ha-Kan] Heavily cited with halakhic sources, by Rabbi Doniel Neustadt ([[Modern Orthodox]], [http://www.yigc.org Young Israel, Cleveland Heights])\n\n[[Category:Jewish ethical law]]\n[[Category:Positive Mitzvoth]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox Halacha|image=[[File:Columba livia nest 2 eggs.jpg|300px]]|caption=|verse={{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:6|HE}}|talmud=[http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/b/l/l5312_140b.htm Chullin 140b]|rambam=[http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/5313.htm#10 Hilchot Schechita 13]|sa=Yoreh Deah 292}}\n'''Shiluach haken''' ({{lang-he|'''\u05e9\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d4\u05e7\u05df'''}}, \"sending-away the nest\") is the [[Halakha|Jewish law]] derived from the [[Torah]] that enjoins one to scare away the mother bird before taking her young or her eggs.

According to the \"rationalist\" approach, the purpose of the commandment is compassion: either to spare the mother bird the distress of seeing its eggs taken, or to limit the greed inherent in killing animals for one's use, or a similar reason. Whereas the \"mystical\" approach sees the commandment as act of cruelty to the bird rather than compassion: in fact, the bird's suffering causes God to consider Israel's suffering at the hands of its enemies, and thus leads God to rescue Israel.<ref name=slifkin>[http://www.zootorah.com/RationalistJudaism/ShiluachHaKein.pdf Shiluach haKein: The Transformation of a Mitzvah]</ref>\n\nThis dispute has practical ramifications, as the \"rationalist\" approach rules the commandment can only be done when one plans to eat the eggs (thus minimizing the birds' pain when pain is unavoidable), while the \"mystical\" approach calls on Jews to shoo away any mother bird even if they do not plan to take the eggs (thus maximizing the birds' pain).<ref name=slifkin/>\n\n===Theodicy===\nAs this is one of the few individual commandments for which a specific reward is promised in the text, it became a ''[[wikt:locus classicus|locus classicus]]'' in Talmudic literature for discussion of [[theodicy]].\n\nOne example of this is in [http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/b/l/l3701_039b.htm Kiddushin 39b] which discusses the problem whether the reward for commandments is in this world or the next. The explanation given in [[Pirkei Avot]], is that the reward may not translate in this world, but rather in [[Olam Habah]], the next world.\n\nIn addition, the Talmud famously records that [[Elisha ben Abuyah]] saw a child fall off the ladder while performing this commandment (at the behest of his parents: so, while performing two [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]], both of which are notable for their unique promise of a reward of longevity). This irreconcilable lack of theodicy led him away from Judaism.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe metaphor of Shiluach haken is used in David Vollach's 2007  movie [[My Father My Lord]], where the main character, Avraham, shoos away a mother bird just before the death of his son Menachem after the mother was \"sent away\" from the boy.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* http://hebrewbooks.org/41298\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/Tanach/tora/shiluah-2.htm List of sources on the reasoning behind Shiluach haken (Hebrew)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091031052650/http://torahsearch.com/page.cfm/1810 The Mitzvah of Shiluach Ha-Kan] Heavily cited with halakhic sources, by Rabbi Doniel Neustadt ([[Modern Orthodox]], [http://www.yigc.org Young Israel, Cleveland Heights])\n\n[[Category:Jewish ethical law]]\n[[Category:Positive Mitzvoth]]\n", "name_user": "213.137.64.76", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(took out controversial piece with no source.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiluach_haken"}

Starting the war as a sapper digging trenches on the South Coast at the time of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], Allan Beckett came to play a significant role in the success of the Mulberry harbour used during and after the Normandy landings of June 1944.\n\nHis contribution to the Mulberry was to design the floating roadways which connected the pierhead to the shore, and a system of anchors.  The roadway had to be strong enough to withstand constant wave action which, as occurred in the appalling weather of June 1944, was much more severe than anticipated.  Beckett's design, which had been tested in the severe conditions of Scotland in winter, survived the storm which struck on 19 June 1944, and raged for three days.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\n==Education and early military service==\nAllan Beckett was born on 4 March 1914 in [[East Ham]], London; the eldest of three children of George William Harry Beckett and his wife Emma (n\u00e9e Stokes).  Allan's father was a professional soldier in the [[Royal Field Artillery]] and was proud to be one of the '[[Old Contemptibles]]'. London Borough of Newham have placed a blue heritage plaque on the house in Montpelier Gardens where the family lived.<ref>http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/blue_plaque_for_east_ham_engineer_who_played_key_role_in_d_day_landings_1_4846892</ref> Allan's first interest was mechanical engineering \u2013 he was a keen model maker, building intricate model boat engines when a teenager.  However his father persuaded him to study civil engineering at university as the career prospects were better.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nHe read civil engineering at the [[University of London]] and was then apprenticed to Sanders and Forster, steelwork and structural engineers from 1930\u201333.   From there he moved to the bridge department of consulting engineers A. J. Bridle until the war began.  He volunteered for the [[Royal Engineers]] in January 1940 and, after basic sapper training, was at the time of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] engaged in trench digging, watch duties and manning a searchlight at [[Folkestone]] Harbour. He also assisted in the sinking of the block ship SS ''Umvoti'' across the harbour's entrance.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/65/a3895365.shtml</ref>  Commissioned in 1941, he was sent to King's Newton, near Derby, to work for Lieutenant-Colonel W. T. Everall, a specialist on the rapid construction of railway bridges for battlefield use.  In this position, he gained valuable experience in assembling light steel bridging.<ref>https://beckettrankine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/allan_beckett_record_of_wartime_service.pdf</ref>\n\n==The Mulberry Minute==\nThe notion of the Mulberry harbour had come from [[Winston Churchill]], determined never to repeat the 1915 deb\u00e2cle of the amphibious landings over open beaches during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].  On 30 May 1942, with an invasion of the German-occupied Continent only a distant dream, he had prepared a minute for the chief of the [[Combined Operations Headquarters]], headed: ''Piers for use on beaches''.\n\n\"They must float up and down with the tide,\" Churchill noted. \"The anchor problem must be mastered.  Let me have the best solution worked out.  Don\u2019t argue the matter.  The difficulties will argue for themselves.\"<ref>http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2015/02/user-requirement-document-piers-use-beaches/</ref>  These injunctions set down the essentials of the floating piers to enable the vast tonnage of vehicles and stores to be got ashore to support the forces in the field.\n\nIn the wake of Churchill's minute Allan Beckett's boss, Lt-Colonel William Teague Everall who was the Chief Bridging Instructor to the War Office,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1680/iicep.1968.7931| title=Obituary. Colonel William Teague Everall, Obe. (1880-1967)| journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers| volume=40| issue=3| pages=449\u2013450| year=1968| doi-access=free}}</ref> was charged with designing a roadway for use over shelving beaches under tidal conditions. Everall gave Beckett a sketch marked \"Top Secret\" asking whether, \"as a keen sailor\", he could make sense of it. The sketch showed a mile-long series of pontoons on legs, linked by bridges covering water that was shallow one end, deep the other. The caption read \"Piers for flat beaches\", without explanation of what they might be intended for.<ref>http://beckettrankine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/allan_beckett_record_of_wartime_service.pdf</ref>\n\nBeckett thought the legs an unnecessary complication for a floating bridge. \"If you think you can do better, you must make it clear before next Monday when I shall be revisiting the War Office,\" said Everall.  By 2 July 1942 Allan had prepared a sketch drawing<ref>http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mulberry_rapid_design_with_date_balanced__Original.png</ref> of a floating roadway, consisting of a torsionally compliant lozenge-shaped bridge span. He had a tin plate scale model made of one full span and part of an adjacent span to show a junction using spherical bearings. Everall took this model to his meeting at the War Office and returned exultant. \"Beckett,\" he said, \"they want six spans built right away, I have promised that you will produce fabrication drawings by the end of the week.\"<ref>http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/Allan_Beckett_Record_Of_Wartime_Service.pdf</ref>\n\n==The Mulberry trials==\n\nIn a week Beckett produced the works drawings and the prototype consisting of six spans of floating roadway was constructed by Braithwaites of [[West Bromwich]].<ref>http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/Whale%20Piers%20for%20Mulberry%20Design%20&%20Fabrication.pdf</ref> It and two competing schemes (the Hamilton Swiss Roll and the Hughes [[Caisson (engineering)|Caisson]] Scheme) were tested at Cairn Head, [[Galloway]], where, over a period, they were subjected to severe weather.\n\nSummoned to Scotland to check his system after a particularly fierce storm, Beckett imagined that he was being called ruefully to inspect a mass of twisted and fractured metal. To his immense gratification the floating roadway had survived intact under the severest of torsion, whilst the Hamilton Swiss Roll had been washed away, and the Hughes Caisson, too, had failed. As Beckett later observed: ''After several more days of rough weather it was not difficult for the chiefs of staff to make a choice''. They ordered six miles of the roadway, codenamed 'Whale', to be manufactured, later increased to ten miles.<ref>http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80016821</ref>\n\nAfter designing the roadway, Beckett found that there was no anchor available that was light enough to be easily handled without a lifting vessel, yet had sufficient holding power which he calculated as 20 tons plus a safety factor. Everall was away in America, so Beckett developed a design for an anchor in his own time, performing experiments with models of anchors in the mud at [[Erith]] Yacht Club where he was a member. The full-size anchor weighed {{convert|330|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and, during performance tests using a large tug, it held up to 30 tons. The Ministry of Supply ordered 2,332 Kite anchors, as they became known, to be manufactured at a total cost of \u00a389,786, with more than 2,000 of the anchors being used on the two Mulberry harbours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/development-kite-anchor-mulberry-harbour/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923183156/http://www.beckettrankine.com/development-kite-anchor-mulberry-harbour/ |archivedate=23 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nNaval opinion was sceptical of Beckett's ability to come up with a new design of anchor with the exceptional holding power he claimed for it; consequently the Navy did not use the Kite anchor for mooring the Bombardon floating breakwaters which were the Navy's design responsibility.\n\n==D-Day and after==\n7 June 1944 was D+1 (the day after the start of [[Operation Overlord]]); Allan Beckett set out for Arromanches, the site of the British Mulberry, as technical adviser in the field to Montgomery's [[21st Army Group]].  After a day and night at sea, he supervised the installation of the anchors, and over the next few days gave technical advice on installing the Whales.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nIn the event the Americans at Mulberry A were first to have a pier in operation, on D+5; this remarkable achievement was at least partly due to the Americans installing Whale bridge spans as they arrived mixing up the 25t and 40t capacity spans in a single roadway and omitting up to 80% of the Kite anchors.<ref>http://www.nce.co.uk/Journals/3/Files/2009/4/24/Mulberry%20Harbour%201944-1994%20-%20pages%201-10.pdf</ref>  The more methodical British approach to construction, and the installation of the designed number of anchors, was vindicated in the violent storm of D+13 which damaged Mulberry A beyond repair, whereas Mulberry B survived and continued to function for more than four months, until the [[Battle of the Scheldt|opening up of Antwerp]] in October rendered it less important.  After the storm Beckett acted as liaison officer to the Americans for the transfer of such undamaged equipment at Mulberry A as could be used by the British on their harbour.\n\nAfter his part in the Mulberry project was finished, Beckett carried out various tasks in the wake of the Allied advance.  He showed how a stock of abandoned German bridging equipment, located near [[Brussels]], could be put to use; he oversaw the installation of much of the Everall bridging equipment which came into its own as the Allied advance took it over river after river; and he assisted Dutch engineers in repairing gaps in the dykes made by RAF bombers at [[Walcheren Island]].  For this, surplus Mulberry units came in useful for plugging the breaches.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nBeckett was appointed [[MBE (Order of the British Empire)|MBE]] for his wartime work.  He also received an inventor's award for the design of the Kite anchor.<ref>http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C6666750</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Arromanches Monument to Allan Beckett.JPG|thumb| The monument unveiled on 6 June 2009 in Arromanches to the memory of Allan Beckett]] -->\n\nAllan Beckett's work is commemorated by a memorial dedicated to him in the town of [[Arromanches-les-Bains]]. Unveiled by Mr Patrick Jardin, the Mayor of Arromanches, on 6 June 2009, the 65th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings, the monument features a bronze [[bas relief]] portrait of Allan by the artist Richard Clarke beneath a full-sized replica of the Kite anchor. The monument is located adjacent to a preserved Whale bridge span.<ref>https://www.newcivilengineer.com/memorial-to-d-day-engineering-hero-allan-beckett-unveiled-in-arromanches/5203152.article</ref>\n\nIn September 2011 a stained glass window dedicated to Allan Beckett was installed in St Peter's church, Oare where he is buried. The south facing three light window was designed by artist Petri Anderson and features a Mulberry tree in fruit together with depictions of a Whale floating roadway and a Kite anchor.<ref>http://www.erithyachtclub.org.uk/index.php/memories/360-allan-beckett-window</ref>\n\n==After the war==\n\nAfter being demobbed Beckett joined Sir [[Bruce White]], Wolfe Barry and Partners as chief engineer.  There he was responsible for projects in India including Mazagon Dock, the Tata locomotive works, the Bombay Marine oil terminal and a self-scouring lock gate to cope with heavily silt-laden waters at [[Bhavnagar]].  In the UK he built factories for Bibby.  In 1959 he became a partner in the firm, and developed techniques for mini-hydraulic model studies which were used for designing the new port at Muara in [[Brunei]] as well as major port expansion work at [[Aden]], [[Harwich]] and [[Cardiff]].<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nAs senior partner from 1983 he oversaw all the engineering aspects of a huge contract to build a new port at [[Dammam]] in Saudi Arabia.  Closer to home there were the design and construction of complex Thames flood defences for north Kent, including the Dartford Creek barrier.  In official retirement from 1989, he acted as a consultant to the marine consulting engineering practice Beckett Rankine where his son Tim Beckett and Sir Bruce White's grandson Gordon Rankine were directors.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nA keen and adventurous yachtsman from boyhood, he also designed and had built 'Pretty Penny' in 1979 \u2013 a new yacht made of non-corrosive [[cupronickel]] (copper-nickel alloy) \u2013 still one of the very few in the world.\n\n==Family==\nWith the \u00a33,000 inventor's award he received for his Kite anchor design, he built himself a house in Farnborough, Kent, where he settled.\n\nAllan Beckett married his wife Ida James in 1949.  She survives him, with his two sons, Michael (1950) & Tim (1953) and his daughter, Sian (1957) and his eight grandchildren.\n\n==Papers==\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/mulberry01.pdf Some aspects of the design of flexible bridging including \"Whale\" floating roadways]\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/RFB_small.pdf River Thames \u2013 removable flood barriers] (1972)\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/The%20Design%20and%20Construction%20of%20Bombay%20Marine%20Oil%20Terminal.pdf The Design and Construction of Bombay Marine Oil Terminal ]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1974.4085 A High Capacity Container Terminal \u2013 Berth 39 Tilbury Docks]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1983.1402 Design and Construction of Muara Deep Water Port]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1981.1791 The River Hull Tidal Surge Barrier]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1964.10181 Design and Construction of the Dock Entrance at Bhavnagar Port, Gujarat State, India]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article542577.ece The Times \u2013 Allan Beckett Obituary]\n*[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html The Telegraph \u2013 Allan Beckett Obituary]\n*[http://www.mulberryharbour.com The Mulberry Harbour archive which includes press cuttings relating to Allan Beckett's wartime work]\n*[http://www.nce.co.uk/sector-news/international/french-honour-mulberry-engineer/1995929.article New Civil Engineer \u2013 article on Arromanches Memorial to Allan Beckett]\n*[http://www.nce.co.uk/news/structures/mulberry-engineer-remembered/5200862.article New Civil Engineer \u2013 Arromanches Memorial Bronzes]\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=102 News page linking to Allan Beckett's Curriculum Vitae]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com Beckett Rankine Marine Consulting Engineers]\n*[http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_hulls.html Cupro Nickel Yachts including Pretty Penny]\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/tudorbarlow/6242946926/ Photo of the Allan Beckett memorial window in Oare Church]\n*[http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80016821 Recording of Imperial War Museum interview with Allan Beckett made on 25 October 1997]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beckett, Allan Harry}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of London]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Royal Engineers officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:English civil engineers]]\n[[Category:People from East Ham]]\n[[Category:English inventors]]\n[[Category:Operation Overlord people]]\n[[Category:20th-century inventors]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox military person\n| name          =Allan Harry Beckett\n| image         =Allan Harry Beckett Small.jpg\n| caption       =\n| birth_date          = {{Birth date|df=yes|1914|03|04}}\n| death_date          = {{Death date and age|df=yes|2005|06|19|1914|03|04}}\n| placeofburial_label =\n| placeofburial =Oare churchyard, Faversham, Kent\n| birth_place  =East Ham, London\n| death_place  =Farnborough, Kent\n| placeofburial_coordinates = {{coord|51|20|02.47|N|00|52|54.26|E}}\n| nickname      =\n| allegiance    ={{UK}}\n| branch        =[[Royal Engineers]]\n| serviceyears  =6\n| rank          =Major\n| unit          =\n| commands      =\n| battles       =\n| awards        =MBE\n| relations     =\n| laterwork     =Sir Bruce White, Wolfe Barry & Partners.

Everall took this model to his meeting at the War Office and returned exultant. \"Beckett,\" he said, \"they want six spans built right away, I have promised that you will produce fabrication drawings by the end of the week.\"<ref>http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/Allan_Beckett_Record_Of_Wartime_Service.pdf</ref>\n\n==The Mulberry trials==\n\nIn a week Beckett produced the works drawings and the prototype consisting of six spans of floating roadway was constructed by Braithwaites of [[West Bromwich]].<ref>http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/Whale%20Piers%20for%20Mulberry%20Design%20&%20Fabrication.pdf</ref> It and two competing schemes (the Hamilton Swiss Roll and the Hughes [[Caisson (engineering)|Caisson]] Scheme) were tested at Cairn Head, [[Galloway]], where, over a period, they were subjected to severe weather.\n\nSummoned to Scotland to check his system after a particularly fierce storm, Beckett imagined that he was being called ruefully to inspect a mass of twisted and fractured metal. To his immense gratification the floating roadway had survived intact under the severest of torsion, whilst the Hamilton Swiss Roll had been washed away, and the Hughes Caisson, too, had failed. As Beckett later observed: ''After several more days of rough weather it was not difficult for the chiefs of staff to make a choice''. They ordered six miles of the roadway, codenamed 'Whale', to be manufactured, later increased to ten miles.<ref>http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80016821</ref>\n\nAfter designing the roadway, Beckett found that there was no anchor available that was light enough to be easily handled without a lifting vessel, yet had sufficient holding power which he calculated as 20 tons plus a safety factor. Everall was away in America, so Beckett developed a design for an anchor in his own time, performing experiments with models of anchors in the mud at [[Erith]] Yacht Club where he was a member. The full-size anchor weighed {{convert|330|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and, during performance tests using a large tug, it held up to 30 tons. The Ministry of Supply ordered 2,332 Kite anchors, as they became known, to be manufactured at a total cost of \u00a389,786, with more than 2,000 of the anchors being used on the two Mulberry harbours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/development-kite-anchor-mulberry-harbour/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923183156/http://www.beckettrankine.com/development-kite-anchor-mulberry-harbour/ |archivedate=23 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nNaval opinion was sceptical of Beckett's ability to come up with a new design of anchor with the exceptional holding power he claimed for it; consequently the Navy did not use the Kite anchor for mooring the Bombardon floating breakwaters which were the Navy's design responsibility.\n\n==D-Day and after==\n7 June 1944 was D+1 (the day after the start of [[Operation Overlord]]); Allan Beckett set out for Arromanches, the site of the British Mulberry, as technical adviser in the field to Montgomery's [[21st Army Group]].  After a day and night at sea, he supervised the installation of the anchors, and over the next few days gave technical advice on installing the Whales.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nIn the event the Americans at Mulberry A were first to have a pier in operation, on D+5; this remarkable achievement was at least partly due to the Americans installing Whale bridge spans as they arrived mixing up the 25t and 40t capacity spans in a single roadway and omitting up to 80% of the Kite anchors.<ref>http://www.nce.co.uk/Journals/3/Files/2009/4/24/Mulberry%20Harbour%201944-1994%20-%20pages%201-10.pdf</ref>  The more methodical British approach to construction, and the installation of the designed number of anchors, was vindicated in the violent storm of D+13 which damaged Mulberry A beyond repair, whereas Mulberry B survived and continued to function for more than four months, until the [[Battle of the Scheldt|opening up of Antwerp]] in October rendered it less important.  After the storm Beckett acted as liaison officer to the Americans for the transfer of such undamaged equipment at Mulberry A as could be used by the British on their harbour.\n\nAfter his part in the Mulberry project was finished, Beckett carried out various tasks in the wake of the Allied advance.  He showed how a stock of abandoned German bridging equipment, located near [[Brussels]], could be put to use; he oversaw the installation of much of the Everall bridging equipment which came into its own as the Allied advance took it over river after river; and he assisted Dutch engineers in repairing gaps in the dykes made by RAF bombers at [[Walcheren Island]].  For this, surplus Mulberry units came in useful for plugging the breaches.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nBeckett was appointed [[MBE]] for his wartime work.  He also received an inventor's award for the design of the Kite anchor.<ref>http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C6666750</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Arromanches Monument to Allan Beckett.JPG|thumb| The monument unveiled on 6 June 2009 in Arromanches to the memory of Allan Beckett]] -->\n\nAllan Beckett's work is commemorated by a memorial dedicated to him in the town of [[Arromanches-les-Bains]]. Unveiled by Mr Patrick Jardin, the Mayor of Arromanches, on 6 June 2009, the 65th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings, the monument features a bronze [[bas relief]] portrait of Allan by the artist Richard Clarke beneath a full-sized replica of the Kite anchor. The monument is located adjacent to a preserved Whale bridge span.<ref>https://www.newcivilengineer.com/memorial-to-d-day-engineering-hero-allan-beckett-unveiled-in-arromanches/5203152.article</ref>\n\nIn September 2011 a stained glass window dedicated to Allan Beckett was installed in St Peter's church, Oare where he is buried. The south facing three light window was designed by artist Petri Anderson and features a Mulberry tree in fruit together with depictions of a Whale floating roadway and a Kite anchor.<ref>http://www.erithyachtclub.org.uk/index.php/memories/360-allan-beckett-window</ref>\n\n==After the war==\n\nAfter being demobbed Beckett joined Sir [[Bruce White]], Wolfe Barry and Partners as chief engineer.  There he was responsible for projects in India including Mazagon Dock, the Tata locomotive works, the Bombay Marine oil terminal and a self-scouring lock gate to cope with heavily silt-laden waters at [[Bhavnagar]].  In the UK he built factories for Bibby.  In 1959 he became a partner in the firm, and developed techniques for mini-hydraulic model studies which were used for designing the new port at Muara in [[Brunei]] as well as major port expansion work at [[Aden]], [[Harwich]] and [[Cardiff]].<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nAs senior partner from 1983 he oversaw all the engineering aspects of a huge contract to build a new port at [[Dammam]] in Saudi Arabia.  Closer to home there were the design and construction of complex Thames flood defences for north Kent, including the Dartford Creek barrier.  In official retirement from 1989, he acted as a consultant to the marine consulting engineering practice Beckett Rankine where his son Tim Beckett and Sir Bruce White's grandson Gordon Rankine were directors.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html</ref>\n\nA keen and adventurous yachtsman from boyhood, he also designed and had built 'Pretty Penny' in 1979 \u2013 a new yacht made of non-corrosive [[cupronickel]] (copper-nickel alloy) \u2013 still one of the very few in the world.\n\n==Family==\nWith the \u00a33,000 inventor's award he received for his Kite anchor design, he built himself a house in Farnborough, Kent, where he settled.\n\nAllan Beckett married his wife Ida James in 1949.  She survives him, with his two sons, Michael (1950) & Tim (1953) and his daughter, Sian (1957) and his eight grandchildren.\n\n==Papers==\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/mulberry01.pdf Some aspects of the design of flexible bridging including \"Whale\" floating roadways]\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/RFB_small.pdf River Thames \u2013 removable flood barriers] (1972)\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/wp-content/legacy/downloads/The%20Design%20and%20Construction%20of%20Bombay%20Marine%20Oil%20Terminal.pdf The Design and Construction of Bombay Marine Oil Terminal ]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1974.4085 A High Capacity Container Terminal \u2013 Berth 39 Tilbury Docks]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1983.1402 Design and Construction of Muara Deep Water Port]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1981.1791 The River Hull Tidal Surge Barrier]\n*[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/iicep.1964.10181 Design and Construction of the Dock Entrance at Bhavnagar Port, Gujarat State, India]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article542577.ece The Times \u2013 Allan Beckett Obituary]\n*[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1493029/Allan-Beckett.html The Telegraph \u2013 Allan Beckett Obituary]\n*[http://www.mulberryharbour.com The Mulberry Harbour archive which includes press cuttings relating to Allan Beckett's wartime work]\n*[http://www.nce.co.uk/sector-news/international/french-honour-mulberry-engineer/1995929.article New Civil Engineer \u2013 article on Arromanches Memorial to Allan Beckett]\n*[http://www.nce.co.uk/news/structures/mulberry-engineer-remembered/5200862.article New Civil Engineer \u2013 Arromanches Memorial Bronzes]\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=102 News page linking to Allan Beckett's Curriculum Vitae]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.beckettrankine.com Beckett Rankine Marine Consulting Engineers]\n*[http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_hulls.html Cupro Nickel Yachts including Pretty Penny]\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/tudorbarlow/6242946926/ Photo of the Allan Beckett memorial window in Oare Church]\n*[http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80016821 Recording of Imperial War Museum interview with Allan Beckett made on 25 October 1997]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beckett, Allan Harry}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of London]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Royal Engineers officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:English civil engineers]]\n[[Category:People from East Ham]]\n[[Category:English inventors]]\n[[Category:Operation Overlord people]]\n[[Category:20th-century inventors]]\n", "name_user": "Paradoctor", "label": "safe", "comment": "dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Beckett"}

His mother, Elizabeth Walker, died in 1921 at the birth of Keith\u2019s sister Betty. Soon, both Keith & Betty were taken to their grandparents, Francis & Alice Wookey who raised them at Stones Cross House, Somerset. After his graduation, Keith got a job in a bank which allowed him to indulge in his passion for Motor Bike Racing on his [[Velocette]] 'K' series motor bike at the [[Isle of Man TT]] race. From 1933 to 1935 Keith joined the Royal Navy Reserve. \n\nIn 1936, Keith made an announcement that he is going to [[Borneo]] the next day for the 'far east', leaving his family stunned and question why anyone would possibly want to go so far away. {{citation needed|reason=Keith's life was detailed on a Facebook page linked to the North Borneo's Historical Society page|date=January 2016}}\n\n=== Pre-war ===\n\nOn 17 April 1936 Keith came to [[North Borneo]] as a cadet (trainee government official), joining the [[British North Borneo Chartered Company]] administrators.

Functioning mostly as a [[playmaker]] and renowned for his passing range, he was described as the general of Arsenal's first team, bringing vision, creativity, and an innate understanding of timing and space to Arsenal's intricate passing game, displaying maturity that belied his age.<ref name=espn/><ref name=ars/><ref name=uefap/><ref name=fa/><ref name=pots/><ref name=chall/><ref name=skates>Smith, Alan, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/01/20/sfnsmi20.xml \"Fabregas puts his skates on in chase for perfection\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 January 2007, accessed 23 May 2007.</ref><ref>McIlvanney, Hugh, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2104071,00.html \"F\u00e0bregas a leader in waiting\"], ''The Times'', 26 March 2006, accessed 22 May 2007.</ref> He was the main creative force when he was at Arsenal, as exemplified by his 16 assists in all competitions in the 2006\u201307 season.<ref name=stats/> Between 2006\u201307 and 2010\u201311, F\u00e0bregas created the most chances in the top-division leagues of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14491850.stm The magic of Cesc Fabregas], BBC Sport, 11 August 2011, accessed 15 August 2011.</ref>\n\nAt Arsenal, F\u00e0bregas also often assumed responsibility for [[Set piece (football)|set pieces]], taking [[corner kick|corners]], [[Direct free kick|free kicks]] and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalties]].

His new role with Barcelona was comparable to that which he had played with the Spanish national team.
