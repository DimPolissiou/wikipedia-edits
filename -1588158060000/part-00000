The company offered cable television services in [[Brasov]] and [[Timisoara]]. In 1993 Zolt\u00e1n Tesz\u00e1ri co-founded Kappa cable company in Bucharest. In 1996, the shareholders decided to divide the Kappa network into two equal parts. Half owned by Zolta Tzesari merged with Analog CATV SA cable company in Bucharest. The other half was bought in 2000 by [[Astral Telecom]], which in 2005 was merged with [[UPC Romania]] (now [[Vodafone Romania]]). This separation of the company led to the division of the areas in Bucharest between the two companies for 10 years. \n\nA cable network was built in [[Chisinau]], [[Republic of Moldova]] in 1995, which was later sold.\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1997 the company changed its name to '''Romania Cable Systems SA''' ('''RCS'''). Same year it is established '''Romania Data System SA''' ('''RDS''') which offers internet services. Among the investors in the company from the beginning until the listing on the stock exchange were Carpathian Cable Investments S.a.R.L. from 1998 and Celest Limited from 1999. \n\nThe company entered Hungary in November 1998 after buying 15 small and medium cable companies in [[Budapest]] and 3 other cities. Between December 1999 and January 2000, the first cable networks were acquired in [[Slovakia]], where Slovakia Cable Systems (SCS) was 95% owned by RCS.\n\nIn April 2000, the project to build a 4,200 km national [[fiber optic]] network was initiated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |title=Romania Cable Systems |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608074723/http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |archivedate=8 June 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, after the liberalization of the market, the [[landline|fixed telephony]] service was launched in Romania. Digi TV [[satellite television]] platform was first launched in Romania in December 2004, followed by launches in Hungary in February 2006, in the [[Czech Republic]] and Slovakia in August 2006 and in [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] in December 2006.\n\n=== 2005-2014 ===\n[[Image:RCS & RDS Logo.png|thumb|RCS & RDS logo (2005-2012)|160px]]\nRCS and RDS merged to form RCS & RDS on 26 April 2005. The company focused on rapid development both organically and through acquisitions. The C-Zone network was acquired in 2006, entering certain areas in Bucharest that were not covered due to zone exclusivity. In these areas RCS & RDS kept the brand until 2009.\n\nDigi Slovakia, including the Digi Sport television channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, were sold to [[Slovak Telekom]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://technology.informa.com/435165/slovak-telekom-to-buy-digi-slovakia |title=Slovak Telekom to buy Digi Slovakia |publisher=informa.com |date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Also, satellite television subsidiary in the Czech Republic was sold to Lama Energy in march 2015,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2015/03/23/czech-digi-tv-to-be-sold/ |title=Czech Digi TV to be sold |publisher=broadbandtvnews.com |date=23 March 2015}}</ref> which continued to use the Digi brand for other acquired internet and IPTV provider until 1 April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mediaguru.cz/clanky/2020/03/digi-tv-se-od-dubna-meni-na-telly-zavadi-nove-balicky/ |title=Digi TV se od dubna m\u011bn\u00ed na Telly, zav\u00e1d\u00ed nov\u00e9 bal\u00ed\u010dky |publisher=mediaguru.cz |date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe subsidiary in Croatia was sold to [[A1 Telekom Austria]]'s Vipnet (now [[A1 Hrvatska|A1 Croatia]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.filmneweurope.com/news/croatia-news/item/105095-rcsrds-sells-digi-tv-croatia-to-vipnet |title=RCS&RDS Sells Digi TV Croatia to Vipnet |publisher=filmneweurope.com |date=13 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile development ===\nIn 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service in 2015. \n\nSatellite television subsidiary in Serbia was sold to Kopernikus Technology, which in turn was sold to [[Telekom Srbija]] (mts) in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parabola.cz/clanky/6523/srbska-digi-tv-prodana-spolecnosti-kopernikus-ta-srbskemu-telekomu/ |title=Srbsk\u00e1 Digi TV prod\u00e1na spole\u010dnosti Kopernikus.

Then followed the implementation of GPON in 2008, covering the houses as well. In 2013 started replacing FFTB with [[Fiber to the home|FTTH]]. In 2018 Digi started offering internet services through FTTH in Spain.\n\n=== Mobile telephony ===\n\nThe company launched Digi Mobil in Romania in December 2007 wich offered mobile telephony limited to [[3G]] service only at the time. In 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service on band 38 in 2015 and on band 1 in 2018.\n\nAfter winning a mobile operator licence in 2014 and numerous delays, the company launched mobile services in Hungary in 2019.\n\nIn Spain, due to the number of Romanians, [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] mobile telephony services were launched through [[Movistar]] in 2008. Initially, the company attracted Romanians because it offered cheap calls with Romanian networks. Vodafone Spain reacted after 1 year when it started losing customers by offering free calls with Vodafone Romania. This was followed by offers for Latin Americans.\nThen the company started offering internet at a low price, attracting Spanish customers. Digi became the second MVNO operator by number of customers. \n\nFollowing the model in Spain, in 2010 Digi Mobil was launched as MVNO in Italy through [[Telecom Italia|TIM]], but it was not as successful despite the fact that in Italy is a larger number of Romanians. Vodafone Italia began to offer free calls with Vodafone Romania and fixed networks before the launch of Digi Mobil.\n\n=== Cable television ===\n\nThe company offers all channels in one package except premium channels.\n\n=== Television channels ===\n\nIn July 2009, Digi launched the [[Digi Sport]] channels in Romania and Hungary. Then followed the Digi Sport channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic in August 2010, which have been operated separately since 2013 following the takeover of Digi Slovakia by Slovak Telekom. \n\nIn the summer of 2010, it acquired 50% of Music Channel, which launched Hit Music Channel in January 2012. The company launched a generalist channel in December 2010, but due to the low audience it was closed. The [[premium]] movie channel Digi Film (now Film Now) was launched on 1 February 2011. In 2011 acquired the UTV music TV channel.\n\n[[Digi 24]] TV news channel was launched on 1 March 2012. Following disagreements with [[Discovery Inc.|Discovery]], the company launched 3 thematic channels in October 2012: Digi World, Digi Life and Digi Animal World. On 10 December 2018 was launched Digi 4K.\n\n=== Energy supplier === \n\nIn April 2015, Digi launched the energy supply service. The company had in 2017 the most subscribers on the competitive market from the companies that do not have the distribution infrastructure. In 2019, it increased tariffs by 30% due to a tax added by the government and then by 20%. The company announced that it is gradually giving up the supply service due to the unusual volatility of the electricity price.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://energyreport.ro/index.php/2013-electricitate/2013-stiri-electricitate/2013-energie-electrica/5020-digi-retrage-furnizarea-de-energie-din-grila-de-programe-a-companiei |title=Digi retrage furnizarea de energie din grila de programe a companiei |publisher=energyreport.ro |date=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Digi brand ==\n\nRCS & RDS introduced the Digi TV brand for satellite television services in December 2004 in Romania and in 2006 in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Serbia. In 2006 the company unified under the Digi brand the cable television, internet and telephony services in Hungary, followed by Slovakia in June 2007.

The company offered cable television services in [[Brasov]] and [[Timisoara]]. In 1993 Zolt\u00e1n Tesz\u00e1ri co-founded Kappa cable company in Bucharest. In 1996, the shareholders decided to divide the Kappa network into two equal parts. Half owned by Zolta Tzesari merged with Analog CATV SA cable company in Bucharest. The other half was bought in 2000 by [[Astral Telecom]], which in 2005 was merged with [[UPC Romania]] (now [[Vodafone Romania]]). This separation of the company led to the division of the areas in Bucharest between the two companies for 10 years. \n\nA cable network was built in [[Chisinau]], [[Republic of Moldova]] in 1995, which was later sold.\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1997 the company changed its name to '''Romania Cable Systems SA''' ('''RCS'''). Same year it is established '''Romania Data System SA''' ('''RDS''') which offers internet services. Among the investors in the company from the beginning until the listing on the stock exchange were Carpathian Cable Investments S.a.R.L. from 1998 and Celest Limited from 1999. \n\nThe company entered Hungary in November 1998 after buying 15 small and medium cable companies in [[Budapest]] and 3 other cities. Between December 1999 and January 2000, the first cable networks were acquired in [[Slovakia]], where Slovakia Cable Systems (SCS) was 95% owned by RCS.\n\nIn April 2000, the project to build a 4,200 km national [[fiber optic]] network was initiated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |title=Romania Cable Systems |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608074723/http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |archivedate=8 June 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, after the liberalization of the market, the [[landline|fixed telephony]] service was launched in Romania. Digi TV [[satellite television]] platform was first launched in Romania in December 2004, followed by launches in Hungary in February 2006, in the [[Czech Republic]] and Slovakia in August 2006 and in [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] in December 2006.\n\n=== 2005-2014 ===\n[[Image:RCS & RDS Logo.png|thumb|RCS & RDS logo (2005-2012)|160px]]\nRCS and RDS merged to form RCS & RDS on 26 April 2005. The company focused on rapid development both organically and through acquisitions. The C-Zone network was acquired in 2006, entering certain areas in Bucharest that were not covered due to zone exclusivity. In these areas RCS & RDS kept the brand until 2009.\n\nDigi Slovakia, including the Digi Sport television channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, were sold to [[Slovak Telekom]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://technology.informa.com/435165/slovak-telekom-to-buy-digi-slovakia |title=Slovak Telekom to buy Digi Slovakia |publisher=informa.com |date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Also, satellite television subsidiary in the Czech Republic was sold to Lama Energy in march 2015,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2015/03/23/czech-digi-tv-to-be-sold/ |title=Czech Digi TV to be sold |publisher=broadbandtvnews.com |date=23 March 2015}}</ref> which continued to use the Digi brand for other acquired internet and IPTV provider until 1 April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mediaguru.cz/clanky/2020/03/digi-tv-se-od-dubna-meni-na-telly-zavadi-nove-balicky/ |title=Digi TV se od dubna m\u011bn\u00ed na Telly, zav\u00e1d\u00ed nov\u00e9 bal\u00ed\u010dky |publisher=mediaguru.cz |date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe subsidiary in Croatia was sold to [[A1 Telekom Austria]]'s Vipnet (now [[A1 Hrvatska|A1 Croatia]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.filmneweurope.com/news/croatia-news/item/105095-rcsrds-sells-digi-tv-croatia-to-vipnet |title=RCS&RDS Sells Digi TV Croatia to Vipnet |publisher=filmneweurope.com |date=13 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile development ===\nIn 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service in 2015. \n\nSatellite television subsidiary in Serbia was sold to Kopernikus Technology, which in turn was sold to [[Telekom Srbija]] (mts) in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parabola.cz/clanky/6523/srbska-digi-tv-prodana-spolecnosti-kopernikus-ta-srbskemu-telekomu/ |title=Srbsk\u00e1 Digi TV prod\u00e1na spole\u010dnosti Kopernikus.

Then followed the implementation of GPON in 2008, covering the houses as well. In 2013 started replacing FFTB with [[Fiber to the home|FTTH]]. In 2018 Digi started offering internet services through FTTH in Spain.\n\n=== Mobile telephony ===\n\nThe company launched Digi Mobil in Romania in December 2007 wich offered mobile telephony limited to [[3G]] service only at the time. In 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service on band 38 in 2015 and on band 1 in 2018.\n\nAfter winning a mobile operator licence in 2014 and numerous delays, the company launched mobile services in Hungary in 2019.\n\nIn Spain, due to the number of Romanians, [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] mobile telephony services were launched through [[Movistar]] in 2008. Initially, the company attracted Romanians because it offered cheap calls with Romanian networks. Vodafone Spain reacted after 1 year when it started losing customers by offering free calls with Vodafone Romania. This was followed by offers for Latin Americans.\nThen the company started offering internet at a low price, attracting Spanish customers. Digi became the second MVNO operator by number of customers. \n\nFollowing the model in Spain, in 2010 Digi Mobil was launched as MVNO in Italy through [[Telecom Italia|TIM]], but it was not as successful despite the fact that in Italy is a larger number of Romanians. Vodafone Italia began to offer free calls with Vodafone Romania and fixed networks before the launch of Digi Mobil.\n\n=== Cable television ===\n\nThe company offers all channels in one package except premium channels.\n\n=== Television channels ===\n\nIn July 2009, Digi launched the [[Digi Sport]] channels in Romania and Hungary. Then followed the Digi Sport channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic in August 2010, which have been operated separately since 2013 following the takeover of Digi Slovakia by Slovak Telekom. \n\nIn the summer of 2010, it acquired 50% of Music Channel, which launched Hit Music Channel in January 2012. The company launched a generalist channel in December 2010, but due to the low audience it was closed. The [[premium]] movie channel Digi Film (now Film Now) was launched on 1 February 2011. In 2011 acquired the UTV music TV channel.\n\n[[Digi 24]] TV news channel was launched on 1 March 2012. Following disagreements with [[Discovery Inc.|Discovery]], the company launched 3 thematic channels in October 2012: Digi World, Digi Life and Digi Animal World. On 10 December 2018 was launched Digi 4K.\n\n=== Energy supplier === \n\nIn April 2015, Digi launched the energy supply service. The company had in 2017 the most subscribers on the competitive market from the companies that do not have the distribution infrastructure. In 2019, it increased tariffs by 30% due to a tax added by the government and then by 20%. The company announced that it is gradually giving up the supply service due to the unusual volatility of the electricity price.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://energyreport.ro/index.php/2013-electricitate/2013-stiri-electricitate/2013-energie-electrica/5020-digi-retrage-furnizarea-de-energie-din-grila-de-programe-a-companiei |title=Digi retrage furnizarea de energie din grila de programe a companiei |publisher=energyreport.ro |date=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Digi brand ==\n\nRCS & RDS introduced the Digi TV brand for satellite television services in December 2004 in Romania and in 2006 in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Serbia. In 2006 the company unified under the Digi brand the cable television, internet and telephony services in Hungary, followed by Slovakia in June 2007.

It was released by [[S.M. Entertainment]] on January 29, 2018, along with the album and an accompanying music video. Written by S.M. Entertainment artist and songwriter [[Yoo Young-jin]] and produced by [[The Stereotypes]], Eazy, Maxx Song and Whitney Philips, \"Bad Boy\" is primarily an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with elements of [[hip hop]] that has a synth melody and heavy bass sound. Its lyrics describe a relationship between the titular \"bad boy\" and a cold woman.\n\nThe song was well-received by critics overseas and in the group's native country South Korea, who praised the music, the music video and its choreography, and the group's transition to a sexy concept, something they have never attempted before. \"Bad Boy\" was included in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' '100 Best Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, and topped their annual '20 Best K-pop Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, they were the first female act to top this list. ''[[Dazed (magazine)|Dazed]]'' also included the song in their '20 best K-pop songs of 2018'. Commercially, the song was a domestic and international success, topping the Gaon Download Chart and charting at number two on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]] in South Korea. It charted at number two on ''Billboard's'' [[World Digital Songs]] chart. As of February 2020, it has sold over 500,000 units in the United States, has 250 million views on YouTube and 100 million streams on Spotify. The group entered the [[Canadian Hot 100]] for the first time with the song, making them only the seventh K-pop artist and the third female act to appear on the chart. It also charted in [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].\n\nThe song is also notable for being one of two songs (the other being \"[[Red Flavor]]\") performed by Red Velvet at the \"[[Spring is Coming]]\" concert in [[Pyongyang]] at the [[East Pyongyang Grand Theatre]] to an audience that included [[Kim Jong-un]].

It was released by [[S.M. Entertainment]] on January 29, 2018, along with the album and an accompanying music video. Written by S.M. Entertainment artist and songwriter [[Yoo Young-jin]] and produced by [[The Stereotypes]], Eazy, Maxx Song and Whitney Philips, \"Bad Boy\" is primarily an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with elements of [[hip hop]] that has a synth melody and heavy bass sound. Its lyrics describe a relationship between the titular \"bad boy\" and a cold woman.\n\nThe song was well-received by critics overseas and in the group's native country South Korea, who praised the music, the music video and its choreography, and the group's transition to a sexy concept, something they have never attempted before. \"Bad Boy\" was included in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' '100 Best Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, and topped their annual '20 Best K-pop Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, they were the first female act to top this list. ''[[Dazed (magazine)|Dazed]]'' also included the song in their '20 best K-pop songs of 2018'. Commercially, the song was a domestic and international success, topping the Gaon Download Chart and charting at number two on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]] in South Korea. It charted at number two on ''Billboard's'' [[World Digital Songs]] chart. As of February 2020, it has sold over 500,000 units in the United States, has 250 million views on YouTube and 100 million streams on Spotify. The group entered the [[Canadian Hot 100]] for the first time with the song, making them only the seventh K-pop artist and the third female act to appear on the chart. It also charted in [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].\n\nThe song is also notable for being one of two songs (the other being \"[[Red Flavor]]\") performed by Red Velvet at the \"[[Spring is Coming]]\" concert in [[Pyongyang]] at the [[East Pyongyang Grand Theatre]] to an audience that included [[Kim Jong-un]].

A dragon who was [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]'s adviser, now adviser to Jimmy Woo, the new Head of the Atlas Foundation\n* [[Temugin]] \u2013 Second in Command of Atlas Foundation.\n* [[Derek Khanata]] \u2013 Overseer of Atlas.\n* At the end of the series, the contemporary [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] was invited to join the team, and he did.\n\nDuring the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' Jimmy Woo recruited several of his teammates from the Asian American superhero team Protectors as well as several new Asian superheroes to form ''The New Agents of Atlas'' to stop The Queen of Cinders invading the Asian continent. The current members consist of:\n* [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]] - The Chinese heroine with wind-based powers.\n* [[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]] - The Korean-American former Hulk and supergenius.\n* [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent and Io]] - South Korean heroine and her magical bear.\n* [[Luna Snow]] - South Korean K-Pop idol with ice-based powers.\n* [[Shang-Chi]] - The Master of Kung-Fu.\n* [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] - The Korean-American [[Spider-Man]] ally.\n* [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] - The mystical sword wielding Chinese hero.\n* [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]] - The Filipina water manipulator.\n* [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]] - South Korean super spy and the last of the [[kumiho]].\n\nThe [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] Pakistani-American superheroine [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]] was offered membership along with the other Protectors but left to rejoin her original team [[Champions (2016 team)|the Champions]] in New York before she could accept the offer.  M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced android created by Jimmy and the Atlas foundation, briefly joined the team under the guise of the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (deity) |Pele]].  The Immortal Monkey King [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants briefly assisted the team as well.\n\nWhen most of the Agents are summoned to the portal city of Pan, they are introduced to the current [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]], Raz Malhotra, who is informally recruited into Atlas by Amadeus when rejecting Mike Nguyen's offer to become Pan's protectors.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\nThe group was formed in Spring 1958 by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent [[Jimmy Woo]] to rescue President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] from the villainous [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]. Woo first recruits [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] and [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]]. He then tries to recruit [[Namora]], who declines but tells Woo where to find a broken but potentially useful robot named [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]]. While Marvel Boy fixes M-11, Woo asks [[Jann of the Jungle]] to take Marvel Boy to extend an invitation to [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Ken Hale)|Gorilla-Man]], who accepts Woo's offer. The group quickly rescues President Eisenhower and remains together for six months until the federal government, deciding the public is not ready for such a group, disbands it and classifies information about it.\n\nYears later, Woo, by now a high-ranking agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], attempts a secret raid of a group identified as the Atlas Foundation. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, Woo invades an Atlas location, resulting in all of the recruits being killed. Woo himself is critically burned and loses his higher brain functions. Gorilla-Man, by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gives the organization a record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no knowledge, and rescues Woo with the aid of M-11 and Marvel Boy, who can only restore Woo to his 1958 self. Namora, whom the group believed dead, is located by the Agents and joins the group. The team learns M-11 is a [[double agent]] for the Yellow Claw, and that Venus is one of the legendary [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s given flesh, not the Venus/[[Aphrodite]] of mythological legend.\n\nUsing M-11 as a beacon, the heroes find the Yellow Claw, who reveals his true identity, Plan Chu, an almost immortal [[Mongol]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who claims he orchestrated each of his battles with Woo only to establish Woo's worthiness to marry Suwan and succeed him as khan. Chu created Atlas to put Woo again in the spotlight. Woo accepts his destiny, takes over Atlas hoping to turn it into a force for good, and the Yellow Claw, having found his heir, appears to commit suicide. The team resurfaces in [[New York City]], where together with [[Spider-Man]], they defeat Temple of Atlas splinter cells still loyal to the Yellow Claw.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Family]]'' #4</ref> \n\nThey later work as a resistance cell against the [[Secret Invasion|invasion of Earth]] by the shapeshifting aliens the [[Skrulls]].<ref name= resistance /> Following the Skrulls' defeat and the [[Dark Reign (comics)|rise]] of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to power, the Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of \"supervillains.\" They attack [[Fort Knox]] and steal the gold reserve, which Osborn had planned on using to finance a secret weapons system.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign: New Nation]]'' one-shot</ref>\n\nThe Agents of Atlas encounter (and battle) the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20134</ref> the X-Men,<ref>''X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20132</ref> fight Norman Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (comics) |Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #139\u2013140</ref> and later investigate an abandoned Thule Society headquarters during the events of ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]''.\n\n[[File:New Agents of Atlas.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The New Agents of Atlas.  Art by Jung-Geun Yoon.]] \nDuring the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' event, while Jimmy offers his Protectors teammates ([[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] and [[Kamala Kahn|Ms. Marvel]]) membership to Atlas, they are suddenly alerted by the news of [[War of the Realms|Malekith's invasion of Earth]].   Most of the New Agents of Atlas head to [[Seoul]] while Ms. Marvel joins the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in New York.  The Agents defend Seoul from Malekith's ally Queen Sindr and her Fire Goblin forces from [[Muspelheim]] with help from the Korean heroes [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]], [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent, Io]] and [[Luna Snow]].<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, Brawn teleports Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to peacefully annex [[South Korea]].  Brawn eventually summons the Chinese heroes [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] and [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]], [[Philippines|Filipina]] heroine [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]] and the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] goddess of Fire and Volcanoes [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] from [[Shanghai]] to help assist in the fight against Sindr.  The newly summoned heroes are less than pleased for being taken out of their previous battle, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice caps]] if they don't work together.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After formulating a plan, Brawn confronts Sindr and her forces directly while Aero, Wave and Luna use Sindr's Black Bifrost to travel to the [[Arctic]] to decrease its temperature with their powers; the remaining members are teleported to Atlas' ally [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants in Northern China where Shang-Chi begins training the remaining members for their final fight.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  As planned by Brawn, the Queen of Cinders and her forces arrive in Northern China with a captured Brawn, only to be taken by surprise by the Agents; Pele reveals herself to be M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced Atlas Android, who then absorbs Sindr's energy and self-destructs, weakening her.  With Shang-Chi's training the group defeats her, although at the cost of Sun Wukong sacrificing himself.  Despite being given the chance by Jimmy to surrender, Sindr flees using the Black Bifrost, only for the Agents to follow her with Brawn's teleporter, where they help [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat her and her remaining forces at the [[Great Wall of China]] near [[Beijing]].  After Malekith's defeat, the Agents are seen in [[Shanghai]] looking on while the captured Fire Goblins are escorted back to Muspelheim.  Jimmy quietly congratulates his new agents.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nShortly after the ''War of the Realms'' event, a few members of the new agents are in [[Madripoor]] fighting one of Sindr's remaining Fire Dragons, where they encounter Isaac Ikeda, the self-proclaimed \"Protector of Pan\", who uses his technologically advanced weaponry to slay the dragon and teleports away with its corpse.  Afterwards, the team goes their separate ways, only to find the cities they are each residing in engulfed in a white light, which Amadeus recognizes as Ikeda's teleportation technology.  The reunited agents along with [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]] discover the cities they were in (along with other Asian, Pacific and [[Ethnic enclave|predominantly Asian cities outside of Asia]]) have been merged and connected together with portals made from Ikeda's technology.  Mike Nguyen of the Big Nguyen Company reveals himself to be behind the newly merged city, \"Pan\", which he states for 24 hours would allow every citizen to easily explore each other's respective cities without any political and economic restrictions.  Shortly after the announcement, Pan is suddenly beset by [[Wyvern|wyverns]], which the agents, Giant-Man and Ikeda fight off.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics</ref>  Concurrently, the original agents are sent by Jimmy to a temple in [[Thailand]] to rescue [[List_of_Avengers_members#Infiltrators|Avenger X]] from General Nurong and his forces.  During the mission, the group encounters Nurong's master, a dragon named Mr. Thong, who reveals himself to be an enemy of Mr. Lao.  Thong mocks the group as being pawns for Lao and warns them of the upcoming ''Clash of Dragons''.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\" />  After fighting off the wyverns, the new agents are praised by Nguyen for their heroics and offers to enlist the agents as Pan's protectors along with Ikeda.  Amadeus is suspicious of Nguyen and Ikeda, believing that Atlas is being used for publicity.  Amadeus and Luna later have a confrontation with several armed members of the Pan Guard, who attempt to arrest a group of Madripoorian refugees that Amadeus and Luna rescued from [[Sea serpents|sea serpents]] for illegally trespassing into Pan. The rescue, fight with the Pan guard and subsequent kiss between Amadeus and Luna is broadcast by Nguyen as an attempt to sell Pan Passes to spectators,<ref name=\"AoA 3-2\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #2. Marvel Comics</ref> much to Amadeus' and Luna's embarrassment and anger.  After the Atlas agents and Ikeda team up with the Pan Guard to save the refugees from the serpents, Nguyen clears up the misunderstanding, claiming that the Madripoorians had been out of range during Pan's activation and the Pan Guard mistakenly believed they were trespassing with help from the serpents; Nguyen has the refugees escorted to the Pan Grand Hotel as special guests.  When Amadeus summons the team to the Atlas secret bunker in Seoul, they are unexpectedly joined by Ikeda.  When Ikeda is interrogated by the team about his and Nguyen's motives, Issac explains that he was hired by Nguyen due to his expertise in fighting dragons, but offers little about Nguyen.  Isacc has his own suspicions of Mike and suggests that the Atlas agents to join him as Pan's protectors as it would be easier for them to gather information about the Big Nguyen Company on the inside.  Despite some misgivings, the team agrees and go their separate ways to different Pan sectors.  Unbeknownst to the agents, their actions are being monitored by Jimmy and Mr. Lao, with the latter believing the new team isn't ready to be trusted yet.<ref name=\"AoA 3-3\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  The team makes several discoveries during their investigations: Brawn, Silk and White Fox realize that the central hub of Pan doesn't correspond with any known location on Earth, which Amadeus deduces is in another dimension, as well as the sound of roaring dragons emerging from Nguyen's tower during nighttime; while searching for the apparently absent Jimmy Woo, Shang-Chi and Crescent infiltrate his office in Mumbai where Shang discovers a photograph of Jimmy and Nguyen shaking hands.<ref name=\"AoA 3-4\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #4. Marvel Comics</ref>  While Shang-Chi relays this to Amadeus, he also uncovers a laptop that broadcasts the sound of a dragon's roar from Nguyen's tower in the Heart of Pan.  While Brawn, Silk, Sword Master and White Fox break into Nguyen's tower and discover a sea serpent imprisoned in a lab, Shang-Chi and Crescent discover a secret tunnel in Jimmy's office that takes them to the Atlas Foundation's headquarters in the Pan sector of San Francisco, where they come face to face with Jimmy and Mr. Lao, who introduces himself to the Atlas agents.  Nguyen denies that he and Jimmy are in league with each other, other than signing nonagression treaty between Atlas and Pan, which the agents just violated.  Nguyen explains that since dragon scales contain magical properties associated with portals and teleportation, the imprisoned dragon was having its scales harvested to supply Pan's portal and teleportation technology.  Suspecting the serpent's identity, Lao and Jimmy order to agents to free her lest awakening the wrath every dragon on the planet, while Nguyen and Ikeda argue that releasing the dragon will cause the portals to collapse, displacing every citizen and refugee that had settled in the portal-city.  Before a decision can be made, a massive storm begins engulfing the city.  While Ikeda reveals that the imprisoned dragon, which he captured a year ago for terrorizing the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], is from [[Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Regions_and_countries|Atlantis]], an enraged [[Namor]] emerges from the waters off of Pan's coast and [[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|begins invading the city]].<ref name=\"AoA 3-5\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #5. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|Atlantis Attacks]]'' storyline, the New Agents of Atlas fight off Namor when he attempts to reclaim the sacred dragon of Atlantis from Pan.  Before retreating, Namor gives them one day to return the dragon or else face the wrath of Atlantis.  After the skirmish, Jimmy formally introduces the original and new teams to each other.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #1</ref>  Jimmy proceeds to deploy the agents to help bolster Pan's defenses, with Namora, Venus, Wave and Aero being sent on a diplomatic mission to Atlantis.  Wary of Namora's familial relationship with Namor, Brawn discretely orders Shang-Chi and Sword Master to spy on her.  After Brawn, Uranian, and 3-D Man are able to successfully able to replicate the dragon's magic with M-11's generator, Atlas releases the dragon who promptly returns back to Atlantis.  However upon arriving at the underwater kingdom, the dragon goes berserk and beings attacking.  After Atlantis' scientists discover the source of the dragon's behavior to be an implant embedded in its scales, Namor accuses Brawn to be behind the deception and immediately flies to Pan for revenge, where he viciously assaults Brawn and attacks Nguyen's tower.  After the Pan Guard and Brawn are able to push Namor's assault back to the ocean, Nguyen reveals that he has recruited the Sirenas, the longtime enemies of Atlantis, to help defend Pan.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #2</ref>  With help from the Sirenas, Namor is eventually overpowered and imprisoned.  During a meeting between the Agents of Atlas, the Pan Guard and the Sirenas, a disagreement erupts when Nguyen and the Sirenas' leader Sea Hunter propose to launch a retaliatory attack Atlantis.  Namora accuses the Sirenas of treachery, revealing the dragon's implant to be made from Sirena tech.  After Namora and Carina of the Sirenas recount their people's history, the group finds itself torn between protecting Pan, attacking or defending Atlantis. The disagreement eventually escalates into trading blows when several members within the group take sides between the Atlanteans and the Sirenas. During the commotion, Namor is able to break free from his prison.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #3</ref>\n\n==Temple of Atlas==\nAs part of a [[viral marketing]] strategy to promote the series, fans could participate in an [[alternate reality game]] centered around the \"Temple of Atlas\" [[weblog]] on Marvel's website. There, readers received weekly prose excerpts of the exploits of Jimmy Woo and his team, and were given \"missions\" from the Temple's curator, the mysterious \"Mr. Lao\". The goal was to discover each week's keyword by following textual clues Lao would post on the messageboards of such comic book [[webzines]] as ''[[Newsarama]]'' and ''[[Comic Book Resources]]''. They, along with [[IGN.com]] and ''[[Comics Bulletin]]'', would also feature fake news posts that players would be led toward, containing more clues for finding keywords. Anagrams were regular, and on several occasions one keyword had to be taken \"into the field\" by going to a local comic shop and saying the phrase to the staff in order to receive a keyword in response. On two occasions, players were required to attend a [[Heroes Convention]] and the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] [[Comic-Con International]] to find keywords.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the [[Marvel Adventures]]: Avengers universe, a time travel story involved a 1958 version of the Agents of Atlas that found [[Captain America]] frozen in ice. The special was written by Jeff Parker and penciled by Leonard Kirk, same creative team as the Agents of Atlas miniseries.\n\n==In other media==\n* The Agents of Atlas appeared in ''[[Lego Marvel Superheroes 2]]'' as [[downloadable content|DLC]] (downloadable content).

The current members consist of:\n* [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]] - The Chinese heroine with wind-based powers.\n* [[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]] - The Korean-American former Hulk and supergenius.\n* [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent and Io]] - South Korean heroine and her magical bear.\n* [[Luna Snow]] - South Korean K-Pop idol with ice-based powers.\n* [[Shang-Chi]] - The Master of Kung-Fu.\n* [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] - The Korean-American [[Spider-Man]] ally.\n* [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] - The mystical sword wielding Chinese hero.\n* [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]] - The Filipina water manipulator.\n* [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]] - South Korean super spy and the last of the [[kumiho]].\n\nThe [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] Pakistani-American superheroine [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]] was offered membership along with the other Protectors but left to rejoin her original team [[Champions (2016 team)|the Champions]] in New York before she could accept the offer.  M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced android created by Jimmy and the Atlas foundation, briefly joined the team under the guise of the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (deity) |Pele]].  The Immortal Monkey King [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants briefly assisted the team as well.\n\nWhen most of the Agents are summoned to the portal city of Pan, they are introduced to the current [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]], Raz Malhotra, who is informally recruited into Atlas by Amadeus when rejecting Mike Nguyen's offer to become Pan's protectors.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\nThe group was formed in Spring 1958 by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent [[Jimmy Woo]] to rescue President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] from the villainous [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]. Woo first recruits [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] and [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]]. He then tries to recruit [[Namora]], who declines but tells Woo where to find a broken but potentially useful robot named [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]]. While Marvel Boy fixes M-11, Woo asks [[Jann of the Jungle]] to take Marvel Boy to extend an invitation to [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Ken Hale)|Gorilla-Man]], who accepts Woo's offer. The group quickly rescues President Eisenhower and remains together for six months until the federal government, deciding the public is not ready for such a group, disbands it and classifies information about it.\n\nYears later, Woo, by now a high-ranking agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], attempts a secret raid of a group identified as the Atlas Foundation. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, Woo invades an Atlas location, resulting in all of the recruits being killed. Woo himself is critically burned and loses his higher brain functions. Gorilla-Man, by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gives the organization a record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no knowledge, and rescues Woo with the aid of M-11 and Marvel Boy, who can only restore Woo to his 1958 self. Namora, whom the group believed dead, is located by the Agents and joins the group. The team learns M-11 is a [[double agent]] for the Yellow Claw, and that Venus is one of the legendary [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s given flesh, not the Venus/[[Aphrodite]] of mythological legend.\n\nUsing M-11 as a beacon, the heroes find the Yellow Claw, who reveals his true identity, Plan Chu, an almost immortal [[Mongol]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who claims he orchestrated each of his battles with Woo only to establish Woo's worthiness to marry Suwan and succeed him as khan. Chu created Atlas to put Woo again in the spotlight. Woo accepts his destiny, takes over Atlas hoping to turn it into a force for good, and the Yellow Claw, having found his heir, appears to commit suicide. The team resurfaces in [[New York City]], where together with [[Spider-Man]], they defeat Temple of Atlas splinter cells still loyal to the Yellow Claw.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Family]]'' #4</ref> \n\nThey later work as a resistance cell against the [[Secret Invasion|invasion of Earth]] by the shapeshifting aliens the [[Skrulls]].<ref name= resistance /> Following the Skrulls' defeat and the [[Dark Reign (comics)|rise]] of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to power, the Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of \"supervillains.\" They attack [[Fort Knox]] and steal the gold reserve, which Osborn had planned on using to finance a secret weapons system.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign: New Nation]]'' one-shot</ref>\n\nThe Agents of Atlas encounter (and battle) the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20134</ref> the X-Men,<ref>''X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20132</ref> fight Norman Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (comics) |Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #139\u2013140</ref> and later investigate an abandoned Thule Society headquarters during the events of ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]''.\n\n[[File:New Agents of Atlas.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The New Agents of Atlas.  Art by Jung-Geun Yoon.]] \nDuring the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' event, while Jimmy offers his Protectors teammates ([[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] and [[Kamala Kahn|Ms. Marvel]]) membership to Atlas, they are suddenly alerted by the news of [[War of the Realms|Malekith's invasion of Earth]].   Most of the New Agents of Atlas head to [[Seoul]] while Ms. Marvel joins the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in New York.  The Agents defend Seoul from Malekith's ally Queen Sindr and her Fire Goblin forces from [[Muspelheim]] with help from the Korean heroes [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]], [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent, Io]] and [[Luna Snow]].<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, Brawn teleports Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to peacefully annex [[South Korea]].  Brawn eventually summons the Chinese heroes [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] and [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]], [[Philippines|Filipina]] heroine [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]] and the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] goddess of Fire and Volcanoes [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] from [[Shanghai]] to help assist in the fight against Sindr.  The newly summoned heroes are less than pleased for being taken out of their previous battle, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice caps]] if they don't work together.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After formulating a plan, Brawn confronts Sindr and her forces directly while Aero, Wave and Luna use Sindr's Black Bifrost to travel to the [[Arctic]] to decrease its temperature with their powers; the remaining members are teleported to Atlas' ally [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants in Northern China where Shang-Chi begins training the remaining members for their final fight.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  As planned by Brawn, the Queen of Cinders and her forces arrive in Northern China with a captured Brawn, only to be taken by surprise by the Agents; Pele reveals herself to be M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced Atlas Android, who then absorbs Sindr's energy and self-destructs, weakening her.  With Shang-Chi's training the group defeats her, although at the cost of Sun Wukong sacrificing himself.  Despite being given the chance by Jimmy to surrender, Sindr flees using the Black Bifrost, only for the Agents to follow her with Brawn's teleporter, where they help [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat her and her remaining forces at the [[Great Wall of China]] near [[Beijing]].  After Malekith's defeat, the Agents are seen in [[Shanghai]] looking on while the captured Fire Goblins are escorted back to Muspelheim.  Jimmy quietly congratulates his new agents.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nShortly after the ''War of the Realms'' event, a few members of the new agents are in [[Madripoor]] fighting one of Sindr's remaining Fire Dragons, where they encounter Isaac Ikeda, the self-proclaimed \"Protector of Pan\", who uses his technologically advanced weaponry to slay the dragon and teleports away with its corpse.  Afterwards, the team goes their separate ways, only to find the cities they are each residing in engulfed in a white light, which Amadeus recognizes as Ikeda's teleportation technology.  The reunited agents along with [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]] discover the cities they were in (along with other Asian, Pacific and [[Ethnic enclave|predominantly Asian cities outside of Asia]]) have been merged and connected together with portals made from Ikeda's technology.  Mike Nguyen of the Big Nguyen Company reveals himself to be behind the newly merged city, \"Pan\", which he states for 24 hours would allow every citizen to easily explore each other's respective cities without any political and economic restrictions.  Shortly after the announcement, Pan is suddenly beset by [[Wyvern|wyverns]], which the agents, Giant-Man and Ikeda fight off.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics</ref>  Concurrently, the original agents are sent by Jimmy to a temple in [[Thailand]] to rescue [[List_of_Avengers_members#Infiltrators|Avenger X]] from General Nurong and his forces.  During the mission, the group encounters Nurong's master, a dragon named Mr. Thong, who reveals himself to be an enemy of Mr. Lao.  Thong mocks the group as being pawns for Lao and warns them of the upcoming ''Clash of Dragons''.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\" />  After fighting off the wyverns, the new agents are praised by Nguyen for their heroics and offers to enlist the agents as Pan's protectors along with Ikeda.  Amadeus is suspicious of Nguyen and Ikeda, believing that Atlas is being used for publicity.  Amadeus and Luna later have a confrontation with several armed members of the Pan Guard, who attempt to arrest a group of Madripoorian refugees that Amadeus and Luna rescued from [[Sea serpents|sea serpents]] for illegally trespassing into Pan. The rescue, fight with the Pan guard and subsequent kiss between Amadeus and Luna is broadcast by Nguyen as an attempt to sell Pan Passes to spectators,<ref name=\"AoA 3-2\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #2. Marvel Comics</ref> much to Amadeus' and Luna's embarrassment and anger.  After the Atlas agents and Ikeda team up with the Pan Guard to save the refugees from the serpents, Nguyen clears up the misunderstanding, claiming that the Madripoorians had been out of range during Pan's activation and the Pan Guard mistakenly believed they were trespassing with help from the serpents; Nguyen has the refugees escorted to the Pan Grand Hotel as special guests.  When Amadeus summons the team to the Atlas secret bunker in Seoul, they are unexpectedly joined by Ikeda.  When Ikeda is interrogated by the team about his and Nguyen's motives, Issac explains that he was hired by Nguyen due to his expertise in fighting dragons, but offers little about Nguyen.  Isacc has his own suspicions of Mike and suggests that the Atlas agents to join him as Pan's protectors as it would be easier for them to gather information about the Big Nguyen Company on the inside.  Despite some misgivings, the team agrees and go their separate ways to different Pan sectors.  Unbeknownst to the agents, their actions are being monitored by Jimmy and Mr. Lao, with the latter believing the new team isn't ready to be trusted yet.<ref name=\"AoA 3-3\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  The team makes several discoveries during their investigations: Brawn, Silk and White Fox realize that the central hub of Pan doesn't correspond with any known location on Earth, which Amadeus deduces is in another dimension, as well as the sound of roaring dragons emerging from Nguyen's tower during nighttime; while searching for the apparently absent Jimmy Woo, Shang-Chi and Crescent infiltrate his office in Mumbai where Shang discovers a photograph of Jimmy and Nguyen shaking hands.<ref name=\"AoA 3-4\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #4. Marvel Comics</ref>  While Shang-Chi relays this to Amadeus, he also uncovers a laptop that broadcasts the sound of a dragon's roar from Nguyen's tower in the Heart of Pan.  While Brawn, Silk, Sword Master and White Fox break into Nguyen's tower and discover a sea serpent imprisoned in a lab, Shang-Chi and Crescent discover a secret tunnel in Jimmy's office that takes them to the Atlas Foundation's headquarters in the Pan sector of San Francisco, where they come face to face with Jimmy and Mr. Lao, who introduces himself to the Atlas agents.  Nguyen denies that he and Jimmy are in league with each other, other than signing nonagression treaty between Atlas and Pan, which the agents just violated.  Nguyen explains that since dragon scales contain magical properties associated with portals and teleportation, the imprisoned dragon was having its scales harvested to supply Pan's portal and teleportation technology.  Suspecting the serpent's identity, Lao and Jimmy order to agents to free her lest awakening the wrath every dragon on the planet, while Nguyen and Ikeda argue that releasing the dragon will cause the portals to collapse, displacing every citizen and refugee that had settled in the portal-city.  Before a decision can be made, a massive storm begins engulfing the city.  While Ikeda reveals that the imprisoned dragon, which he captured a year ago for terrorizing the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], is from [[Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Regions_and_countries|Atlantis]], an enraged [[Namor]] emerges from the waters off of Pan's coast and [[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|begins invading the city]].<ref name=\"AoA 3-5\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #5. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|Atlantis Attacks]]'' storyline, the New Agents of Atlas fight off Namor when he attempts to reclaim the sacred dragon of Atlantis from Pan.  Before retreating, Namor gives them one day to return the dragon or else face the wrath of Atlantis.  After the skirmish, Jimmy formally introduces the original and new teams to each other.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #1</ref>  Jimmy proceeds to deploy the agents to help bolster Pan's defenses, with Namora, Venus, Wave and Aero being sent on a diplomatic mission to Atlantis.  Wary of Namora's familial relationship with Namor, Brawn discretely orders Shang-Chi and Sword Master to spy on her.  After Brawn, Uranian, and 3-D Man are able to successfully able to replicate the dragon's magic with M-11's generator, Atlas releases the dragon who promptly returns back to Atlantis.  However upon arriving at the underwater kingdom, the dragon goes berserk and beings attacking.  After Atlantis' scientists discover the source of the dragon's behavior to be an implant embedded in its scales, Namor accuses Brawn to be behind the deception and immediately flies to Pan for revenge, where he viciously assaults Brawn and attacks Nguyen's tower.  After the Pan Guard and Brawn are able to push Namor's assault back to the ocean, Nguyen reveals that he has recruited the Sirenas, the longtime enemies of Atlantis, to help defend Pan.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #2</ref>  With help from the Sirenas, Namor is eventually overpowered and imprisoned.  During a meeting between the Agents of Atlas, the Pan Guard and the Sirenas, a disagreement erupts when Nguyen and the Sirenas' leader Sea Hunter propose to launch a retaliatory attack Atlantis.  Namora accuses the Sirenas of treachery, revealing the dragon's implant to be made from Sirena tech.  After Namora and Carina of the Sirenas recount their people's history, the group finds itself torn between protecting Pan, attacking or defending Atlantis. The disagreement eventually escalates into trading blows when several members within the group take sides between the Atlanteans and the Sirenas. During the commotion, Namor is able to break free from his prison.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #3</ref>\n\n==Temple of Atlas==\nAs part of a [[viral marketing]] strategy to promote the series, fans could participate in an [[alternate reality game]] centered around the \"Temple of Atlas\" [[weblog]] on Marvel's website. There, readers received weekly prose excerpts of the exploits of Jimmy Woo and his team, and were given \"missions\" from the Temple's curator, the mysterious \"Mr. Lao\". The goal was to discover each week's keyword by following textual clues Lao would post on the messageboards of such comic book [[webzines]] as ''[[Newsarama]]'' and ''[[Comic Book Resources]]''. They, along with [[IGN.com]] and ''[[Comics Bulletin]]'', would also feature fake news posts that players would be led toward, containing more clues for finding keywords. Anagrams were regular, and on several occasions one keyword had to be taken \"into the field\" by going to a local comic shop and saying the phrase to the staff in order to receive a keyword in response. On two occasions, players were required to attend a [[Heroes Convention]] and the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] [[Comic-Con International]] to find keywords.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the [[Marvel Adventures]]: Avengers universe, a time travel story involved a 1958 version of the Agents of Atlas that found [[Captain America]] frozen in ice. The special was written by Jeff Parker and penciled by Leonard Kirk, same creative team as the Agents of Atlas miniseries.\n\n==In other media==\n* The Agents of Atlas appeared in ''[[Lego Marvel Superheroes 2]]'' as [[downloadable content|DLC]] (downloadable content).

It is located in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, near [[Tuzla]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 39,678 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]'s best-preserved medieval [[castle]], [[Srebrenik Fortress]], dating from 1333 is located in the outskirts of Srebrenik. The castle was occupied by the [[Ban (title)|Ban]] of [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnia]] [[Stephen II Kotromani\u0107]] until his death in 1353.\n\nThere are two historical versions related to the Ottoman conquest of Srebrenik.

It is located in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, near [[Tuzla]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 39,678 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]'s best-preserved medieval [[castle]], [[Srebrenik Fortress]], dating from 1333 is located in the outskirts of Srebrenik. The castle was occupied by the [[Ban (title)|Ban]] of [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnia]] [[Stephen II Kotromani\u0107]] until his death in 1353.\n\nThere are two historical versions related to the Ottoman conquest of Srebrenik. According to one, Srebrenik was taken in 1512, together with [[Teo\u010dak]]. The other version says that Srebrenik was taken together with Sokol and [[Te\u0161anj]] in 1521 by the Bosnian sanjak bey Feriz.

It is also the first [[Polytechnic (Singapore)|polytechnic]] established in Singapore. It was founded on 27 October 1954 to provide studies, training and research in technology, science, commerce and the arts. The former campus was originally located at Prince Edward Road and was relocated to its present-day location at [[Dover, Singapore|Dover]] next to [[Dover MRT station]] in 1978.

It is composed of 21 members; 19 elected members for a four-year term and two members ''ex officio''.<ref name=\"o2015\">[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1379/pdfs/uksi_20091379_en.pdf The Nineteen Single Member Electoral Districts Boundaries Order, 2015]</ref>\n\nThe Governor may at any time, by Proclamation, prorogue or dissolve the Assembly. The Governor shall dissolve the Assembly at the expiration of four years from the date when the Assembly first meets after any general election unless it has been sooner dissolved. There shall be a general election at such time within two months after every dissolution of the Assembly as the Governor shall, by Proclamation, appoint. The first meeting of every session of the House shall, by Proclamation, be held on such day as the Governor shall appoint. A session usually consists of four meetings. A Meeting comprises several sittings.\n\nIn the elections of 8 November 2000, with a turnout of 80% only non-partisans were elected. After the election, [[conservatism|conservative]] members of parliament formed the [[United Democratic Party (Cayman Islands)|United Democratic Party]].

[[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|The Progressives]] (PPM), three of the nine elected independents and the [[Cayman Democratic Party]] (CDP) formed a historic [[national unity government]].

This building is the seat of parliamentary beginnings in the Cayman Islands.\n\nBy 1909 what got established as the Legislative Assembly of Justices and Vestry was meeting in the Court House on the waterfront in what is now the headquarters of the [[Cayman Islands National Museum]], in front of Hog Sty Bay and the cruise passenger arrival terminal. The building served as the seat of government, the court house and the legislature. Now it is the home of the Cayman Islands National Museum.\n\nThe present Legislative Assembly building was built on the site of the former Princess Royal Park. The building design was the subject of some controversy when selected as the winner of an international architectural competition. Being the first poured concrete public building in Cayman, modern techniques were not yet in use, so the concrete was mixed on the street and poured pail by pail by a bucket brigade. The cornerstone was laid by Captain Rayal Brazly Bodden, MBE, JP, on 29 September 1971. The building was completed in July 1972.<ref>National Trust Cayman Islands \u2013 An Historical Walking Tour - Central George Town</ref>\n[[File:Cayman Islands Legislative Assembly Inside.jpg|thumb|509x509px|Cayman Islands Legislative Assembly Main Chamber]]\nBy 2003, the legislature had outgrown the space and the building was in need of renovating. Repair and refurbishment work on the building began in February 2003, which added more space through reconfiguration, and renovated and refurbished portions of the interior, including the main chamber.\n\nThe newly refurbished and expanded building was inaugurated with the opening of the Legislature session on 2 July 2004, two months before Hurricane Ivan, which almost completely devastated Grand Cayman over a two-day period (11\u201312 September 2004). The LA building withstood the storm with minor damage to its roof.\n\nNineteen members (Members of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs) are currently elected on a [[one man, one vote|\"one person, one vote\"]] basis, following a Constitution Order in 2015.<ref name=\"o2015\" /> This replaced the electoral system form the 2009 constitutional amendment (where 18 members were elected from five multi- and two single-member constituencies).<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1379/pdfs/uksi_20091379_en.pdf The Cayman Islands Constitution Order 2009]</ref> The two ''ex officio'' (appointed) members, the Deputy Governor and the Attorney-General, are appointed by the [[Governor of the Cayman Islands]].\n\n==Official Members==\n*'''Hon.

It is composed of 21 members; 19 elected members for a four-year term and two members ''ex officio''.<ref name=\"o2015\">[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1379/pdfs/uksi_20091379_en.pdf The Nineteen Single Member Electoral Districts Boundaries Order, 2015]</ref>\n\nThe Governor may at any time, by Proclamation, prorogue or dissolve the Assembly. The Governor shall dissolve the Assembly at the expiration of four years from the date when the Assembly first meets after any general election unless it has been sooner dissolved. There shall be a general election at such time within two months after every dissolution of the Assembly as the Governor shall, by Proclamation, appoint. The first meeting of every session of the House shall, by Proclamation, be held on such day as the Governor shall appoint. A session usually consists of four meetings. A Meeting comprises several sittings.\n\nIn the elections of 8 November 2000, with a turnout of 80% only non-partisans were elected. After the election, [[conservatism|conservative]] members of parliament formed the [[United Democratic Party (Cayman Islands)|United Democratic Party]]. The [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|People's Progressive Movement]] formed in response and won the [[Caymanian general election, 2005|subsequent election]].\n\nFollowing the most [[Caymanian general election, 2017|recent election]] both established parties failed to attain the majority of seats in the legislature. [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|The Progressives]] (PPM), three of the nine elected independents and the [[Cayman Democratic Party]] (CDP) formed a historic [[national unity government]]. Progressive leader [[Alden McLaughlin]] secured a second term as [[Premier]], with [[Cayman Democratic Party]] leader [[McKeeva Bush]] as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly.<ref>[http://cayman27.ky/2017/05/smooth-swearing-in-for-progressives-led-national-unity-government/ Smooth swearing-in for Progressives-led national unity government] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625061556/http://cayman27.ky/2017/05/smooth-swearing-in-for-progressives-led-national-unity-government/ |date=25 June 2017 }} Cayman 27, 31 May 2017</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first meeting to discuss the possible legislative future of the Cayman Islands took place on 5 December 1831 at [[Pedro St. James Castle]], a great house in the fertile area of Savannah on Grand Cayman. This building is the seat of parliamentary beginnings in the Cayman Islands.\n\nBy 1909 what got established as the Legislative Assembly of Justices and Vestry was meeting in the Court House on the waterfront in what is now the headquarters of the [[Cayman Islands National Museum]], in front of Hog Sty Bay and the cruise passenger arrival terminal. The building served as the seat of government, the court house and the legislature. Now it is the home of the Cayman Islands National Museum.\n\nThe present Legislative Assembly building was built on the site of the former Princess Royal Park. The building design was the subject of some controversy when selected as the winner of an international architectural competition. Being the first poured concrete public building in Cayman, modern techniques were not yet in use, so the concrete was mixed on the street and poured pail by pail by a bucket brigade. The cornerstone was laid by Captain Rayal Brazly Bodden, MBE, JP, on 29 September 1971. The building was completed in July 1972.<ref>National Trust Cayman Islands \u2013 An Historical Walking Tour - Central George Town</ref>\n[[File:Cayman Islands Legislative Assembly Inside.jpg|thumb|509x509px|Cayman Islands Legislative Assembly Main Chamber]]\nBy 2003, the legislature had outgrown the space and the building was in need of renovating. Repair and refurbishment work on the building began in February 2003, which added more space through reconfiguration, and renovated and refurbished portions of the interior, including the main chamber.\n\nThe newly refurbished and expanded building was inaugurated with the opening of the Legislature session on 2 July 2004, two months before Hurricane Ivan, which almost completely devastated Grand Cayman over a two-day period (11\u201312 September 2004). The LA building withstood the storm with minor damage to its roof.\n\nNineteen members (Members of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs) are currently elected on a [[one man, one vote|\"one person, one vote\"]] basis, following a Constitution Order in 2015.<ref name=\"o2015\" /> This replaced the electoral system form the 2009 constitutional amendment (where 18 members were elected from five multi- and two single-member constituencies).<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1379/pdfs/uksi_20091379_en.pdf The Cayman Islands Constitution Order 2009]</ref> The two ''ex officio'' (appointed) members, the Deputy Governor and the Attorney-General, are appointed by the [[Governor of the Cayman Islands]].\n\n==Official Members==\n*'''Hon.

[[Native American cultures in the United States|Numerous indigenous cultures]] formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the year 1492 started the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of [[John Winthrop]] make the [[United States]] the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of the American people|last=Johnson, Paul, 1928\u2013|date=1999|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=0060930349|edition= 1st HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY|pages=32|oclc=40984521|quote=These early diaries and letters, which are plentiful, and the fact that most important documents about the early American colonies have been preserved, mean that the United States is the first nation in human history whose most distant origins are fully recorded.}}</ref> By the 1760s, the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] contained 2.5 million people along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. After [[French and Indian Wars|defeating France]], the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773, led to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] issuing [[Intolerable Acts|punitive laws]] designed to end self-government in Massachusetts.\n\nArmed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the [[Second Continental Congress]] [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the colonies as the United States. Led by General [[George Washington]], it won the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] with large support from France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty of 1783]] gave the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida) to the new nation. The [[Articles of Confederation]] established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] in 1787 wrote [[Constitution of the United States|a new Constitution]] that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was added to guarantee [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable rights]]. With Washington as the first president and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. [[Louisiana Purchase|Purchase]] of the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was [[War of 1812|fought in 1812]], which solidified national pride.\n\nEncouraged by the notion of [[manifest destiny]], U.S. territory expanded [[American frontier|all the way]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]]. While the United States was large in terms of area, by 1790 [[Demography of the United States|its population]] was only 4 million. It grew rapidly, however, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was even greater. Compared to European powers, though, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. [[American frontier|Westward expansion]] was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [[yeoman]] farmers and slave owners. The expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states [[Northern United States|north]] of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] by 1804, but the [[Southern United States|South]] continued to profit from the institution, mostly from the [[Cotton production in the United States|production of cotton]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was [[1860 United States presidential election|elected president in 1860]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery.\n\nSeven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Its [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack of Fort Sumter]] against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union forces]] there in 1861 started the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Defeat of the Confederates in 1865 led to the impoverishment of the South and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]]. In the [[Reconstruction era]] following the war, [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|legal and voting rights were extended]] to [[Freedman|freed slaves]]. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, it gained explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained their power in the South in 1877, often by [[paramilitary]] [[Voter suppression in the United States|suppression of voting]], they passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy]], as well as new [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] that prevented most [[African Americans]] and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] from voting. This continued until the gains of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s and the passage of federal legislation to enforce uniform constitutional rights for all citizens.\n\nThe United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century, due to an outburst of entrepreneurship and industrialization in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the arrival of [[European emigration|millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe]]. A national railroad network was completed and large-scale mines and factories were established. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency, and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], from the 1890s to 1920s. This era led to many reforms, including the Sixteenth to Nineteenth constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. Initially neutral during [[World War I]], the United States [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] in 1917 and funded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory the following year. Women obtained the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to vote]] in 1920, with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924.\n\nAfter [[Roaring Twenties|a prosperous decade]] in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ended the Republican dominance of the [[White House]] and implemented his [[New Deal]] programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]]. The New Deal defined [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States entered [[World War II]] and financed the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]. Its involvement culminated in using newly-invented [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities]] to defeat [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].\n\nThe United States and the [[Soviet Union]] emerged as rival superpowers in the [[aftermath of World War II]]. During the [[Cold War]], the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the [[arms race]], the [[Space Race]], [[proxy war]]s, and propaganda campaigns. The goal of the United States in this was to stop the spread of [[communism]]. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the [[civil rights movement]], another wave of social reforms was enacted which enforced the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only [[superpower]].\n\nAfter the Cold War, the United States's foreign policy has focused on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|modern conflicts in the Middle East]]. The beginning of the 21st century saw the [[September 11 attacks]] carried out by [[Al-Qaeda]] in 2001, which was later followed by wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2007, the United States entered its [[Great Recession in the United States|worst economic crisis since the Great Depression]], which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the early 2010s.

The prevailing theory proposes that people from [[Eurasia]] followed [[Game (hunting)|game]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas.

While the term technically refers to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage in 1492, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's initial landing.\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:North American cultural areas.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Cultural area]]s of [[pre-Columbian North America]], according to [[Alfred Kroeber]].]]\nBy 10,000 BCE, humans were relatively well-established throughout [[North America]]. Originally, Paleo-Indian hunted Ice Age [[megafauna]] like [[mammoth]]s, but as they began to go extinct, people turned instead to [[bison]] as a food source. As time went on, foraging for berries and seeds became an important alternative to hunting. Paleo-Indians in central Mexico were the first in the Americas to farm, starting to plant corn, beans, and squash around 8,000 BCE. Eventually, the knowledge began to spread northward. By 3,000 BCE, corn was being grown in the valleys of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], followed by primitive [[irrigation]] systems and early villages of the [[Hohokam]].<ref name=\":6\"/><ref name=\"mark\">Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos{{'}}'', Part I and II.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest cultures in the present-day United States was the [[Clovis culture]], who are primarily identified by the use of fluted [[spear]] points called the [[Clovis point]]. From 9,100 to 8,850 BCE, the culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The [[Folsom tradition|Folsom culture]] was similar, but is marked by the use of the [[Folsom point]].\n\nA later migration identified by linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists occurred around 8,000 BCE.

They are the earliest known people to have been [[Mound Builders|mound builders]], however, there are mounds in the United States that predate this culture. [[Watson Brake]] is an 11-mound complex in [[Louisiana]] that dates to 3,500 BCE, and nearby [[Poverty Point]], built by the [[Poverty Point culture]], is an earthwork complex that dates to 1,700 BCE. These mounds likely served a religious purpose.\n\nThe Adenans were absorbed into the [[Hopewell tradition]], a powerful people who traded tools and goods across a wide territory. They continued the Adena tradition of mound-building, with remnants of several thousand still in existence across the core of their former territory in southern [[Ohio]]. The Hopewell pioneered a trading system called the Hopewell Exchange System, which at its greatest extent ran from the present-day Southeast up to the Canadian side of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name=\":8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell|publisher=Ohio History Central}}</ref> By 500 CE, the Hopewellians had too disappeared, absorbed into the larger [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nThe Mississippians were a broad group of tribes. Their most important city was [[Cahokia]], near modern-day [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. At its peak in the 12th century, the city had an estimated population of 20,000, larger than the population of London at the time. The entire city was centered around a [[Monks Mound|mound]] that stood {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=}} tall.

Many distinct cultural and political nations developed there, but they all shared certain beliefs traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of [[salmon]] as a resource and spiritual symbol. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the [[potlatch]].

[[New Netherland]] was established in 1621 by the company to capitalize on the [[North American fur trade]]. Growth was slow at first due to mismanagement by the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] and Native American conflicts. After the Dutch purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the Native Americans for a reported price of US$24, the land was named [[New Amsterdam]] and became the capital of [[New Netherland]]. The town rapidly expanded and in the mid 1600s it became an important trading center and port. Despite being [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and building the [[Reformed Church in America]], the Dutch were tolerant of other religions and cultures and traded with the [[Iroquois]] to the north.<ref name=\"questia.com\">Jaap Jacobs, ''The Colony of New Netherland: A Dutch Settlement in Seventeenth-Century America'' (2nd ed. Cornell University Press; 2009) [https://www.questia.com/read/109275503 online]</ref>\n\nThe colony served as a barrier to British expansion from [[New England Confederation|New England]], and as a result a [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|series of wars]] were fought. The colony was taken over by Britain in 1664 and its capital was renamed [[New York City]]. New Netherland left an enduring legacy on American cultural and political life of religious tolerance and sensible trade in urban areas and rural traditionalism in the countryside (typified by the story of [[Rip Van Winkle]]). Notable Americans of Dutch descent include [[Martin Van Buren]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Frelinghuysen family|Frelinghuysens]].<ref name=\"questia.com\"/>\n\n==== French and Spanish conflict ====\n[[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] landed in North Carolina in 1524, and was the first European to sail into [[New York Harbor]] and [[Narragansett Bay]]. A decade later, [[Jacques Cartier]] sailed in search of the Northwest Passage, but instead discovered the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and laid the foundation for [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonization]] of the Americas in [[New France]]. After the collapse of the first [[Charlesbourg-Royal|Quebec]] colony in the 1540s, French [[Huguenots]] settled at [[Fort Caroline]] near present-day [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] in Florida. In 1565, Spanish forces led by [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s|Pedro Men\u00e9ndez]] destroyed the settlement and established the first European settlement in what would become the United States \u2014 [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].\n\nAfter this, the French mostly remained in [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]], but far-reaching trade relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest spread their influence. French colonists in small villages along the Mississippi and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers lived in farming communities that served as a grain source for Gulf Coast settlements.

The first British colony in North America was established at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] by [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1585, but failed. It would be twenty years before another attempt.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe early British colonies were established by private groups seeking profit, and were marked by starvation, disease, and Native American attacks. Many immigrants were people seeking religious freedom or escaping political oppression, peasants displaced by the Industrial Revolution, or those simply seeking adventure and opportunity.\n\nIn some areas, Native Americans taught colonists how to plant and harvest the native crops. In others, they attacked the settlers. Virgin forests provided an ample supply of building material and firewood. Natural inlets and harbors lined the coast, providing easy ports for essential trade with Europe. Settlements remained close to the coast due to this as well as Native American resistance and the Appalachian Mountains that were found in the interior.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== The first settlement: Jamestown ====\n[[Image:Squantoteaching.png|thumb|200px|[[Squanto]] known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the ''Mayflower'' settlers, who made their settlement at the site of Squanto's former summer village.]]\n\nThe first successful English colony, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was established by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] in 1607 on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]]. The colonists were preoccupied with the search for gold and were ill-equipped for life in the New World. Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] held the fledgling Jamestown together in the first year, and the colony descended into anarchy and nearly failed when he returned to England two years later. [[John Rolfe]] began experimenting with tobacco from the West Indies in 1612, and by 1614 the first shipment arrived in London. It became Virginia's chief source of revenue within a decade.\n\nIn 1624, after years of disease and Indian attacks, including the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], [[James VI and I|King James I]] revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made Virginia a royal colony.\n\n==== New England ====\n[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts]]\n\n[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution. The [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] sailed for Virginia on the Mayflower in 1620, but were knocked off course by a storm and landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], where they agreed to a social contract of rules in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Like Jamestown, Plymouth suffered from disease and starvation, but local [[Wampanoag]] Indians taught the colonists how to farm maize.\n\nPlymouth was followed by the [[Puritans]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630. They maintained a charter for self-government separate from England, and elected founder [[John Winthrop]] as the governor for most of its early years. [[Roger Williams]] opposed Winthrop's treatment of Native Americans and religious intolerance, and established the colony of [[Providence Plantations]], later [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], on the basis of freedom of religion. Other colonists established settlements in the [[Connecticut River]] Valley, and on the coasts of present-day [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Native American attacks continued, with the most significant occurring in the 1637 [[Pequot War]] and the 1675 [[King Philip's War]].\n\nNew England became a center of commerce and industry due to the poor, mountainous soil making agriculture difficult. Rivers were harnessed to power grain mills and sawmills, and the numerous harbors facilitated trade. Tight-knit villages developed around these industrial centers, and [[Boston]] became one of America's most important ports.\n\n==== Middle Colonies ====\n[[File:Indians_at_a_Hudson_Bay_Company_trading_post.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Indians trade 90-lb packs of furs at a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the 1660s, the [[Middle Colonies]] of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]] were established in the former Dutch New Netherland, and were characterized by a large degree of ethnic and religious diversity. At the same time, the [[Iroquois]] of New York, strengthened by years of fur trading with Europeans, formed the powerful Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe last colony in this region was [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], established in 1681 by [[William Penn]] as a home for religious dissenters, including [[Quakers]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[Amish]].<ref name=\":9\" /> The capital of colony, [[Philadelphia]], became a dominant commercial center in a few short years, with busy docks and brick houses. While Quakers populated the city, [[German Americans|German]] immigrants began to flood into the Pennsylvanian hills and forests, while the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] pushed into the far western frontier.\n\n==== Southern Colonies ====\nThe extremely rural [[Southern Colonies]] contrasted greatly with the north. Outside of Virginia, the first British colony south of New England was [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], established as a Catholic haven in 1632. The economy of these two colonies was built entirely on [[yeoman]] farmers and planters. The planters established themselves in the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] region of Virginia, establishing massive [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] with slave labor, while the small-scale farmers made their way into political office.\n\nIn 1670, the [[Province of Carolina]] was established, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] became the region's great trading port. While Virginia's economy was based on tobacco, Carolina was much more diversified, exporting rice, indigo, and lumber as well. In 1712 the colony was split in half, creating [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. The [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]]&nbsp;\u2013 the last of the Thirteen Colonies&nbsp;\u2013 was established by [[James Oglethorpe]] in 1732 as a border to Spanish Florida and a reform colony for former prisoners and the poor.<ref name=\":9\">Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\u201d>\n1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622.

American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted new believers with an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the late 1790s.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref> In the early stages, evangelicals in the South, such as [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.\n\n==== Government ====\nEach of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote on taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\">{{cite book |author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA185|origyear=1948|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185\u201390|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>\n\n==== Servitude and slavery ====\nOver half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America|last=Barker|first=Deanna|publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|archivedate=October 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Few could afford the cost of the journey to America, and so this form of unfree labor provided a means to immigrate. Typically, people would sign a contract agreeing to a set term of labor, usually four to seven years, and in return would receive transport to America and a piece of land at the end of their servitude. In some cases, ships' captains received rewards for the delivery of poor migrants, and so extravagant promises and kidnapping were common. The Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company also utilized indentured servant labor.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe first [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to Virginia from the British West Indies in 1619, just twelve years after the founding of Jamestown. Initially regarded as indentured servants who could buy their freedom, the institution of slavery began to harden and the involuntary servitude became lifelong as the demand for labor on tobacco and rice plantations grew in the 1660s. Slavery became identified with brown skin color, at the time seen as a \"[[black race]]\", and the children of slave women were born slaves (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). By the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population.\n\nThe question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London, however, continued to regard the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country in a policy known as [[mercantilism]].<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\" />\n\nColonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that utilized forms of [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]], such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]].The British colonies were also marked by a policy of avoiding strict enforcement of parliamentary laws, known as [[salutary neglect]].

A unique class system operated in [[upstate New York]], where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family]]. The other colonies were more egalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited respect for its small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' in 1756 summed it up:\n<blockquote>The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the ''meanest among them'' thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.<ref>Clinton Rossiter, ''Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty'' (1953) p 106.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Political integration and autonomy===\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This 1756 political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]] urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.]]\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363), part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]], was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies.

In the following years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies, without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have the right to tax Americans who were not represented in it?

His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.\n\nAs a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.<ref name=\"NEH EDSITEMENT\">Lesson Plan on \"What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?\" [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]</ref>\n\n=== Loyalists and Britain ===\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819)]]\nThe Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.

A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.\n\nTo assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).<ref>Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008)</ref>\n\n===President George Washington===\n\n[[File:Stuart-george-washington-constable-1797.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Washington]] legacy remains among the two or three greatest in American history, as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.]]\n[[File:Farewelladdresses 01 various 128kb.ogg|thumb|Reading of the [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell address]] of President George Washington, 1796]]\n\n[[George Washington]]&nbsp;\u2013 a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]&nbsp;\u2013 became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789.

The former Jeffersonian (Democratic-Republican) party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:\n<blockquote>Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party, and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.\n\nBehind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:\n\n[[File:Clay44b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Horace Greeley]]'s ''New York Tribune''\u2014the leading Whig paper\u2014endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844.]]\n<blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics.&nbsp;... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287\u201388</ref><ref>Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1\u20134</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Walters, rejected [[William_Lloyd_Garrison|Garrison's]] theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.<ref>{{cite book |author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W.

Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states\".

A small number of active Northerners were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin (in terms of Protestant theology) and demanded its immediate abolition. Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".<ref>Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)</ref> Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments. Defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and killing economic impact in the South where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy. They also argued that if all the slaves were freed, there would be widespread unemployment and chaos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/27f.asp|title=The Southern Argument for Slavery [ushistory.org]|last=ushistory.org|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=June 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nReligious activists split on slavery, with the [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]] dividing into northern and southern denominations.

Abolitionists pounced on the Act to attack slavery, as in the best-selling anti-slavery [[novel]] ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].<ref>Fergus M. Bordewich, ''America's Great Debate: Henry Clay, Stephen A. Douglas, and the Compromise That Preserved the Union'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe [[Compromise of 1820]] was repealed in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of \"[[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]]\" and democracy. It permitted voters to decide on the legality of slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to adopt neutrality on the issue of slavery. Anti-slavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Pro- and anti- contingents rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a miniature civil war called [[Bleeding Kansas]]. By the late 1850s, the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college. It insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand (and thus would slowly die out).<ref>Nicole Etcheson, ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006)</ref>\n\n=== The plantation economy ===\nThe Southern slavery-based societies had become wealthy based on their [[cotton]] and other agricultural [[commodity]] production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including [[textile mills]]. By 1860, there were four million slaves in [[Southern United States|the South]], nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in 1790. The [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining [[tobacco]] regions).\n\n[[File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png|right|thumb|300px|The United States, immediately before the Civil War.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.\n\n=== Lincoln and secession ===\nAfter [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states [[Secession|seceded]] from the union and set up a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]] (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861. It attacked [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) \"[[slave and free states|slave states]]\" did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.\n\nDuring the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)</ref> West Virginia is usually associated with the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|American Civil War}}\nThe Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when elements of 100,000 [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.<ref>Allen C. Guelzo, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=313dh9YAiE4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction]'' (2012) ch 3\u20134</ref>\n\n[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Lincoln with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]\nThe war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.<ref>Stephen E. Woodworth, ''Decision in the Heartland: The Civil War in the West'' (2011)</ref>\n\nWarfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)</ref> Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861\u201362 on raising and training new armies.  The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention.\n\nLee's smaller army won at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]]. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause [[war-weariness]] in the North. In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1\u20133, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.<ref>On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, \"To Conquer a Peace?\" ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26\u201333, online at EBSCO\n</ref>  On the homefront,  industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories.  Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates).  The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton.  The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than a handful of runs.\n\n[[File:Gettysburg by Britton.ogg|left|thumb|Modern recording of [[Gettysburg Address]] originally spoken by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Kurz and Allison - Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864.]]\nIn the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies.  In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864.  Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties.  Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion.  Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies.  In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenish casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses,  launched a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|besieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency.\n\nThe American Civil War was the world's earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial war]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]].

In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Allen C.

President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress; he was impeached, but the Senate's attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.<ref name=\"George C. Rable 2007\">George C.

In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. [[Paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s.

Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting.

Roosevelt]] promised \"a [[New Deal]] for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established [[modern liberalism in the United States]] and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the [[New Deal Coalition]] of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners.  It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and for young men, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935\u201336, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937\u201338; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.<ref>David M.

[[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 but no military personnel.<ref>Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648\u201382</ref> This was carried out through the [[Lend-Lease]] agreements. Japan tried to neutralize America's power in the Pacific by [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, which catalyzed American support to enter the war.<ref>Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' (1982)</ref>\n\nThe main contributions of the U.S. to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and (especially 1944\u201345), military personnel. Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high-efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt Pearl Harbor.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Infamy speech|President Roosevelt's [[Infamy Speech]] in aftermath of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]].

People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence that it was only \"for the duration\", and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline were tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression.<ref>Harold G.

The Allies saw Germany as the main threat and gave the highest priority to Europe. The U.S. dominated the war against Japan and stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific in 1942. After losing Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines to the Japanese, and drawing the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] (May 1942), the American Navy inflicted a decisive blow at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] (June 1942). American ground forces assisted in the [[North African Campaign]] that eventually concluded with the collapse of Mussolini's fascist government in 1943, as Italy switched to the Allied side. A more significant European front was opened on [[D-Day]], June 6, 1944, in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France from Britain.\n\nOn the [[United States home front during World War II|home front]], mobilization of the U.S. economy was managed by Roosevelt's [[War Production Board]].

[[Native American cultures in the United States|Numerous indigenous cultures]] formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the year 1492 started the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of [[John Winthrop]] make the [[United States]] the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of the American people|last=Johnson, Paul, 1928\u2013|date=1999|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=0060930349|edition= 1st HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY|pages=32|oclc=40984521|quote=These early diaries and letters, which are plentiful, and the fact that most important documents about the early American colonies have been preserved, mean that the United States is the first nation in human history whose most distant origins are fully recorded.}}</ref> By the 1760s, the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] contained 2.5 million people along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. After [[French and Indian Wars|defeating France]], the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773, led to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] issuing [[Intolerable Acts|punitive laws]] designed to end self-government in Massachusetts.\n\nArmed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the [[Second Continental Congress]] [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the colonies as the United States. Led by General [[George Washington]], it won the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] with large support from France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty of 1783]] gave the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida) to the new nation. The [[Articles of Confederation]] established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] in 1787 wrote [[Constitution of the United States|a new Constitution]] that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was added to guarantee [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable rights]]. With Washington as the first president and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. [[Louisiana Purchase|Purchase]] of the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was [[War of 1812|fought in 1812]], which solidified national pride.\n\nEncouraged by the notion of [[manifest destiny]], U.S. territory expanded [[American frontier|all the way]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]]. While the United States was large in terms of area, by 1790 [[Demography of the United States|its population]] was only 4 million. It grew rapidly, however, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was even greater. Compared to European powers, though, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. [[American frontier|Westward expansion]] was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [[yeoman]] farmers and slave owners. The expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states [[Northern United States|north]] of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] by 1804, but the [[Southern United States|South]] continued to profit from the institution, mostly from the [[Cotton production in the United States|production of cotton]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was [[1860 United States presidential election|elected president in 1860]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery.\n\nSeven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Its [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack of Fort Sumter]] against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union forces]] there in 1861 started the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Defeat of the Confederates in 1865 led to the impoverishment of the South and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]]. In the [[Reconstruction era]] following the war, [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|legal and voting rights were extended]] to [[Freedman|freed slaves]]. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, it gained explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained their power in the South in 1877, often by [[paramilitary]] [[Voter suppression in the United States|suppression of voting]], they passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy]], as well as new [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] that prevented most [[African Americans]] and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] from voting. This continued until the gains of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s and the passage of federal legislation to enforce uniform constitutional rights for all citizens.\n\nThe United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century, due to an outburst of entrepreneurship and industrialization in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the arrival of [[European emigration|millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe]]. A national railroad network was completed and large-scale mines and factories were established. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency, and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], from the 1890s to 1920s. This era led to many reforms, including the Sixteenth to Nineteenth constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. Initially neutral during [[World War I]], the United States [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] in 1917 and funded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory the following year. Women obtained the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to vote]] in 1920, with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924.\n\nAfter [[Roaring Twenties|a prosperous decade]] in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ended the Republican dominance of the [[White House]] and implemented his [[New Deal]] programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]]. The New Deal defined [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States entered [[World War II]] and financed the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]. Its involvement culminated in using newly-invented [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities]] to defeat [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].\n\nThe United States and the [[Soviet Union]] emerged as rival superpowers in the [[aftermath of World War II]]. During the [[Cold War]], the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the [[arms race]], the [[Space Race]], [[proxy war]]s, and propaganda campaigns. The goal of the United States in this was to stop the spread of [[communism]]. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the [[civil rights movement]], another wave of social reforms was enacted which enforced the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only [[superpower]].\n\nAfter the Cold War, the United States's foreign policy has focused on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|modern conflicts in the Middle East]]. The beginning of the 21st century saw the [[September 11 attacks]] carried out by [[Al-Qaeda]] in 2001, which was later followed by wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2007, the United States entered its [[Great Recession in the United States|worst economic crisis since the Great Depression]], which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the early 2010s.

The prevailing theory proposes that people from [[Eurasia]] followed [[Game (hunting)|game]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas.

While the term technically refers to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage in 1492, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's initial landing.\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:North American cultural areas.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Cultural area]]s of [[pre-Columbian North America]], according to [[Alfred Kroeber]].]]\nBy 10,000 BCE, humans were relatively well-established throughout [[North America]]. Originally, Paleo-Indian hunted Ice Age [[megafauna]] like [[mammoth]]s, but as they began to go extinct, people turned instead to [[bison]] as a food source. As time went on, foraging for berries and seeds became an important alternative to hunting. Paleo-Indians in central Mexico were the first in the Americas to farm, starting to plant corn, beans, and squash around 8,000 BCE. Eventually, the knowledge began to spread northward. By 3,000 BCE, corn was being grown in the valleys of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], followed by primitive [[irrigation]] systems and early villages of the [[Hohokam]].<ref name=\":6\"/><ref name=\"mark\">Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos{{'}}'', Part I and II.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest cultures in the present-day United States was the [[Clovis culture]], who are primarily identified by the use of fluted [[spear]] points called the [[Clovis point]]. From 9,100 to 8,850 BCE, the culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The [[Folsom tradition|Folsom culture]] was similar, but is marked by the use of the [[Folsom point]].\n\nA later migration identified by linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists occurred around 8,000 BCE.

They are the earliest known people to have been [[Mound Builders|mound builders]], however, there are mounds in the United States that predate this culture. [[Watson Brake]] is an 11-mound complex in [[Louisiana]] that dates to 3,500 BCE, and nearby [[Poverty Point]], built by the [[Poverty Point culture]], is an earthwork complex that dates to 1,700 BCE. These mounds likely served a religious purpose.\n\nThe Adenans were absorbed into the [[Hopewell tradition]], a powerful people who traded tools and goods across a wide territory. They continued the Adena tradition of mound-building, with remnants of several thousand still in existence across the core of their former territory in southern [[Ohio]]. The Hopewell pioneered a trading system called the Hopewell Exchange System, which at its greatest extent ran from the present-day Southeast up to the Canadian side of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name=\":8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell|publisher=Ohio History Central}}</ref> By 500 CE, the Hopewellians had too disappeared, absorbed into the larger [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nThe Mississippians were a broad group of tribes. Their most important city was [[Cahokia]], near modern-day [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. At its peak in the 12th century, the city had an estimated population of 20,000, larger than the population of London at the time. The entire city was centered around a [[Monks Mound|mound]] that stood {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=}} tall.

[[New Netherland]] was established in 1621 by the company to capitalize on the [[North American fur trade]]. Growth was slow at first due to mismanagement by the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] and Native American conflicts. After the Dutch purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the Native Americans for a reported price of US$24, the land was named [[New Amsterdam]] and became the capital of [[New Netherland]]. The town rapidly expanded and in the mid 1600s it became an important trading center and port. Despite being [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and building the [[Reformed Church in America]], the Dutch were tolerant of other religions and cultures and traded with the [[Iroquois]] to the north.<ref name=\"questia.com\">Jaap Jacobs, ''The Colony of New Netherland: A Dutch Settlement in Seventeenth-Century America'' (2nd ed.

The colony was taken over by Britain in 1664 and its capital was renamed [[New York City]]. New Netherland left an enduring legacy on American cultural and political life of religious tolerance and sensible trade in urban areas and rural traditionalism in the countryside (typified by the story of [[Rip Van Winkle]]). Notable Americans of Dutch descent include [[Martin Van Buren]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Frelinghuysen family|Frelinghuysens]].<ref name=\"questia.com\"/>\n\n==== French and Spanish conflict ====\n[[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] landed in North Carolina in 1524, and was the first European to sail into [[New York Harbor]] and [[Narragansett Bay]]. A decade later, [[Jacques Cartier]] sailed in search of the Northwest Passage, but instead discovered the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and laid the foundation for [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonization]] of the Americas in [[New France]]. After the collapse of the first [[Charlesbourg-Royal|Quebec]] colony in the 1540s, French [[Huguenots]] settled at [[Fort Caroline]] near present-day [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] in Florida. In 1565, Spanish forces led by [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s|Pedro Men\u00e9ndez]] destroyed the settlement and established the first European settlement in what would become the United States \u2014 [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].\n\nAfter this, the French mostly remained in [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]], but far-reaching trade relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest spread their influence. French colonists in small villages along the Mississippi and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers lived in farming communities that served as a grain source for Gulf Coast settlements.

The first British colony in North America was established at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] by [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1585, but failed. It would be twenty years before another attempt.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe early British colonies were established by private groups seeking profit, and were marked by starvation, disease, and Native American attacks. Many immigrants were people seeking religious freedom or escaping political oppression, peasants displaced by the Industrial Revolution, or those simply seeking adventure and opportunity.\n\nIn some areas, Native Americans taught colonists how to plant and harvest the native crops. In others, they attacked the settlers. Virgin forests provided an ample supply of building material and firewood. Natural inlets and harbors lined the coast, providing easy ports for essential trade with Europe. Settlements remained close to the coast due to this as well as Native American resistance and the Appalachian Mountains that were found in the interior.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== The first settlement: Jamestown ====\n[[Image:Squantoteaching.png|thumb|200px|[[Squanto]] known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the ''Mayflower'' settlers, who made their settlement at the site of Squanto's former summer village.]]\n\nThe first successful English colony, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was established by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] in 1607 on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]]. The colonists were preoccupied with the search for gold and were ill-equipped for life in the New World. Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] held the fledgling Jamestown together in the first year, and the colony descended into anarchy and nearly failed when he returned to England two years later. [[John Rolfe]] began experimenting with tobacco from the West Indies in 1612, and by 1614 the first shipment arrived in London. It became Virginia's chief source of revenue within a decade.\n\nIn 1624, after years of disease and Indian attacks, including the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], [[James VI and I|King James I]] revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made Virginia a royal colony.\n\n==== New England ====\n[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts]]\n\n[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution. The [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] sailed for Virginia on the Mayflower in 1620, but were knocked off course by a storm and landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], where they agreed to a social contract of rules in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Like Jamestown, Plymouth suffered from disease and starvation, but local [[Wampanoag]] Indians taught the colonists how to farm maize.\n\nPlymouth was followed by the [[Puritans]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630. They maintained a charter for self-government separate from England, and elected founder [[John Winthrop]] as the governor for most of its early years. [[Roger Williams]] opposed Winthrop's treatment of Native Americans and religious intolerance, and established the colony of [[Providence Plantations]], later [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], on the basis of freedom of religion. Other colonists established settlements in the [[Connecticut River]] Valley, and on the coasts of present-day [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Native American attacks continued, with the most significant occurring in the 1637 [[Pequot War]] and the 1675 [[King Philip's War]].\n\nNew England became a center of commerce and industry due to the poor, mountainous soil making agriculture difficult. Rivers were harnessed to power grain mills and sawmills, and the numerous harbors facilitated trade. Tight-knit villages developed around these industrial centers, and [[Boston]] became one of America's most important ports.\n\n==== Middle Colonies ====\n[[File:Indians_at_a_Hudson_Bay_Company_trading_post.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Indians trade 90-lb packs of furs at a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the 1660s, the [[Middle Colonies]] of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]] were established in the former Dutch New Netherland, and were characterized by a large degree of ethnic and religious diversity. At the same time, the [[Iroquois]] of New York, strengthened by years of fur trading with Europeans, formed the powerful Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe last colony in this region was [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], established in 1681 by [[William Penn]] as a home for religious dissenters, including [[Quakers]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[Amish]].<ref name=\":9\" /> The capital of colony, [[Philadelphia]], became a dominant commercial center in a few short years, with busy docks and brick houses. While Quakers populated the city, [[German Americans|German]] immigrants began to flood into the Pennsylvanian hills and forests, while the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] pushed into the far western frontier.\n\n==== Southern Colonies ====\nThe extremely rural [[Southern Colonies]] contrasted greatly with the north. Outside of Virginia, the first British colony south of New England was [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], established as a Catholic haven in 1632. The economy of these two colonies was built entirely on [[yeoman]] farmers and planters. The planters established themselves in the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] region of Virginia, establishing massive [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] with slave labor, while the small-scale farmers made their way into political office.\n\nIn 1670, the [[Province of Carolina]] was established, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] became the region's great trading port. While Virginia's economy was based on tobacco, Carolina was much more diversified, exporting rice, indigo, and lumber as well. In 1712 the colony was split in half, creating [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. The [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]]&nbsp;\u2013 the last of the Thirteen Colonies&nbsp;\u2013 was established by [[James Oglethorpe]] in 1732 as a border to Spanish Florida and a reform colony for former prisoners and the poor.<ref name=\":9\">Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\u201d>\n1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622.

American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted new believers with an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the late 1790s.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref> In the early stages, evangelicals in the South, such as [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.\n\n==== Government ====\nEach of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote on taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\">{{cite book |author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA185|origyear=1948|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185\u201390|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>\n\n==== Servitude and slavery ====\nOver half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America|last=Barker|first=Deanna|publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|archivedate=October 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Few could afford the cost of the journey to America, and so this form of unfree labor provided a means to immigrate. Typically, people would sign a contract agreeing to a set term of labor, usually four to seven years, and in return would receive transport to America and a piece of land at the end of their servitude. In some cases, ships' captains received rewards for the delivery of poor migrants, and so extravagant promises and kidnapping were common. The Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company also utilized indentured servant labor.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe first [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to Virginia from the British West Indies in 1619, just twelve years after the founding of Jamestown. Initially regarded as indentured servants who could buy their freedom, the institution of slavery began to harden and the involuntary servitude became lifelong as the demand for labor on tobacco and rice plantations grew in the 1660s. Slavery became identified with brown skin color, at the time seen as a \"[[black race]]\", and the children of slave women were born slaves (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). By the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population.\n\nThe question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London, however, continued to regard the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country in a policy known as [[mercantilism]].<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\" />\n\nColonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that utilized forms of [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]], such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]].The British colonies were also marked by a policy of avoiding strict enforcement of parliamentary laws, known as [[salutary neglect]].

A unique class system operated in [[upstate New York]], where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family]]. The other colonies were more egalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited respect for its small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' in 1756 summed it up:\n<blockquote>The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level.

In the following years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies, without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have the right to tax Americans who were not represented in it?

His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.\n\nAs a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.<ref name=\"NEH EDSITEMENT\">Lesson Plan on \"What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?\" [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]</ref>\n\n=== Loyalists and Britain ===\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819)]]\nThe Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.

A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.\n\nTo assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).<ref>Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008)</ref>\n\n===President George Washington===\n\n[[File:Stuart-george-washington-constable-1797.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Washington]] legacy remains among the two or three greatest in American history, as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.]]\n[[File:Farewelladdresses 01 various 128kb.ogg|thumb|Reading of the [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell address]] of President George Washington, 1796]]\n\n[[George Washington]]&nbsp;\u2013 a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]&nbsp;\u2013 became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789.

The former Jeffersonian (Democratic-Republican) party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:\n<blockquote>Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party, and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.\n\nBehind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:\n\n[[File:Clay44b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Horace Greeley]]'s ''New York Tribune''\u2014the leading Whig paper\u2014endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844.]]\n<blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics.&nbsp;... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287\u201388</ref><ref>Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1\u20134</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Walters, rejected [[William_Lloyd_Garrison|Garrison's]] theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.<ref>{{cite book |author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W.

Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states\".

A small number of active Northerners were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin (in terms of Protestant theology) and demanded its immediate abolition. Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".<ref>Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)</ref> Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments. Defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and killing economic impact in the South where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy. They also argued that if all the slaves were freed, there would be widespread unemployment and chaos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/27f.asp|title=The Southern Argument for Slavery [ushistory.org]|last=ushistory.org|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=June 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nReligious activists split on slavery, with the [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]] dividing into northern and southern denominations.

Abolitionists pounced on the Act to attack slavery, as in the best-selling anti-slavery [[novel]] ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].<ref>Fergus M. Bordewich, ''America's Great Debate: Henry Clay, Stephen A. Douglas, and the Compromise That Preserved the Union'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe [[Compromise of 1820]] was repealed in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of \"[[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]]\" and democracy. It permitted voters to decide on the legality of slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to adopt neutrality on the issue of slavery. Anti-slavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Pro- and anti- contingents rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a miniature civil war called [[Bleeding Kansas]]. By the late 1850s, the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college. It insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand (and thus would slowly die out).<ref>Nicole Etcheson, ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006)</ref>\n\n=== The plantation economy ===\nThe Southern slavery-based societies had become wealthy based on their [[cotton]] and other agricultural [[commodity]] production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including [[textile mills]]. By 1860, there were four million slaves in [[Southern United States|the South]], nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in 1790. The [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining [[tobacco]] regions).\n\n[[File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png|right|thumb|300px|The United States, immediately before the Civil War.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.\n\n=== Lincoln and secession ===\nAfter [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states [[Secession|seceded]] from the union and set up a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]] (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861. It attacked [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) \"[[slave and free states|slave states]]\" did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.\n\nDuring the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)</ref> West Virginia is usually associated with the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|American Civil War}}\nThe Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when elements of 100,000 [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.<ref>Allen C. Guelzo, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=313dh9YAiE4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction]'' (2012) ch 3\u20134</ref>\n\n[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Lincoln with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]\nThe war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.<ref>Stephen E. Woodworth, ''Decision in the Heartland: The Civil War in the West'' (2011)</ref>\n\nWarfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)</ref> Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861\u201362 on raising and training new armies.  The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention.\n\nLee's smaller army won at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]]. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause [[war-weariness]] in the North. In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1\u20133, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.<ref>On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, \"To Conquer a Peace?\" ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26\u201333, online at EBSCO\n</ref>  On the homefront,  industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories.  Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates).  The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton.  The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than a handful of runs.\n\n[[File:Gettysburg by Britton.ogg|left|thumb|Modern recording of [[Gettysburg Address]] originally spoken by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Kurz and Allison - Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864.]]\nIn the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies.  In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864.  Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties.  Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion.  Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies.  In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenish casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses,  launched a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|besieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency.\n\nThe American Civil War was the world's earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial war]].

In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Allen C.

President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress; he was impeached, but the Senate's attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.<ref name=\"George C. Rable 2007\">George C.

In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. [[Paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s.

Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting.

Roosevelt]] promised \"a [[New Deal]] for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established [[modern liberalism in the United States]] and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the [[New Deal Coalition]] of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners.  It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and for young men, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935\u201336, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937\u201338; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.<ref>David M.

[[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 but no military personnel.<ref>Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648\u201382</ref> This was carried out through the [[Lend-Lease]] agreements. Japan tried to neutralize America's power in the Pacific by [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, which catalyzed American support to enter the war.<ref>Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' (1982)</ref>\n\nThe main contributions of the U.S. to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and (especially 1944\u201345), military personnel. Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high-efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt Pearl Harbor.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Infamy speech|President Roosevelt's [[Infamy Speech]] in aftermath of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]].

People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence that it was only \"for the duration\", and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline were tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression.<ref>Harold G.

The Allies saw Germany as the main threat and gave the highest priority to Europe. The U.S. dominated the war against Japan and stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific in 1942. After losing Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines to the Japanese, and drawing the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] (May 1942), the American Navy inflicted a decisive blow at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] (June 1942). American ground forces assisted in the [[North African Campaign]] that eventually concluded with the collapse of Mussolini's fascist government in 1943, as Italy switched to the Allied side. A more significant European front was opened on [[D-Day]], June 6, 1944, in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France from Britain.\n\nOn the [[United States home front during World War II|home front]], mobilization of the U.S. economy was managed by Roosevelt's [[War Production Board]].
