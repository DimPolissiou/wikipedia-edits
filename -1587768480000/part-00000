Rodgers was also a founder of one of America's oldest and largest black presses, [[Third World Press]]. She got her start in the literary circuit as a young woman studying under [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning poet [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] in the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of Chicago.\n\nLater, Rodgers began writing her own works, which grappled with black identity and culture in the late 1960s. Rodgers was a leading voice of the [[Black Arts Movement]] (BAM) and the author of nine books, including ''How I got Ovah'' (1975). She was also an essayist and critic, and her work has been described as delivered in a language rooted in a black female perspective<ref>Shadduck, Lani, [http://www.huliq.com/9502/92676/funeral-held-chicago-poet-founding-black-press \"Funeral Held For Chicago Poet Founding Black Press\"], ''Huliq'', April 14, 2010.</ref> that wove strands of [[feminism]], [[black power]], [[spirituality]], and self-consciousness into a sometimes raging, sometimes ruminative search for identity. She also wrote deeply on the subject of mother/daughter relationships, particularly focusing on feminist, matriarchal issues.\n\n==Life and work==\nBorn in the [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]] neighborhood in the South Side of [[Chicago, Illinois]], Rodgers was encouraged from a young age to pursue music, and learned to play guitar and composed music for much of her life. She kept a journal throughout adolescence in which she explored poetry, but did not take writing seriously until she began college. Rodgers first attended college at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1960, but transferred in 1961 to Chicago's [[Roosevelt University]], where she earned her BA degree in 1965. She later earned an MA in English from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1980. Rodgers is most well known for her writing contributions to the [[Black Arts Movement]] (BAM). Rodgers first became involved in writing during that period while attending Writers Workshops by the [[Organization of Black American Culture]] (OBAC), of which she was an active member from 1967 to 1971.<ref>[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], \"Carolyn Rodgers\", ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', 1992, pp. 544\u201346.</ref> The organization sought to promote city involvement and inclusion of the arts in the city of Chicago, which Rodgers was eager to participate in.\n\nShe became distinctive as a new black woman poet in the 1960s with the publication of her first two books, ''Paper Soul'' and ''Songs of a Blackbird'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 1969). Following the national success of ''Paper Soul'', Rodgers was awarded the first Conrad Kent Rivers Memorial Fund Award. Rodgers also won the Poet Laureate Award from the Society of Midland Authors in 1970. She then went on to receive an award from the [[National Endowment of the Arts]], following the publication of ''Songs of a Blackbird''. In 1980, Rodgers won the Carnegie Writer's Grant. She won the Television Gospel Tribute in 1982 and the PEN Grant in 1987.\n\nIn 2009, Rodgers was inducted into the International Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent at the Gwendolyn Brooks Center for Black Literature and Creative Writing.  In 2012, Rodgers was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/carolyn-rodgers |title=Carolyn Rodgers |date=2012 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Poetry and poetics==\n;Early work\nRodgers's poetry is recognizable for its themes, which included identity, religion, and revolution, and her own use of [[free verse]] street slang and concern with feminine issues. In her early days, black revolutionary themes and \"cuss words\" wove through some poems.\n\nShe used slang and heartfelt language to write about love, lust, body image, family, religion, and the grace of human kindness. In her earliest writings such as ''Paper Soul'' (1968) and ''Songs of a Blackbird'' (1969), her revolutionary ideas about women's roles conflicted with the more traditional ideas of the African-American culture. She was criticized for her use of profanity, which male leaders of BAM found inappropriate for a woman.\n\n[[Haki R. Madhubuti]], chair, publisher and fellow founder of Third World Press, told the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' that: \"She would take no quarter from insults, or downgrading her writing as a woman ... Her writing could stand by itself.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/2155306,CST-NWS-xrodg13.article |title=\"CAROLYN M. RODGERS: 'Great poet' born of '60s\". |access-date=2010-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418194447/http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/2155306,CST-NWS-xrodg13.article |archive-date=2010-04-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSo while Rodgers's ''Songs of a Blackbird'' includes themes about survival, mother-daughter conflicts, and street life, it also criticizes those who dishonor her use of profanity. In her poem \"The Last M.F.\" she fights back:\n\n<blockquote>\nthey say,<br />\nthat I should not use the word<br />\nmothafucka anymo<br />\nin my poetry or in any speech I give.<br />\nthey say,<br />\nthat I must and can only say it to myself<br />\nas the new Black Womanhood suggests<br />\na softer self<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn \"The Last M.F.\" Rodgers says she will stop using profanity but continues using the \"menacing word\" at least 11 times throughout the poem, blatantly making jabs at men and their ideas of how a woman should speak and behave. Here too, Rodgers mocks the new Black Womanhood which she believes, paradoxically, promotes women to be silent.\n\n;Later work\n\nRodgers was a revolutionary influence during the Civil Rights Movement for the black community and oppressed women. She was not afraid to stand up and fight for herself and her people, and she welcomed controversy:\n\n<blockquote>\nlet uh revolution come<br />\nstate of peace is not known to me<br />\nanyway\n</blockquote>\n\nHer poetry centered on declaring what black people needed to do to overcome their low status in society. She also elocuted that women not stand for the poor treatment they received from men, black or white.\n\nOther volumes of work such as ''The Heart as Ever Green'' (1978) and ''How I Got Ovah'' (1975) also reflect on feminine issues such as female identity, women's roles in society, and the relationships between mothers and daughters. However, ''How I Got Ovah'' exhibits a more crafted tendency than previous books, along with being more autobiographical and transformative. Personal voice pervades the poems of ''How I Got Ovah''.<ref name=McElroy>{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Hilda|title=About Carolyn Rodgers|url=//www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rodgers/about.html|publisher=Modern American Poetry|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Rodgers develops the individual tone so well that the reader experiences a kinship with the poet and her subject matter (McElroy). The poem \"how i got ovah\" (from which the book receives its title) serves as an example of this deep personal voice. Rodgers begins an intimate revealing of personal survival with the opening lines:\n\n<blockquote>\ni can tell you<br />\nabout them<br />\ni have shaken rivers<br />\nout of my eyes.<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nRodgers carries the reader through experiences of crossing rivers while \"eyelash deep,\" picturing the engulfing of ideas and socially accepted expectations of her as a black woman. She encounters ancestors through nature with their \"rich dark root fingers,\" showing appreciation for her heritage. At the end of the poem, she has found secret strength through staying afloat:\n\n<blockquote>\nthough i shivered<br />\nwas wet with cold<br />\nand wanted to sink down<br />\nand float as water, yea--<br />\ni can tell you.<br />\ni have shaken rivers<br />\nout of my eyes.<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nEstella M. Sales concludes that, in this poem, Rodgers \"comes to recognize ... her own inner voice, her ancestral rootedness, her Christian faith, and her parental support\".<ref name=Sales>{{cite web|last=Sales|first=Estella|title=About Carolyn Rodgers|url=//www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rodgers/about.html|publisher=Modern American Poetry|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> She finds a way to \"bridg[e] the separating waters\" and \"reconcile ... contradictions\" in the \"seemingly dichotomous entities of black life.\"\n\nBy the 1970s, Rodgers was distilling her language and militant persona into poetry that was deeply concerned with religion, God, and the quest for inner beauty. The change from militant views to more religious views can be seen in her 1975 poem \"and when the revolution came.\" The repetition in the first four verses show a constancy in the black church communities:\n\n<blockquote>\nand they just kept on going to church<br />\ngittin on they knees and praying<br />\nand tithing and building and buying<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe implied criticism here is that while the militants were busy telling other black people how they should live to improve their lives, the black church communities were busy making black communities better. In stanzas 1\u20135, Rodgers notes that the militants try to change the hair styles, the dress, any association with whites, the food eaten by blacks, and what the militants termed \"white man's religion\", According to Friedrike Kaufel, these changes \"are petty ones\".<ref name=Kaufel>{{cite web|last=Kaufel|first=Friederike|title=On \"when the revolution came\"|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rodgers/revolution.html|publisher=Modern American Poetry|accessdate= November 11, 2012}}</ref>  These changes were quietly and passively resisted by the church members, who continued \"going to church\" and \"tithing and building and praying\" Stanzas 6\u20138 show the militants wanting to build new institutions for black children, and realizing that while the militants were only using words, in the form of orders, to make changes, the churches were actually making needed changes in black neighborhoods. Rodgers shows further implicates the oppressive actions of the militants, and celebrates the communal sanctity of the black church in Stanza 8:\n\n<blockquote>\nand the church folks said, yeah.<br />\nwe been waiting fo you militants<br />\nto realize that the church is an eternal rock<br />\nnow why don't you militants jest come on in<br />\nwe been waitin for you<br />\nwe can show you how to build<br />\nanything that needs building<br />\nand while we're on our knees, at that.<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn these actions, the church members have long before reached the state of solidarity among themselves that the militants finally call for in Stanza 6.<ref name=Kaufel />\n\nAnother example of Rodgers's turn to more personal and religious matters is her poem \"mama's God\":<ref>\"mama's God\", in Cary Nelson (ed.), ''Anthology of Modern American Poetry''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n:mama's God never was no white man.\nher My Jesus, Sweet Jesus never was neither.<br />\n::the color they had was the color of\nher aches and trials, the tribulations of her heart<br />\n:mama never had no savior that would turn\n::his back on her because she was black\n:::when mama prayed, she knew who she\n::was praying to and who she was praying to\n:::didn't and ain't got\n::::no color.\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\nHere Rodgers points once again to the underlying foundation to which African Americans had been clinging even before the Black Arts Movement. By using her mother as the major reference point, the poet establishes these ideas as coming before the militants. Just as the church-goers had already been calling each other brother and sister according to a higher authority, Rodgers perceives an authority to which she can appeal who \"ain't got no color\". She renders powerless the restrictions placed on her by the color of her skin.\n\nIf this cannot be characterized as transformative, nonetheless her work seems to have shifted from a collective black perspective in her early work to an individual one<ref name=ny/> in her later writings. Consequently, by the time she publishes ''The Heart as Ever Green'' in 1978, Rodgers is incorporating earlier themes of feminism and human dignity in her poems, along with newer or more pronounced themes of love and Christianity. Some readers and cultural observers do not recognize a break or rupture from Rodgers's past in her later work. For them, Rodgers's spiritual progress in her poetry still brings a radical infusion. Even in her later poetry, we can still break open into a vision uniquely situated in a poetics that remains strident, militant and experimental.\n\n==Fiction and literary criticism==\nRodgers earned an appreciative and crucial audience through her fiction and literary criticism. Her short stories, which are often overlooked, ultimately suggest themes of survival and adaptability, and are directed to a predominately black audience. Rodgers was successful in providing contemporary black readers with solace and encouragement to persist through her use of well-crafted language. Marsha C. Vick points out some of the reasons why Rodger's fiction was so influential at the time of publication, particularly focusing on her aesthetic appeal:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe same insight and searching analysis that distinguish her poetry are integral to Rodgers's short fiction and her literary criticism. She portrays in her short fiction the ordinary and overlooked people in everyday African American life and emphasizes the theme of survival. Many consider her critical essay \"Black Poetry\u2014Where It's At\" (1969) to be the best essay on the work of the \"new black poets\". In it, she aesthetically evaluates contemporary African American poetry and sets up preliminary criteria of appraisal.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/carolyn-m-rodgers Carolyn M. Rodgers: Information from Answers.com]</ref> </blockquote>\n\nAccording to poet [[Lorenzo Thomas (poet)|Lorenzo Thomas]], Carolyn Rodgers proposed new [[prosodic]] categories specific to black poetry. Thomas points out that this kind of essay (or [[manifesto]]) outlining a vision statement to spur militant and creative inquiry (but most particularly \"Black Poetry\u2014Where It's At\") was widely disseminated and discussed among poets of that time.<ref>Thomas, Lorenzo. ''Extraordinary Measures: Afrocentric Modernism and Twentieth-Century American Poetry.'' Tuscaloosa and London: The University of Alabama Press, 2000. p. 211.</ref> Thomas then goes on to point out that: \"Her [Rodgers's] ideas were based on what Jerry W. Ward, Jr., has called \"culturally anchored SPEECH ACTS and Reader/Hearer Response.\" Her position on not only African-Americans' rights, but women's rights, was clear in the content and language in her poems. \"She's demonstrably feminine because she's sexy,\"<ref name=Gender>From ''Gender and The Poetics of Excess: Moments of Brocade''. Copyright \u00a9 1997 by the University Press of Mississippi.</ref> and her lines in \"The Last M.F.\" show this:\n\n<blockquote>\ni say,<br />\nthat i am soft, and you can subpoena my man, put him<br /> \non trial, and he will testify that i am<br /> \nsoft in the right places at the right times<br />\nand often we are so reserved, i have nothing to say.<ref name=Gender />\n</blockquote>\n\nDespite recognition for her efforts in the Black Arts Movement, Rodgers' unconventional use of language, especially for a woman, was frowned upon by some of her readers, most notably men. Her consistent use of profanity wasn't seen as \"ladylike\". Also, she urged her fellow black women to be strong and state clearly what they wanted. She prompted them not to acquiesce to the demands and expectations of white people, but just as important, she made it clear that black women should not be submissive to men in general; \"she registers her scorn for black men who censor women.\"<ref name=Gender />\n\n==Sidelights==\n*In addition to writing poetry, Rodgers wrote numerous short stories. Her play ''Love'' was produced Off-Broadway by [[Woodie King Jr.]], a father of the Black Theatre movement.\n*Rodgers had a career as a teacher and educator, and taught at [[Columbia College Chicago]], [[University of Washington]], Malcolm X Community College, [[Albany State University|Albany State College]], and [[Indiana University]].\n*Rodgers was a member of the [[Organization of Black American Culture]] (OBAC), which promotes cultural activity of the arts.\n*Rodgers also owned her own publishing firm, Eden Press.\n*Rodgers was deeply influenced by [[Hoyt Fuller]], the founder of Chicago's OBAC, after meeting him while working as a social worker at the YMCA (1963\u201369).  \n*Rodgers worked as a book critic for the ''Chicago Daily News'' and as a columnist for the ''Milwaukee Courier'' \n*In December 1967, Carolyn Rodgers met with Haki R. Madhubuti and Johari Amini in the basement of a South Side apartment to found Third World Press, an outlet for [[African-American literature]]. By 2007, the company continues to thrive in a multimillion-dollar facility. Over the years, Rodgers would publish works for friend and Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author Gwendolyn Brooks, as well as [[Sonia Sanchez]], [[Sterling Plumpp]] and [[Pearl Cleage]].

Rodgers was also a founder of one of America's oldest and largest black presses, [[Third World Press]]. She got her start in the literary circuit as a young woman studying under [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning poet [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] in the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of Chicago.\n\nLater, Rodgers began writing her own works, which grappled with black identity and culture in the late 1960s. Rodgers was a leading voice of the [[Black Arts Movement]] (BAM) and the author of nine books, including ''How I got Ovah'' (1975). She was also an essayist and critic, and her work has been described as delivered in a language rooted in a black female perspective<ref>Shadduck, Lani, [http://www.huliq.com/9502/92676/funeral-held-chicago-poet-founding-black-press \"Funeral Held For Chicago Poet Founding Black Press\"], ''Huliq'', April 14, 2010.</ref> that wove strands of [[feminism]], [[black power]], [[spirituality]], and self-consciousness into a sometimes raging, sometimes ruminative search for identity. She also wrote deeply on the subject of mother/daughter relationships, particularly focusing on feminist, matriarchal issues.\n\n==Life and work==\nBorn in the [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]] neighborhood in the South Side of [[Chicago, Illinois]], Rodgers was encouraged from a young age to pursue music, and learned to play guitar and composed music for much of her life. She kept a journal throughout adolescence in which she explored poetry, but did not take writing seriously until she began college. Rodgers first attended college at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1960, but transferred in 1961 to Chicago's [[Roosevelt University]], where she earned her BA degree in 1965. She later earned a MA in English from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1980. Rodgers is most well known for her writing contributions to the [[Black Arts Movement]] (BAM). Rodgers first became involved in writing during that period while attending Writers Workshops by the [[Organization of Black American Culture]] (OBAC), of which she was an active member from 1967 to 1971.<ref>[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], \"Carolyn Rodgers\", ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', 1992, pp. 544\u201346.</ref> The organization sought to promote city involvement and inclusion of the arts in the city of Chicago, which Rodgers was eager to participate in.\n\nShe became distinctive as a new black woman poet in the 1960s with the publication of her first two books, ''Paper Soul'' and ''Songs of a Blackbird'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 1969). Following the national success of ''Paper Soul'', Rodgers was awarded the first Conrad Kent Rivers Memorial Fund Award. Rodgers also won the Poet Laureate Award from the Society of Midland Authors in 1970. She then went on to receive an award from the [[National Endowment of the Arts]], following the publication of ''Songs of a Blackbird''. In 1980, Rodgers won the Carnegie Writer's Grant. She won the Television Gospel Tribute in 1982 and the PEN Grant in 1987.\n\nIn 2009, Rodgers was inducted into the International Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent at the Gwendolyn Brooks Center for Black Literature and Creative Writing.  In 2012, Rodgers was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/carolyn-rodgers |title=Carolyn Rodgers |date=2012 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Poetry and poetics==\n;Early work\nRodgers's poetry is recognizable for its themes, which included identity, religion, and revolution, and her own use of [[free verse]] street slang and concern with feminine issues. In her early days, black revolutionary themes and \"cuss words\" wove through some poems.\n\nShe used slang and heartfelt language to write about love, lust, body image, family, religion, and the grace of human kindness. In her earliest writings such as ''Paper Soul'' (1968) and ''Songs of a Blackbird'' (1969), her revolutionary ideas about women's roles conflicted with the more traditional ideas of the African-American culture. She was criticized for her use of profanity, which male leaders of BAM found inappropriate for a woman.\n\n[[Haki R. Madhubuti]], chair, publisher and fellow founder of Third World Press, told the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' that: \"She would take no quarter from insults, or downgrading her writing as a woman ... Her writing could stand by itself.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/2155306,CST-NWS-xrodg13.article |title=\"CAROLYN M. RODGERS: 'Great poet' born of '60s\". |access-date=2010-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418194447/http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/2155306,CST-NWS-xrodg13.article |archive-date=2010-04-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSo while Rodgers's ''Songs of a Blackbird'' includes themes about survival, mother-daughter conflicts, and street life, it also criticizes those who dishonor her use of profanity. In her poem \"The Last M.F.\" she fights back:\n\n<blockquote>\nthey say,<br />\nthat I should not use the word<br />\nmothafucka anymo<br />\nin my poetry or in any speech I give.<br />\nthey say,<br />\nthat I must and can only say it to myself<br />\nas the new Black Womanhood suggests<br />\na softer self<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn \"The Last M.F.\" Rodgers says she will stop using profanity but continues using the \"menacing word\" at least 11 times throughout the poem, blatantly making jabs at men and their ideas of how a woman should speak and behave. Here too, Rodgers mocks the new Black Womanhood which she believes, paradoxically, promotes women to be silent.\n\n;Later work\n\nRodgers was a revolutionary influence during the Civil Rights Movement for the black community and oppressed women. She was not afraid to stand up and fight for herself and her people, and she welcomed controversy:\n\n<blockquote>\nlet uh revolution come<br />\nstate of peace is not known to me<br />\nanyway\n</blockquote>\n\nHer poetry centered on declaring what black people needed to do to overcome their low status in society. She also elocuted that women not stand for the poor treatment they received from men, black or white.\n\nOther volumes of work such as ''The Heart as Ever Green'' (1978) and ''How I Got Ovah'' (1975) also reflect on feminine issues such as female identity, women's roles in society, and the relationships between mothers and daughters. However, ''How I Got Ovah'' exhibits a more crafted tendency than previous books, along with being more autobiographical and transformative. Personal voice pervades the poems of ''How I Got Ovah''.<ref name=McElroy>{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Hilda|title=About Carolyn Rodgers|url=//www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rodgers/about.html|publisher=Modern American Poetry|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Rodgers develops the individual tone so well that the reader experiences a kinship with the poet and her subject matter (McElroy). The poem \"how i got ovah\" (from which the book receives its title) serves as an example of this deep personal voice. Rodgers begins an intimate revealing of personal survival with the opening lines:\n\n<blockquote>\ni can tell you<br />\nabout them<br />\ni have shaken rivers<br />\nout of my eyes.<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nRodgers carries the reader through experiences of crossing rivers while \"eyelash deep,\" picturing the engulfing of ideas and socially accepted expectations of her as a black woman. She encounters ancestors through nature with their \"rich dark root fingers,\" showing appreciation for her heritage. At the end of the poem, she has found secret strength through staying afloat:\n\n<blockquote>\nthough i shivered<br />\nwas wet with cold<br />\nand wanted to sink down<br />\nand float as water, yea--<br />\ni can tell you.<br />\ni have shaken rivers<br />\nout of my eyes.<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nEstella M. Sales concludes that, in this poem, Rodgers \"comes to recognize ... her own inner voice, her ancestral rootedness, her Christian faith, and her parental support\".<ref name=Sales>{{cite web|last=Sales|first=Estella|title=About Carolyn Rodgers|url=//www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rodgers/about.html|publisher=Modern American Poetry|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> She finds a way to \"bridg[e] the separating waters\" and \"reconcile ... contradictions\" in the \"seemingly dichotomous entities of black life.\"\n\nBy the 1970s, Rodgers was distilling her language and militant persona into poetry that was deeply concerned with religion, God, and the quest for inner beauty. The change from militant views to more religious views can be seen in her 1975 poem \"and when the revolution came.\" The repetition in the first four verses show a constancy in the black church communities:\n\n<blockquote>\nand they just kept on going to church<br />\ngittin on they knees and praying<br />\nand tithing and building and buying<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe implied criticism here is that while the militants were busy telling other black people how they should live to improve their lives, the black church communities were busy making black communities better. In stanzas 1\u20135, Rodgers notes that the militants try to change the hair styles, the dress, any association with whites, the food eaten by blacks, and what the militants termed \"white man's religion\", According to Friedrike Kaufel, these changes \"are petty ones\".<ref name=Kaufel>{{cite web|last=Kaufel|first=Friederike|title=On \"when the revolution came\"|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rodgers/revolution.html|publisher=Modern American Poetry|accessdate= November 11, 2012}}</ref>  These changes were quietly and passively resisted by the church members, who continued \"going to church\" and \"tithing and building and praying\" Stanzas 6\u20138 show the militants wanting to build new institutions for black children, and realizing that while the militants were only using words, in the form of orders, to make changes, the churches were actually making needed changes in black neighborhoods. Rodgers shows further implicates the oppressive actions of the militants, and celebrates the communal sanctity of the black church in Stanza 8:\n\n<blockquote>\nand the church folks said, yeah.<br />\nwe been waiting fo you militants<br />\nto realize that the church is an eternal rock<br />\nnow why don't you militants jest come on in<br />\nwe been waitin for you<br />\nwe can show you how to build<br />\nanything that needs building<br />\nand while we're on our knees, at that.<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn these actions, the church members have long before reached the state of solidarity among themselves that the militants finally call for in Stanza 6.<ref name=Kaufel />\n\nAnother example of Rodgers's turn to more personal and religious matters is her poem \"mama's God\":<ref>\"mama's God\", in Cary Nelson (ed.), ''Anthology of Modern American Poetry''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n:mama's God never was no white man.\nher My Jesus, Sweet Jesus never was neither.<br />\n::the color they had was the color of\nher aches and trials, the tribulations of her heart<br />\n:mama never had no savior that would turn\n::his back on her because she was black\n:::when mama prayed, she knew who she\n::was praying to and who she was praying to\n:::didn't and ain't got\n::::no color.\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\nHere Rodgers points once again to the underlying foundation to which African Americans had been clinging even before the Black Arts Movement. By using her mother as the major reference point, the poet establishes these ideas as coming before the militants. Just as the church-goers had already been calling each other brother and sister according to a higher authority, Rodgers perceives an authority to which she can appeal who \"ain't got no color\". She renders powerless the restrictions placed on her by the color of her skin.\n\nIf this cannot be characterized as transformative, nonetheless her work seems to have shifted from a collective black perspective in her early work to an individual one<ref name=ny/> in her later writings. Consequently, by the time she publishes ''The Heart as Ever Green'' in 1978, Rodgers is incorporating earlier themes of feminism and human dignity in her poems, along with newer or more pronounced themes of love and Christianity. Some readers and cultural observers do not recognize a break or rupture from Rodgers's past in her later work. For them, Rodgers's spiritual progress in her poetry still brings a radical infusion. Even in her later poetry, we can still break open into a vision uniquely situated in a poetics that remains strident, militant and experimental.\n\n==Fiction and literary criticism==\nRodgers earned an appreciative and crucial audience through her fiction and literary criticism. Her short stories, which are often overlooked, ultimately suggest themes of survival and adaptability, and are directed to a predominately black audience. Rodgers was successful in providing contemporary black readers with solace and encouragement to persist through her use of well-crafted language. Marsha C. Vick points out some of the reasons why Rodger's fiction was so influential at the time of publication, particularly focusing on her aesthetic appeal:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe same insight and searching analysis that distinguish her poetry are integral to Rodgers's short fiction and her literary criticism. She portrays in her short fiction the ordinary and overlooked people in everyday African American life and emphasizes the theme of survival. Many consider her critical essay \"Black Poetry\u2014Where It's At\" (1969) to be the best essay on the work of the \"new black poets\". In it, she aesthetically evaluates contemporary African American poetry and sets up preliminary criteria of appraisal.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/carolyn-m-rodgers Carolyn M. Rodgers: Information from Answers.com]</ref> </blockquote>\n\nAccording to poet [[Lorenzo Thomas (poet)|Lorenzo Thomas]], Carolyn Rodgers proposed new [[prosodic]] categories specific to black poetry. Thomas points out that this kind of essay (or [[manifesto]]) outlining a vision statement to spur militant and creative inquiry (but most particularly \"Black Poetry\u2014Where It's At\") was widely disseminated and discussed among poets of that time.<ref>Thomas, Lorenzo. ''Extraordinary Measures: Afrocentric Modernism and Twentieth-Century American Poetry.'' Tuscaloosa and London: The University of Alabama Press, 2000. p. 211.</ref> Thomas then goes on to point out that: \"Her [Rodgers's] ideas were based on what Jerry W. Ward, Jr., has called \"culturally anchored SPEECH ACTS and Reader/Hearer Response.\" Her position on not only African-Americans' rights, but women's rights, was clear in the content and language in her poems. \"She's demonstrably feminine because she's sexy,\"<ref name=Gender>From ''Gender and The Poetics of Excess: Moments of Brocade''. Copyright \u00a9 1997 by the University Press of Mississippi.</ref> and her lines in \"The Last M.F.\" show this:\n\n<blockquote>\ni say,<br />\nthat i am soft, and you can subpoena my man, put him<br /> \non trial, and he will testify that i am<br /> \nsoft in the right places at the right times<br />\nand often we are so reserved, i have nothing to say.<ref name=Gender />\n</blockquote>\n\nDespite recognition for her efforts in the Black Arts Movement, Rodgers' unconventional use of language, especially for a woman, was frowned upon by some of her readers, most notably men. Her consistent use of profanity wasn't seen as \"ladylike\". Also, she urged her fellow black women to be strong and state clearly what they wanted. She prompted them not to acquiesce to the demands and expectations of white people, but just as important, she made it clear that black women should not be submissive to men in general; \"she registers her scorn for black men who censor women.\"<ref name=Gender />\n\n==Sidelights==\n*In addition to writing poetry, Rodgers wrote numerous short stories. Her play ''Love'' was produced Off-Broadway by [[Woodie King Jr.]], a father of the Black Theatre movement.\n*Rodgers had a career as a teacher and educator, and taught at [[Columbia College Chicago]], [[University of Washington]], Malcolm X Community College, [[Albany State University|Albany State College]], and [[Indiana University]].\n*Rodgers was a member of the [[Organization of Black American Culture]] (OBAC), which promotes cultural activity of the arts.\n*Rodgers also owned her own publishing firm, Eden Press.\n*Rodgers was deeply influenced by [[Hoyt Fuller]], the founder of Chicago's OBAC, after meeting him while working as a social worker at the YMCA (1963\u201369).  \n*Rodgers worked as a book critic for the ''Chicago Daily News'' and as a columnist for the ''Milwaukee Courier'' \n*In December 1967, Carolyn Rodgers met with Haki R. Madhubuti and Johari Amini in the basement of a South Side apartment to found Third World Press, an outlet for [[African-American literature]]. By 2007, the company continues to thrive in a multimillion-dollar facility. Over the years, Rodgers would publish works for friend and Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author Gwendolyn Brooks, as well as [[Sonia Sanchez]], [[Sterling Plumpp]] and [[Pearl Cleage]].

The film was directed by [[Lawrence Guterman]] with screenplay by [[John Requa]] and [[Glenn Ficarra]], and stars [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Elizabeth Perkins]] and [[Alexander Pollock]], with the voices of (among others) [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Joe Pantoliano]] and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]]. The story centers on the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] between [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, depicting the relationship as an intense rivalry in which both sides use organizations and tactics that mirror those used in human [[espionage]]. It was shot in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Vancouver]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada as well as at [[Warner Bros. Studios]]. It was released on July 4, 2001 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], [[Zide/Perry Productions]], and [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and it earned $200,687,492 on a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the home laboratory of Professor Charles Brody, his wife Carolyn, and son Scotty, the family's pet [[Bloodhound]] Buddy chases a cat and is captured by other cats in an ambush. Dogs and cats are revealed to be highly intelligent, tech-savvy enemies capable of speech, waging war with covert operatives while concealing their true nature from humans. After an [[Anatolian Shepherd]] dog named Butch reports Buddy's capture to his superiors, the best canine agents are dispatched to complete Buddy's mission: to prevent [[cat]]s from making all humans allergic to [[dogs]].\n\nAt a local barn, a litter of [[Beagle]] puppies mock the youngest for trying to escape captivity. A [[Doberman Pinscher]] agent replaces the litter with puppy agents, failing to notice the youngest Beagle. The Brodys arrive to adopt a new dog and Carolyn selects the Beagle, naming him Lou after Scotty sarcastically suggests the name \"Loser\".\n\nAfter detonating an explosive trap laid by cats for Lou, Butch \u2013 mistaking him for a trained operative \u2013 brings him to the dogs\u2019 underground network, and introduces agents Peek, a [[Chinese Crested Dog]], and Sam, an [[Old English Sheepdog]]. Realizing Lou is a civilian, Butch raises his concerns to his superiors but is rebuffed. Lou is briefed on the origins of the conflict between cats and dogs, dating back to [[Ancient Egypt]] when cats ruled the world. Butch reveals that Buddy has escaped the cats and the spy trade, retiring to a [[condominium|condo]] in [[Boca Raton]].\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Tinkles, a white [[Persian cat]], plans to exploit Charles\u2019 research on dog allergies to conquer the world. His scheming is interrupted by Sophie, his comatose owner's maid, who enjoys dressing Tinkles in embarrassing costumes. Tinkles orders his sidekick Calico, an [[Exotic Shorthair]], to send [[Devon Rex]] [[ninja]]s to steal the research. Lou foils the theft and meets former agent and Butch's ex-sweetheart Ivy, a [[Saluki]] who encourages him to bond with Scotty.\n\nMr. Tinkles contracts a [[Russian Blue]] mercenary named Dimitri Kennelkoff, who tricks Lou and places a bomb on Brody's lab door. Kennelkoff battles Lou and Butch, damaging the Brodys\u2019 house until Butch disables the bomb and captures Kennelkoff. During interrogation, the dogs recover a note by Mr. Tinkles from Kennelkoff's stomach.\n\nAfter a breakthrough involving Lou playing with Scotty, Charles' machine finally finds the formula to a cure for human allergies to dogs. Having bugged the house, Mr. Tinkles and Calico spring a trap for the Brodys. First, Mr. Tinkles travels to a [[Christmas tree]] flocking plant under the guise of the plant's comatose owner, Mr. Mason, and sends the employees home, then lures the Brodys with faux tickets to an exhibition game between [[Uruguay]] and [[Chad]], capturing the family.\n\n[[Youtube.com/watch?v=qv7UH0hMTnw&t=60s|The dogs]] receive a video from Mr. Tinkles demanding Charles\u2019 research as a ransom for the Brodys, and dogs around the world assemble at a meeting led by the [[Mastiff]]. When the assembly decides not to surrender the formula, Lou confronts Butch. Revealing that he was abandoned by his owner, the unsympathetic Butch leaves Lou behind. Desperate, Lou brings Mr. Tinkles the research and is double-crossed. Butch, realizing what has happened, stages a raid of Mr. Tinkles' factory where [[Mouse|mice]] are being prepared to spread the mass-produced allergy.\n\nWhile Butch, Ivy, Peek, and Sam fight Tinkles' cat forces, Lou frees the Brodys and Calico, who was betrayed by Tinkles, revealing to the family that he can speak. Lou defeats Tinkles but is struck by an excavator as an explosion destroys the factory. Butch rescues the seemingly dead Lou, tearfully admitting that Lou was right to love his adoptive family, and Lou awakens. He decides to return to a normal pet's life with the Brodys until he can serve as a full-grown agent.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Tinkles is sent to live with Sophie and her three sisters, with even more humiliating outfits as punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Professor Charles Brody\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Mrs. Carolyn Brody\n* [[Alexander Pollock]] as Scotty Brody\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Sophie the Maid\n\n===Voice cast===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Lou (Louis) a [[Beagle]], who lives with the Brody family\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Butch, an [[Anatolian Shepherd]] and an experienced field agent, and Lou's mentor\n* [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as Mr. Tinkles, a [[Persian cat]] and leader of the cat agents who wants to defeat the dogs and rule the world\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Ivy, a [[Saluki]] and \"domestically challenged\" former dog agent Lou meets when he trains to be an agent, who has a history with Butch\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as The Mastiff, an [[English Mastiff]] and the leader of the dog agents\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Calico, an [[Exotic Shorthair]] and Mr. Tinkles' second in command\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Peek, a [[Chinese Crested Dog]] agent.\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Sam, an [[Old English Sheepdog]] agent.\n* [[Billy West]] as Ninja Cat #1\n* [[Danny Mann]] as Ninja Cat #2\n* [[Glenn Ficarra]] as Dimitri Kennelkoff / The Russian, a [[Russian Blue]] agent sent to set off an explosive device at Professor Brody's lab\n* [[Paul Pape]] as Wolf Blitzer of Canine News Network\n* Victor Wilson as [[Doberman]] Drill Sergeant\n* [[Charles Howerton]] as [[German Shepherd]] at Dog Headquarters (uncredited)\n* [[Richard Steven Horvitz]] as Puppy at Barn (uncredited)\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Ginger Kitten (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Puppeteers===\n{{div col}}\n*  Adam Behr\n* [[Kevin Carlson]]\n* Alejandro Diaz\n*  Randi Kaplan\n* [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]]\n*   Luke Khanlian\n* [[Bruce Lanoil]]\n* [[Drew Massey]]\n*  Gordon Robertson\n* [[Michelan Sisti]]\n* [[Allan Trautman]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe Brody house was filmed at an actual house: 1661 W 45th Avenue, [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].

The story centers on the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] between [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, depicting the relationship as an intense rivalry in which both sides use organizations and tactics that mirror those used in human [[espionage]]. It was shot in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Vancouver]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada as well as at [[Warner Bros. Studios]]. It was released on July 4, 2001 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], [[Zide/Perry Productions]], and [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and it earned $200,687,492 on a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the home laboratory of Professor Charles Brody, his wife Carolyn, and son Scotty, the family's pet [[Bloodhound]] Buddy chases a cat and is captured by other cats in an ambush. Dogs and cats are revealed to be highly intelligent, tech-savvy enemies capable of speech, waging war with covert operatives while concealing their true nature from humans. After an [[Anatolian Shepherd]] dog named Butch reports Buddy's capture to his superiors, the best canine agents are dispatched to complete Buddy's mission: to prevent [[cat]]s from making all humans allergic to [[dogs]].\n\nAt a local barn, a litter of [[Beagle]] puppies mock the youngest for trying to escape captivity. A [[Doberman Pinscher]] agent replaces the litter with puppy agents, failing to notice the youngest Beagle. The Brodys arrive to adopt a new dog and Carolyn selects the Beagle, naming him Lou after Scotty sarcastically suggests the name \"Loser\".\n\nAfter detonating an explosive trap laid by cats for Lou, Butch \u2013 mistaking him for a trained operative \u2013 brings him to the dogs\u2019 underground network, and introduces agents Peek, a [[Chinese Crested Dog]], and Sam, an [[Old English Sheepdog]]. Realizing Lou is a civilian, Butch raises his concerns to his superiors but is rebuffed. Lou is briefed on the origins of the conflict between cats and dogs, dating back to [[Ancient Egypt]] when cats ruled the world. Butch reveals that Buddy has escaped the cats and the spy trade, retiring to a [[condominium|condo]] in [[Boca Raton]].\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Tinkles, a white [[Persian cat]], plans to exploit Charles\u2019 research on dog allergies to conquer the world. His scheming is interrupted by Sophie, his comatose owner's maid, who enjoys dressing Tinkles in embarrassing costumes. Tinkles orders his sidekick Calico, an [[Exotic Shorthair]], to send [[Devon Rex]] [[ninja]]s to steal the research. Lou foils the theft and meets former agent and Butch's ex-sweetheart Ivy, a [[Saluki]] who encourages him to bond with Scotty.\n\nMr. Tinkles contracts a [[Russian Blue]] mercenary named Dimitri Kennelkoff, who tricks Lou and places a bomb on Brody's lab door. Kennelkoff battles Lou and Butch, damaging the Brodys\u2019 house until Butch disables the bomb and captures Kennelkoff. During interrogation, the dogs recover a note by Mr. Tinkles from Kennelkoff's stomach.\n\nAfter a breakthrough involving Lou playing with Scotty, Charles' machine finally finds the formula to a cure for human allergies to dogs. Having bugged the house, Mr. Tinkles and Calico spring a trap for the Brodys. First, Mr. Tinkles travels to a [[Christmas tree]] flocking plant under the guise of the plant's comatose owner, Mr. Mason, and sends the employees home, then lures the Brodys with faux tickets to an exhibition game between [[Uruguay]] and [[Chad]], capturing the family.\n\nThe dogs receive a video from Mr. Tinkles demanding Charles\u2019 research as a ransom for the Brodys, and dogs around the world assemble at a meeting led by the [[Mastiff]]. When the assembly decides not to surrender the formula, Lou confronts Butch. Revealing that he was abandoned by his owner, the unsympathetic Butch leaves Lou behind. Desperate, Lou brings Mr. Tinkles the research and is double-crossed. Butch, realizing what has happened, stages a raid of Mr. Tinkles' factory where [[Mouse|mice]] are being prepared to spread the mass-produced allergy.\n\nWhile Butch, Ivy, Peek, and Sam fight Tinkles' cat forces, Lou frees the Brodys and Calico, who was betrayed by Tinkles, revealing to the family that he can speak. Lou defeats Tinkles but is struck by an excavator as an explosion destroys the factory. Butch rescues the seemingly dead Lou, tearfully admitting that Lou was right to love his adoptive family, and Lou awakens. He decides to return to a normal pet's life with the Brodys until he can serve as a full-grown agent.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Tinkles is sent to live with Sophie and her three sisters, with even more humiliating outfits as punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Professor Charles Brody\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Mrs. Carolyn Brody\n* [[Alexander Pollock]] as Scotty Brody\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Sophie the Maid\n\n===Voice cast===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Lou (Louis) a [[Beagle]], who lives with the Brody family\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Butch, an [[Anatolian Shepherd]] and an experienced field agent, and Lou's mentor\n* [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as Mr. Tinkles, a [[Persian cat]] and leader of the cat agents who wants to defeat the dogs and rule the world\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Ivy, a [[Saluki]] and \"domestically challenged\" former dog agent Lou meets when he trains to be an agent, who has a history with Butch\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as The Mastiff, an [[English Mastiff]] and the leader of the dog agents\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Calico, an [[Exotic Shorthair]] and Mr. Tinkles' second in command\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Peek, a [[Chinese Crested Dog]] agent.\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Sam, an [[Old English Sheepdog]] agent.\n* [[Billy West]] as Ninja Cat #1\n* [[Danny Mann]] as Ninja Cat #2\n* [[Glenn Ficarra]] as Dimitri Kennelkoff / The Russian, a [[Russian Blue]] agent sent to set off an explosive device at Professor Brody's lab\n* [[Paul Pape]] as Wolf Blitzer of Canine News Network\n* Victor Wilson as [[Doberman]] Drill Sergeant\n* [[Charles Howerton]] as [[German Shepherd]] at Dog Headquarters (uncredited)\n* [[Richard Steven Horvitz]] as Puppy at Barn (uncredited)\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Ginger Kitten (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Puppeteers===\n{{div col}}\n*  Adam Behr\n* [[Kevin Carlson]]\n* Alejandro Diaz\n*  Randi Kaplan\n* [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]]\n*   Luke Khanlian\n* [[Bruce Lanoil]]\n* [[Drew Massey]]\n*  Gordon Robertson\n* [[Michelan Sisti]]\n* [[Allan Trautman]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe Brody house was filmed at an actual house: 1661 W 45th Avenue, [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].

During the [[Kwanzaa]] celebration, black prisoners were placed under lockdown, angering the whole facility and leading to a general strike. Prisoners refused to work or leave their cells for three months, leading to the guards beating prisoners, putting prisoners in solitary confinement, denying prisoners medical care and food.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|title=Anarchy Works|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe strike ended in the prisoners' favour as the superintendent of the prison resigned. The prisoners were granted more visitation rights and work programs. Angered by this, the prison guards went on strike and abandoned the prison, hoping that this would create chaos and violence throughout the prison. But the prisoners were able to create an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[List of anarchist communities|community]] where [[recidivism]] dropped dramatically and murders and rapes fell to zero. Prisoners volunteered to cook meals. Vietnam veterans who had been trained as medics took charge of the pharmacy and distribution of meds. Decisions were made in community assemblies.\n\nGuards retook the prison after two months, leading to many prison administrators and bureaucrats quitting their jobs and embracing the prison abolition movement.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bisonnette|first=Jamie|title=When the prisoners ran Walpole: a true story in the movement for prison abolition|publisher=South End Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Advocates of prison abolition ==\nProminent social activist [[Angela Davis]], outspoken critic of the [[Prison\u2013industrial complex|prison-industrial complex]] (PIC), openly supports prison abolition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Dylan|date=2000-01-01|title=The Challenge of Prison Abolition: A Conversation|journal=Social Justice|volume=27|issue=3 (81)|pages=212\u2013218|jstor=29767244}}</ref> In her work, she writes: \"Mass incarceration is not a solution to unemployment, nor is it a solution to the vast array of social problems that are hidden away in a rapidly growing network of prisons and jails.

As an economic being, the person would spend money at or near his or her area of residence\u2014typically, an inner city. Imprisonment displaces that economic activity: Instead of buying snacks in a local deli, the prisoner makes those purchases in a prison commissary. The removal may represent a loss of economic value to the home community, but it is a boon to the prison [host] community. Each prisoner represents as much as $25,000 in income for the community in which the prison is located, not to mention the value of constructing the prison facility in the first place. This can be a massive transfer of value: a young male worth a few thousand dollars of support to children and local purchases is transformed into a $25,000 financial asset to a rural prison community.

But both anecdotal evidence and fragmentary data confirm what common sense would predict: individuals who have been incarcerated have great difficulty securing employment when they return to society. Except for a short period in the late 1990s, when the labor market was so tight that the Wall Street Journal reported on employer efforts to reach out to felons, those leaving prison have faced formidable obstacles to employment. Some of these difficulties are related to company policies or procedures and others are the result of employer perceptions of felons' job skills or trustworthiness. Felons are also barred from public employment in a number of states, including three with a high proportion of African American residents (Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina).

During the [[Kwanzaa]] celebration, black prisoners were placed under lockdown, angering the whole facility and leading to a general strike. Prisoners refused to work or leave their cells for three months, leading to the guards beating prisoners, putting prisoners in solitary confinement, denying prisoners medical care and food.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|title=Anarchy Works|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe strike ended in the prisoners' favour as the superintendent of the prison resigned. The prisoners were granted more visitation rights and work programs. Angered by this, the prison guards went on strike and abandoned the prison, hoping that this would create chaos and violence throughout the prison. But the prisoners were able to create an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[List of anarchist communities|community]] where [[recidivism]] dropped dramatically and murders and rapes fell to zero. Prisoners volunteered to cook meals. Vietnam veterans who had been trained as medics took charge of the pharmacy and distribution of meds. Decisions were made in community assemblies.\n\nGuards retook the prison after two months, leading to many prison administrators and bureaucrats quitting their jobs and embracing the prison abolition movement.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bisonnette|first=Jamie|title=When the prisoners ran Walpole: a true story in the movement for prison abolition|publisher=South End Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Advocates of prison abolition ==\nProminent social activist [[Angela Davis]], outspoken critic of the [[Prison\u2013industrial complex|prison-industrial complex]] (PIC), openly supports prison abolition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Dylan|date=2000-01-01|title=The Challenge of Prison Abolition: A Conversation|journal=Social Justice|volume=27|issue=3 (81)|pages=212\u2013218|jstor=29767244}}</ref> In her work, she writes: \"Mass incarceration is not a solution to unemployment, nor is it a solution to the vast array of social problems that are hidden away in a rapidly growing network of prisons and jails.

The removal may represent a loss of economic value to the home community, but it is a boon to the prison [host] community. Each prisoner represents as much as $25,000 in income for the community in which the prison is located, not to mention the value of constructing the prison facility in the first place.

Except for a short period in the late 1990s, when the labor market was so tight that the Wall Street Journal reported on employer efforts to reach out to felons, those leaving prison have faced formidable obstacles to employment. Some of these difficulties are related to company policies or procedures and others are the result of employer perceptions of felons' job skills or trustworthiness. Felons are also barred from public employment in a number of states, including three with a high proportion of African American residents (Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina).

He was nicknamed {{lang|it|Il Migliore}} (\"The Best\")<ref>http://www.raistoria.rai.it/articoli/togliatti-labilita-de-il-migliore/12363/default.aspx</ref> by his supporters. In 1930 he became a citizen of the [[Soviet Union]]<ref>[http://archivio.corriere.it/Archivio/interface/landing.html Togliatti e Stalin]</ref> and later he had a city in that country named after him: [[Tolyatti]].\n\nTogliatti was a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (''Partito Comunista d\u2019Italia'', PCI), and from 1927 until his death, he was the Secretary and the undisputed leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]], except for the period from 1934 to 1938, during which he served as representative to the [[Comintern]], the international organization of communist parties. After the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943 and the formation of the [[Cominform]] in 1947, he refused the post of Secretary General, offered to him directly by [[Stalin]] in 1951, preferring to remain at the head of the PCI.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1945 Togliatti held the post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of Italy|Deputy Prime Minister]] and from 1945 to 1946 he was appointed [[Italian Minister of Justice|Minister of Justice]] in the governments that ruled Italy after the [[fall of Fascism]]. He was also a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy]].\n\nTogliatti survived an assassination attempt in 1948, and died in 1964, during a holiday in [[Crimea]] on the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Early life and family==\nPalmiro Togliatti was born in [[Genoa]] into a middle-class family. His father Antonio was an accountant in the [[Public Administration]], while his mother Teresa Vitale was a teacher.<ref>P. Togliatti, intervista a \u00abNoi donne\u00bb, 20 agosto 1964.</ref>\n\nTogliatti's father's job forced the Togliattis to move frequently to different cities. Before his birth they moved from [[Turin]] to [[Genoa]]. He was named \"Palmiro\" because he was born on [[Palm Sunday]]; Togliatti's parents were observant [[Roman Catholic]]s.\n\nPalmiro Togliatti had one sister, Maria Cristina, and two brothers, Enrico and [[Eugenio Giuseppe Togliatti|Eugenio Giuseppe]]. Eugenio became a mathematician and discovered [[Togliatti surface]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Accademia delle Scienze di Torino.

He served as a volunteer army officer during the war, and was wounded in action and sent home to recuperate.\n\n===''L'Ordine Nuovo''===\nReturning at the end of the conflict, Togliatti was a part of the group around [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s ''[[L'Ordine Nuovo]]'' paper in [[Turin]], while working as a [[tutor]].\n\nLike the other founders of ''L'Ordine Nuovo'', Togliatti was an admirer of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and strongly supported the immediate creation of [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] in Italy. He believed that existing factory councils of workers could be strengthened so that they could become the basis of a communist coup.<ref>Lindemann, p. 56</ref><ref>Lindemann, p. 58</ref>\n\nInitially, the newspaper, which was founded with union backing, focused on cultural politics, but in June 1919, the month following its founding, Gramsci and Togliatti pushed Tasca out and re-focused as a revolutionary voice.<ref>Bellamy, pp. xviii\u2013xix</ref> The newspaper reached a circulation of 6,000 by the end of the year and its reputation was heightened by its support of the April 1920 general strike, which the Socialist Party and the affiliated [[Confederazione Generale del Lavoro|General Confederation of Labour]] did not support it.<ref>Bellamy, p. xix</ref> On 1 January 1921 the paper began to be published daily.<ref name=\"marc\">{{cite book|author=Marcel Danesi|title=Encyclopedia of Media and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZOBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT488|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=17 June 2013|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9553-5|page=488}}</ref>\n\n==Communist Party of Italy==\n[[File:Il giovane Togliatti.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Togliatti in the 1920s.]]\nTogliatti was a member of the Communist Faction of the PSI, which was part of the Communist International, commonly known as the [[Comintern]]. On 21 January 1921, following a split in the Socialist Party on their 17th Congress in [[Livorno]], he was one of the founders of the [[Communist Party of Italy]]. The PCdI was formed by ''L'Ordine Nuovo'' group led by Gramsci and the \"culturalist\" faction led by [[Angelo Tasca]].<ref>Bellamy, p. xxv</ref>\n\nIn 1923, some members of the party were arrested and put on trial for \"conspiracy against the State\". This allowed the intense activity of the Communist International to deprive the party's left wing of authority and give control to the minority centre which had aligned with Moscow. In 1924 and 1925, the Comintern began a campaign of \"[[Bolshevik|Bolshevisation]]\" which forced each party to conform to the discipline and orders of Moscow.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Fascist regime===\nIn October 1922, [[Benito Mussolini]], leader of the [[National Fascist Party]], took advantage of a general strike by workers and announced his demands to the government to give the Fascist Party political power or face a coup. With no immediate response, a small number of Fascists began a long trek across Italy to Rome which was called the [[March on Rome]], claiming to Italians that Fascists were intending to restore law and order. Mussolini himself did not participate until the very end of the march, with [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] being hailed as leader of the march, until it was revealed that he had been pushed out of a window and severely wounded in a failed assassination attempt. This deprived him of the possibility of leading the actual coup d'\u00e9tat orchestrated by an organization he himself had founded.\n\nThe Fascists, under the leadership of Mussolini, demanded Prime Minister [[Luigi Facta]]'s resignation and that Mussolini be named Prime Minister. Although the Italian Army was far better armed than the Fascist paramilitaries, the Italian government under King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] faced a political crisis. The King was forced to choose which of the two rival movements in Italy would form the government: Mussolini's Fascists, or the anti-monarchist [[Italian Socialist Party]]. He selected the Fascists and appointed Mussolini new Prime Minister.<ref>Charles Keserich, \"The Fiftieth Year of the\" March on Rome\": Recent Interpretations of Facism.\" ''History Teacher'' (1972) 6#1 pp: 135\u2013142 {{jstor|492632}}.</ref><ref>Giulia Albanese, \"Reconsidering the March on Rome,\" ''European History Quarterly'' (2012) 42#3 pp 403\u2013421.</ref>\n\nIn August 1923 Mussolini pushed through Parliament a new electoral law, the [[Acerbo Law]], which assigned two-thirds of the seats to the list that had exceeded 25% of the votes. Togliatti wrote that \"fascism will, gained power, dispersing the proletarians aggregates, prevent their unification on any terrain and cause a unification around it instead of the bourgeois political groups''.<ref>P. Togliatti, ''Dopo la riforma elettorale'', in \u00ab''lo Stato Operaio''\u00bb, 16 agosto 1923.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1924 Italian general election|1924 general election]] the [[National List (Italy)|National List]] of Mussolini (an alliance with Liberals and Conservatives) used intimidation tactics,<ref name=NS2>Nohlen & St\u00f6ver, p1033</ref> resulting in a landslide victory and a subsequent [[two-thirds majority]]; while the Communist Party gained only 3.74% of votes and 19 seats.\n\nIn 1926, when the party was banned by the Italian Fascist government in 1926, [[Amedeo Bordiga]] and Gramsci were arrested and imprisoned on the island of [[Ustica]]. Togliatti was one of few leaders not to be arrested, as he was attending a meeting of the [[Comintern]] in Moscow.\n\n===Exile===\nIn 1927, Togliatti was elected General Secretary in place of Gramsci.\n\nIn exile during the late 1920s and the 1930s, he organized clandestine meetings of the PCd'I at [[Lyon]] (1926) and [[Cologne]] (1931). In 1927 he took the position of [[General Secretary|Secretary]] of the party.\n\nIn 1935, under the ''[[Pseudonym|nom de guerre]]'' ''Ercole Ercoli'', he was named member of the secretariat of the Comintern.  In 1939, he was arrested in France: released, he moved to the [[Soviet Union]], and remained there during [[World War II]], broadcasting radio messages to Italy, in which he called for resistance to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Italian Social Republic]].\n\n==Secretary of the Italian Communist Party==\n\n===\"Salerno turn\" and shooting===\n[[File:Togliatti Unit\u00e0.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Togliatti with a copy of ''[[L'Unit\u00e0]]'' newspaper, in 1950s.]]\nIn 1944 Togliatti returned to Italy, and led his [[Italian Communist Party|PCI]] and other political forces to the so-called ''Svolta di Salerno'', the  \"[[Salerno]] Turn\". This was a compromise between antifascist parties, the monarchy and prime minister [[Pietro Badoglio]] to set up a government of national unity and to postpone institutional questions. The PCI committed to supporting democracy and to abandon the [[armed struggle]] for the cause of Socialism. In effect, the turn moved the party to the right, in contrast with many demands from within; it also meant the disarmament of those members of the [[Italian resistance movement]] that had been organized by the PCI (the Garibaldi Brigades). Togliatti served from December 1944 as Deputy Prime Minister and then from June 1945 as [[Italian Minister of Justice|Justice Minister]].\n\nAfter having been [[minister without portfolio]] in the [[Pietro Badoglio]] government, he acted as vice-premier under [[Alcide De Gasperi]] in 1945. In opposition to the dominant line in his own party, he voted for the inclusion of the [[Lateran Pacts]] in the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]. At the [[1946 Italian general election|1946 general election]], held at the same time as the [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|Constitutional Referendum]] won by republican supporters, the PCI obtained 19% of the votes and 104 seats in the new [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]].\n\n[[File:Palmiro Togliatti comizio.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Togliatti during a Communist rally.]]\nCommunist ministers were evicted during the [[May 1947 crisis]]. The same month, [[Maurice Thorez]], head of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), was forced to quit [[Paul Ramadier]]'s government along with the four other communist ministers. As in Italy, the PCF was very strong, taking part in the [[Three parties]] alliance (''Tripartisme'') and scoring 28.6% at the November 1946 elections.\n\nIn 1948, Togliatti led the PCI in the [[1948 Italian general election|first democratic election]] after [[World War II]].<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html How to Hang On], ''Time'', 19 April 1948</ref> He lost to the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] party (DC \u2013 [[Democrazia Cristiana]]) after a highly confrontational campaign in which the United States, viewing him as a [[Cold War]] enemy, played a large part.<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798522,00.html The Battle Continues], ''Time'', 3 May 1948</ref> Allied with the PCI in the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]], the left-wing achieved 31% of the votes.\n\nOn 14 July 1948, Togliatti was shot three times, being severely wounded by Antonio Pallante, a strongly anti-communist fascist student{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}; his life hung in the balance for days and news about his condition was uncertain, causing an acute political crisis in Italy (which included a [[general strike]] called by the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour]]).<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887830,00.html Blood on the Cobblestones], ''Time'', 26 July 1948</ref>\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\n[[File:Togliatti.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|A portrait of Togliatti in 1950s.]]\nUnder his leadership, the PCI became the second largest party in Italy, and the largest non-ruling [[communist party]] in Europe. Although permanently in the opposition at the national level during Togliatti's lifetime, the party ran many municipalities and held great power at the local and regional level in certain areas.\n\nIn 1953, he fought against the so-called \"cheat or swindle law\", an electoral legislation passed by the Christian Democracy-led majority of the time, which aimed at using [[Plurality voting system|first past the post]] to augment the center-right's power. Ultimately, the law was to prove of no use for the government in the elections of that year, where Togliatti's PCI won 22.6% of the vote. It was repealed in November 1953.\n\nDespite his close relationship with the [[Soviet Union]], Togliatti's leadership remained unscathed after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] (which was in most countries a cause for major conflicts within the [[left-wing|left]]). He developed and named the [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]] theory (unity in diversity within the communist parties in all countries).  In the [[1958 Italian general election|1958 elections]], the number of Communist votes was still on the rise. In the [[1963 Italian general election|1963 elections]], the PCI gained 25.2% of the votes but again failed to reach a relative majority.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Togliatti Iotti.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Togliatti and [[Nilde Iotti]], before 1964.]]\nTogliatti died as a result of [[cerebral haemorrhage]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Agosti |first=Aldo |title=Palmiro Togliatti: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V30AAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291#v=twopage&q&f=false |location=London |publisher=I.

According to some of his collaborators, Togliatti was traveling to the Soviet Union to give his support to [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s election as [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s successor at the head of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. His favourite pupil, [[Enrico Berlinguer]], was later elected as his successor to the National Secretary of the PCI position, though Berlinguer's time in office saw the rejection of key policies advocated by Togliatti.\n\nThe [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian]] city of Stavropol-on-Volga, where Togliatti had been instrumental in establishing the [[AutoVAZ]] (''Lada'') automobile manufacturing plant in collaboration with [[Fiat]], was renamed [[Tolyatti]] (as transliterated from \u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0442\u0442\u0438, the Russian spelling of his name) in his honor in 1964, after his death.\n\nAgarossi and Zaslavsky (2011) argue that Togliatti and the other leaders of the PCI were fundamentally subservient to Stalin, and did their best to promote Soviet interests. They argue Togliatti was above all a Stalinist, and that he remained one for years after Stalin died in 1953 and the Soviet Union had repudiated much of his legacy. They argue that it was Stalin who ordered Togliatti to play a moderating role in Italian politics because the time was not yet ripe for a showdown with capitalism.

He was nicknamed  {{lang|it|Il Migliore}} (\"The Best\").<ref>http://www.raistoria.rai.it/articoli/togliatti-labilita-de-il-migliore/12363/default.aspx</ref> by his supporters. In 1930 he became a citizen of the [[Soviet Union]]<ref>[http://archivio.corriere.it/Archivio/interface/landing.html Togliatti e Stalin]</ref> and later he had a city in that country named after him: [[Tolyatti]].\n\nTogliatti was a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (''Partito Comunista d\u2019Italia'', PCI), and from 1927 until his death, he was the Secretary and the undisputed leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]], except for the period from 1934 to 1938, during which he served as representative to the [[Comintern]], the international organization of communist parties. After the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943 and the formation of the [[Cominform]] in 1947, he refused the post of Secretary General, offered to him directly by [[Stalin]] in 1951, preferring to remain at the head of the PCI.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1945 Togliatti held the post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of Italy|Deputy Prime Minister]] and from 1945 to 1946 he was appointed [[Italian Minister of Justice|Minister of Justice]] in the governments that ruled Italy after the [[fall of Fascism]]. He was also a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy]].\n\nTogliatti survived an assassination attempt in 1948, and died in 1964, during a holiday in [[Crimea]] on the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Early life and family==\nPalmiro Togliatti was born in [[Genoa]] into a middle-class family. His father Antonio was an accountant in the [[Public Administration]], while his mother Teresa Vitale was a teacher.<ref>P. Togliatti, intervista a \u00abNoi donne\u00bb, 20 agosto 1964.</ref>\n\nTogliatti's father's job forced the Togliattis to move frequently to different cities. Before his birth they moved from [[Turin]] to [[Genoa]]. He was named \"Palmiro\" because he was born on [[Palm Sunday]]; Togliatti's parents were observant [[Roman Catholic]]s.\n\nPalmiro Togliatti had one sister, Maria Cristina, and two brothers, Enrico and [[Eugenio Giuseppe Togliatti|Eugenio Giuseppe]]. Eugenio became a mathematician and discovered [[Togliatti surface]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Accademia delle Scienze di Torino.

He served as a volunteer army officer during the war, and was wounded in action and sent home to recuperate.\n\n===''L'Ordine Nuovo''===\nReturning at the end of the conflict, Togliatti was a part of the group around [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s ''[[L'Ordine Nuovo]]'' paper in [[Turin]], while working as a [[tutor]].\n\nLike the other founders of ''L'Ordine Nuovo'', Togliatti was an admirer of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and strongly supported the immediate creation of [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] in Italy. He believed that existing factory councils of workers could be strengthened so that they could become the basis of a communist coup.<ref>Lindemann, p. 56</ref><ref>Lindemann, p. 58</ref>\n\nInitially, the newspaper, which was founded with union backing, focused on cultural politics, but in June 1919, the month following its founding, Gramsci and Togliatti pushed Tasca out and re-focused as a revolutionary voice.<ref>Bellamy, pp. xviii\u2013xix</ref> The newspaper reached a circulation of 6,000 by the end of the year and its reputation was heightened by its support of the April 1920 general strike, which the Socialist Party and the affiliated [[Confederazione Generale del Lavoro|General Confederation of Labour]] did not support it.<ref>Bellamy, p. xix</ref> On 1 January 1921 the paper began to be published daily.<ref name=\"marc\">{{cite book|author=Marcel Danesi|title=Encyclopedia of Media and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZOBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT488|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=17 June 2013|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9553-5|page=488}}</ref>\n\n==Communist Party of Italy==\n[[File:Il giovane Togliatti.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Togliatti in the 1920s.]]\nTogliatti was a member of the Communist Faction of the PSI, which was part of the Communist International, commonly known as the [[Comintern]]. On 21 January 1921, following a split in the Socialist Party on their 17th Congress in [[Livorno]], he was one of the founders of the [[Communist Party of Italy]]. The PCdI was formed by ''L'Ordine Nuovo'' group led by Gramsci and the \"culturalist\" faction led by [[Angelo Tasca]].<ref>Bellamy, p. xxv</ref>\n\nIn 1923, some members of the party were arrested and put on trial for \"conspiracy against the State\". This allowed the intense activity of the Communist International to deprive the party's left wing of authority and give control to the minority centre which had aligned with Moscow. In 1924 and 1925, the Comintern began a campaign of \"[[Bolshevik|Bolshevisation]]\" which forced each party to conform to the discipline and orders of Moscow.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Fascist regime===\nIn October 1922, [[Benito Mussolini]], leader of the [[National Fascist Party]], took advantage of a general strike by workers and announced his demands to the government to give the Fascist Party political power or face a coup. With no immediate response, a small number of Fascists began a long trek across Italy to Rome which was called the [[March on Rome]], claiming to Italians that Fascists were intending to restore law and order. Mussolini himself did not participate until the very end of the march, with [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] being hailed as leader of the march, until it was revealed that he had been pushed out of a window and severely wounded in a failed assassination attempt. This deprived him of the possibility of leading the actual coup d'\u00e9tat orchestrated by an organization he himself had founded.\n\nThe Fascists, under the leadership of Mussolini, demanded Prime Minister [[Luigi Facta]]'s resignation and that Mussolini be named Prime Minister. Although the Italian Army was far better armed than the Fascist paramilitaries, the Italian government under King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] faced a political crisis. The King was forced to choose which of the two rival movements in Italy would form the government: Mussolini's Fascists, or the anti-monarchist [[Italian Socialist Party]]. He selected the Fascists and appointed Mussolini new Prime Minister.<ref>Charles Keserich, \"The Fiftieth Year of the\" March on Rome\": Recent Interpretations of Facism.\" ''History Teacher'' (1972) 6#1 pp: 135\u2013142 {{jstor|492632}}.</ref><ref>Giulia Albanese, \"Reconsidering the March on Rome,\" ''European History Quarterly'' (2012) 42#3 pp 403\u2013421.</ref>\n\nIn August 1923 Mussolini pushed through Parliament a new electoral law, the [[Acerbo Law]], which assigned two-thirds of the seats to the list that had exceeded 25% of the votes. Togliatti wrote that \"fascism will, gained power, dispersing the proletarians aggregates, prevent their unification on any terrain and cause a unification around it instead of the bourgeois political groups''.<ref>P. Togliatti, ''Dopo la riforma elettorale'', in \u00ab''lo Stato Operaio''\u00bb, 16 agosto 1923.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1924 Italian general election|1924 general election]] the [[National List (Italy)|National List]] of Mussolini (an alliance with Liberals and Conservatives) used intimidation tactics,<ref name=NS2>Nohlen & St\u00f6ver, p1033</ref> resulting in a landslide victory and a subsequent [[two-thirds majority]]; while the Communist Party gained only 3.74% of votes and 19 seats.\n\nIn 1926, when the party was banned by the Italian Fascist government in 1926, [[Amedeo Bordiga]] and Gramsci were arrested and imprisoned on the island of [[Ustica]]. Togliatti was one of few leaders not to be arrested, as he was attending a meeting of the [[Comintern]] in Moscow.\n\n===Exile===\nIn 1927, Togliatti was elected General Secretary in place of Gramsci.\n\nIn exile during the late 1920s and the 1930s, he organized clandestine meetings of the PCd'I at [[Lyon]] (1926) and [[Cologne]] (1931). In 1927 he took the position of [[General Secretary|Secretary]] of the party.\n\nIn 1935, under the ''[[Pseudonym|nom de guerre]]'' ''Ercole Ercoli'', he was named member of the secretariat of the Comintern.  In 1939, he was arrested in France: released, he moved to the [[Soviet Union]], and remained there during [[World War II]], broadcasting radio messages to Italy, in which he called for resistance to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Italian Social Republic]].\n\n==Secretary of the Italian Communist Party==\n\n===\"Salerno turn\" and shooting===\n[[File:Togliatti Unit\u00e0.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Togliatti with a copy of ''[[L'Unit\u00e0]]'' newspaper, in 1950s.]]\nIn 1944 Togliatti returned to Italy, and led his [[Italian Communist Party|PCI]] and other political forces to the so-called ''Svolta di Salerno'', the  \"[[Salerno]] Turn\". This was a compromise between antifascist parties, the monarchy and prime minister [[Pietro Badoglio]] to set up a government of national unity and to postpone institutional questions. The PCI committed to supporting democracy and to abandon the [[armed struggle]] for the cause of Socialism. In effect, the turn moved the party to the right, in contrast with many demands from within; it also meant the disarmament of those members of the [[Italian resistance movement]] that had been organized by the PCI (the Garibaldi Brigades). Togliatti served from December 1944 as Deputy Prime Minister and then from June 1945 as [[Italian Minister of Justice|Justice Minister]].\n\nAfter having been [[minister without portfolio]] in the [[Pietro Badoglio]] government, he acted as vice-premier under [[Alcide De Gasperi]] in 1945. In opposition to the dominant line in his own party, he voted for the inclusion of the [[Lateran Pacts]] in the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]. At the [[1946 Italian general election|1946 general election]], held at the same time as the [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|Constitutional Referendum]] won by republican supporters, the PCI obtained 19% of the votes and 104 seats in the new [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]].\n\n[[File:Palmiro Togliatti comizio.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Togliatti during a Communist rally.]]\nCommunist ministers were evicted during the [[May 1947 crisis]]. The same month, [[Maurice Thorez]], head of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), was forced to quit [[Paul Ramadier]]'s government along with the four other communist ministers. As in Italy, the PCF was very strong, taking part in the [[Three parties]] alliance (''Tripartisme'') and scoring 28.6% at the November 1946 elections.\n\nIn 1948, Togliatti led the PCI in the [[1948 Italian general election|first democratic election]] after [[World War II]].<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html How to Hang On], ''Time'', 19 April 1948</ref> He lost to the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] party (DC \u2013 [[Democrazia Cristiana]]) after a highly confrontational campaign in which the United States, viewing him as a [[Cold War]] enemy, played a large part.<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798522,00.html The Battle Continues], ''Time'', 3 May 1948</ref> Allied with the PCI in the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]], the left-wing achieved 31% of the votes.\n\nOn 14 July 1948, Togliatti was shot three times, being severely wounded by Antonio Pallante, a strongly anti-communist fascist student{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}; his life hung in the balance for days and news about his condition was uncertain, causing an acute political crisis in Italy (which included a [[general strike]] called by the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour]]).<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887830,00.html Blood on the Cobblestones], ''Time'', 26 July 1948</ref>\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\n[[File:Togliatti.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|A portrait of Togliatti in 1950s.]]\nUnder his leadership, the PCI became the second largest party in Italy, and the largest non-ruling [[communist party]] in Europe. Although permanently in the opposition at the national level during Togliatti's lifetime, the party ran many municipalities and held great power at the local and regional level in certain areas.\n\nIn 1953, he fought against the so-called \"cheat or swindle law\", an electoral legislation passed by the Christian Democracy-led majority of the time, which aimed at using [[Plurality voting system|first past the post]] to augment the center-right's power. Ultimately, the law was to prove of no use for the government in the elections of that year, where Togliatti's PCI won 22.6% of the vote. It was repealed in November 1953.\n\nDespite his close relationship with the [[Soviet Union]], Togliatti's leadership remained unscathed after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] (which was in most countries a cause for major conflicts within the [[left-wing|left]]). He developed and named the [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]] theory (unity in diversity within the communist parties in all countries).  In the [[1958 Italian general election|1958 elections]], the number of Communist votes was still on the rise. In the [[1963 Italian general election|1963 elections]], the PCI gained 25.2% of the votes but again failed to reach a relative majority.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Togliatti Iotti.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Togliatti and [[Nilde Iotti]], before 1964.]]\nTogliatti died as a result of [[cerebral haemorrhage]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Agosti |first=Aldo |title=Palmiro Togliatti: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V30AAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291#v=twopage&q&f=false |location=London |publisher=I.

According to some of his collaborators, Togliatti was traveling to the Soviet Union to give his support to [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s election as [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s successor at the head of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. His favourite pupil, [[Enrico Berlinguer]], was later elected as his successor to the National Secretary of the PCI position, though Berlinguer's time in office saw the rejection of key policies advocated by Togliatti.\n\nThe [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian]] city of Stavropol-on-Volga, where Togliatti had been instrumental in establishing the [[AutoVAZ]] (''Lada'') automobile manufacturing plant in collaboration with [[Fiat]], was renamed [[Tolyatti]] (as transliterated from \u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0442\u0442\u0438, the Russian spelling of his name) in his honor in 1964, after his death.\n\nAgarossi and Zaslavsky (2011) argue that Togliatti and the other leaders of the PCI were fundamentally subservient to Stalin, and did their best to promote Soviet interests. They argue Togliatti was above all a Stalinist, and that he remained one for years after Stalin died in 1953 and the Soviet Union had repudiated much of his legacy. They argue that it was Stalin who ordered Togliatti to play a moderating role in Italian politics because the time was not yet ripe for a showdown with capitalism. Agarossi and Zaslavsky rely not only on Togliatti's papers but those of the Kremlin, especially the highly detailed reports sent in by the Soviet ambassador in Rome.
