The season comprised 12 episodes, and concluded its initial airing on June 26, 1991. It introduced a number of characters who played significant roles in later episodes, such as Jerry's [[Uncle Leo]] and Jerry's neighbor [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nFilming of the show moved from [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City, Los Angeles]]. One episode, \"The Bet\", remained unfilmed, as it was considered too provocative by the network, as well as several cast and crew members. Two new writers joined the writing staff, [[Larry Charles]] and [[Peter Mehlman]], who would continue to write for the show in later seasons. Even though season two started out with poor ratings, bringing the season to a two-month hiatus, the rest of the season was positively received by critics and was nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.\n\nA ''Seasons 1 and 2'' [[DVD]] box set was released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] in the United States and Canada on November 23, 2004, 13 years after it completed broadcast on television. In addition to every episode from the two seasons, the DVD release features [[The Stranded|an episode from the third season that was held over]], bonus material, including [[deleted scene]]s, inside looks, bloopers, and commentaries. Four million copies of the DVD were sold by the end of the year, making it one of the best-selling DVDs of all time. ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the sixth-greatest TV season ever made.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\nThe show features an ensemble cast of four characters: [[Jerry Seinfeld]] stars as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictional version of himself]]; [[Jason Alexander]] portrays Seinfeld's neurotic friend [[George Costanza]]; [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] plays [[Elaine Benes]], Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend; and [[Michael Richards]] stars as Seinfeld's neighbor [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,309157,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Tucker, Ken|date=January 10, 1992|title=Seinfeld (1990\u20131998)|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the characters' evolution during the season: \"As the seasons progress, you can see Michael Richards turn Kramer {{interp|...}} from a vague eccentric {{interp|...}} into a stylized creation who redefined TV's quirky-neighbor type with [[Danny Kaye]] accents. You can see Julia Louis-Dreyfus {{interp|...}} develop Elaine from a puffy-haired gal pal (who wasn't in the pilot) into a delightfully petty urbanite.

The season comprised 12 episodes, and concluded its initial airing on June 26, 1991. It introduced a number of characters who played significant roles in later episodes, such as Jerry's [[Uncle Leo]] and Jerry's neighbor [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nFilming of the show moved from [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City, Los Angeles]]. One episode, \"The Bet\", remained unfilmed, as it was considered too provocative by the network, as well as several cast and crew members. Two new writers joined the writing staff, [[Larry Charles]] and [[Peter Mehlman]], who would continue to write for the show in later seasons. Even though season two started out with poor ratings, bringing the season to a two-month hiatus, the rest of the season was positively received by critics and was nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.\n\nA ''Seasons 1 and 2'' [[DVD]] box set was released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] in the United States and Canada on November 23, 2004, 13 years after it completed broadcast on television. In addition to every episode from the two seasons, the DVD release features [[The Stranded|an episode from the third season that was held over]], bonus material, including [[deleted scene]]s, inside looks, bloopers, and commentaries. Four million copies of the DVD were sold by the end of the year, making it one of the best-selling DVDs of all time. ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the sixth-greatest TV season ever made.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\nThe show features an ensemble cast of four characters: [[Jerry Seinfeld]] stars as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictional version of himself]]; [[Jason Alexander]] portrays Seinfeld's neurotic friend [[George Costanza]]; [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] plays [[Elaine Benes]], Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend; and [[Michael Richards]] stars as Seinfeld's neighbor [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,309157,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Tucker, Ken|date=January 10, 1992|title=Seinfeld (1990\u20131998)|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the characters' evolution during the season: \"As the seasons progress, you can see Michael Richards turn Kramer {{interp|...}} from a vague eccentric {{interp|...}} into a stylized creation who redefined TV's quirky-neighbor type with [[Danny Kaye]] accents. You can see Julia Louis-Dreyfus {{interp|...}} develop Elaine from a puffy-haired gal pal (who wasn't in the pilot) into a delightfully petty urbanite.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action.
