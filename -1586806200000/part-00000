She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  \n\nThe [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n==Life==\n=== Early life and education ===\n[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]Mendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n\u00e9e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3\u20135</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny C\u00e4cilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>\n\nWhile growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>\n\n=== Gender and class limitations ===\nIn the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>\n\nIn 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840.

Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\n===Death===\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833\u201334.

She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary.

Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]].

She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research.

She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819.

(2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>\n\nIn 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299\u2013301</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and later life===\n[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\nIn 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> \n\nWilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\n===Death===\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833\u201334.

She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary.

Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]].

The population of the civil parish (including Whitwell Common) taken at the 2011 Census was 3,900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11130606&c=Whitwell&d=16&e=62&g=6413200&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1458312682616&enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=18 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Whitwell celebrated its 1,000th anniversary in the 'Whitwell 1000' celebrations of 1989, it is much older than this celebration suggests. The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several [[Iron Age]] burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church, the world heritage site of [[Creswell Crags]] was until recently within the parish. [[Whitwell Old Hall]] is a medieval manor house.\n\nWhitwell won the 'Best Kept Village in Derbyshire' Award in 1988.\n\nWhitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.\n\nAlthough being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses.  It previously had as many as 11 and held the record for most number of licensed premises per capita. The current pubs are Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.\n\n[[Image:Whitwell, Derbyshire View.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View over Whitwell]]\n\n==Whitwell Wood==\nWhitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A [[Three Shire Oak]] once stood in a field adjacent to Whitwell Wood. The oak traditionally marked the meeting point of the borders of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However, the tree actually stood some distance to the south of the actual border, which is located closer to the Nottinghamshire village of [[Shireoaks]].\n\n=== Whitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) - Creswell Crags ===\nUntil Creswell village was developed by the colliery company in the late 19th Century, Creswell Crags was known locally as Whitwell Crags.Up until this time , there were only a few farms around the entrance to the Crags.The nearest local Anglo Saxon villages were Whitwell, Elmton & Thorpe (Salvin). According to a local resident whose relatives lived in the farms close to the Crags,  Creswell was only the name of the farm nearest to the new colliery site, and used as a drop off point for materials used in the building of the colliery.  The original name of the Crags (Whitwell Crags) may be the  location referred to by the Anglo Saxon poets who recorded King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund conquering the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore & \"Hwitan Wylles Geat\" (the Whitwell Gap). Whitwell Gap would have to be a significant landscape feature to warrant mention in an Anglo Saxon chronicle, and be easily identifiable.\n\n==Famous Whitwellians==\nOne of Whitwell's most famous sons was [[Joe Davis]], world snooker and billiards champion from the 1920s to the 1940s. His Whitwell home (on Welbeck Street) bears a plaque commemorating him.\n\n[[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]], [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]]<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/859/859.html Les Jackson at CricketArchive.com]</ref> in 1959, played for Whitwell Cricket Club and came to watch their games on a Saturday afternoon until his death in 2007.\n\nAlso from the village are [[Chris Adams (cricketer)|Chris Adams]], the [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Ian Bennett (footballer)|Ian Bennett]], a professional goalkeeper who currently plays for [[Huddersfield Town]], whose family still lives in the village.\n\nCelebrated Great War poet, William Streets was also from the village.\n\nThe village is the birthplace and childhood home of [[J. T. Edson]] the author, whose various escapism-adventure series sold over 27 million copies globally; the Edson family lived in Whitwell from Victorian times.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Whitwell, Derbyshire}}\n*[http://www.whitwell-pc.gov.uk/ Whitwell Parish Council]\n*[http://www.whitwell.info/ Whitwell Parish Website]\n*[http://www.whitwell.com/ Whitwell Website]\n*[http://whitwellderbyscc.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp Whitwell Cricket Club's Website]\n*[http://www.wlhg.co.uk/ Whitwell Local History Group's Website]\n*[http://www.whitwellbrassband.org.uk/ Whitwell Brass Band]\n*[http://www.whitwell4ward.org.uk/ Whitwell Forward]\n*[http://www.whitwellagainstalkane.info/ Whitwell Against Alkane (Action Group against Alkane Energy)]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Bolsover District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{infobox UK place\n|country = England\n|coordinates  = {{coord|53.285|-1.209|display=inline,title}}\n|static_image_name =608434 4e55cf25-by-Richard-Croft.jpg\n|static_image_caption=[[St Lawrence's Church, Whitwell|Church of St Lawrence, Whitwell.]]\n|official_name= Whitwell\n|map_type= Derbyshire\n|population = 3,900\n|population_ref = (2011)\n|shire_district= [[Bolsover (district)|Bolsover]]\n|shire_county = [[Derbyshire]]\n|region= East Midlands\n|constituency_westminster= [[Bolsover (UK Parliament constituency)|Bolsover]]\n|post_town= WORKSOP\n|postcode_district = S80\n|postcode_area= S\n|dial_code= 01909\n|os_grid_reference= SK528767\n}}\n\n'''Whitwell''' is a small village located in [[Derbyshire]], England.

[[Whitwell Old Hall]] is a medieval manor house.\n\nWhitwell won the 'Best Kept Village in Derbyshire' Award in 1988.\n\nWhitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.\n\nAlthough being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses.  It previously had as many as 11 and held the record for most number of licensed premises per capita. The current pubs are Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.\n\n[[Image:Whitwell, Derbyshire View.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View over Whitwell]]\n\n==Whitwell Wood==\nWhitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A [[Three Shire Oak]] once stood in a field adjacent to Whitwell Wood. The oak traditionally marked the meeting point of the borders of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However, the tree actually stood some distance to the south of the actual border, which is located closer to the Nottinghamshire village of [[Shireoaks]].\n\n===== Whitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) - Creswell Crags=====\nUntil Creswell village was developed by the colliery company in the late 19th Century, Creswell Crags was known locally as Whitwell Crags.Up until this time , there were only a few farms around the entrance to the Crags.The nearest local Anglo Saxon villages were Whitwell, Elmton & Thorpe (Salvin). According to a local resident whose relatives lived in the farms close to the Crags,  Creswell was only the name of the farm nearest to the new colliery site, and used as a drop off point for materials used in the building of the colliery.  The original name of the Crags (Whitwell Crags) may be the  location referred to by the Anglo Saxon poets who recorded King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund conquering the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore & \"Hwitan Wylles Geat\" (the Whitwell Gap). Whitwell Gap would have to be a significant landscape feature to warrant mention in an Anglo Saxon chronicle, and be easily identifiable.\n\n==Famous Whitwellians==\nOne of Whitwell's most famous sons was [[Joe Davis]], world snooker and billiards champion from the 1920s to the 1940s. His Whitwell home (on Welbeck Street) bears a plaque commemorating him.\n\n[[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]], [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]]<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/859/859.html Les Jackson at CricketArchive.com]</ref> in 1959, played for Whitwell Cricket Club and came to watch their games on a Saturday afternoon until his death in 2007.\n\nAlso from the village are [[Chris Adams (cricketer)|Chris Adams]], the [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Ian Bennett (footballer)|Ian Bennett]], a professional goalkeeper who currently plays for [[Huddersfield Town]], whose family still lives in the village.\n\nCelebrated Great War poet, William Streets was also from the village.\n\nThe village is the birthplace and childhood home of [[J. T. Edson]] the author, whose various escapism-adventure series sold over 27 million copies globally; the Edson family lived in Whitwell from Victorian times.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Whitwell, Derbyshire}}\n*[http://www.whitwell-pc.gov.uk/ Whitwell Parish Council]\n*[http://www.whitwell.info/ Whitwell Parish Website]\n*[http://www.whitwell.com/ Whitwell Website]\n*[http://whitwellderbyscc.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp Whitwell Cricket Club's Website]\n*[http://www.wlhg.co.uk/ Whitwell Local History Group's Website]\n*[http://www.whitwellbrassband.org.uk/ Whitwell Brass Band]\n*[http://www.whitwell4ward.org.uk/ Whitwell Forward]\n*[http://www.whitwellagainstalkane.info/ Whitwell Against Alkane (Action Group against Alkane Energy)]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Bolsover District]]\n", "name_user": "GregorM01", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWhitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) - Creswell Crags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitwell,_Derbyshire"}

Stearns was born in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] on January 8, 1809, the eldest son and second child of Luther and Mary (Hall) Stearns. His paternal immigrant ancestor, Isaac Sterne, arrived in Salem on June 12, 1630, from [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. He had sailed to the new colony with [[John Winthrop]], a future governor, and Sir [[Richard Saltonstall]], among others. Isaac Sterne moved to Watertown, located along the [[Charles River]], where he died in 1671. What became known as the American Stearns family (note spelling variation) grew, with branches moving northward and westward. For decades men typically worked as farmers, teachers, and clergymen.\n\nStearns' father, Luther Stearns, was born on February 17, 1770, the eldest of five children born to Captain Josiah Stearns, a soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He commanded a company of 50 men from [[Lunenburg, Massachusetts]]. Luther Stearns had entered Dartmouth College at age seventeen but transferred, graduating from Harvard in 1791. He worked as a tutor at Harvard and eventually studied medicine. He later became an obstetrician. He was honored in 1811 by an honorary degree from Harvard. <!-- Nice trick! Honorary degrees do not constitute certification for medical specialties -->\n\nAfter getting his practice started, Luther married Mary Hall of [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], on December 29, 1799; she was 16 years old, not an uncommon marrying age for women. They settled in  Medford, Massachusetts to be closer to her relatives. They had three children together: Elizabeth Hall, George Luther, and Henry Laurens Stearns (named after the American Ambassador of that name, a distant relative). The senior Stearns later opened a private preparatory school for boys in Medford; many students came from the American South and the West Indies.\n\nStearns died of pneumonia on April 27, 1820, when son George was eleven years old. To earn money, young George sometimes tended the locks on the Middlesex Canal in town.  At the age of 15, he entered the workforce to support his mother and sisters.\n\n===Career===\nIn early life, Stearns was engaged in the business of ship-chandlery. After a prosperous career, he began the manufacture of sheet and pipe-lead, doing business in [[Boston]] and residing in Medford.\n\nHe married Mary Elizabeth Preston on October 12, 1843. They met through acquaintances, including her father Warren Preston, a probate judge in Norridgewock, Maine; and [[Lydia Maria Child]], an American abolitionist and women's rights activist. \n\nBefore voting in the Missouri and Kansas territories about the future of slavery in each jurisdiction, Stearns was one of the chief financiers of the [[Emigrant Aid Company]]. It supported the settlement of [[Kansas]] by antislavery homesteaders. He identified with the [[Abolitionism in the United States|antislavery cause]], and became a [[Free Soil Party|Free-soiler]] in 1848. \n\nHe also established the Medford station of the [[Underground Railroad]] to help escaped refugee slaves to gain freedom (some continued to Canada, which had abolished slavery). Stearns was one of the \"[[Secret Six]]\" who aided [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in [[Kansas]], and financially supported him for the raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]; Brown was executed for this attack. Stearns had owned the pikes and 200 [[Sharps rifle]]s taken to  Harpers Ferry by Brown and his followers. Following Brown's arrest, Stearns briefly fled to Canada but returned to Medford to face inquiry following Brown's execution.\n\nSoon after the opening of the Civil War, Stearns advocated the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. Massachusetts Governor [[John Albion Andrew|John Andrew]] asked Stearns to recruit the first two Northern state-sponsored black [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s. He contributed strongly to recruiting the enlistees of the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry|54th]] and [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts]] regiments and the 5th cavalry. \n\nStearns was commissioned as [[Major (United States)|major]] through the recommendation of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. Later he also enlisted  black soldiers for the [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]]US Colored Troops from [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], and [[Tennessee]]. He is credited with recruiting more than 13,000 African Americans.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} He also established schools for their children and found work for their families while the men served in the army.\n\nStearns founded the ''Nation'', ''Commonwealth'', and ''Right Way'' newspapers for the dissemination of his ideas.<ref>James M. McPherson, ''The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction'', Princeton University Press, 1964/new edition 2015</ref> \n\nAfter President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January 1863, Stearns worked tirelessly for the [[civil rights]] of African Americans. Among his many admirers and friends were [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Charles Sumner]], [[Frederick Douglass]], and President [[Andrew Johnson]]. He also helped to found the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], a federal organization designed to support emancipated African Americans ([[freedmen]]) in the South after the end of the war.\n\n\n==Death and legacy==\nStearns died of pneumonia in New York City, New York on April 9, 1867.

It had ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers.\n\nContinental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era. After 1978, Continental grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial troubles and other issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.\n\nThe airline merged with [[UAL Corporation]] (the parent company of [[United Airlines]]) via a [[stock swap]] in 2010.

Varney]], who was also a founder of [[United Airlines]]) was formed in 1934, operating [[airmail]] and passenger services in the [[American Southwest]] over a route originating from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and extending through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]] to [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. The airline commenced operations with the [[Lockheed Vega]], a single-engine plane that carried four passengers.<ref name=\"Serling\">Serling, Robert J., Maverick: The story of Robert Six and Continental Airlines ({{ISBN|0-385-04057-1}}), Doubleday & Company, 1974.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. Following [[Air_Mail_scandal|cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts]] by the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration in 1934, [[Robert F. Six]] learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as Chairman of the Board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines (later changed to \"Airlines\") on July 8, 1937. Six relocated the airline's headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in [[Denver]] in October 1937.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\">Davies, R.E.G., Continental Airlines: the first fifty years, 1934\u20131984, Pioneer Publications, 1984.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six changed the name to \"Continental\" because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.<ref name=\"COFacts\">\"[http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts Continental Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719164330/http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts |date=July 19, 2010 }}.\" [[Continental (magazine)|Continental Magazine]].

Profits from military transportation and aircraft conversion enabled Continental to contemplate expansion and acquisition of new airliners after the war.<ref name=\"Serling\"/> Among those were the [[Douglas DC-3]], the [[Convair 240]] and the [[Convair 340]]. The Convairs were Continental's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] airliners.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/> The airline's early route was [[El Paso]] to Albuquerque and Denver, with routes being added during the war from Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso eastward across Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. In 1946 Continental flew Denver to Kansas City, Wichita, Tulsa, and to Oklahoma City, and from El Paso and Albuquerque to San Antonio. Each route included stops in several of 22 smaller cities.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Continental began several interchange routes with American, Braniff, and United Airlines. Routes were operated on American from Los Angeles and San Francisco to El Paso continuing onto Continental's route to San Antonio and Houston.  Continental's Denver to Kansas City route would interchange onto St. Louis with Braniff Airways and United's routes from Seattle and Portland to Denver would interchange with Continental's routes onto Wichita and Tulsa. These interchange routes continued for many years until Continental was able to secure routes of its own between each city.\n\nIn 1955 Continental merged with [[Pioneer Air Lines]], gaining access to 16 more cities in Texas and New Mexico. In August 1953 Continental flew to 35 airports and Pioneer flew to 19, but Continental's network didn't reach beyond Denver, El Paso, Houston and Kansas City until April 1957 when it started Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles, two [[Douglas DC-7]]Bs a day each way. Pioneer's Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence|Harding Luther Lawrence]] arrived at Continental as a result of the merger. Bob Six commented on more than one occasion that, \"the reason we bought Pioneer was to get Harding.\" Harding Lawrence implemented several innovative changes at Continental as well as a flamboyant advertising campaign during his ten years as Six's protege. During Lawrence's tenure Continental grew by 500 percent. Lawrence left Continental in April 1965 to head [[Braniff Airways]].<ref name=UPI>{{cite web|last=United Press International|title=Airline Pioneer Harding Lawrence Dies|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/01/17/Airline-pioneer-Harding-Lawrence-dies/UPI-69351011319865/|work=United Press International|publisher=upi.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nSix petitioned the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB) for longer routes to larger cities, hoping to transform the regional into a trunkline like [[United Airlines]], [[TWA]], and [[American Airlines]]. He was discussing with [[Boeing]] for Continental to become one of the first to operate the soon-to-be-launched [[Boeing 707|707]]. The timing was crucial, since new routes would justify the 707s, and vice versa.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Robert F. Six, Chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Six]], chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1936\u20131981]]\n\nContinental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes, thanks to a responsive CAB and persistent efforts by Six and Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence]] (who came to Continental in the Pioneer merger), who both frequently referred to his company as \"the Airline that needs to grow.\"<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\">Christian, J. Scott, former Continental employee and manager, Bring Songs to the Sky: Recollections of Continental Airlines, 1970\u20131986, Quadran Press, 1998.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} In 1958 Continental began turboprop flights with the [[Vickers Viscount]] on the new medium-haul routes. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many smaller cities, enabling the carrier's new aircraft to operate more economically on longer flights. In 1960 Continental flew more than three times the passenger-miles it had in 1956. (''Aviation Week'' June 22, 1959: \"Continental's current re-equipment program \u2014 involving a total cost of $64 million for the Boeings, Viscounts and DC-7Bs \u2014 was launched in 1955 when the carrier's net worth amounted to $5.5 million.\")\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s Six was the airline industry's leading lower-fare advocate. He predicted that increased traffic, not higher fares, was the answer to the airline industry's problems. To amazement from the industry he introduced the [[Economy class#Airlines|economy fare]] on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which made air travel available to many who could not previously afford it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Continental took delivery of the first of five 707-124s in spring 1959, and started Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Having so few jets, Continental needed radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. It developed the \"progressive maintenance\" program, which enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, achieving greater aircraft utilization than any other jet operator in the industry.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six, not being satisfied with 707 service, introduced innovations and luxe cuisine on Continental's 707 flights which were described as, \"...&nbsp;nothing short of luxurious\" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and, \"...&nbsp;clearly, the finest in the airline industry\" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 707-124 (Continental Airlines) LAX.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 707]] at Los Angeles, 1967]]\nIn the early 1960s Continental added flights from Los Angeles to Houston, nonstop as well as via Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, Austin, and/or San Antonio. In 1963 the company headquarters moved from Denver to Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} By late 1963 Continental had discontinued service to most of its smaller cities in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas with the exception of Lawton, OK and Wichita Falls, TX which continued operating with DC-9 and 727 jets until 1977. Total passenger-miles in 1967 were more than five times greater than in 1960, but 61% of the 1967 total was on unscheduled flights (mostly transpacific charters). During the late 1960s the company disposed of the last of its turboprop and piston-powered aircraft\u2014one of the first U.S. airlines to do so.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> Continental replaced the Viscount fleet with [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s and then added [[Boeing 727-100]]s and [[727-200]]s.  The DC-9 and 727 were to become the workhorses of the fleet from the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> The DC-9s were phased out by the late 1970s (although the type reappeared after mergers in the 1980s with an example being [[Texas International Airlines]] DC-9s which were added to the CO fleet); the 727-200 was the mainstay of its narrow-body fleet until the late 1980s. In 1968 a new [[livery]] was launched: orange and gold cheatlines on a white fuselage; and a black \"jetstream\" logo (by Six's friend, the noted graphic designer [[Saul Bass]]) on the iconic \"Golden Tails\" of the airline's aircraft. The slogans adopted in 1968 and used for more than a decade were, \"The Airline That Pride Built\" and, \"The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail\".<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> 1960s saw international routes awarded to Continental (to New Zealand and Australia) in the Transpacific Case, but they were cancelled by the Nixon Administration.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines B737-200 N7381F.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing 737-200 with 1968\u20131991 \"meatball\" logo and livery designed by [[Saul Bass]]]]\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] Continental provided extensive cargo and troop transportation for [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] forces to Asian and the Pacific bases.

With Continental's experience in Pacific operations, the carrier formed subsidiary [[Air Micronesia]] in May 1968, inaugurating [[island hopping]] routes between [[Yap]]/[[Saipan]]/[[Guam]], [[Majuro]], Rota, [[Chuuk International Airport|Truk]], Ponape ([[Pohnpei]]) and Honolulu.<ref name=\"Serling\"/> \"Air Mike\", as it was known, initially operated with [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]] aircraft with open-ocean survival gear, doppler radar, and a large complement of spare parts (including tires).<ref name=\"Serling\"/> A senior mechanic flew on every Air Mike flight until the late 1970s. Air Micronesia operated as subsidiary [[Continental Micronesia]] until 2010.

On June 26, 1970, Continental became the second carrier (after TWA) to put the 747 into U.S. domestic service. Its upper-deck first class lounge and main deck \"Polynesian Pub\" won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental's Cordon Bleu-trained executive chef, Lucien DeKeyser.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental's 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> On June 1, 1972, Continental's widebody [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] service began. Six had insisted that Continental place a large order for DC-10s with manufacturer [[McDonnell Douglas]]. This decision again proved prescient, since the publicity associated with Continental's splashy 747 service Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles-Honolulu had stimulated increased market share and increased traffic for all carriers. Denver, Houston and Seattle were growing rapidly in the 1970s; the DC-10s took over most flights between Denver and Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, and between Houston and Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-224 N32718 CO ORD 19.02.78 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-224]] at [[Chicago O'Hare Airport]] in 1978]]\nDuring the 1970s, Denver served as the airline's main hub. The 747s were focused on the Chicago-Los Angeles-Honolulu routes, with one daily round trip through Denver. The DC-10s served large markets (Los Angeles to Chicago, Denver, Houston and Honolulu; and from Denver to Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston). DC-9s and 727s predominated elsewhere and added frequencies on DC-10 routes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Next to [[Braniff]], Continental operated fewer aircraft types (four: the 747, DC-10, 727-200, and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9-10]]) during this period than any U.S. trunkline, affording savings in parts, maintenance, and crew training.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The DC-10 enabled the airline to capitalize on traffic growth in the west. Continental saw market share grow annually in each DC-10 market through the 1970s, until relative market parity was achieved with United, the principal competitor on most of the DC-10 routes. The same innovations introduced on the 747s appeared on Continental's DC-10s, including the \"Polynesian Pub\", but after the [[1973 oil crisis]] more seats were needed and the DC-10 pubs were removed.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental phased out its 747s in 1978 in favor of the DC-10s (747s would return to Continental during the Lorenzo era, flying Newark to London and Paris). From the late 1970s until it merged with Texas International, Continental operated only DC-10s and 727-200s.  In the very late seventies, prior to the merger, 727-100s were added.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1982, Continental was headquartered at the west end of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on World Way West. The facility included the general offices, system operations control, the central maintenance facility, flight kitchen, and Los Angeles crew bases.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}<ref>''World Airline Directory''.

President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB and for the first time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between [[Air Micronesia]] destination [[Saipan]] and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via [[Honolulu]], [[American Samoa]], Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} After the 1978 passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref name=\"Scott\"/> That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and [[Taipei]], via Honolulu and [[Guam]]. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. In Denver, Continental's rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new [[Denver International Airport]], which would be completed almost fifteen years later.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines DC-10-10 N68042.jpg|thumb|left|Continental DC-10 at Narita Airport, Japan]]\nWhile deregulation allowed Continental to expand into new profitable areas, it hurt the company's existing business as consumers were for the first time able to choose lower fares over Continental's better service. In 1978 Continental explored the possibility of a merger with [[Western Airlines]], which held a nearby headquarters and similar fleet.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the [[Great Plains]] states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the [[Intermountain West]]. Both airlines served the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Rocky Mountain]] states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. The merger did not take place.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> Unlike some airlines (notably [[Braniff]] whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's expansion after passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] seems, in retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, absorbing some of the hits to its existing markets and helping it in difficult times between 1982 and 1994.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1981, [[Texas Air Corporation]], an airline holding company controlled by U.S. aviation entrepreneur [[Frank Lorenzo]], acquired Continental after a contentious battle with Continental's management who were determined to resist Lorenzo. Continental's labor unions also fiercely resisted, fearing what they termed as \"Lorenzo's deregulation tactics\", which they believed implied that he wanted to make Continental a non-union airline. Lorenzo viewed the company as stuck in the pre-deregulation era and in need of serious changes to stay competitive. Continental was experiencing financial challenges both before and after Lorenzo's takeover, and he demanded immediate wage cuts and layoffs to keep the company afloat.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\">{{cite book |author=Bamber, G.J. |author2=Gittell, J.H. |author3=Kochan, T.A. |author4=von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |chapter=Alternative Strategies for New Entrants: Southwest vs. Ryanair |isbn=978-0-8014-4747-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801447471 }}</ref> During this struggle, Continental Airlines CEO, [[Alvin Feldman]], died from suicide in his office.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Continental Air Chief Dies, Apparent Suicide|work=New York Times|date=August 10, 1981|accessdate=July 16, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/us/continental-air-chief-dies-apparent-suicide.html?&pagewanted=print|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Lorenzo became Continental's new Chairman and CEO.

Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately. Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreements on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline's labor costs.<ref>Moss Kanter, Rosabeth, Confidence \u2013 How Winning Streaks and Losing Streaks Begin and End ({{ISBN|1-4000-5290-4}}), Crown Business, 2004</ref> Continental became vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S., but employee attitudes and loyalty were adversely affected. By the end of 1984, Continental recorded a $50&nbsp;million profit.

Additional service from Newark to London and Paris started after the airline's merger with People Express Airlines in 1987. However, the airline was still facing significant challenges with consistently low reliability rankings and a high level of customer complaints compared with its competitors.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, [[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]], opening a bidding war with [[People Express]], which was headed by Lorenzo's former TI associate [[Donald Burr|Don Burr]]. People Express paid a substantial premium for Frontier's high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view, but was in the opinion of most industry analysts rather an attempt by Burr to best his former boss, Lorenzo.<ref name=\"Scott\"/><ref name=\"Delaney\"/> On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With People Express hemorrhaging cash, Texas Air acquired People Express on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier, whose strong network in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental's already formidable Denver hub. Because it had been the largest airline operating in the New York market, the People Express hub at Newark would permit Continental to expand its East Coast services dramatically. Continental soon became the third-largest airline in the U.S. and the predominant force in the New York, Denver and Houston airline markets. {{Disputed inline|date=April 2019}}\n\nContinental emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 1986, with improved asset and cash flow positions and a more competitive route structure with routes radiating to every large U.S. city from major hubs at Denver and Houston.<ref name=\"Scott\"/><ref name=\"Delaney\"/> Continental also began developing its Midwest hub at [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] in 1986, just as United Airlines began to transfer its Cleveland hub operations to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Fairfax County, Virginia.

While at Continental, Bethune created the Go-Forward plan, to fix problems with the airline, which included employee morale, the quality of the product, and the route structure, among others. Bethune began by ordering new aircraft in an effort to convert to an all-Boeing fleet.

The majority of Continental flights were operated from its hubs, with a few exceptions (Seattle-Anchorage, Los Angeles-Honolulu, and Los Angeles-Havana, LaGuardia \u2013 Aruba). Some affiliated airlines used the [[Continental Connection]] name also operate flights not involving hubs, such as [[Gulfstream International Airlines]], which operated intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas services.\n\n[[File:Terminal E Waiting area.jpg|thumb|Continental was the dominant operator at [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]]]]\n\nFor almost 40 years, Continental operated a very large hub in [[Denver]], Colorado, but took the decision to close that hub in 1995 immediately after the opening of [[Denver International Airport]] (DIA), which represented a significantly higher-cost operation than the former Stapleton Airport, which DIA had replaced. The abrupt nature of this change came as a shock to Denver, which was experiencing dramatic growth. The void left by Continental's departure allowed the establishment of the \"new\" [[Frontier Airlines]] (a startup, rather than the original carrier of that name). Both Frontier and Southwest Airlines (which entered the Denver market after Continental's dehubbing) expanded quickly to fill the vacuum created by Continental's closing of its Denver hub.\n\nFor the first forty years of its existence, Continental was a domestic airline; however, especially after the incorporation of [[Texas International Airlines|Texas International]] routes, it has served more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. carrier since the mid-1980s.\n\nContinental first entered the transatlantic market in April 1985, with the introduction of a Houston-[[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]] service. Long prevented from serving [[London Heathrow Airport]] because of the provisions of the [[Bermuda II]] agreement, which only allowed [[British Airways]], [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] to operate flights from Heathrow to the United States, Continental maintained its London services at Gatwick, where in 2007 as many as six flights a day were offered to Newark, Houston, and Cleveland.\n\nIn March 2008, an [[Open Skies Agreement]] between the U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II restrictions that had limited the number of carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] and [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and are offered with a combination of [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] and [[757-200]] equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin.<ref>\"[https://archive.today/20120628230019/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85779&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1078367&highlight= Continental Airlines to Launch Twice-Daily Nonstop Flights to Heathrow From Both New York and Houston]\", ''Continental Airlines''</ref> Continental has grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.\n\n[[File:Bush terminal E.jpg|thumb|Continental operated international flights from Terminal E at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] in [[Houston]].]]\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Continental's extensive military charter operations established a presence in the Pacific region that formed the basis for the [[Air Micronesia]] operation. Service to Japan was initiated in the 1970s from Guam and Saipan, and by the late 1980s, nonstop service between Seattle and Tokyo was briefly offered with [[Boeing 747|747]] equipment, soon to be replaced with a direct Honolulu-[[Narita International Airport|Tokyo (Narita)]] flight. Through the 1990s, Continental maintained a minimal presence in the long-haul trans-Pacific market, until the delivery of 777-200ERs in 1998 which saw the addition of nonstop Tokyo service from Houston and Newark. By 2007, Hong Kong and Beijing were added to the network, and in 2009 Shanghai was added, all from the Newark hub.

United repainted this aircraft to the standard Globe livery in May 2016, and then painted a different airframe in the Blue Skyway, sister ship N75435. The reason for the change is currently unknown to the public.\n\nFirst Class was offered on Domestic Flights, and BusinessFirst was offered on Transatlantic/Transpacific Flights.\n\nContinental Airlines was one of three carriers (with [[American Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]]) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired [[McDonnell Douglas]], the European Union forced Boeing to void the contracts. Both parties had been adhering to the terms under a [[gentlemen's agreement]].\n\nContinental was one of the first major airlines to fly Boeing 757s on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a fuel stop which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller [[seating capacity]] allowed for \"thin\" routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It allowed non-stop service from smaller cities, such as [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland and [[Hamburg]], Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, or Frankfurt, in order to travel to New York. United retains a number of these flight routes, mostly based out of Newark, including Newark-Hamburg, Newark-Dublin, and Newark-Berlin.\n\n===Historic fleet===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''CAL, March 1960'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200497.html |title=Flight International April 8, 1960 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707\u2013120]]\n|4\n|1\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-3]]\n|10\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]\n|1\n|0\n|Leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]B\n|2\n|0\n|1 leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-7]]B\n|5\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 812]]\n|15\n|\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''37'''\n|'''1'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, March 1970'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%200529.html |title=Flight International March 26, 1970 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Concorde]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not delivered\n|-\n|[[Boeing 2707]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not manufactured\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320C]]\n|13\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 720B]]\n|8\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100C]]\n|1\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|12\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]]\n|0\n|4\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-10F]]\n|19\n|0\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''62'''\n|'''10'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, July 1980'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%201919.html|title=World Airline Directory 1980|publisher=Flight International |date=July 26, 1980|accessdate=December 11, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]]\n|16\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|36\n|9\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10]]\n|7\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10CF]]\n|6\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-30]]\n|0\n|2\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''65'''\n|'''11'''\n|\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Cabin===\nContinental Airlines had a two-class service configuration, First/BusinessFirst and Economy Class, for aircraft in the mainline fleets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |title=Continental Airlines Aircraft Information |publisher=Continental.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102529/https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====BusinessFirst====\nContinental had begun deploying BusinessFirst seats that allowed customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m}} of sleeping space in the fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft.

Installation on the [[Boeing 767]] fleet was to follow in 2011. The anticipated completion of the roll-out across Continental's entire international fleet was planned for August 2012. In addition, all 787 deliveries were to have the seats installed.\n\nContinental considered BusinessFirst to be its signature onboard product, and the service is a frequent subject of advertising campaigns. Customers seated in the BusinessFirst cabin on longhaul flights from the United States to Europe, Asia, select cities in South America, and the Middle East received special ground services, including EliteAccess priority bag service at check-in, expedited security screening (where available), access to Continental's Presidents Club or affiliated Star Alliance lounges, personalized Continental Concierge service, and dedicated boarding procedures.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines BusinessFirst entree.jpg|thumb|In-flight meal in BusinessFirst]]\n\nOn board, multi-course meals were designed by Continental's Congress of Chefs, beverages were selected by Continental's Wine Masters, and service was provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights had at least two meal services. Entertainment was offered at each individual seat, and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft had access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft featured older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft were expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also were provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access to shower facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.\n\nContinental offered a modified BusinessFirst service on flights from the United States mainland to Hawaii. All flights offered the same suite of EliteAccess ground services, along with a similar main meal service on board. Amenities such as pillows and headsets also were the same, but no amenity kits were offered. On flights from Newark and Houston to Honolulu, Continental operated Boeing 767-400ER aircraft with typical recliner-style BusinessFirst seats. On flights from Los Angeles and Orange County to Honolulu/Kahului with [[Boeing 737]] equipment, domestic First Class seats were substituted. Nonstop flights from Guam to Honolulu were exempt from most of these modifications and more closely resembled the standard BusinessFirst service.\n\nNo complimentary upgrades were offered to Continental OnePass Elite members on any intercontinental flights offering BusinessFirst service. However, on 767-operated BusinessFirst services to Hawaii, Continental offered a day-of-departure buy up fee for any revenue coach class fare, provided seats were available. Mainland-Hawaii was the only BusinessFirst market where such upgrades are available. In addition, OnePass Elites were eligible for complimentary automatic upgrades on Continental-operated flights from California to Hawaii.\n[[File:Continental Airlines domestic First Class dinner.jpg|thumb|left|Domestic First Class dinner]]\n\n====Domestic First Class====\nDomestic First Class was offered on domestic flights.

When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde's left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured. The tires then exploded and tire rubber fragments penetrated Concorde's wing fuel tanks, starting fires in engines 1 and 2, leading to the crash which killed all aboard and four people on the ground.

Continental mechanic John Taylor was given a 15-month suspended sentence, while another airline operative and three French officials were cleared of all charges. The court ruled that the crash resulted from a piece of metal from a Continental jet that was left on the runway; the object punctured a tire on the Concorde and then ruptured a fuel tank.

It had ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers.\n\nContinental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era. After 1978, Continental grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial troubles and other issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.\n\nThe airline merged with [[UAL Corporation]] (the parent company of [[United Airlines]]) via a [[stock swap]] in 2010.

Varney]], who was also a founder of [[United Airlines]]) was formed in 1934, operating [[airmail]] and passenger services in the [[American Southwest]] over a route originating from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and extending through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]] to [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. The airline commenced operations with the [[Lockheed Vega]], a single-engine plane that carried four passengers.<ref name=\"Serling\">Serling, Robert J., Maverick: The story of Robert Six and Continental Airlines ({{ISBN|0-385-04057-1}}), Doubleday & Company, 1974.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. Following [[Air_Mail_scandal|cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts]] by the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration in 1934, [[Robert F. Six]] learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as Chairman of the Board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines (later changed to \"Airlines\") on July 8, 1937. Six relocated the airline's headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in [[Denver]] in October 1937.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\">Davies, R.E.G., Continental Airlines: the first fifty years, 1934\u20131984, Pioneer Publications, 1984.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six changed the name to \"Continental\" because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.<ref name=\"COFacts\">\"[http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts Continental Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719164330/http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts |date=July 19, 2010 }}.\" [[Continental (magazine)|Continental Magazine]].

Profits from military transportation and aircraft conversion enabled Continental to contemplate expansion and acquisition of new airliners after the war.<ref name=\"Serling\"/> Among those were the [[Douglas DC-3]], the [[Convair 240]] and the [[Convair 340]]. The Convairs were Continental's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] airliners.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/> The airline's early route was [[El Paso]] to Albuquerque and Denver, with routes being added during the war from Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso eastward across Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. In 1946 Continental flew Denver to Kansas City, Wichita, Tulsa, and to Oklahoma City, and from El Paso and Albuquerque to San Antonio. Each route included stops in several of 22 smaller cities.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Continental began several interchange routes with American, Braniff, and United Airlines. Routes were operated on American from Los Angeles and San Francisco to El Paso continuing onto Continental's route to San Antonio and Houston.  Continental's Denver to Kansas City route would interchange onto St. Louis with Braniff Airways and United's routes from Seattle and Portland to Denver would interchange with Continental's routes onto Wichita and Tulsa. These interchange routes continued for many years until Continental was able to secure routes of its own between each city.\n\nIn 1955 Continental merged with [[Pioneer Air Lines]], gaining access to 16 more cities in Texas and New Mexico. In August 1953 Continental flew to 35 airports and Pioneer flew to 19, but Continental's network didn't reach beyond Denver, El Paso, Houston and Kansas City until April 1957 when it started Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles, two [[Douglas DC-7]]Bs a day each way. Pioneer's Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence|Harding Luther Lawrence]] arrived at Continental as a result of the merger. Bob Six commented on more than one occasion that, \"the reason we bought Pioneer was to get Harding.\" Harding Lawrence implemented several innovative changes at Continental as well as a flamboyant advertising campaign during his ten years as Six's protege. During Lawrence's tenure Continental grew by 500 percent. Lawrence left Continental in April 1965 to head [[Braniff Airways]].<ref name=UPI>{{cite web|last=United Press International|title=Airline Pioneer Harding Lawrence Dies|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/01/17/Airline-pioneer-Harding-Lawrence-dies/UPI-69351011319865/|work=United Press International|publisher=upi.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nSix petitioned the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB) for longer routes to larger cities, hoping to transform the regional into a trunkline like [[United Airlines]], [[TWA]], and [[American Airlines]]. He was discussing with [[Boeing]] for Continental to become one of the first to operate the soon-to-be-launched [[Boeing 707|707]]. The timing was crucial, since new routes would justify the 707s, and vice versa.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Robert F. Six, Chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Six]], chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1936\u20131981]]\n\nContinental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes, thanks to a responsive CAB and persistent efforts by Six and Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence]] (who came to Continental in the Pioneer merger), who both frequently referred to his company as \"the Airline that needs to grow.\"<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\">Christian, J. Scott, former Continental employee and manager, Bring Songs to the Sky: Recollections of Continental Airlines, 1970\u20131986, Quadran Press, 1998.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} In 1958 Continental began turboprop flights with the [[Vickers Viscount]] on the new medium-haul routes. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many smaller cities, enabling the carrier's new aircraft to operate more economically on longer flights. In 1960 Continental flew more than three times the passenger-miles it had in 1956. (''Aviation Week'' June 22, 1959: \"Continental's current re-equipment program \u2014 involving a total cost of $64 million for the Boeings, Viscounts and DC-7Bs \u2014 was launched in 1955 when the carrier's net worth amounted to $5.5 million.\")\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s Six was the airline industry's leading lower-fare advocate. He predicted that increased traffic, not higher fares, was the answer to the airline industry's problems. To amazement from the industry he introduced the [[Economy class#Airlines|economy fare]] on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which made air travel available to many who could not previously afford it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Continental took delivery of the first of five 707-124s in spring 1959, and started Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Having so few jets, Continental needed radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. It developed the \"progressive maintenance\" program, which enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, achieving greater aircraft utilization than any other jet operator in the industry.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six, not being satisfied with 707 service, introduced innovations and luxe cuisine on Continental's 707 flights which were described as, \"...&nbsp;nothing short of luxurious\" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and, \"...&nbsp;clearly, the finest in the airline industry\" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 707-124 (Continental Airlines) LAX.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 707]] at Los Angeles, 1967]]\nIn the early 1960s Continental added flights from Los Angeles to Houston, nonstop as well as via Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, Austin, and/or San Antonio. In 1963 the company headquarters moved from Denver to Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} By late 1963 Continental had discontinued service to most of its smaller cities in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas with the exception of Lawton, OK and Wichita Falls, TX which continued operating with DC-9 and 727 jets until 1977. Total passenger-miles in 1967 were more than five times greater than in 1960, but 61% of the 1967 total was on unscheduled flights (mostly transpacific charters). During the late 1960s the company disposed of the last of its turboprop and piston-powered aircraft\u2014one of the first U.S. airlines to do so.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> Continental replaced the Viscount fleet with [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s and then added [[Boeing 727-100]]s and [[727-200]]s.  The DC-9 and 727 were to become the workhorses of the fleet from the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> The DC-9s were phased out by the late 1970s (although the type reappeared after mergers in the 1980s with an example being [[Texas International Airlines]] DC-9s which were added to the CO fleet); the 727-200 was the mainstay of its narrow-body fleet until the late 1980s. In 1968 a new [[livery]] was launched: orange and gold cheatlines on a white fuselage; and a black \"jetstream\" logo (by Six's friend, the noted graphic designer [[Saul Bass]]) on the iconic \"Golden Tails\" of the airline's aircraft. The slogans adopted in 1968 and used for more than a decade were, \"The Airline That Pride Built\" and, \"The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail\".<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> 1960s saw international routes awarded to Continental (to New Zealand and Australia) in the Transpacific Case, but they were cancelled by the Nixon Administration.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines B737-200 N7381F.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing 737-200 with 1968\u20131991 \"meatball\" logo and livery designed by [[Saul Bass]]]]\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] Continental provided extensive cargo and troop transportation for [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] forces to Asian and the Pacific bases.

On June 26, 1970, Continental became the second carrier (after TWA) to put the 747 into U.S. domestic service. Its upper-deck first class lounge and main deck \"Polynesian Pub\" won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental's Cordon Bleu-trained executive chef, Lucien DeKeyser.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental's 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> On June 1, 1972, Continental's widebody [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] service began. Six had insisted that Continental place a large order for DC-10s with manufacturer [[McDonnell Douglas]]. This decision again proved prescient, since the publicity associated with Continental's splashy 747 service Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles-Honolulu had stimulated increased market share and increased traffic for all carriers. Denver, Houston and Seattle were growing rapidly in the 1970s; the DC-10s took over most flights between Denver and Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, and between Houston and Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-224 N32718 CO ORD 19.02.78 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-224]] at [[Chicago O'Hare Airport]] in 1978]]\nDuring the 1970s, Denver served as the airline's main hub. The 747s were focused on the Chicago-Los Angeles-Honolulu routes, with one daily round trip through Denver. The DC-10s served large markets (Los Angeles to Chicago, Denver, Houston and Honolulu; and from Denver to Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston). DC-9s and 727s predominated elsewhere and added frequencies on DC-10 routes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Next to [[Braniff]], Continental operated fewer aircraft types (four: the 747, DC-10, 727-200, and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9-10]]) during this period than any U.S. trunkline, affording savings in parts, maintenance, and crew training.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The DC-10 enabled the airline to capitalize on traffic growth in the west. Continental saw market share grow annually in each DC-10 market through the 1970s, until relative market parity was achieved with United, the principal competitor on most of the DC-10 routes. The same innovations introduced on the 747s appeared on Continental's DC-10s, including the \"Polynesian Pub\", but after the [[1973 oil crisis]] more seats were needed and the DC-10 pubs were removed.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental phased out its 747s in 1978 in favor of the DC-10s (747s would return to Continental during the Lorenzo era, flying Newark to London and Paris). From the late 1970s until it merged with Texas International, Continental operated only DC-10s and 727-200s.  In the very late seventies, prior to the merger, 727-100s were added.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1982, Continental was headquartered at the west end of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on World Way West. The facility included the general offices, system operations control, the central maintenance facility, flight kitchen, and Los Angeles crew bases.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}<ref>''World Airline Directory''.

President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB and for the first time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between [[Air Micronesia]] destination [[Saipan]] and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via [[Honolulu]], [[American Samoa]], Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} After the 1978 passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref name=\"Scott\"/> That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and [[Taipei]], via Honolulu and [[Guam]]. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. In Denver, Continental's rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new [[Denver International Airport]], which would be completed almost fifteen years later.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines DC-10-10 N68042.jpg|thumb|left|Continental DC-10 at Narita Airport, Japan]]\nWhile deregulation allowed Continental to expand into new profitable areas, it hurt the company's existing business as consumers were for the first time able to choose lower fares over Continental's better service. In 1978 Continental explored the possibility of a merger with [[Western Airlines]], which held a nearby headquarters and similar fleet.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the [[Great Plains]] states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the [[Intermountain West]]. Both airlines served the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Rocky Mountain]] states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. The merger did not take place.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> Unlike some airlines (notably [[Braniff]] whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's expansion after passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] seems, in retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, absorbing some of the hits to its existing markets and helping it in difficult times between 1982 and 1994.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1981, [[Texas Air Corporation]], an airline holding company controlled by U.S. aviation entrepreneur [[Frank Lorenzo]], acquired Continental after a contentious battle with Continental's management who were determined to resist Lorenzo. Continental's labor unions also fiercely resisted, fearing what they termed as \"Lorenzo's deregulation tactics\", which they believed implied that he wanted to make Continental a non-union airline. Lorenzo viewed the company as stuck in the pre-deregulation era and in need of serious changes to stay competitive. Continental was experiencing financial challenges both before and after Lorenzo's takeover, and he demanded immediate wage cuts and layoffs to keep the company afloat.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\">{{cite book |author=Bamber, G.J. |author2=Gittell, J.H. |author3=Kochan, T.A. |author4=von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |chapter=Alternative Strategies for New Entrants: Southwest vs. Ryanair |isbn=978-0-8014-4747-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801447471 }}</ref> During this struggle, Continental Airlines CEO, [[Alvin Feldman]], died from suicide in his office.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Continental Air Chief Dies, Apparent Suicide|work=New York Times|date=August 10, 1981|accessdate=July 16, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/us/continental-air-chief-dies-apparent-suicide.html?&pagewanted=print|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Lorenzo became Continental's new Chairman and CEO.

Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately.

Additional service from Newark to London and Paris started after the airline's merger with People Express Airlines in 1987. However, the airline was still facing significant challenges with consistently low reliability rankings and a high level of customer complaints compared with its competitors.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, [[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]], opening a bidding war with [[People Express]], which was headed by Lorenzo's former TI associate [[Donald Burr|Don Burr]]. People Express paid a substantial premium for Frontier's high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view, but was in the opinion of most industry analysts rather an attempt by Burr to best his former boss, Lorenzo.<ref name=\"Scott\"/><ref name=\"Delaney\"/> On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With People Express hemorrhaging cash, Texas Air acquired People Express on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier, whose strong network in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental's already formidable Denver hub. Because it had been the largest airline operating in the New York market, the People Express hub at Newark would permit Continental to expand its East Coast services dramatically.

The majority of Continental flights were operated from its hubs, with a few exceptions (Seattle-Anchorage, Los Angeles-Honolulu, and Los Angeles-Havana, LaGuardia \u2013 Aruba). Some affiliated airlines used the [[Continental Connection]] name also operate flights not involving hubs, such as [[Gulfstream International Airlines]], which operated intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas services.\n\n[[File:Terminal E Waiting area.jpg|thumb|Continental was the dominant operator at [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]]]]\n\nFor almost 40 years, Continental operated a very large hub in [[Denver]], Colorado, but took the decision to close that hub in 1995 immediately after the opening of [[Denver International Airport]] (DIA), which represented a significantly higher-cost operation than the former Stapleton Airport, which DIA had replaced. The abrupt nature of this change came as a shock to Denver, which was experiencing dramatic growth. The void left by Continental's departure allowed the establishment of the \"new\" [[Frontier Airlines]] (a startup, rather than the original carrier of that name). Both Frontier and Southwest Airlines (which entered the Denver market after Continental's dehubbing) have expanded quickly to fill the vacuum created by Continental's closing of its Denver hub.\n\nFor the first forty years of its existence, Continental was a domestic airline; however, especially after the incorporation of [[Texas International Airlines|Texas International]] routes, it has served more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. carrier since the mid-1980s.\n\nContinental first entered the transatlantic market in April 1985, with the introduction of a Houston-[[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]] service. Long prevented from serving [[London Heathrow Airport]] because of the provisions of the [[Bermuda II]] agreement, which only allowed [[British Airways]], [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] to operate flights from Heathrow to the United States, Continental maintained its London services at Gatwick, where in 2007 as many as six flights a day were offered to Newark, Houston, and Cleveland.\n\nIn March 2008, an [[Open Skies Agreement]] between the U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II restrictions that had limited the number of carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] and [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and are offered with a combination of [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] and [[757-200]] equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin.<ref>\"[https://archive.today/20120628230019/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85779&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1078367&highlight= Continental Airlines to Launch Twice-Daily Nonstop Flights to Heathrow From Both New York and Houston]\", ''Continental Airlines''</ref> Continental has grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.\n\n[[File:Bush terminal E.jpg|thumb|Continental operated international flights from Terminal E at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] in [[Houston]].]]\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Continental's extensive military charter operations established a presence in the Pacific region that formed the basis for the [[Air Micronesia]] operation. Service to Japan was initiated in the 1970s from Guam and Saipan, and by the late 1980s, nonstop service between Seattle and Tokyo was briefly offered with [[Boeing 747|747]] equipment, soon to be replaced with a direct Honolulu-[[Narita International Airport|Tokyo (Narita)]] flight. Through the 1990s, Continental maintained a minimal presence in the long-haul trans-Pacific market, until the delivery of 777-200ERs in 1998 which saw the addition of nonstop Tokyo service from Houston and Newark. By 2007, Hong Kong and Beijing were added to the network, and in 2009 Shanghai was added, all from the Newark hub.

United repainted this aircraft to the standard Globe livery in May 2016, and then painted a different airframe in the Blue Skyway, sister ship N75435. The reason for the change is currently unknown to the public.\n\nFirst Class was offered on Domestic Flights, and BusinessFirst was offered on Transatlantic/Transpacific Flights.\n\nContinental Airlines was one of three carriers (with [[American Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]]) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired [[McDonnell Douglas]], the European Union forced Boeing to void the contracts. Both parties had been adhering to the terms under a [[gentlemen's agreement]].\n\nContinental was one of the first major airlines to fly Boeing 757s on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a fuel stop which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller [[seating capacity]] allowed for \"thin\" routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It allowed non-stop service from smaller cities, such as [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland and [[Hamburg]], Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, or Frankfurt, in order to travel to New York. United retains a number of these flight routes, mostly based out of Newark, including Newark-Hamburg, Newark-Dublin, and Newark-Berlin.\n\n===Historic fleet===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''CAL, March 1960'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200497.html |title=Flight International April 8, 1960 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707\u2013120]]\n|4\n|1\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-3]]\n|10\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]\n|1\n|0\n|Leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]B\n|2\n|0\n|1 leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-7]]B\n|5\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 812]]\n|15\n|\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''37'''\n|'''1'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, March 1970'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%200529.html |title=Flight International March 26, 1970 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Concorde]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not delivered\n|-\n|[[Boeing 2707]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not manufactured\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320C]]\n|13\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 720B]]\n|8\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100C]]\n|1\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|12\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]]\n|0\n|4\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-10F]]\n|19\n|0\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''62'''\n|'''10'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, July 1980'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%201919.html|title=World Airline Directory 1980|publisher=Flight International |date=July 26, 1980|accessdate=December 11, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]]\n|16\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|36\n|9\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10]]\n|7\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10CF]]\n|6\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-30]]\n|0\n|2\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''65'''\n|'''11'''\n|\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Cabin===\nContinental Airlines had a two-class service configuration, First/BusinessFirst and Economy Class, for aircraft in the mainline fleets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |title=Continental Airlines Aircraft Information |publisher=Continental.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102529/https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====BusinessFirst====\nContinental had begun deploying BusinessFirst seats that allowed customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m}} of sleeping space in the fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft.

Installation on the [[Boeing 767]] fleet was to follow in 2011. The anticipated completion of the roll-out across Continental's entire international fleet was planned for August 2012. In addition, all 787 deliveries were to have the seats installed.\n\nContinental considered BusinessFirst to be its signature onboard product, and the service is a frequent subject of advertising campaigns. Customers seated in the BusinessFirst cabin on longhaul flights from the United States to Europe, Asia, select cities in South America, and the Middle East received special ground services, including EliteAccess priority bag service at check-in, expedited security screening (where available), access to Continental's Presidents Club or affiliated Star Alliance lounges, personalized Continental Concierge service, and dedicated boarding procedures.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines BusinessFirst entree.jpg|thumb|In-flight meal in BusinessFirst]]\n\nOn board, multi-course meals were designed by Continental's Congress of Chefs, beverages were selected by Continental's Wine Masters, and service was provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights had at least two meal services. Entertainment was offered at each individual seat, and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft had access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft featured older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft were expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also were provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access to shower facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.\n\nContinental offered a modified BusinessFirst service on flights from the United States mainland to Hawaii. All flights offered the same suite of EliteAccess ground services, along with a similar main meal service on board. Amenities such as pillows and headsets also were the same, but no amenity kits were offered. On flights from Newark and Houston to Honolulu, Continental operated Boeing 767-400ER aircraft with typical recliner-style BusinessFirst seats. On flights from Los Angeles and Orange County to Honolulu/Kahului with [[Boeing 737]] equipment, domestic First Class seats were substituted. Nonstop flights from Guam to Honolulu were exempt from most of these modifications and more closely resembled the standard BusinessFirst service.\n\nNo complimentary upgrades were offered to Continental OnePass Elite members on any intercontinental flights offering BusinessFirst service. However, on 767-operated BusinessFirst services to Hawaii, Continental offered a day-of-departure buy up fee for any revenue coach class fare, provided seats were available. Mainland-Hawaii was the only BusinessFirst market where such upgrades are available. In addition, OnePass Elites were eligible for complimentary automatic upgrades on Continental-operated flights from California to Hawaii.\n[[File:Continental Airlines domestic First Class dinner.jpg|thumb|left|Domestic First Class dinner]]\n\n====Domestic First Class====\nDomestic First Class was offered on domestic flights.

When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde's left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured.

The 1958 result was helped by an alliance with [[Maurice Duplessis]]'s formidable provincial electoral machine. But by the [[1962 Canadian federal election|1962 election]], Duplessis had died and his ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' party was out of office and in disarray, and Diefenbaker's support in Quebec had evaporated.  The Mulroney-era resurgence also collapsed entirely when he retired from politics.\n\nThe ''[[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' was formed for the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]] in the aftermath of the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]], and has won more seats in Quebec than the Liberals in every election it has run in. The number of seats won by the Bloc has declined in each successive election from 1993 to 1997 to 2000. The party has now had a resurgence due to the [[2004 Canadian sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal]] and the unpopularity of [[Jean Charest]]'s provincial [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government, which influences support for the federal Liberals even though the two parties are independent of one another.\n\nPolls show the Bloc with a strong lead, and they may return to the number of seats they had in 1993.  However, the Liberals are likely to dominate in many parts of Montreal. Ridings where Anglophone voters are a significant factor are among the safest Liberal seats in all of Canada.\n\nThe other two major federal parties, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) are not expected to win any seats and are struggling to move out of single digits in the polls.  The NDP in particular has historically never had any electoral success in Quebec up to that point.\n\n====Eastern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-e}}\n\n====C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-cn}}\n\n====Quebec City====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Quebec City}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-qc}}\n\n====Central Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-c}}\n\n====Eastern Townships====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Eastern Townships}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-et}}\n\n====Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mt}}\n\n====Eastern Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-me}}\n\n====Western Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Western Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mw}}\n\n====Northern Montreal and Laval====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Northern Montreal and Laval}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mn}}\n\n====Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-lo}}\n\n===Ontario===\n[[Image:Flag of Ontario.svg|150px|left]] Ontario was predicted to be the battle ground of this election. Most pundits believed that this is where the election was lost for the Conservatives. Ontario is home to more than one third of all of Canada's ridings. In the last three elections, right wing vote splitting has resulted in just six riding losses for the Liberals, compared to 299 riding wins. However, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives have merged, and they should win many seats in Ontario, especially in rural ridings in midwestern Ontario, Central-eastern Ontario, and Central Ontario. The NDP has some support in various pockets in Ontario in the past, but has only won one riding in the last three elections, and one more in a by-election, both in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]. However, the NDP was expected to do well not only in Windsor, but in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Downtown [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa Centre]], and possibly even in [[Northern Ontario]].\n\n====Ottawa====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Ottawa}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-o}}\n\n====Eastern Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-e}}\n\n====Central Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-c}}\n\n====Southern Durham and York====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=80%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|This sprawling and rapidly growing [[suburban]] area to the north and east of the City of [[Toronto]] encompasses the eastern portion of what Canadian political watchers in the early nineties dubbed the \"[[905 belt]]\"\u2014a swath of middle class suburban voters roughly corresponding to the same boundaries of the [[North American area code 905|905 Area Code]] that can be readily tipped from the Liberal to the Conservative column.  905's buy-in on the provincial level to [[Mike Harris]]'s [[Common Sense Revolution]] secured him two conservative majority governments, while its rejection of the Tories in 2002 paved the way for [[Dalton McGuinty]]'s landslide. 905 solidly supported the Chr\u00e9tien Liberals, but Conservatives hope that the absence of vote-splitting and rising national fortunes can lead to substantial pickups on election night.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 - [[Ivan Grose|Grose]] lost nomination\n<br />2 - [[Elinor Caplan|Caplan]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The three seats that went Liberal were Guelph and Kitchener (1980) and Haldimand-Norfolk (1988). Since the collapse of the Conservatives, and vote splitting the Liberals swept this area in 1993, 1997 and 2000. However, with a united right, this is unlikely to be duplicated a fourth time.\n<br />'''Notes:''' \n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Jane Stewart (politician)|Stewart]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[John Baird Finlay|Finlay]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Liberals do well in the cities of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[London, Ontario|London]], and Conservatives do well in the rural areas of Kent County, Essex County, Lambton County, Elgin County, and Middlesex County. The NDP also has done well in the past, and currently in Windsor and London, where unions are strong. The NDP was elected in both Windsor-Walkerville and London-Fanshawe in 1984 and 1988, and hold both Windsor seats currently. The Liberas swept all but the riding of Elgin in 1980, the Conservatives swept all but the two Windsor ridings in 1984, and one London riding. The Liberals swept every single riding here in 1993 and 1997, and all but the riding of Windsor-St. Clair in 2000. \n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Conservatives have only won a combined total of 9 seats in Northern Ontario since 1979, 4 of which in the very Conservative Parry Sound Muskoka. The NDP has consistently done well here, finishing either first or second, even if it means not winning seats. They are especially strong in Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Nickel Belt, and Sault Ste. Marie, but have also won seats in Kenora-Rainy River, Thunder Bay-Nipigon, and Timmins Chapleau. The only bad showing by the Liberals since 1979 came in 1984, where they still managed 3 of 12 seats winning in Algoma, Sudbury, and Cochrane despite a national Conservative landslide.\n<br />'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Bob Nault|Nault]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Bob Wood (Liberal)|Wood]] not seeking re-election\n<br />3 -  [[Stan Dromisky|Dromisky]] not seeking re-election\n<br />4 -  [[R\u00e9ginald B\u00e9lair|B\u00e9lair]] and [[Ben Serr\u00e9|Serr\u00e9]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

This is especially true in the city of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] where most Manitobans live. However, due to vote splitting in recent elections, neither the Progressive Conservatives or the Canadian Alliance/Reform Party have been able to win in Winnipeg. In rural Manitoba, the Liberals are usually shut out of elections (exception in 1993). Conservative support is normally in the more populous south, with NDP support in the sparsely populated north, which usually only means one seat.\n\n====Rural Manitoba====\n  {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|\n\nRural Manitoba is traditionally very Conservative, sith some NDP leanings.  Vote splitting only effected this area in 1993, when the Liberals nearly swept the region, winning all but one seat. In 1997 they could keep one. The Progressive Conservatives did their best here, out of all of western Canada, winning the riding of Brandon-Souris in both 1997 and 2000. The NDP's strength lies in the riding of [[Churchill (electoral district)|Churchill]], in northern Manitoba where they have consistently won in.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Rick Borotsik|Borotsik]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Howard Hilstrom|Hilstrom]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

Traditionally, Saskatchewan has been a two-way race between the Conservatives, and later the Reform/Alliance and the NDP. Recent vote splitting has allowed the Liberals to come through and win a few seats in this polarized province. Urban Saskatchewan has tended to vote NDP and rural Saskatchewan has tended to vote Conservative. This is especially true in provincial politics, where riding boundaries more reflect the urban/rural divide. Both Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewans largest cities are split into 4 ridings each. All eight of these ridings are generally split evenly between rural and urban.

You need only look at the results of the ridings here in the last century to prove this. Alberta has long been a Progressive Conservative province, but with the collapse of the party in 1993, Albertans went to the Reform Party of Canada (later the Canadian Alliance) for their vote. Edmonton seems to be the only exception to this. The Liberals have won in Edmonton six times since 1993, and the NDP has won in Edmonton as well.\n\n====Rural Alberta====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|This region is unarguably the most Conservative region in Canada.

The two Liberal incumbents are both in close races, and the new Conservative Party of Canada could possibly sweep Edmonton, and therefore all of Alberta. \n<br />'''Notes:'''\n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Deborah Grey|Grey]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cornflowerblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''2004'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cadetblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1997 Canadian federal election|1997]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>  \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>   \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]'''\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=16% rowspan=2|Electoral District\n!colspan=5|Candidates\n!width=14% rowspan=2|Incumbent\n|-\n!width=14% bgcolor=lightcoral|<br />[[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=cornflowerblue|<br />[[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=sandybrown|<br />[[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrats]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=yellowgreen|<br />[[Green Party of Canada|Green]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=gainsboro|Other\t\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton\u2014Beaumont]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|[[David Kilgour]] <br /> 17,555\n|[[Tim Uppal]] <br /> 17,421\n|Paul Reikie <br /> 3,975\n|Michael Garfinkle <br /> 1,911\n|[[Naomi Rankin]] (Comm.) <br /> 135\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|David Kilgour\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton Centre]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|'''[[Anne McLellan]]''' <br /> 22,560\n|[[Laurie Hawn]] <br /> 21,839\n|Meghan McMaster <br /> 4,836\n|[[David J.

British Columbia has a history of voting against the government. This has meant the NDP in the 1980s and the Reform/Canadian Alliance in the 1990s. More recently, regional trends have started to appear in B.C. The interior votes very Conservative, as the Canadian Alliance swept this area in 2000. B.C. has in the past been a province that would swing from one extreme to the other going for the right wing Social Credit to the left wing NDP in the past, in not only federal elections but provincial elections. The NDP also does well in British Columbia, or at least has in the past. Recently, they have been reduced to seats in the Vancouver area. There is hope that they will return to more traditional NDP seats on Vancouver Island, and in the interior. The Liberals have also won a few seats in B.C. recently, an area they have traditionally done very poor. Their strengths are in Victoria and in Vancouver.\n\n====Interior B.C.====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the British Columbia Interior}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-in}}\n\n====Fraser Valley and Southern Lower Mainland====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Fraser Valley and Southern Lower Mainland}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-fv}}\n\n====Vancouver and Northern Lower Mainland====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Vancouver and the Northern Lower Mainland}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-vn}}\n\n====Vancouver Island====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Vancouver Island}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/bc-vi}}\n\n===Nunavut===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/nu}}\n\n===Northwest Territories===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/nt}}\n\n===Yukon===\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/yk}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=ele&document=index&dir=38e/loc&lang=e&textonly=false Complete List of Official Candidates&mdash;Elections Canada]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090705085708/http://www.electionalmanac.com/canada/ Election Almanac - Canada Federal Election]\n* http://www.electionprediction.org/2004_fed/\n\n{{See also|list of Canada's electoral districts}}\n\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004A}}\n\n[[Category:2004 Canadian federal election]]\n", "text_old": "This is a seat by seat list of '''candidates in the 2004 Canadian election'''.\n\nFor more information about the election see [[2004 Canadian federal election]].\n\n==2004 federal redistribution==\nDue to the 2001 census, Canada's 301 electoral districts increased to 308 as of April 1, 2004.

The 1958 result was helped by an alliance with [[Maurice Duplessis]]'s formidable provincial electoral machine. But by the [[1962 Canadian federal election|1962 election]], Duplessis had died and his ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' party was out of office and in disarray, and Diefenbaker's support in Quebec had evaporated.  The Mulroney-era resurgence also collapsed entirely when he retired from politics.\n\nThe ''[[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' was formed for the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]] in the aftermath of the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]], and has won more seats in Quebec than the Liberals in every election it has run in. The number of seats won by the Bloc has declined in each successive election from 1993 to 1997 to 2000. The party has now had a resurgence due to the [[2004 Canadian sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal]] and the unpopularity of [[Jean Charest]]'s provincial [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government, which influences support for the federal Liberals even though the two parties are independent of one another.\n\nPolls show the Bloc with a strong lead, and they may return to the number of seats they had in 1993.  However, the Liberals are likely to dominate in many parts of Montreal. Ridings where Anglophone voters are a significant factor are among the safest Liberal seats in all of Canada.\n\nThe other two major federal parties, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) are not expected to win any seats and are struggling to move out of single digits in the polls.  The NDP in particular has historically never had any electoral success in Quebec up to that point.\n\n====Eastern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-e}}\n\n====C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-cn}}\n\n====Quebec City====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Quebec City}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-qc}}\n\n====Central Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-c}}\n\n====Eastern Townships====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Eastern Townships}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-et}}\n\n====Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mt}}\n\n====Eastern Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-me}}\n\n====Western Montreal====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Western Montreal}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mw}}\n\n====Northern Montreal and Laval====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Northern Montreal and Laval}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-mn}}\n\n====Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in the Laurentides, Outaouais and Northern Quebec}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-lo}}\n\n===Ontario===\n[[Image:Flag of Ontario.svg|150px|left]] Ontario was predicted to be the battle ground of this election. Most pundits believed that this is where the election was lost for the Conservatives. Ontario is home to more than one third of all of Canada's ridings. In the last three elections, right wing vote splitting has resulted in just six riding losses for the Liberals, compared to 299 riding wins. However, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives have merged, and they should win many seats in Ontario, especially in rural ridings in midwestern Ontario, Central-eastern Ontario, and Central Ontario. The NDP has some support in various pockets in Ontario in the past, but has only won one riding in the last three elections, and one more in a by-election, both in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]. However, the NDP was expected to do well not only in Windsor, but in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Downtown [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa Centre]], and possibly even in [[Northern Ontario]].\n\n====Ottawa====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Ottawa}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-o}}\n\n====Eastern Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Eastern Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-e}}\n\n====Central Ontario====\n{{see also|Canadian federal election results in Central Ontario}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/on-c}}\n\n====Southern Durham and York====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=80%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|This sprawling and rapidly growing [[suburban]] area to the north and east of the City of [[Toronto]] encompasses the eastern portion of what Canadian political watchers in the early nineties dubbed the \"[[905 belt]]\"\u2014a swath of middle class suburban voters roughly corresponding to the same boundaries of the [[North American area code 905|905 Area Code]] that can be readily tipped from the Liberal to the Conservative column.  905's buy-in on the provincial level to [[Mike Harris]]'s [[Common Sense Revolution]] secured him two conservative majority governments, while its rejection of the Tories in 2002 paved the way for [[Dalton McGuinty]]'s landslide. 905 solidly supported the Chr\u00e9tien Liberals, but Conservatives hope that the absence of vote-splitting and rising national fortunes can lead to substantial pickups on election night.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 - [[Ivan Grose|Grose]] lost nomination\n<br />2 - [[Elinor Caplan|Caplan]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

Brant is where the NDP did will with popular MP [[Derek Blackburn]] from 1971 to 1993. However, the NDP have been unable to duplicate this success in this area, and are unlikely to do so. The Conservatives won every other seat except for three seats in 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1988 sweeping the area (except for Brant) in 1984 and 1979. The three seats that went Liberal were Guelph and Kitchener (1980) and Haldimand-Norfolk (1988). Since the collapse of the Conservatives, and vote splitting the Liberals swept this area in 1993, 1997 and 2000. However, with a united right, this is unlikely to be duplicated a fourth time.\n<br />'''Notes:''' \n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Jane Stewart (politician)|Stewart]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[John Baird Finlay|Finlay]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Liberals do well in the cities of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[London, Ontario|London]], and Conservatives do well in the rural areas of Kent County, Essex County, Lambton County, Elgin County, and Middlesex County. The NDP also has done well in the past, and currently in Windsor and London, where unions are strong. The NDP was elected in both Windsor-Walkerville and London-Fanshawe in 1984 and 1988, and hold both Windsor seats currently. The Liberas swept all but the riding of Elgin in 1980, the Conservatives swept all but the two Windsor ridings in 1984, and one London riding. The Liberals swept every single riding here in 1993 and 1997, and all but the riding of Windsor-St. Clair in 2000. \n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:lightcoral;

The Conservatives have only won a combined total of 9 seats in Northern Ontario since 1979, 4 of which in the very Conservative Parry Sound Muskoka. The NDP has consistently done well here, finishing either first or second, even if it means not winning seats. They are especially strong in Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Nickel Belt, and Sault Ste. Marie, but have also won seats in Kenora-Rainy River, Thunder Bay-Nipigon, and Timmins Chapleau. The only bad showing by the Liberals since 1979 came in 1984, where they still managed 3 of 12 seats winning in Algoma, Sudbury, and Cochrane despite a national Conservative landslide.\n<br />'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Bob Nault|Nault]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Bob Wood (Liberal)|Wood]] not seeking re-election\n<br />3 -  [[Stan Dromisky|Dromisky]] not seeking re-election\n<br />4 -  [[R\u00e9ginald B\u00e9lair|B\u00e9lair]] and [[Ben Serr\u00e9|Serr\u00e9]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

This is especially true in the city of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] where most Manitobans live. However, due to vote splitting in recent elections, neither the Progressive Conservatives or the Canadian Alliance/Reform Party have been able to win in Winnipeg. In rural Manitoba, the Liberals are usually shut out of elections (exception in 1993). Conservative support is normally in the more populous south, with NDP support in the sparsely populated north, which usually only means one seat.\n\n====Rural Manitoba====\n  {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|\n\nRural Manitoba is traditionally very Conservative, sith some NDP leanings.  Vote splitting only effected this area in 1993, when the Liberals nearly swept the region, winning all but one seat. In 1997 they could keep one. The Progressive Conservatives did their best here, out of all of western Canada, winning the riding of Brandon-Souris in both 1997 and 2000. The NDP's strength lies in the riding of [[Churchill (electoral district)|Churchill]], in northern Manitoba where they have consistently won in.\n\n'''Notes:'''<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Rick Borotsik|Borotsik]] not seeking re-election\n<br />2 -  [[Howard Hilstrom|Hilstrom]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown;

Traditionally, Saskatchewan has been a two-way race between the Conservatives, and later the Reform/Alliance and the NDP. Recent vote splitting has allowed the Liberals to come through and win a few seats in this polarized province. Urban Saskatchewan has tended to vote NDP and rural Saskatchewan has tended to vote Conservative. This is especially true in provincial politics, where riding boundaries more reflect the urban/rural divide. Both Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewans largest cities are split into 4 ridings each. All eight of these ridings are generally split evenly between rural and urban. Northern Saskatchewan has in the past been the stand-alone region of rural Saskatchewan, usually voting for the NDP.\n\n====Southern Saskatchewan====\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=100%|Profile & Notes\n!colspan=2|Electoral History\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke rowspan=8 valign=top|\n\nSouthern Saskatchewan is traditionally split between the NDP and the Conservatives.

Much like the rest of Alberta, Edmonton usually always votes for the leading right wing party of the day. This is the one area of Alberta where the Liberals have been able to win anything in recent years, winning two seats in both 1997 and 2000, and four seats in 1993. The NDP have also won a seat in Edmonton, doing so in 1988. The two Liberal incumbents are both in close races, and the new Conservative Party of Canada could possibly sweep Edmonton, and therefore all of Alberta. \n<br />'''Notes:'''\n<small>\n<br />1 -  [[Deborah Grey|Grey]] not seeking re-election\n</small>\n|bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cornflowerblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''2004'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:cadetblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1997 Canadian federal election|1997]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:lightcoral; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumseagreen; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:sandybrown; font-size:135%;\">\u2022</span><span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span> \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>  \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>   \n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]]'''\n|-\n|colspan=1 bgcolor=darkgray align=right valign=center|<span style=\"color:mediumslateblue; font-size:135%;\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</span>\n|bgcolor=darkgray valign=center|'''[[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]'''\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=gray\n!width=16% rowspan=2|Electoral District\n!colspan=5|Candidates\n!width=14% rowspan=2|Incumbent\n|-\n!width=14% bgcolor=lightcoral|<br />[[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=cornflowerblue|<br />[[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=sandybrown|<br />[[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrats]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=yellowgreen|<br />[[Green Party of Canada|Green]]\n!width=14% bgcolor=gainsboro|Other\t\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton\u2014Beaumont]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|[[David Kilgour]] <br /> 17,555\n|[[Tim Uppal]] <br /> 17,421\n|Paul Reikie <br /> 3,975\n|Michael Garfinkle <br /> 1,911\n|[[Naomi Rankin]] (Comm.) <br /> 135\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|David Kilgour\n|-\n|bgcolor=whitesmoke|[[Edmonton Centre]]\n|bgcolor=lightcoral|'''[[Anne McLellan]]''' <br /> 22,560\n|[[Laurie Hawn]] <br /> 21,839\n|Meghan McMaster <br /> 4,836\n|[[David J.

British Columbia has a history of voting against the government. This has meant the NDP in the 1980s and the Reform/Canadian Alliance in the 1990s. More recently, regional trends have started to appear in B.C. The interior votes very Conservative, as the Canadian Alliance swept this area in 2000. B.C. has in the past been a province that would swing from one extreme to the other going for the right wing Social Credit to the left wing NDP in the past, in not only federal elections but provincial elections. The NDP also does well in British Columbia, or at least has in the past. Recently, they have been reduced to seats in the Vancouver area. There is hope that they will return to more traditional NDP seats on Vancouver Island, and in the interior.

McLouth\n| products      = Low carbon and stainless strip steel\n}}\n'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the United States and had three locations. \n\nThe first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit and Trenton plants have been demolished, while the Gibraltar plant has been purchased and restarted by Ferrolux.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department, newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nMcLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| name          = McLouth Steel Corporation\n| logo          = [[image:McLouth Steel Logo.svg|200px]]\n| fate          = Bankruptcy\n| successor     = Detroit Steel Company\n| foundation    = 1934\n| defunct       = 1996\n| location      = [[Detroit, MI]] 1934-1981, [[Trenton, MI]] 1982-1996\n| industry      = [[Steel]]\n| key_people    = Donald B.

The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the United States and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. \n\nThe Detroit and Trenton plants have been demolished, while the Gibraltar plant has been purchased and restarted by Ferrolux.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation.

The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department, newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nMcLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Ty5150", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLouth_Steel"}

He [[History of Barcelona#Barcelona in the Spanish March|conquered Barcelona]] from the [[Muslims]] in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over [[Pamplona]] and the [[Basques]] south of the [[Pyrenees]] in 812. As emperor he included his adult sons, [[Lothair I|Lothair]], [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], and [[Louis the German|Louis]], in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them. The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew [[Bernard of Italy]], for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement.\n\nIn the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons, only exacerbated by Louis's attempts to include his son [[Charles the Bald|Charles]] by his second wife in the succession plans. Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war. Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father, though the problems he faced were of a distinctly different sort.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/24403332?seq=1 |title= Louis the Pious Reconsidered |publisher=  JSTOR | date=   | author=F.

Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 116.</ref> In the following year he was sent to Aquitaine accompanied by [[regent]]s and a court. Charlemagne constituted this sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his realm after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under [[Waiofar|Waifer]] (capitulated ''c''. 768) and later [[Hunald II]], which culminated in the disastrous [[Battle of Roncesvalles]] (778). Charlemagne wanted his son Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, in 785, wary of the customs his son may have been taking in Aquitaine, Charlemagne, who after Hildegard's death in 783, had remarried Fastrada, sent for Louis in 785. Louis presented himself in Saxony at the royal [[Council of Paderborn]] dressed in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.<ref name=jong/>\n\nIn 794, Charlemagne gave four former [[Gallo-Roman]] villas to Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: [[Dou\u00e9-la-Fontaine]] in today's [[Anjou]], [[Ebreuil]] in Allier, [[Angeac-Charente]], and the disputed Cassinogilum. Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at a young age. The marches - peripheral principalities - played a vital role as bullwarks against exterior threats to the empire. Louis reigned over the [[Spanish March]]. In 797, [[Barcelona]], the largest city of the ''Marca'', fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including [[Gascons]] with their duke [[Sancho I of Gascony]], [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] under [[Leibulf of Provence|Leibulf]], and [[Visigoths|Goths]] under [[Bera, Count of Barcelona|Bera]], over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|author=David Levering Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zxuar_ISdcUC&pg=PA312|date=12 January 2009|publisher=W.

His twin brother, Lothair died during infancy. According to the  Frankish custom of [[partible inheritance]], Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, [[Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], and [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]]. In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], Provence, and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. However, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died \u2013 Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 \u2013 and Louis was crowned co-emperor with an already ailing Charlemagne in Aachen in 813.

Louis, having barely survived and feeling the imminent danger of death, began planning for his succession. Three months later among the approval of his Aachen court and the clergy he issued an imperial decree of eighteen chapters, the ''Ordinatio Imperii'', that laid out plans for an orderly dynastic succession. The term ''Ordinatio Imperii'' is a modern (19th century) creation. The decree is called ''divisio imperii'' in the only surviving contemporary manuscript.<ref name=jong/> \n\nIn 815, Louis had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] to govern [[Bavaria]] and Aquitaine respectively, though without the royal titles. He proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:\n\n* Lothair was proclaimed and crowned co-emperor in Aachen by his father. He was promised the succession to most of the Frankish dominions (excluding the exceptions below), and would be the overlord of his brothers and cousin.\n* Pepin was proclaimed King of Aquitaine, his territory including Gascony, the march around Toulouse, and the counties of Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers.\n* [[Louis the German|Louis]], the youngest son, was proclaimed King of Bavaria and the neighbouring marches.\n\nIf one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons. If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom. In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious' younger sons would be chosen to replace him by \"the people\". Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory.\n\nWith this settlement, Louis attempted to combine his sense for the Empire's unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons. Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share.\n\nThe decree failed to create order as it omitted Bernard, who immediately began to conspire. When Louis began to issue changes in favor of his second wife [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith's]] son [[Charles the Bald]], his sons Lothar, Pepin and Louis refused to accept. The rule of sons being favoured over brothers in succession remained also untouched.<ref name=jong/>\n\n===Bernard's rebellion and Louis's penance===\n[[File:Louis the Pious.jpg|thumb|Louis the Pious doing penance at Attigny in 822]]\nThe ''ordinatio imperii'' of Aachen left Bernard in Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence. Upon hearing of this, Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and headed for [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]]. Intimidated by the emperor's swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered. He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason. Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony. Others also suffered: [[Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans]], in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, dying soon afterwards; it was rumored that he had been poisoned.<ref>''The Frankish Kingdoms, 814\u2013898: The West'', Janet L. Nelson, ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, 700\u2013900'', Vol. II, ed. Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), 114.</ref> The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis's conscience for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed [[penance]] for causing Bernard's death, at his palace of [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] near Vouziers in the [[Ardennes]], before [[Pope Paschal I]], and a council of clerics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, [[Hugh (abbot of Saint-Quentin)|Hugo]] whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] whom he soon made [[Bishop of Metz]], and Theodoric. This act of contrition, partly in emulation of [[Theodosius I]], had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice. He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house.<ref name=jong/>\n\n===Frontier wars===\n{{unref|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Louis le Pieu denier Sens 818 823.jpg|left|thumb|Louis on a ''[[denarius]]'' from [[Sens]], 818\u2013823]]\nAt the start of Louis's reign, the many tribes \u2013 [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Obotrites]], [[Slovenes]], [[Bretons]], [[Basques]] \u2013 which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor's power and dared not stir up any trouble. In 816, however, the [[Sorbs]] rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818. Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace of the Franks in a short time.\n\nA greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast. There, [[Ljudevit]], duke of [[Pannonia]], was harassing the border at the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers. The [[margrave of Friuli]], [[Cadolah]], was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margravate was invaded by Slovenes. In 821, an alliance was made with [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], duke of the [[Dalmatia]], and Liudewit was brought to heel. In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of [[Bulgaria]] acknowledged Louis's suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]], in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in [[Pannonia]] and regained their lands.\n\nOn the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard [[list of Dukes and Princes of Benevento|princes of Benevento]] whom Charlemagne had never subjugated. He extracted promises from Princes [[Grimoald IV of Benevento|Grimoald IV]] and [[Sico of Benevento|Sico]], but to no effect.\n\nOn the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c. 812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees 'to settle matters' in Pamplona. The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basques]] in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i.e. hostages. [[Semen Lop of Gascony|S\u00e9guin]], duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]], was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax. Seguin was replaced by [[Lop III Centullo of Gascony|Lupus III]], who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor. In 820 an assembly at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]] decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827). The counts in charge of the army, [[Hugh of Tours|Hugh]], count of [[Tours]], and [[Matfrid of Orl\u00e9ans|Matfrid]], count of [[Orl\u00e9ans]], were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught.\n\n===First civil war===\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France - Bible de Vivien Ms. Latin 1 folio 423r d\u00e9tail Le comte Vivien offre le manuscrit de la Bible faite \u00e0 l'abbaye de Saint-Martin de Tours \u00e0 Charles le Chauve.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Louis's son [[Charles the Bald]] as depicted in the [[First Bible of Charles the Bald|Vivian Bible]], c.\u2009845]]\nIn 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to [[Brittany]], he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye|Ermengarde]]. Ermengarde was the daughter of [[Ingerman, Count of Hesbania|Ingerman]], the duke of Hesbaye. Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking. It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew's death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event. It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]], daughter of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], count of [[Altdorf (Weingarten)|Altdorf]]. In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named [[Charles the Bald|Charles]].\n\nThe birth of this son damaged the ''Partition of Aachen'', as Louis's attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war.\n\nAt [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 829, Louis gave [[Alemannia]] to Charles, with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair,<ref>Paired gold medallions of father and son had been struck on the occasion of the synod of Paris (825) that asserted Frankish claims as emperor, recently denigrated by the Byzantines; see Karl F. Morrison, \"The Gold Medallions of Louis the Pious and Lothaire I and the Synod of Paris (825)\" ''Speculum'' '''36'''.4 (October 1961:592\u2013599).</ref> whose promised share was thereby diminished. An insurrection was soon at hand.\n\nWith the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles. Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them. [[Agobard]], [[Archbishop of Lyon]], and Jesse of Amiens, [[bishop of Amiens]], too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels.\n\nIn 830, at Wala's insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of [[Gascony|Gascon]]s, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris. At [[Verberie]], Louis the German joined him. At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself. He marched as far as [[Compi\u00e8gne]], an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin's forces and captured. Judith was incarcerated at [[Poitiers]] and Bernard fled to Barcelona.\n\nThen Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father. When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in [[Nijmegen]], in the heart of [[Austrasia]], the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831). Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy.\n\nPepin returned to Aquitaine and Judith \u2013 after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence \u2013 to Louis's court. Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]]. Although [[Hilduin]], abbot of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]], was exiled to [[Paderborn]] and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps; they did not lose their freedom.<ref name=jong/>\n\n===Second civil war===\nThe next revolt occurred a mere two years later, in 832. The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father's court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father's orders. Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of [[Slavic peoples|Slav]] allies and conquered [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]] before the emperor could react. Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm. At [[Jonac]], he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war. Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father's authority. His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles.\n\nSoon Lothair, with the support of [[Pope Gregory IV]], whom he had confirmed in office without his father's support, joined the revolt in 833. While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north. Louis marched south. The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld. There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks. Soon much of Louis's army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because \"it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account.\" The resigned emperor was taken to [[Abbey of Saint-M\u00e9dard de Soissons|Saint-M\u00e9dard de Soissons]], his son Charles to [[Pr\u00fcm]], and the queen to [[Tortona]]. The despicable show of disloyalty and disingenuousness earned the site the name [[Field of Lies]], or L\u00fcgenfeld, or Campus Mendacii, ''ubi plurimorum fidelitas exstincta est''.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0459/_P16.HTM].</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis le Pieux sesquisolidus 814 840.jpg|thumb|Louis on a ''[[sesquisolidus]]'', essentially Roman in design.<ref>''Medieval European Coinage'' by [[Philip Grierson]], Mark Blackburn, [[Lucia Travaini]], p. 329 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkz9NGFXIMC&pg=PA327&dq=manqush+coin#PPA329,M1]</ref>]]\n\nOn 13 November 833, [[Ebbo]], with [[Agobard of Lyon]], presided over a synod at the Church of Saint Medard in Soissons which saw Louis undertake public [[penance]] for the second time in his reign. The penitential ritual that was undertaken began when Louis arrived at the church and confessed multiple times to the crimes levied against him. The crimes had been historic and recent, with accusations of oath breaking, violation of the public peace and inability to control his adulterous wife, [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]].<ref> Mayke De Jong, \"Power and Humility in Carolingian society: the Public Penance of Louis the Pious\", ''Early Medieval Europe'' 1 (1992). p. 29. </ref> Afterwards, he threw his sword belt at the base of the altar and received judgement through the imposition of the hands of the bishops.<ref> Agobard, \"Personal Attestation to the Penance of Louis the Pious\" in Lievan Van Acker (ed.)

Ebbo himself received the monastery of [[St Vaast]] whilst [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] was allowed to keep the lands reclaimed from his father. \n\nMen like [[Rabanus Maurus]], Louis' younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith's sister and Louis the German's new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire. The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compi\u00e8gne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and [[Saxony]] against Lothair, and the usurper fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], skirmishing with loyalists near [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]]. Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834.\n\nOn Lothair's return to Italy, Wala, Jesse, and Matfrid, formerly count of Orl\u00e9ans, died of a pestilence. On 2 February 835 at the palace [[Thionville]], Louis presided over a general council to deal with the events of the previous year. Known as the [[Synod of Thionville]], Louis himself was reinvested with his ancestral garb and the crown, symbols of [[Carolingian]] rulership. Furthermore, the penance of 833 was officially reversed and Archbishop  [[Ebbo]] officially resigned after confessing to a capital crime, whilst [[Agobard of Lyon]] and Bartholmew, Archbishop of Narbonne were also deposed.<ref> ''The Annals of Saint Bertin'', trans. Janet L. Nelson (Manchester, 1991), pp. 32\u201333. </ref> Later that year Lothair fell ill; once again the events turned in Louis favour.\n\nIn 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of [[Cr\u00e9mieu]]. At about that time, the [[Vikings]] terrorized and sacked [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Antwerp]]. In 837, they went up the [[Rhine]] as far as Nijmegen, and their king, [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]], demanded the [[weregild]] of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them. They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts. In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over [[Frisia]], but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839. Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of ''[[missus dominicus|missi dominici]]'' into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\">{{cite book|author=Pierre Riche|title=The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcjy7bCmFL0C|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1342-4}}</ref>\n\n===Third civil war===\nIn 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis' land. Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], giving all of the young king of Bavaria's lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles. Emperor Louis did not stop there, however. His devotion to Charles knew no bounds. When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]]. When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out. In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the [[Loire]], and the Danes returned to ravage the [[Frisia]]n coast (sacking [[Dorestad]] for a second time).\n\nLothair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance. At a final ''[[placitum]]'' held at Worms on 20 May, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western. Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles. The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-en-Auvergne]] in 840. Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the [[March of Pannonia|Ostmark]]. The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he disbanded the army. The final civil war of his reign was over.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\"/>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Partage de l'Empire carolingien au Trait\u00e9 de Verdun en 843.JPG|thumb|200px|The parting of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.]]\nLouis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and retreated to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine near his [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|palace at Ingelheim]]. He died on 20 June 840 in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo as he pardoned his son Louis, proclaimed Lothair emperor and commended the absent Charles and Judith to his protection. \n\nSoon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into yet another civil war. It lasted until 843 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Verdun]], in which the division of the empire into three souvereign entities was settled. [[West Francia]] and [[East Francia]] became the kernels of modern France and Germany respectively.

He was also [[King of Aquitaine]] from 781.\nAs the only surviving adult son of Charlemagne and [[Hildegard of the Vinzgau|Hildegard]], he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father's death in 814, a position which he held until his death, save for the period 833\u201334, during which he was deposed.\n\nDuring his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the empire's southwestern frontier. He [[History of Barcelona#Barcelona in the Spanish March|conquered Barcelona]] from the [[Muslims]] in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over [[Pamplona]] and the [[Basques]] south of the [[Pyrenees]] in 812. As emperor he included his adult sons, [[Lothair I|Lothair]], [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], and [[Louis the German|Louis]], in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them. The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew [[Bernard of Italy]], for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement.\n\nIn the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons, only exacerbated by Louis's attempts to include his son [[Charles the Bald|Charles]] by his second wife in the succession plans. Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war. Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father, though the problems he faced were of a distinctly different sort.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/24403332?seq=1 |title= Louis the Pious Reconsidered |publisher=  JSTOR | date=   | author=F.

Charlemagne constituted this sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his realm after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under [[Waiofar|Waifer]] (capitulated ''c''. 768) and later [[Hunald II]], which culminated in the disastrous [[Battle of Roncesvalles]] (778). Charlemagne wanted his son Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, in 785, wary of the customs his son may have been taking in Aquitaine, Charlemagne, who after Hildegard's death in 783, had remarried Fastrada, sent for Louis in 785. Louis presented himself in Saxony at the royal [[Council of Paderborn]] dressed in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.<ref name=jong/>\n\nIn 794, Charlemagne gave four former [[Gallo-Roman]] villas to Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: [[Dou\u00e9-la-Fontaine]] in today's [[Anjou]], [[Ebreuil]] in Allier, [[Angeac-Charente]], and the disputed Cassinogilum. Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at a young age. The marches - peripheral principalities - played a vital role as bullwarks against exterior threats to the empire. Louis reigned over the [[Spanish March]]. In 797, [[Barcelona]], the largest city of the ''Marca'', fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including [[Gascons]] with their duke [[Sancho I of Gascony]], [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] under [[Leibulf of Provence|Leibulf]], and [[Visigoths|Goths]] under [[Bera, Count of Barcelona|Bera]], over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|author=David Levering Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zxuar_ISdcUC&pg=PA312|date=12 January 2009|publisher=W.

His twin brother, Lothair died during infancy. According to the  Frankish custom of [[partible inheritance]], Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, [[Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], and [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]]. In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], Provence, and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. However, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died \u2013 Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 \u2013 and Louis was crowned co-emperor with an already ailing Charlemagne in Aachen in 813. On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Carolingian Empire and all its possessions (with the sole exception of the kingdom of Italy; although within Louis's empire, in 813 Charlemagne had ordered that [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]], Pepin's son be made and called king).<ref name=jong/><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvd1c74c.6?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=%22Louis+the+Pious%22&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3D%2522Louis%2Bthe%2BPious%2522%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-4946%2Fcontrol&refreqid=search%3A0f8a6e321ca88a12d44dd4db92ec2a9d&seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents |title= Framing the Carolingian Reforms: The Early Years of Louis the Pious|publisher=  JSTOR | date=   | author=Rutger Kramer  | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Emperor==\n[[File:Denier Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Denarius]]'' of Louis.]]\nWhile at his villa of [[Dou\u00e9-la-Fontaine]], Anjou, Louis received news of his father's death.<ref name=\"Driscoll194\">''Church Architecture and Liturgy in the Carolingian Era'', Michael S.

Louis, having barely survived and feeling the imminent danger of death, began planning for his succession. Three months later among the approval of his Aachen court and the clergy he issued an imperial decree of eighteen chapters, the ''Ordinatio Imperii'', that laid out plans for an orderly dynastic succession. The term ''Ordinatio Imperii'' is a modern (19th century) creation. The decree is called ''divisio imperii'' in the only surviving contemporary manuscript.<ref name=jong/> \n\nIn 815, Louis had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] to govern [[Bavaria]] and Aquitaine respectively, though without the royal titles. He proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:\n\n* Lothair was proclaimed and crowned co-emperor in Aachen by his father. He was promised the succession to most of the Frankish dominions (excluding the exceptions below), and would be the overlord of his brothers and cousin.\n* Pepin was proclaimed King of Aquitaine, his territory including Gascony, the march around Toulouse, and the counties of Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers.\n* [[Louis the German|Louis]], the youngest son, was proclaimed King of Bavaria and the neighbouring marches.\n\nIf one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons. If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom. In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious' younger sons would be chosen to replace him by \"the people\". Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory.\n\nWith this settlement, Louis attempted to combine his sense for the Empire's unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons. Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share.\n\nThe decree failed to create order as it omitted Bernard, who immediately began to conspire. When Louis began to issue changes in favor of his second wife [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith's]] son [[Charles the Bald]], his sons Lothar, Pepin and Louis refused to accept. The rule of sons being favoured over brothers in succession remained also untouched.<ref name=jong/>\n\n===Bernard's rebellion and Louis's penance===\n[[File:Louis the Pious.jpg|thumb|Louis the Pious doing penance at Attigny in 822]]\nThe ''ordinatio imperii'' of Aachen left Bernard in Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence. Upon hearing of this, Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and headed for [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]]. Intimidated by the emperor's swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered. He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason. Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony. Others also suffered: [[Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans]], in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, dying soon afterwards; it was rumored that he had been poisoned.<ref>''The Frankish Kingdoms, 814\u2013898: The West'', Janet L. Nelson, ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, 700\u2013900'', Vol. II, ed. Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), 114.</ref> The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis's conscience for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed [[penance]] for causing Bernard's death, at his palace of [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] near Vouziers in the [[Ardennes]], before [[Pope Paschal I]], and a council of clerics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, [[Hugh (abbot of Saint-Quentin)|Hugo]] whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] whom he soon made [[Bishop of Metz]], and Theodoric. This act of contrition, partly in emulation of [[Theodosius I]], had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice. He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house.<ref name=jong/>\n\n===Frontier wars===\n{{unref|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Louis le Pieu denier Sens 818 823.jpg|left|thumb|Louis on a ''[[denarius]]'' from [[Sens]], 818\u2013823]]\nAt the start of Louis's reign, the many tribes \u2013 [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Obotrites]], [[Slovenes]], [[Bretons]], [[Basques]] \u2013 which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor's power and dared not stir up any trouble. In 816, however, the [[Sorbs]] rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818. Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace of the Franks in a short time.\n\nA greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast. There, [[Ljudevit]], duke of [[Pannonia]], was harassing the border at the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers. The [[margrave of Friuli]], [[Cadolah]], was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margravate was invaded by Slovenes. In 821, an alliance was made with [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], duke of the [[Dalmatia]], and Liudewit was brought to heel. In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of [[Bulgaria]] acknowledged Louis's suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]], in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in [[Pannonia]] and regained their lands.\n\nOn the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard [[list of Dukes and Princes of Benevento|princes of Benevento]] whom Charlemagne had never subjugated. He extracted promises from Princes [[Grimoald IV of Benevento|Grimoald IV]] and [[Sico of Benevento|Sico]], but to no effect.\n\nOn the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c. 812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees 'to settle matters' in Pamplona. The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basques]] in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i.e. hostages. [[Semen Lop of Gascony|S\u00e9guin]], duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]], was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax. Seguin was replaced by [[Lop III Centullo of Gascony|Lupus III]], who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor. In 820 an assembly at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]] decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827). The counts in charge of the army, [[Hugh of Tours|Hugh]], count of [[Tours]], and [[Matfrid of Orl\u00e9ans|Matfrid]], count of [[Orl\u00e9ans]], were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught.\n\n===First civil war===\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France - Bible de Vivien Ms. Latin 1 folio 423r d\u00e9tail Le comte Vivien offre le manuscrit de la Bible faite \u00e0 l'abbaye de Saint-Martin de Tours \u00e0 Charles le Chauve.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Louis's son [[Charles the Bald]] as depicted in the [[First Bible of Charles the Bald|Vivian Bible]], c.\u2009845]]\nIn 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to [[Brittany]], he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye|Ermengarde]]. Ermengarde was the daughter of [[Ingerman, Count of Hesbania|Ingerman]], the duke of Hesbaye. Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking. It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew's death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event. It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]], daughter of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], count of [[Altdorf (Weingarten)|Altdorf]]. In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named [[Charles the Bald|Charles]].\n\nThe birth of this son damaged the ''Partition of Aachen'', as Louis's attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war.\n\nAt [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 829, Louis gave [[Alemannia]] to Charles, with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair,<ref>Paired gold medallions of father and son had been struck on the occasion of the synod of Paris (825) that asserted Frankish claims as emperor, recently denigrated by the Byzantines; see Karl F.

An insurrection was soon at hand.\n\nWith the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles. Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them. [[Agobard]], [[Archbishop of Lyon]], and Jesse of Amiens, [[bishop of Amiens]], too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels.\n\nIn 830, at Wala's insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of [[Gascony|Gascon]]s, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris. At [[Verberie]], Louis the German joined him. At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself. He marched as far as [[Compi\u00e8gne]], an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin's forces and captured. Judith was incarcerated at [[Poitiers]] and Bernard fled to Barcelona.\n\nThen Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father. When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in [[Nijmegen]], in the heart of [[Austrasia]], the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831). Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy.\n\nPepin returned to Aquitaine and Judith \u2013 after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence \u2013 to Louis's court. Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]]. Although [[Hilduin]], abbot of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]], was exiled to [[Paderborn]] and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps; they did not lose their freedom.<ref name=jong/>\n\n===Second civil war===\nThe next revolt occurred a mere two years later, in 832. The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father's court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father's orders. Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of [[Slavic peoples|Slav]] allies and conquered [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]] before the emperor could react. Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm. At [[Jonac]], he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war. Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father's authority. His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles.\n\nSoon Lothair, with the support of [[Pope Gregory IV]], whom he had confirmed in office without his father's support, joined the revolt in 833. While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north. Louis marched south. The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld. There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks. Soon much of Louis's army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because \"it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account.\" The resigned emperor was taken to [[Abbey of Saint-M\u00e9dard de Soissons|Saint-M\u00e9dard de Soissons]], his son Charles to [[Pr\u00fcm]], and the queen to [[Tortona]]. The despicable show of disloyalty and disingenuousness earned the site the name [[Field of Lies]], or L\u00fcgenfeld, or Campus Mendacii, ''ubi plurimorum fidelitas exstincta est''.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0459/_P16.HTM].</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis le Pieux sesquisolidus 814 840.jpg|thumb|Louis on a ''[[sesquisolidus]]'', essentially Roman in design.<ref>''Medieval European Coinage'' by [[Philip Grierson]], Mark Blackburn, [[Lucia Travaini]], p. 329 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkz9NGFXIMC&pg=PA327&dq=manqush+coin#PPA329,M1]</ref>]]\n\nOn 13 November 833, [[Ebbo]], with [[Agobard of Lyon]], presided over a synod at the Church of Saint Medard in Soissons which saw Louis undertake public [[penance]] for the second time in his reign. The penitential ritual that was undertaken began when Louis arrived at the church and confessed multiple times to the crimes levied against him. The crimes had been historic and recent, with accusations of oath breaking, violation of the public peace and inability to control his adulterous wife, [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]].<ref> Mayke De Jong, \"Power and Humility in Carolingian society: the Public Penance of Louis the Pious\", ''Early Medieval Europe'' 1 (1992). p. 29. </ref> Afterwards, he threw his sword belt at the base of the altar and received judgement through the imposition of the hands of the bishops.<ref> Agobard, \"Personal Attestation to the Penance of Louis the Pious\" in Lievan Van Acker (ed.)

Ebbo himself received the monastery of [[St Vaast]] whilst [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] was allowed to keep the lands reclaimed from his father. \n\nMen like [[Rabanus Maurus]], Louis' younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith's sister and Louis the German's new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire. The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compi\u00e8gne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and [[Saxony]] against Lothair, and the usurper fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], skirmishing with loyalists near [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]]. Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834.\n\nOn Lothair's return to Italy, Wala, Jesse, and Matfrid, formerly count of Orl\u00e9ans, died of a pestilence. On 2 February 835 at the palace [[Thionville]], Louis presided over a general council to deal with the events of the previous year. Known as the [[Synod of Thionville]], Louis himself was reinvested with his ancestral garb and the crown, symbols of [[Carolingian]] rulership. Furthermore, the penance of 833 was officially reversed and Archbishop  [[Ebbo]] officially resigned after confessing to a capital crime, whilst [[Agobard of Lyon]] and Bartholmew, Archbishop of Narbonne were also deposed.<ref> ''The Annals of Saint Bertin'', trans. Janet L. Nelson (Manchester, 1991), pp. 32\u201333. </ref> Later that year Lothair fell ill; once again the events turned in Louis favour.\n\nIn 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of [[Cr\u00e9mieu]]. At about that time, the [[Vikings]] terrorized and sacked [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Antwerp]]. In 837, they went up the [[Rhine]] as far as Nijmegen, and their king, [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]], demanded the [[weregild]] of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them. They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts. In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over [[Frisia]], but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839. Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of ''[[missus dominicus|missi dominici]]'' into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\">{{cite book|author=Pierre Riche|title=The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcjy7bCmFL0C|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1342-4}}</ref>\n\n===Third civil war===\nIn 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis' land. Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], giving all of the young king of Bavaria's lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles. Emperor Louis did not stop there, however. His devotion to Charles knew no bounds. When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]]. When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out. In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the [[Loire]], and the Danes returned to ravage the [[Frisia]]n coast (sacking [[Dorestad]] for a second time).\n\nLothair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance. At a final ''[[placitum]]'' held at Worms on 20 May, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western. Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles. The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-en-Auvergne]] in 840. Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the [[March of Pannonia|Ostmark]]. The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he disbanded the army. The final civil war of his reign was over.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\"/>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Partage de l'Empire carolingien au Trait\u00e9 de Verdun en 843.JPG|thumb|200px|The parting of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.]]\nLouis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and retreated to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine near his [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|palace at Ingelheim]]. He died on 20 June 840 in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo as he pardoned his son Louis, proclaimed Lothair emperor and commended the absent Charles and Judith to his protection. \n\nSoon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into yet another civil war. It lasted until 843 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Verdun]], in which the division of the empire into three souvereign entities was settled. [[West Francia]] and [[East Francia]] became the kernels of modern France and Germany respectively. [[Middle Francia]], that included [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], the [[Low Countries]] and northern Italy among other regions was only short-lived until 855 and later reorganized as [[Lotharingia]].<ref name=\"Riddle2008\">{{cite book|author=John M.

Roses have been portrayed in Greek legends as a gift of secrecy and of confidentiality, known as ''[[sub rosa]]'', introducing that the rose is a symbol of silence between the narrator and Miss Emily, the narrator keeps Emily's secrets until her death.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of [[Emily Grierson]], an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town. It then proceeds in a [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear fashion]] to the narrator's recollections of Emily's archaic and increasingly strange behavior throughout the years. Emily is a member of a family of the [[antebellum South]]ern aristocracy. After the Civil War, the family falls into hard times. She and her father, the last two of the clan, continue to live as if in the past; Emily's father refuses for her to marry.  Her father dies when Emily is about the age of 30, which takes her by surprise. She refuses to give up his corpse, and the townspeople write it off as her grieving process. The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry. Emily depended heavily on her father, believing he would never leave her; he was all she had.\n\nAfter her father's death, the only person seen moving about Emily's home is Tobe, a black man serving as Emily's butler. He is frequently seen entering and exiting the house for groceries. Although Emily did not have a strong relationship with her community, she did give art lessons to young children within her town at the age of forty. A prime reason why she gave art lessons was her financial problem since she was running out of money. The townspeople make cruel comments and nasty looks behind Miss Emily's back, as she wasn't respected in her town. With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair, and becomes friendly with Homer Barron. He is a Northern laborer who comes to town shortly after Mr. Grierson's death. The connection surprises some of the community while others are glad she is taking an interest; however, \"Homer likes men and claims that he is not a marrying man.\" <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\" /> This draws attention to Homer's questionable sexuality in the story. Emily shortly buys arsenic from a druggist in town, presumably to kill rats, however, the townspeople are convinced that she will use it to poison herself. Emily's distant cousins are called into town by the minister's wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron. Homer leaves town for some time, reputedly to give Emily a chance to get rid of her cousins, and returns three days later after the cousins have left. After he is observed entering Miss Emily's home one evening, Homer is never seen alive again.\n\nDespite these turnabouts in her social status, Emily continues to behave mysteriously, as she had before her father died. Her reputation is such that the city council finds itself unable to confront her about a strong smell that has begun to emanate from the house. They believed Tobe was unable to maintain the house and something was rotting, unaware that a death has occurred.  Instead, the council decide to send men to her house under the cover of darkness to sprinkle lime around the house, after which the smell dissipates. The mayor of the town, [[Colonel (title)|Colonel]] Sartorius, makes a [[gentleman's agreement]] to overlook her taxes as an act of charity, though it is done under a pretense of repayment towards her father, to assuage Emily's pride after her father's death. Years later, when the next generation has come to power, Emily insists on this informal arrangement, flatly refusing that she owes any taxes, stating \"I have no taxes in Jefferson.\" After this, the council declines to press the issue due to her stubbornness. Emily has become a [[recluse]]: she is never seen outside of the house, and only rarely accepts people into it. The community eventually comes to view her as a \"hereditary obligation\" on the town, who must be humored and tolerated.\n\nThe funeral is a large affair: Emily had become an institution, so her death sparks a great deal of curiosity about her reclusive nature and what remains of her house. After she is buried, a group of townsfolk enters her house to see what remains of her life there. Tobe walked out of the house and was never seen again, giving the townspeople access to Miss Emily's home. The door to her upstairs bedroom is locked, and some of the townsfolk break down the door to see what has been hidden for so long. Inside, among the possessions that Emily had bought for Homer, lies the decomposed corpse of Homer Barron on the bed. On the pillow beside him is the indentation of a head and a single strand of gray hair, indicating that Emily had slept with Homer's corpse. The house is an indicator revealing how Emily struggled to keep everything the same, in a frozen time period, avoiding change.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n'''Emily Grierson''' - The main character of the story. Emily's father kept her from seeing suitors and controlled her social life, keeping her in isolation until his death, when she is 30 years old.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Her struggle with loss and attachment is the impetus for the plot, driving her to kill Homer Barron, the man that is assumed to have married her. Emily presumably poisons and kills Homer, as she sees murder as the only way to keep Homer with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> She treats him as her living husband even after his death, which is shown by her keeping his clothes in the room, keeping his engraved wedding items on the dresser, and the strand of her hair found beside his corpse at the end of the story that indicated she even slept beside him. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Emily's murderous act also displays her obstinate nature. This is evident in Emily's refusal to pay her taxes, her denial of her father's death, and the fact that she kills Homer to ensure that he will never leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> \n\n'''Homer Barron''' - Emily's romantic interest. He is later found dead and decomposed in Emily's bedroom after her funeral. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> He initially enters the story as a foreman for a road construction project occurring in the town. He is soon seen to be with Emily in her Sunday carriage rides, and it is expected for them to be married. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Homer differs from the rest of the town because he is a Northerner. The story takes place in the South shortly after the Civil War, and while Homer is not necessarily unwelcome to the town, he does stand out. This, along with the fact that he is seemingly courting Emily, sets him apart from all of the other characters in the story. It is because he is an outlier that Emily becomes attracted to him. It is generally unknown if Homer reciprocates the romantic feelings Emily has for him. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> It is stated in the story, that Homer likes men and is \"not the marrying kind\"  he has commitment issues.

It starts with the announcement of Emily's death, an event that has the entire town talking. This leads the reader to assume that she was an important figure in the town. As Fassler says in his article \u201cThe Key,\u201d \u201cClearly, this lady who died unmarried was of importance to everyone. And yet the town itself is eventually divided,\u201d<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-key-to-writing-a-mystery-is-asking-the-perfect-question/515799/</ref> and we see that division with the events depicted in between the announcement at the beginning and the revelation at the end are told out of order, making the reader analyze the story more closely than if it was told chronologically. Based on the townspeople's thoughts of Emily displayed in this section, the reader discovers that the town was not dreading Emily's death. On the other hand, it was somewhat welcomed. Emily stuck out from the rest of the town as a figure stuck in the past, desperately trying to cling to old traditions and ways of life. With her passing on, the town can finally be free of this remnant, being wholly set in the present. Had the story been told in a linear fashion, this understanding would have been lost, something Faulkner knew and incorporated into the story. By presenting the story in terms of present and past events, he could examine how they influence each other. In terms of mathematical precision, time moves on and what exists is only the present. In terms of the more subjective time, time moves on but memories can exist no matter how much time changes. Those memories stay unhindered. Through this Faulkner could analyze the depth at which Miss Emily could change as a character. If Faulkner presented the story in a linear fashion, the chances of the reader sympathizing with Emily would be far less. By telling the story out of order, the reader sees Emily as a tragic product of her environment rather than a twisted necrophiliac.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\n\"A Rose for Emily\" discusses many dark themes that characterized the Old South and [[Southern Gothic]] fiction. \n\nThe story explores themes of death and resistance to change. Also, it reflects the decaying of the societal tenets of the South in the 1930s. [[Emily Grierson]] had been oppressed by her father for most of her life and hadn't questioned it because that was her way of living. Likewise, the antiquated traditions of the south (often harmful, such as in the treatment of black people) had remained acceptable, as that was their way of living. Once her father had passed, Emily, in denial, refused to give his corpse up for burial\u2014this shows her inability to functionally adapt to change. When the present mayor and aldermen insist Miss Emily pay the taxes which she had been exempted from, she refuses and continues to live in her house. Miss Emily's stubborn insistence that she \"pays no taxes in Jefferson\" and her mistaking the new mayor for Colonel Sartoris brings into question whether her acts of resistance are a conscious act of defiance or a result of a decayed mental stability. The reader is only shown Emily from an external perspective, we can not ascertain whether she acts in a rational manner or not. The death of Homer, if interpreted as having been a murder, can be seen in the context of the North-South clash. Homer, notably a northerner, is not one for the tradition of marriage. In the framework that his death was not an accident, but a murder on the part of Emily, Homer's rejection of the marriage can be seen as the North's rejection of Southern tradition. The South ends its relations with the North in retaliation. Emily continuing to sleep next to Homer's body can be seen as the south holding on to an ideal that is no longer feasible. \n\nControl and its repercussions is a persistent theme throughout the story. Emily's father was an intimidating and manipulative figure, keeping her from experiencing life in her own terms. She was never able to grow, learn, live her life, start a family, and marry the one she truly loved. Even after Emily's father died, his presence and impact on his daughter were still apparent. Discussing Emily and her father, the townspeople said \"We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Literature An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing|date=2016|page=32|last1=Kennedy|first1=X.J.}}</ref> Emily is portrayed as small and powerless, placed behind the overbearing frame of her father. She wears white, a symbol of innocence and purity. Emily falls victim to the ruling hand of her father and to her place in the society: she has to uphold the [[noblesse oblige]] to which she was born into. In this way, her father's influence remains after he has passed. This control leads to Emily's isolation, both externally and internally imposed. Emily is alone, yet always being watched by the townspeople; she is both apart from and a part of the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> Her position prevents her from ever finding happiness.\n\nThe power of death is a consistent theme throughout the story. Emily herself is portrayed as a \"skeleton\" that is both \"small and spare\" which is representative of the fact that she emanates death. When it comes to death itself, Emily is in denial and most of that feeling has to do with her loneliness. After her father dies, she keeps his corpse for three days and refuses to admit that he is dead. The reader also sees this with the corpse of Homer Barron, except she is the one who inflicts death upon him. She poisons him and keeps him locked away in her room; she did not want to lose the only other person she had ever loved, so she made his stay permanent. These examples show that the power of death triumphs over everything, including \"poor Emily\", herself.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Ji-won|title=Narrator as Collective 'We':The Narrative Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\"|journal=English Language and Literature Teaching|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nDue to this inevitability in the portrayal of death, A Rose for Emily is seen as a tale based on determinism, making the short story part of the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism literary movement]]. Here, a character's fate is already determined no matter how much the individual struggles to change it. There are impersonal forces of nature that prevent him or her from taking control. As the very universe itself appear indifferent, this character descends into an inevitable death and decay. The case of Emily is the same. She had a mental illness, an unavoidable fate, which her father must have sought to finally end by refusing to let Emily marry, which would have continued his line. No matter what she did, there was the implication that she would ultimately go mad. There was also the depiction of a cursed land due to slavery and the class structure based upon it and that no matter how the people clung to the glorious past and soldier on, there was a tarnished way of life that leads to an impending ruin. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Strategies and Genre Conventions in Literary Studies: Teaching and Writing in the Disciplines|last=Wilder|first=Laura|publisher=SIU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780809330942|location=|pages=146}}</ref>\n\n== Critical response ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\nFloyd C. Watkins wrote about the structure of \"A Rose for Emily\" in \"[[Modern Language Notes]]\". Watkins claims that this is Faulkner's best story and that he is among the best American writers of this time period. Faulkner had to carefully dissect his sections, bringing importance to every aspect of Miss Emily's life, but Watkins sees this as a \"structural problem\" but later goes on to rave about the symmetry of this short story. Watkins enjoys this story in its entirety, and is impressed by Faulkner's ordering, as building suspense was an important aspect in the response.<ref>Watkins, Floyd C. \"Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\".\" Modern Language Notes 7th ser. 69 (1954): 508-10. JSTOR. Web. 5 Apr. 2017.</ref>\n\nThis critical response by John Skinner explores the interpretations of Faulkner's short story in detail while reviewing the importance of over-analyzing a piece of literary work. William Faulkner published this story in the 1930s, Skinner had published his critical response in 1985. More than 40 years have passed and people are still ignoring his claim; \u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d should not be interpreted any further. The characters and theme of this tale have been scrutinized by many. There have been numerous interpretations of what Miss Emily stands for; Skinner gives examples of scholars including S.W. M. Johnson \u201cEmily represented a refusal to submit to, or even concede, to the inevitability of change\u201d. Whereas, William Going pictures Emily as a rose, \u201cthe treasured memory of the Confederate veterans\u201d. The point of view according to Skinner is of immediate relevance to the story as the chief character, the narrator tells the chronology of the story. This narrator gives approximately \u201cround figures\u201d for the important events of the accounts. Yet the exact chronology is of little relevance to the overall importance of the story itself. John Skinner states that Faulkner should be taken literally, appreciate his formal subtlety in his works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=John|date=Winter 1985|title=\"A Rose for Emily\": Against Interpretation.\"|url=|journal=The Journal of Narrative Technique|volume=15.1|pages=42\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAlice Petry introduces a different type of critical response that is not focused on the usual subjects. Rather, she focuses on the complex and provocative language. For example, Hall discusses how the sentence, \"Thus she passed from generation to generation-dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil and perverse\" has been considered misleading, but is in fact strategically placed to provide foreshadowing and unification of plot. The five descriptive words used in the sentence each correspond to one of the five parts in the order they are seen. For example, the adjective \"inescapable\" corresponds to Part II, to the incident of the strange smell coming from Miss Emily's home. Faulkner's placement of these adjectives at the end of Part IV serves as an important unifying sentence that connects all five parts to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petry|first=Alice|date=Spring 1986|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=509417186&S=R&D=brb&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeqLQ4v%2BbwOLCmr0%2BeprZSsam4SrKWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvsku1p69MuePfgeyx43zx|journal=Explicator|volume=44|pages=52\u201354}}</ref>\n\nJim Barloon of the University of St. Thomas wrote about an idea introduced to him by his students, that Homer was homosexual, possibly providing another reason for his murder. He proposes that Emily did not kill Homer because of her own insecurities, but also because he did not reciprocate her romantic feelings. Thus, she could have murdered him out of affection as well as spite. Whether or not this theory is correct, it proves that the story is still being closely analyzed decades after it was written. As Barloon states in his article, \u201cPositing that Homer Barron is gay not only raises a new set of questions but transforms [the story], or at least our perspective of it.\u201d<ref>http://www.semo.edu/cfs/teaching/10186.html</ref>\n\nThe psychology of Emily Grierson has been analyzed countless times, with many people reaching the conclusion that she was mentally ill, and from that point, the reasons why. Though many different diagnoses have been made, the most common can be summarized as follows by Nicole Smith in her psychological analysis of the character: \u201cIt is reasonable to propose that Miss Emily developed [schizophrenia] as a response to the demanding conditions in which she was living as a Southern woman from an aristocratic family.\u201d<ref>http://www.articlemyriad.com/psychological-character-analysis-rose-emily/{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> This has been thought to represent just how unbearable life in the old South could be, not only for a person similar to Emily but to the people around them as well. A contributing factor to this point would change. The story is an allegory for the change that the South dealt with after the Civil War, with Emily representing the resistance of that change. This is shown in the story through Emily's conflicts with the town and her refusal of cooperation. Tuncay Tezcan in his analysis of the story states, \u201cIt represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.101 |title=A Stylistic Analysis of a Rose for Emily by William Faulkner and its Turkish Translation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=158 |pages=364\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Tezcan |first1=Tuncay }}</ref>\n\nThere has been much discussion over the title of the story. Why have a rose for Emily? At that time, giving a rose to a woman was common if they had been through a great tragedy. Emily's tragedy is her environment, changing quickly and with volatility, causing her to cling to the past in hopes of stopping the change from occurring. This has a deep impact on her mental state, driving her to extreme acts such as murdering Homer and then sleeping with his corpse for years. The town does nothing to stop these events, merely entertain the idea. Terry Heller writes in his analysis of the story that the town, \u201c[chose] to deal with an idea of Emily, rather than with Emily herself; they are different in that they have different ideas of her and, therefore, approach her\u2026 differently.\u201d<ref>http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/essays/rose.html{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> With nobody willing to help her, Emily died a broken person, and for that Faulkner gave her a rose, in sympathy of her ending.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n* ''A Rose for Emily''\u2014[[PBS]] adaptation with [[Anjelica Huston]].\n* [[My Chemical Romance]]'s song \"To The End\" from [[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]] (2005) loosely retells the story of Homer and Miss Emily.\n* [[The Zombies]]' song \"A Rose for Emily\" retells the story, and is about a strong theme present in the story: Miss Emily living and dying alone, unloved.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petridis|first1=Alexis|title=The story behind A Rose for Emily \u2013 and why it's perfect for S-Town|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2017/apr/17/rose-for-emily-s-town-zombies-podcast-john-b-mclemore|work=The Guardian|date=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Camilleri]] has a similar theme in his novel ''[[The Scent of the Night]]'' influencing his character Detective Salvo Montalbano.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Morton, Clay (2005). \"'A Rose for Emily': Oral Plot, Typographic Story\", ''Storytelling: A Critical Journal of Popular Narrative'' 5.1.\n\n{{Faulkner}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rose For Emily, A}}\n[[Category:1930 short stories]]\n[[Category:Short stories by William Faulkner]]\n[[Category:Horror short stories]]\n[[Category:Necrophilia in fiction]]\n[[Category:Short stories adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Nonlinear narrative literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = A Rose for Emily\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = <!--prefer 1st edition-->\n| image_caption = \n| author        = [[William Faulkner]]\n| country       = United States\n| language      = English\n| series        = \n| genre         = [[Southern gothic]]\n| published_in  = 1930\n| publication_type = \n| publisher     = \n|\n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   = \n}}\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\n\"'''A Rose for Emily'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[William Faulkner]], first published in April 30, 1930, in an issue of ''[[The Forum (defunct magazine)|The Forum]]''.

Roses have been portrayed in Greek legends as a gift of secrecy and of confidentiality, known as ''[[sub rosa]]'', introducing that the rose is a symbol of silence between the narrator and Miss Emily, the narrator keeps Emily's secrets until her death.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of [[Emily Grierson]], an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town. It then proceeds in a [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear fashion]] to the narrator's recollections of Emily's archaic and increasingly strange behavior throughout the years. Emily is a member of a family of the [[antebellum South]]ern aristocracy. After the Civil War, the family falls into hard times. She and her father, the last two of the clan, continue to live as if in the past; Emily's father refuses for her to marry.  Her father dies when Emily is about the age of 30, which takes her by surprise. She refuses to give up his corpse, and the townspeople write it off as her grieving process. The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry. Emily depended heavily on her father, believing he would never leave her; he was all she had.\n\nAfter her father's death, the only person seen moving about Emily's home is Tobe, a black man serving as Emily's butler. He is frequently seen entering and exiting the house for groceries. Although Emily did not have a strong relationship with her community, she did give art lessons to young children within her town at the age of forty. A prime reason why she gave art lessons was her financial problem since she was running out of money. The townspeople make cruel comments and nasty looks behind Miss Emily's back, as she wasn't respected in her town. With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair, and becomes friendly with Homer Barron. He is a Northern laborer who comes to town shortly after Mr. Grierson's death. The connection surprises some of the community while others are glad she is taking an interest; however, \"Homer likes men and claims that he is not a marrying man.\" <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\" /> This draws attention to Homer's questionable sexuality in the story. Emily shortly buys arsenic from a druggist in town, presumably to kill rats, however, the townspeople are convinced that she will use it to poison herself. Emily's distant cousins are called into town by the minister's wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron. Homer leaves town for some time, reputedly to give Emily a chance to get rid of her cousins, and returns three days later after the cousins have left. After he is observed entering Miss Emily's home one evening, Homer is never seen alive again.\n\nDespite these turnabouts in her social status, Emily continues to behave mysteriously, as she had before her father died. Her reputation is such that the city council finds itself unable to confront her about a strong smell that has begun to emanate from the house. They believed Tobe was unable to maintain the house and something was rotting, unaware that a death has occurred.  Instead, the council decide to send men to her house under the cover of darkness to sprinkle lime around the house, after which the smell dissipates. The mayor of the town, [[Colonel (title)|Colonel]] Sartorius, makes a [[gentleman's agreement]] to overlook her taxes as an act of charity, though it is done under a pretense of repayment towards her father, to assuage Emily's pride after her father's death. Years later, when the next generation has come to power, Emily insists on this informal arrangement, flatly refusing that she owes any taxes, stating \"I have no taxes in Jefferson.\" After this, the council declines to press the issue due to her stubbornness. Emily has become a [[recluse]]: she is never seen outside of the house, and only rarely accepts people into it. The community eventually comes to view her as a \"hereditary obligation\" on the town, who must be humored and tolerated.\n\nThe funeral is a large affair: Emily had become an institution, so her death sparks a great deal of curiosity about her reclusive nature and what remains of her house. After she is buried, a group of townsfolk enters her house to see what remains of her life there. Tobe walked out of the house and was never seen again, giving the townspeople access to Miss Emily's home. The door to her upstairs bedroom is locked, and some of the townsfolk break down the door to see what has been hidden for so long. Inside, among the possessions that Emily had bought for Homer, lies the decomposed corpse of Homer Barron on the bed. On the pillow beside him is the indentation of a head and a single strand of gray hair, indicating that Emily had slept with Homer's corpse. The house is an indicator revealing how Emily struggled to keep everything the same, in a frozen time period, avoiding change.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n'''Emily Grierson''' - The main character of the story. Emily's father kept her from seeing suitors and controlled her social life, keeping her in isolation until his death, when she is 30 years old.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Her struggle with loss and attachment is the impetus for the plot, driving her to kill Homer Barron, the man that is assumed to have married her.

The story is presented to the reader in a non-chronological order; this suggests that the story may have been patched together by multiple tellers. Some parts of the story are repeated, such as Homer's disappearance, the idea that Emily and Homer will get married, and Emily's refusal to pay taxes, also indicating that the narrator is a voice for the town. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Getty|first=Laura|date=Summer 2005|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://mrsstaceybrown.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12441735/rose_for_emily_literary_analysis.pdf|journal=The Explicator|volume=63|pages=230\u2013234}}</ref> Though the townspeople disapprove of most of Emily's actions, such as refusing to pay her taxes and purchasing poison, nobody intervenes.\n\n'''Colonel Sartoris''' - The former mayor who remitted Emily's taxes. While he is in the story very little, his decision to remit Emily's taxes leads to her refusal to pay them ever again, contributing to her stubborn personality.

It starts with the announcement of Emily's death, an event that has the entire town talking. This leads the reader to assume that she was an important figure in the town. As Fassler says in his article \u201cThe Key,\u201d \u201cClearly, this lady who died unmarried was of importance to everyone. And yet the town itself is eventually divided,\u201d<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-key-to-writing-a-mystery-is-asking-the-perfect-question/515799/</ref> and we see that division with the events depicted in between the announcement at the beginning and the revelation at the end are told out of order, making the reader analyze the story more closely than if it was told chronologically. Based on the townspeople's thoughts of Emily displayed in this section, the reader discovers that the town was not dreading Emily's death. On the other hand, it was somewhat welcomed. Emily stuck out from the rest of the town as a figure stuck in the past, desperately trying to cling to old traditions and ways of life. With her passing on, the town can finally be free of this remnant, being wholly set in the present. Had the story been told in a linear fashion, this understanding would have been lost, something Faulkner knew and incorporated into the story. By presenting the story in terms of present and past events, he could examine how they influence each other. In terms of mathematical precision, time moves on and what exists is only the present. In terms of the more subjective time, time moves on but memories can exist no matter how much time changes. Those memories stay unhindered. Through this Faulkner could analyze the depth at which Miss Emily could change as a character. If Faulkner presented the story in a linear fashion, the chances of the reader sympathizing with Emily would be far less. By telling the story out of order, the reader sees Emily as a tragic product of her environment rather than a twisted necrophiliac.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\n\"A Rose for Emily\" discusses many dark themes that characterized the Old South and [[Southern Gothic]] fiction. \n\nThe story explores themes of death and resistance to change. Also, it reflects the decaying of the societal tenets of the South in the 1930s. [[Emily Grierson]] had been oppressed by her father for most of her life and hadn't questioned it because that was her way of living. Likewise, the antiquated traditions of the south (often harmful, such as in the treatment of black people) had remained acceptable, as that was their way of living. Once her father had passed, Emily, in denial, refused to give his corpse up for burial\u2014this shows her inability to functionally adapt to change. When the present mayor and aldermen insist Miss Emily pay the taxes which she had been exempted from, she refuses and continues to live in her house. Miss Emily's stubborn insistence that she \"pays no taxes in Jefferson\" and her mistaking the new mayor for Colonel Sartoris brings into question whether her acts of resistance are a conscious act of defiance or a result of a decayed mental stability. The reader is only shown Emily from an external perspective, we can not ascertain whether she acts in a rational manner or not. The death of Homer, if interpreted as having been a murder, can be seen in the context of the North-South clash. Homer, notably a northerner, is not one for the tradition of marriage. In the framework that his death was not an accident, but a murder on the part of Emily, Homer's rejection of the marriage can be seen as the North's rejection of Southern tradition. The South ends its relations with the North in retaliation. Emily continuing to sleep next to Homer's body can be seen as the south holding on to an ideal that is no longer feasible. \n\nControl and its repercussions is a persistent theme throughout the story. Emily's father was an intimidating and manipulative figure, keeping her from experiencing life in her own terms. She was never able to grow, learn, live her life, start a family, and marry the one she truly loved. Even after Emily's father died, his presence and impact on his daughter were still apparent. Discussing Emily and her father, the townspeople said \"We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Literature An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing|date=2016|page=32|last1=Kennedy|first1=X.J.}}</ref> Emily is portrayed as small and powerless, placed behind the overbearing frame of her father. She wears white, a symbol of innocence and purity. Emily falls victim to the ruling hand of her father and to her place in the society: she has to uphold the [[noblesse oblige]] to which she was born into. In this way, her father's influence remains after he has passed. This control leads to Emily's isolation, both externally and internally imposed. Emily is alone, yet always being watched by the townspeople; she is both apart from and a part of the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> Her position prevents her from ever finding happiness.\n\nThe power of death is a consistent theme throughout the story. Emily herself is portrayed as a \"skeleton\" that is both \"small and spare\" which is representative of the fact that she emanates death. When it comes to death itself, Emily is in denial and most of that feeling has to do with her loneliness. After her father dies, she keeps his corpse for three days and refuses to admit that he is dead. The reader also sees this with the corpse of Homer Barron, except she is the one who inflicts death upon him. She poisons him and keeps him locked away in her room; she did not want to lose the only other person she had ever loved, so she made his stay permanent. These examples show that the power of death triumphs over everything, including \"poor Emily\", herself.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Ji-won|title=Narrator as Collective 'We':The Narrative Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\"|journal=English Language and Literature Teaching|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nDue to this inevitability in the portrayal of death, A Rose for Emily is seen as a tale based on determinism, making the short story part of the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism literary movement]]. Here, a character's fate is already determined no matter how much the individual struggles to change it. There are impersonal forces of nature that prevent him or her from taking control. As the very universe itself appear indifferent, this character descends into an inevitable death and decay. The case of Emily is the same. She had a mental illness, an unavoidable fate, which her father must have sought to finally end by refusing to let Emily marry, which would have continued his line. No matter what she did, there was the implication that she would ultimately go mad. There was also the depiction of a cursed land due to slavery and the class structure based upon it and that no matter how the people clung to the glorious past and soldier on, there was a tarnished way of life that leads to an impending ruin. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Strategies and Genre Conventions in Literary Studies: Teaching and Writing in the Disciplines|last=Wilder|first=Laura|publisher=SIU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780809330942|location=|pages=146}}</ref>\n\n== Critical response ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\nFloyd C. Watkins wrote about the structure of \"A Rose for Emily\" in \"[[Modern Language Notes]]\". Watkins claims that this is Faulkner's best story and that he is among the best American writers of this time period. Faulkner had to carefully dissect his sections, bringing importance to every aspect of Miss Emily's life, but Watkins sees this as a \"structural problem\" but later goes on to rave about the symmetry of this short story. Watkins enjoys this story in its entirety, and is impressed by Faulkner's ordering, as building suspense was an important aspect in the response.<ref>Watkins, Floyd C. \"Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\".\" Modern Language Notes 7th ser. 69 (1954): 508-10. JSTOR. Web. 5 Apr. 2017.</ref>\n\nThis critical response by John Skinner explores the interpretations of Faulkner's short story in detail while reviewing the importance of over-analyzing a piece of literary work. William Faulkner published this story in the 1930s, Skinner had published his critical response in 1985. More than 40 years have passed and people are still ignoring his claim; \u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d should not be interpreted any further. The characters and theme of this tale have been scrutinized by many. There have been numerous interpretations of what Miss Emily stands for; Skinner gives examples of scholars including S.W. M. Johnson \u201cEmily represented a refusal to submit to, or even concede, to the inevitability of change\u201d. Whereas, William Going pictures Emily as a rose, \u201cthe treasured memory of the Confederate veterans\u201d. The point of view according to Skinner is of immediate relevance to the story as the chief character, the narrator tells the chronology of the story. This narrator gives approximately \u201cround figures\u201d for the important events of the accounts. Yet the exact chronology is of little relevance to the overall importance of the story itself. John Skinner states that Faulkner should be taken literally, appreciate his formal subtlety in his works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=John|date=Winter 1985|title=\"A Rose for Emily\": Against Interpretation.\"|url=|journal=The Journal of Narrative Technique|volume=15.1|pages=42\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAlice Petry introduces a different type of critical response that is not focused on the usual subjects. Rather, she focuses on the complex and provocative language. For example, Hall discusses how the sentence, \"Thus she passed from generation to generation-dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil and perverse\" has been considered misleading, but is in fact strategically placed to provide foreshadowing and unification of plot. The five descriptive words used in the sentence each correspond to one of the five parts in the order they are seen. For example, the adjective \"inescapable\" corresponds to Part II, to the incident of the strange smell coming from Miss Emily's home. Faulkner's placement of these adjectives at the end of Part IV serves as an important unifying sentence that connects all five parts to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petry|first=Alice|date=Spring 1986|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=509417186&S=R&D=brb&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeqLQ4v%2BbwOLCmr0%2BeprZSsam4SrKWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvsku1p69MuePfgeyx43zx|journal=Explicator|volume=44|pages=52\u201354}}</ref>\n\nJim Barloon of the University of St. Thomas wrote about an idea introduced to him by his students, that Homer was homosexual, possibly providing another reason for his murder. He proposes that Emily did not kill Homer because of her own insecurities, but also because he did not reciprocate her romantic feelings. Thus, she could have murdered him out of affection as well as spite. Whether or not this theory is correct, it proves that the story is still being closely analyzed decades after it was written. As Barloon states in his article, \u201cPositing that Homer Barron is gay not only raises a new set of questions but transforms [the story], or at least our perspective of it.\u201d<ref>http://www.semo.edu/cfs/teaching/10186.html</ref>\n\nThe psychology of Emily Grierson has been analyzed countless times, with many people reaching the conclusion that she was mentally ill, and from that point, the reasons why. Though many different diagnoses have been made, the most common can be summarized as follows by Nicole Smith in her psychological analysis of the character: \u201cIt is reasonable to propose that Miss Emily developed [schizophrenia] as a response to the demanding conditions in which she was living as a Southern woman from an aristocratic family.\u201d<ref>http://www.articlemyriad.com/psychological-character-analysis-rose-emily/{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> This has been thought to represent just how unbearable life in the old South could be, not only for a person similar to Emily but to the people around them as well. A contributing factor to this point would change. The story is an allegory for the change that the South dealt with after the Civil War, with Emily representing the resistance of that change. This is shown in the story through Emily's conflicts with the town and her refusal of cooperation. Tuncay Tezcan in his analysis of the story states, \u201cIt represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.101 |title=A Stylistic Analysis of a Rose for Emily by William Faulkner and its Turkish Translation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=158 |pages=364\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Tezcan |first1=Tuncay }}</ref>\n\nThere has been much discussion over the title of the story. Why have a rose for Emily? At that time, giving a rose to a woman was common if they had been through a great tragedy. Emily's tragedy is her environment, changing quickly and with volatility, causing her to cling to the past in hopes of stopping the change from occurring. This has a deep impact on her mental state, driving her to extreme acts such as murdering Homer and then sleeping with his corpse for years. The town does nothing to stop these events, merely entertain the idea. Terry Heller writes in his analysis of the story that the town, \u201c[chose] to deal with an idea of Emily, rather than with Emily herself; they are different in that they have different ideas of her and, therefore, approach her\u2026 differently.\u201d<ref>http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/essays/rose.html{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> With nobody willing to help her, Emily died a broken person, and for that Faulkner gave her a rose, in sympathy of her ending.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n* ''A Rose for Emily''\u2014[[PBS]] adaptation with [[Anjelica Huston]].\n* [[My Chemical Romance]]'s song \"To The End\" from [[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]] (2005) loosely retells the story of Homer and Miss Emily.\n* [[The Zombies]]' song \"A Rose for Emily\" retells the story, and is about a strong theme present in the story: Miss Emily living and dying alone, unloved.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petridis|first1=Alexis|title=The story behind A Rose for Emily \u2013 and why it's perfect for S-Town|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2017/apr/17/rose-for-emily-s-town-zombies-podcast-john-b-mclemore|work=The Guardian|date=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Camilleri]] has a similar theme in his novel ''[[The Scent of the Night]]'' influencing his character Detective Salvo Montalbano.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Morton, Clay (2005). \"'A Rose for Emily': Oral Plot, Typographic Story\", ''Storytelling: A Critical Journal of Popular Narrative'' 5.1.\n\n{{Faulkner}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rose For Emily, A}}\n[[Category:1930 short stories]]\n[[Category:Short stories by William Faulkner]]\n[[Category:Horror short stories]]\n[[Category:Necrophilia in fiction]]\n[[Category:Short stories adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Nonlinear narrative literature]]\n", "name_user": "Abbeyperrin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted the word fictional as it already appeared in the same sentence.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rose_for_Emily"}
