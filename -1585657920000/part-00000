[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%.

The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

Although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons <65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost. Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last 9 months of 2009. The majority (62\u201385%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe.

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%.

The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

Although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons <65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost. Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last 9 months of 2009. The majority (62\u201385%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe. The model attributed 148,000\u2013249,000 respiratory deaths to influenza in an average pre-pandemic season, with only 19% in persons <65 years of age.<ref name=\"mortality estimate worldwide\">{{cite journal |last=Simonsen |first=Lone |last2=Spreeuwenberg |first2=Peter |last3=Lustig |first3=Roger |last4=Taylor |first4=Robert J. |last5=Fleming |first5=Douglas M. |last6=Kroneman |first6=Madelon |last7=Van Kerkhove |first7=Maria D. |last8=Mounts |first8=Anthony W. |last9=Paget |first9=W.

After Bajirao's death, she pleaded with the new Peshwa [[Balaji Baji Rao|Balaji Rao]], to release the Dabhades from the revenue-sharing covenant. When he refused to do so, she sided with [[Tarabai]] in a rebellion against the Peshwa. When Balaji Baji Rao left for the Mughal frontier, Tarabai imprisoned [[Rajaram II of Satara|Chhatrapati Rajaram II]] and Umabai dispatched Damaji Gaekwad with a 15,000-strong force to support her.<ref name=\"CAKDBP_1918\"/>\n\nOn 13 March, the Peshwa loyalist Trimbakrao Purandare set out from Pune to intercept Damaji.

Despite being numerically inferior, Damaji's army defeated them at Nimb, a small town north of Satara. A victorious Damaji then reached Satara, where he was received by Tarabai. However, Trimbakrao re-formed his army. On 15 March, he launched a fresh attack on Damaji's troops, who were encamped on the banks of the [[Venna River]]. Damaji was defeated in this battle, and forced to retreat with heavy losses. Trimbakrao continued pursuing him, eventually trapping him a gorge in the [[Krishna River]] valley. Meanwhile, the Peshwa returned from the Mughal frontier, and joined Trimbakrao. Damaji's Maratha troops deserted him, while his Gujarati troops lost hope in an unfamiliar locality. He was, therefore, compelled to declare ceasefire and meet Peshwa to discuss the terms of a peace treaty. The Peshwa demanded half of Gujarat's territories in addition to a [[war indemnity]] of {{INR}} 2,500,000.

In return, he was made the Maratha chief of Gujarat, and the Peshwa offered him assistance in expelling the Mughals from Gujarat. Gaekwad promised to pay an annual tribute of {{INR}} 525,000 to Peshwa in addition to a one-time payment of {{INR}} 1,500,000.

This army was joined by Damaji's troops, resulting in the formation of a 50,000-strong Maratha army. The Marathas sieged [[Ahmedabad]], where the Mughal Governor Jawan Mard Khan Babi put up a strong defence. Babi surrendered Ahmedabad in March 1753 after a long siege. The Peshwa appointed Shripatrao Bapuji as the Governor of Ahmedabad; a part of the city was given to Damaji. In July 1756, the [[Nawab of Cambay]] Momin Khan invaded Ahmedabad with Mughal support, while Shripatrao was away in Pune.

Meanwhile, the Peshwa suffered setbacks in some other battles, and decided to seek reconciliation with the Gaekwads.<ref name=\"CAKDBP_1918\"/>\n\n== As the Maratha chief in Gujarat ==\n[[File:Damajino Dero at Savli.jpg|thumb|Damajino Dero, a memorial dedicated to him located at [[Savli]], Gujarat]]\nIn March 1752, Damaji finally agreed to abandon Dabhades in favour of the Peshwa. In return, he was made the Maratha chief of Gujarat, and the Peshwa offered him assistance in expelling the Mughals from Gujarat. Gaekwad promised to pay an annual tribute of {{INR}} 525,000 to Peshwa in addition to a one-time payment of {{INR}} 1,500,000. He was also asked to maintain a cavalry of 20,000 horses in service of the Peshwa. The Dabhade family was respectfully removed from power, and provided an annual maintenance expense by Gaekwad.<ref name=\"CAKDBP_1918\"/>\n\nOn 10 December 1752, Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao dispatched an army from Pune to Gujarat, under the commandment of Raghunathrao. This army was joined by Damaji's troops, resulting in the formation of a 50,000-strong Maratha army. The Marathas sieged [[Ahmedabad]], where the Mughal Governor Jawan Mard Khan Babi put up a strong defence. Babi surrendered Ahmedabad in March 1753 after a long siege. The Peshwa appointed Shripatrao Bapuji as the Governor of Ahmedabad; a part of the city was given to Damaji. In July 1756, the [[Nawab of Cambay]] Momin Khan invaded Ahmedabad with Mughal support, while Shripatrao was away in Pune. The Peshwa sent a force led by Sadashiv Shenvi, which regained control of Ahmedabad with Damaji's help.<ref name=\"CAKDBP_1918\"/> Subsequently, the town remained under the Marathas until the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. The British later handed it over to Damaji's son [[Fateh Singh Rao Gaekwad]] after the [[Treaty of Salbai]] in 1782.<ref name=\"CAKDBP_1918\"/>\n\nHe died at [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] on 18 August 1768.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/b/baroda.html#2 BARODA]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gaekwad II, Damajirao}}\n[[Category:1768 deaths]]\n[[Category:Maharajas of Vadodara]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n", "name_user": "PawanjiGupta", "label": "safe", "comment": "Improvement", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damaji_Rao_Gaekwad"}

Industrial activity by a number of various companies continues by the river, albeit on a much reduced scale.\n\nThe area around Burn Naze on the western side of the Wyre Estuary was formerly known as ''Bergerode'', believed to be an [[Old English]] term for \"shallow harbour\", ''beor grade''.<ref>William John Thomas et al., ''Notes and Queries'' (1850).
