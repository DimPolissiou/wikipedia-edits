The club, organized in 1895, first leased land at this site, then purchased it in 1903, building its first purpose-built clubhouse c. 1903\u201307.

It is Brown's second novel to include the character [[Robert Langdon]]: the first was his 2000 novel ''[[Angels & Demons]]''.  ''The Da Vinci Code'' follows \"symbologist\" [[Robert Langdon]] and [[cryptography|cryptologist]] [[List of The Da Vinci Code characters#Sophie Neveu Saint-Clair|Sophie Neveu]] after a murder in the [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris causes them to become involved in a battle between the [[Priory of Sion]] and [[Opus Dei]] over the possibility of [[Jesus Christ]] having been a companion to [[Mary Magdalene]].\n\nThe novel explores an alternative religious history, whose central plot point is that the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]] were descended from [[Jesus bloodline|the bloodline of Jesus Christ]] and Mary Magdalene, ideas derived from Clive Prince's ''[[The Templar Revelation]]'' (1997) and books by Margaret Starbird. The book also refers to ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (1982) though Dan Brown has stated that it was not used as research material.\n\n''The Da Vinci Code'' provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the [[Holy Grail]] legend and Mary Magdalene's role in the [[history of Christianity]]. The book has, however, been extensively denounced by many [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] as an attack on the [[Catholic Church]], and consistently criticized for [[Criticism of The Da Vinci Code|its historical and scientific inaccuracies]].

In November 2004, [[Random House]] published a Special Illustrated Edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006, a [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film adaptation]] was released by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Louvre]] curator and [[Priory of Sion]] grand master Jacques Sauni\u00e8re is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the \"keystone,\" an item crucial in the search for the [[Holy Grail]]. \n\nAfter Sauni\u00e8re's body is discovered in the pose of the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Sauni\u00e8re left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a [[Fibonacci sequence]] out of order. \n\nLangdon explains to Fache that Sauni\u00e8re was a leading authority on the subject of goddess artwork and that the pentacle Sauni\u00e8re drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes.\n\nSophie Neveu, a police [[cryptographer]], secretly explains to Langdon that she is Sauni\u00e8re's estranged granddaughter, and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message, which was meant for Neveu, said \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon,\" which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival.  However, \"P.S.\" actually refers to Sophie, as the nickname given to her by her grandfather is \"Princess Sophie\". It does not refer to \"postscript\".  Neveu is troubled by memories of her grandfather's involvement in a secret pagan group. However, she understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads them to a [[safe deposit box]] at the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. \n\n[[Image:Davincicryptex01wiki1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Replica cryptex: prize from [[The Da Vinci Code WebQuests#The Google WebQuest|Google Da Vinci Code Quest Contest]]]]\nNeveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box they find a box containing the keystone: a [[cryptex]], a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When these are lined up correctly, they unlock the device. If the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on [[papyrus]]. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password.\n\nLangdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup, but a tomb containing the bones of [[Mary Magdalene]]. \n\nThe trio then flees the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spell out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of [[Isaac Newton]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\nDuring the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier. Arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnesses a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she is shocked to see her grandfather with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who are wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She flees the house and breaks off all contact with Sauni\u00e8re. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known as ''[[hieros gamos]]'' or \"sacred marriage.\"\n\nBy the time they arrive at [[Westminster Abbey]], Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that [[Jesus Christ]] married Mary Magdalene and bore children, in order to ruin the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is \"apple.\" Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air. \n\nTeabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious sect [[Opus Dei]] and Silas' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, he assumes that they are there to kill him and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a gunshot wound.\n\nThe final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to [[Rosslyn Chapel]], whose docent turns out to be Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother. It is revealed that Neveu and her brother are descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life.\n\nThe real meaning of the last message is that the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] is buried beneath the small [[pyramid]] directly below the ''[[La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e]]'', the inverted glass pyramid of the [[Louvre]]. It also lies beneath the \"Rose Line,\" an allusion to \"Rosslyn.\" Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line to ''La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e'', where he kneels to pray before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as the Templar knights did before him.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main article|List of The Da Vinci Code characters}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Robert Langdon]]\n*Jacques Sauni\u00e8re \n*Sophie Neveu\n*Bezu Fache\n*Silas\n*Manuel Aringarosa\n*Sister Sandrine\n{{col-2}}\n*Andr\u00e9 Vernet\n*Leigh Teabing\n*R\u00e9my Legaludec\n*J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet\n*Marie Chauvel Saint-Clair\n*Pamela Gettum\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reaction==\n\n===Sales===\n''The Da Vinci Code'' was a major success in 2003 and was outsold only by [[J.

The book has received mostly negative reviews from Catholic and other Christian communities.\n\nMany critics took issue with the level of research Brown did when writing the story. ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer Laura Miller characterized the novel as \"based on a notorious hoax\", \"rank nonsense\", and \"bogus\", saying the book is heavily based on the fabrications of [[Pierre Plantard]], who is asserted to have created the Priory of Sion in 1956.\n\nCritics accuse Brown of distorting and fabricating history. For example, Marcia Ford wrote:\n{{Quote |Regardless of whether you agree with Brown's conclusions, it's clear that his history is largely fanciful, which means he and his publisher have violated a long-held if unspoken agreement with the reader: Fiction that purports to present historical facts should be researched as carefully as a nonfiction book would be.<ref name=\"faithfulreader1\">{{cite web|url= http://www.faithfulreader.com/features/0405-da_vinci_debunkers.asp |title=Da Vinci Debunkers: Spawns of Dan Brown's Bestseller | first = Marcia | last = Ford |publisher=FaithfulReader |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040527122442/http://faithfulreader.com/features/0405-da_vinci_debunkers.asp |archivedate=2004-05-27 |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Richard Abanes]] wrote:\n{{Quote | The most flagrant aspect... is not that Dan Brown disagrees with Christianity but that he utterly warps it in order to disagree with it... to the point of completely rewriting a vast number of historical events.

This assertion is broadly disputed; the [[Priory of Sion]] is generally regarded as a hoax created in 1956 by [[Pierre Plantard]]. The author also claims that \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents\u2026 and secret rituals in this novel are accurate\", but this claim is disputed by numerous academic scholars expert in numerous areas.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.historyversusthedavincicode.com/ |title = History vs The Da Vinci Code |accessdate = 2009-02-03}}</ref>\n\nDan Brown himself addresses the idea of some of the more controversial aspects being fact on his web site, stating that the \"FACT\" page at the beginning of the novel mentions only \"documents, rituals, organization, artwork and architecture\", but not any of the ancient theories discussed by fictional characters, stating that \"Interpreting those ideas is left to the reader\". Brown also says, \"It is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these characters may have merit\" and \"the secret behind ''The Da Vinci Code'' was too well documented and significant for me to dismiss.\"<ref>{{cite web | first1 = Ken | last1 = Kelleher | first2 = Carolyn | last2 = Kelleher|url=http://www.danbrown.com/#/davinciCode/questions|title= The Da Vinci Code | type = FAQs | publisher = Dan Brown |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2009-02-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325062025/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |archivedate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, while promoting the novel, Brown was asked in interviews what parts of the history in his novel actually happened. He replied \"Absolutely all of it.\" In a 2003 interview with CNN's [[Martin Savidge]] he was again asked how much of the historical background was true. He replied, \"99% is true\u2026 the background is all true\". \n\nAsked by [[Elizabeth Vargas]] in an [[ABC News]] special if the book would have been different if he had written it as non-fiction he replied, \"I don't think it would have.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.historyversusthedavincicode.com/fiction.htm|title = Fiction|contribution = |accessdate = 2009-02-03|website = History vs The Da Vinci Code}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, UK TV personality [[Tony Robinson]] edited and narrated a detailed rebuttal of the main arguments of Dan Brown and those of [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] and [[Henry Lincoln]], who authored the book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail|Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'', in the program ''The Real Da Vinci Code'', shown on [[British television|British TV]] [[Channel 4]].

In November 2004, [[Random House]] published a Special Illustrated Edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006, a [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film adaptation]] was released by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Louvre]] curator and [[Priory of Sion]] grand master Jacques Sauni\u00e8re is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the \"keystone,\" an item crucial in the search for the [[Holy Grail]]. \n\nAfter Sauni\u00e8re's body is discovered in the pose of the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Sauni\u00e8re left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a [[Fibonacci sequence]] out of order. \n\nLangdon explains to Fache that Sauni\u00e8re was a leading authority on the subject of goddess artwork and that the pentacle Sauni\u00e8re drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes.\n\nSophie Neveu, a police [[cryptographer]], secretly explains to Langdon that she is Sauni\u00e8re's estranged granddaughter, and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message, which was meant for Neveu, said \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon,\" which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival.  However, \"P.S.\" actually refers to Sophie, as the nickname given to her by her grandfather is \"Princess Sophie\". It does not refer to \"postscript\".  Neveu is troubled by memories of her grandfather's involvement in a secret pagan group. However, she understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads them to a [[safe deposit box]] at the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. \n\n[[Image:Davincicryptex01wiki1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Replica cryptex: prize from [[The Da Vinci Code WebQuests#The Google WebQuest|Google Da Vinci Code Quest Contest]]]]\nNeveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box they find a box containing the keystone: a [[cryptex]], a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When these are lined up correctly, they unlock the device. If the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on [[papyrus]]. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password.\n\nLangdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup, but a tomb containing the bones of [[Mary Magdalene]]. \n\nThe trio then flees the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spell out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of [[Isaac Newton]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\nDuring the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier. Arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnesses a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she is shocked to see her grandfather with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who are wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She flees the house and breaks off all contact with Sauni\u00e8re. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known as ''[[hieros gamos]]'' or \"sacred marriage.\"\n\nBy the time they arrive at [[Westminster Abbey]], Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that [[Jesus Christ]] married Mary Magdalene and bore children, in order to ruin the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is \"apple.\" Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air. \n\nTeabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious sect [[Opus Dei]] and Silas' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, he assumes that they are there to kill him and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a gunshot wound.\n\nThe final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to [[Rosslyn Chapel]], whose docent turns out to be Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother. It is revealed that Neveu and her brother are descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life.\n\nThe real meaning of the last message is that the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] is buried beneath the small [[pyramid]] directly below the ''[[La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e]]'', the inverted glass pyramid of the [[Louvre]]. It also lies beneath the \"Rose Line,\" an allusion to \"Rosslyn.\" Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line to ''La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e'', where he kneels to pray before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as the Templar knights did before him.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main article|List of The Da Vinci Code characters}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Robert Langdon]]\n*Jacques Sauni\u00e8re \n*Sophie Neveu\n*Bezu Fache\n*Silas\n*Manuel Aringarosa\n*Sister Sandrine\n{{col-2}}\n*Andr\u00e9 Vernet\n*Leigh Teabing\n*R\u00e9my Legaludec\n*J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet\n*Marie Chauvel Saint-Clair\n*Pamela Gettum\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reaction==\n\n===Sales===\n''The Da Vinci Code'' was a major success in 2003 and was outsold only by [[J.

The book has received mostly negative reviews from Catholic and other Christian communities.\n\nMany critics took issue with the level of research Brown did when writing the story. ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer Laura Miller characterized the novel as \"based on a notorious hoax\", \"rank nonsense\", and \"bogus\", saying the book is heavily based on the fabrications of [[Pierre Plantard]], who is asserted to have created the Priory of Sion in 1956.\n\nCritics accuse Brown of distorting and fabricating history. For example, Marcia Ford wrote:\n{{Quote |Regardless of whether you agree with Brown's conclusions, it's clear that his history is largely fanciful, which means he and his publisher have violated a long-held if unspoken agreement with the reader: Fiction that purports to present historical facts should be researched as carefully as a nonfiction book would be.<ref name=\"faithfulreader1\">{{cite web|url= http://www.faithfulreader.com/features/0405-da_vinci_debunkers.asp |title=Da Vinci Debunkers: Spawns of Dan Brown's Bestseller | first = Marcia | last = Ford |publisher=FaithfulReader |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040527122442/http://faithfulreader.com/features/0405-da_vinci_debunkers.asp |archivedate=2004-05-27 |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Richard Abanes]] wrote:\n{{Quote | The most flagrant aspect... is not that Dan Brown disagrees with Christianity but that he utterly warps it in order to disagree with it... to the point of completely rewriting a vast number of historical events. And making the matter worse has been Brown's willingness to pass off his distortions as \u2018facts' with which innumerable scholars and historians agree.<ref name=\"faithfulreader1\" />}}\n\nThe book opens with the claim by Dan Brown that \"The Priory of Sion\u2014a French [[secret society]] founded in 1099\u2014is a real organization\". This assertion is broadly disputed; the [[Priory of Sion]] is generally regarded as a hoax created in 1956 by [[Pierre Plantard]]. The author also claims that \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents\u2026 and secret rituals in this novel are accurate\", but this claim is disputed by numerous academic scholars expert in numerous areas.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.historyversusthedavincicode.com/ |title = History vs The Da Vinci Code |accessdate = 2009-02-03}}</ref>\n\nDan Brown himself addresses the idea of some of the more controversial aspects being fact on his web site, stating that the \"FACT\" page at the beginning of the novel mentions only \"documents, rituals, organization, artwork and architecture\", but not any of the ancient theories discussed by fictional characters, stating that \"Interpreting those ideas is left to the reader\". Brown also says, \"It is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these characters may have merit\" and \"the secret behind ''The Da Vinci Code'' was too well documented and significant for me to dismiss.\"<ref>{{cite web | first1 = Ken | last1 = Kelleher | first2 = Carolyn | last2 = Kelleher|url=http://www.danbrown.com/#/davinciCode/questions|title= The Da Vinci Code | type = FAQs | publisher = Dan Brown |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2009-02-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325062025/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |archivedate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, while promoting the novel, Brown was asked in interviews what parts of the history in his novel actually happened. He replied \"Absolutely all of it.\" In a 2003 interview with CNN's [[Martin Savidge]] he was again asked how much of the historical background was true. He replied, \"99% is true\u2026 the background is all true\". \n\nAsked by [[Elizabeth Vargas]] in an [[ABC News]] special if the book would have been different if he had written it as non-fiction he replied, \"I don't think it would have.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.historyversusthedavincicode.com/fiction.htm|title = Fiction|contribution = |accessdate = 2009-02-03|website = History vs The Da Vinci Code}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, UK TV personality [[Tony Robinson]] edited and narrated a detailed rebuttal of the main arguments of Dan Brown and those of [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] and [[Henry Lincoln]], who authored the book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail|Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'', in the program ''The Real Da Vinci Code'', shown on [[British television|British TV]] [[Channel 4]]. The program featured lengthy interviews with many of the main protagonists cited by Brown as \"absolute fact\" in ''The Da Vinci Code''. \n\nArnaud de S\u00e8de, son of [[G\u00e9rard de S\u00e8de]], stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of the [[Prieur\u00e9 de Sion]], the cornerstone of the [[Jesus bloodline]] theory: \"frankly, it was piffle\", noting that the concept of a descendant of Jesus was also an element of the 1999 [[Kevin Smith]] film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''.\n\nThe earliest appearance of this theory is due to the 13th-century [[Cistercian]] monk and chronicler [[Peter of Vaux de Cernay]] who reported that [[Catharism|Cathars]] believed that the 'evil' and 'earthly' [[Jesus Christ]] had a relationship with [[Mary Magdalene]], described as his [[concubinage|concubine]] (and that the 'good Christ' was incorporeal and existed spiritually in the body of Paul).<ref>{{Citation | first1 = WA | last1 = Sibly | first2 = MD | last2 = Sibly | title = The History of the Albigensian Crusade: Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay's \"Historia Albigensis\" | publisher = Boydell | year = 1998 | ISBN = 0-85115-658-4 | quote = Further, in their secret meetings they said that the Christ who was born in the earthly and visible Bethlehem and crucified at Jerusalem was 'evil', and that Mary Magdalene was his concubine \u2013 and that she was the woman taken in adultery who is referred to in the Scriptures; the 'good' Christ, they said, neither ate nor drank nor assumed the true flesh and was never in this world, except spiritually in the body of Paul.

He thought Christianity would appeal to [[Paganism|pagan]]s only if it featured a [[demigod]] similar to pagan heroes. According to the [[Gnostic Gospels]], Jesus was merely a human prophet, not a demigod. Therefore, to change Jesus' image, Constantine destroyed the [[Gnostic Gospels]] and promoted the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which portray Jesus as divine or semi-divine.\n\nBut Gnosticism did not portray Jesus as merely human.<ref name=\"chapterfiftyfive\">{{Citation|first = Tim|last = O'Neill|url = http://www.historyversusthedavincicode.com/chapterfiftyfive.htm#nagdss|chapter = 55.

Anikin interprets the ''Mona Lisa'' to be a Christian allegory consisting of two images, one of Jesus Christ that comprises the image's right half, one of the Virgin Mary that forms its left half. According to Anikin, he expressed this idea to a group of experts from the Museum of Houston during a 1988 [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] exhibit at the Hermitage, and when one of the Americans requested permission to pass it along to a friend Anikin granted the request on condition that he be credited in any book using his interpretation. Anikin eventually compiled his research into ''Leonardo da Vinci or Theology on Canvas'', a book published in 2000, but ''The Da Vinci Code'', published three years later, makes no mention of Anikin and instead asserts that the idea in question is a \"well-known opinion of a number of scientists.\"<ref>Page, Jeremy. \"Now Russian sues Brown over his Da Vinski Code\", ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', April 12, 2006</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Grachev | first = Guerman | url = http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/13-04-2006/79125-danbrown-0/ | title = Russian scientist to sue best-selling author Dan Brown over 'Da Vinci Code' plagiarism | date = 13 April 2006 | newspaper = Pravda | place = [[Russia|RU]] | access-date = May 13, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007082243/http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/13-04-2006/79125-danbrown-0/ | archive-date = October 7, 2012 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}.</ref>\n\n==Release details==\nThe book has been translated into over 44 languages, primarily hardcover.<ref>{{Citation | title = Secrets | url = http://www.danbrown.com/secrets/foreign.html | contribution = World editions of The Da Vinci Code | type = official site | publisher = Dan Brown | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060127001617/http://www.danbrown.com/secrets/foreign.html | archivedate = January 27, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}.</ref> Major English-language (hardcover) editions include:\n* {{Citation | place = US | title = The Da Vinci Code | date = April 2003 | edition = 1st | publisher = Doubleday | ISBN = 0-385-50420-9 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/davincicodenove00brow }}.\n* {{Citation | title = The Da Vinci Code | edition = spec illustr | date = November 2, 2004 | publisher = Doubleday | ISBN = 0-385-51375-5 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/davincicode00brow_0 }} (as of January 2006, has sold 576,000 copies).\n* {{Citation | place = UK | title = The Da Vinci Code | date = April 2004 | publisher = Corgi Adult | ISBN = 0-552-14951-9 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/davincicode00danb }}.\n* {{Citation | place = UK | title = The Da Vinci Code | edition = illustr | date = October 2, 2004 | publisher = Bantam | ISBN = 0-593-05425-3}}.\n* {{Citation | place = US/[[Canada|CA]] | title = The Da Vinci Code | type = trade paperback |date=March 2006 | publisher = Anchor}}.\n* {{Citation | date = March 28, 2006 | title = The da Vinci code | publisher = Anchor | type = paperback}}, 5 million copies.\n* {{Citation | date = March 28, 2006 | title = The da Vinci code | publisher = Broadway | edition = special illustrated | type = paperback}}, released 200,000 copies.\n* {{Citation | date = May 19, 2006 | publisher = Doubleday, Broadway | title = The Da Vinci Code Illustrated Screenplay: Behind the Scenes of the Major Motion Picture | first = Akiva | last = Goldsman | author-link = Akiva Goldsman | others = Howard, Ron; Brown, Dan introd}}, the day of the film's release.

The vocal and dance performance group scene in Korea was shaped by trends and influences from dance music in the late 20th century. With the emergence of entertainment agencies towards the end of the 20th century, idol groups have since evolved over several generations to emphasize distinct personalities, images, and concepts in a more coordinated and sophisticated manner.\n\n== 1930\u201370s: Early Vocal Groups ==\nIn the 1930s and the 1950s, the earliest mainstream idols in Korea consisted of vocal groups that sang and performed at the same time.
