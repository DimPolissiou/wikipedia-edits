Mean temperatures range from {{convert|-4.9|C|1}} in February to {{convert|16.1|C|1}} in August, showing somewhat of a seasonal lag in the climate. The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States. The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia. This is partly due to its propensity for tropical storm activity as well as moist, Atlantic air frequently blowing ashore and creating precipitation.\n\nOf major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days),<ref name=\"Foggiest location\">{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=37&submit=Submit|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130219193253/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=37&submit=Submit|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-19|title=National Climate Data and Information Archive|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> windiest ({{convert|24.3|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} average speed),<ref name=\"Windiest location year-round\">{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=60&submit=Submit|title=National Climate Data and Information Archive|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2013-01-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121216045102/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=60&submit=Submit|archivedate=16 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and cloudiest (1,497&nbsp;hours of sunshine).<ref name=\"Cloudiest skies year-round\">{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=58&submit=Submit|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130219192052/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=58&submit=Submit|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-19|title=National Climate Data and Information Archive|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is unusual for humid continental climates, which typically have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds.\n\nIn winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can turn into heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend well into the spring months (March, April). The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain events (called \"silver thaws\"), the worst of which paralyzed the city in April 1984 and April 2017.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, St. John's declared a

Buildings took a variety of styles according to the means available to build them.\n\nStarting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John's consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood. Like many other cities of the time, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, the landscape changed as the city grew. [[The Great Fire of 1892]] destroyed most of the [[downtown St. John's|downtown]] core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period.<ref name=\"City of Fire\"/>\n[[File:St John's Houses.jpg|thumb|left|Houses in St. John's are typically painted in bright colours.]]\nOften compared to San Francisco due to the hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours, earning its downtown the nickname [[Jelly Bean Row]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/nytimes/articles/2006/07/28/st_johns_newfoundland/ |work=The Boston Globe |title=St. Johns, Newfoundland |date=28 July 2006 |first1=Jeff |last1=Schlegel |access-date=23 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604105047/http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/nytimes/articles/2006/07/28/st_johns_newfoundland/ |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[St. John's City Council|city council]] has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings.<ref>{{cite web|work=PHB Group Inc.|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/cityservices/planning/pdfs/Heritagefinal.pdf|title=St. John's Heritage Areas, Heritage Buildings and Public View|accessdate=5 August 2011|publisher=City of St. John's|date=21 March 2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016204712/http://www.stjohns.ca/cityservices/planning/pdfs/Heritagefinal.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These regulations have caused much controversy over the years.

On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is unusual for humid continental climates, which typically have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds.\n\nIn winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can turn into heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend well into the spring months (March, April). The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain events (called \"silver thaws\"), the worst of which paralyzed the city in April 1984 and April 2017.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, St. John's declared a

Some residences, storage shacks, and wharves are primarily made of wood.]]\nSt. John's architecture has a distinct style from the rest of Canada, and its major buildings are remnants of its history as one of the first British colonial capitals. Buildings took a variety of styles according to the means available to build them.\n\nStarting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John's consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood. Like many other cities of the time, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, the landscape changed as the city grew. [[The Great Fire of 1892]] destroyed most of the [[downtown St. John's|downtown]] core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period.<ref name=\"City of Fire\"/>\n[[File:St John's Houses.jpg|thumb|left|Houses in St. John's are typically painted in bright colours.]]\nOften compared to San Francisco due to the hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours, earning its downtown the nickname [[Jelly Bean Row]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/nytimes/articles/2006/07/28/st_johns_newfoundland/ |work=The Boston Globe |title=St. Johns, Newfoundland |date=28 July 2006 |first1=Jeff |last1=Schlegel |access-date=23 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604105047/http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/nytimes/articles/2006/07/28/st_johns_newfoundland/ |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[St. John's City Council|city council]] has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings.<ref>{{cite web|work=PHB Group Inc.|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/cityservices/planning/pdfs/Heritagefinal.pdf|title=St. John's Heritage Areas, Heritage Buildings and Public View|accessdate=5 August 2011|publisher=City of St. John's|date=21 March 2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016204712/http://www.stjohns.ca/cityservices/planning/pdfs/Heritagefinal.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These regulations have caused much controversy over the years.

The new zone will allow for buildings of greater height.

The station sublicenses entertainment programming from [[Global Television Network|Global]] and news programming from [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and Global, rather than purchasing primary broadcast rights. [[Rogers Cable]] has its provincial headquarters in St. John's, and their community channel [[Rogers TV]] airs local shows such as ''Out of the Fog'' and ''One Chef One Critic''. [[CBC Television|CBC]] has its Newfoundland and Labrador headquarters in the city and their television station [[CBNT-DT]] broadcasts from University Avenue.\n\nThe city is home to 15&nbsp;am and FM radio stations, two of which are [[French-language]] stations. St. John's is the only Canadian city served by radio stations whose call letters do not all begin with the letter ''C''. The [[ITU prefix]] ''VO'' was assigned to the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] before the province joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949, and three [[AM radio|AM]] stations kept their existing call letters. However, other commercial radio stations in St. John's that went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes (''CF''\u2013''CK'') currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of [[VOCM-FM]], which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the AM station that bore that callsign. VO remains in use in [[amateur radio]].\n\n''allNewfoundlandLabrador'' is the city's daily [[online newspaper]], which focuses on business news from across the province.<ref name=brad>{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=James|title=Subscription news site AllNovaScotia expands to Newfoundland|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/|website=Globe and Mail|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=13 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022021135/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/|archive-date=22 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador}}\n\n==Sister cities==\n* [[\u00cdlhavo]], Portugal<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Johns (Canad\u00e1)|url=http://www.cm-ilhavo.pt/pages/124|publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal de \u00cdlhavo|accessdate=8 September 2015|language=Portuguese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831184558/http://cm-ilhavo.pt/pages/124|archive-date=31 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Waterford]], Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Waterford city and St John's, Newfoundland, to be twinned|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/waterford-city-and-st-john-s-newfoundland-to-be-twinned-1.1061907|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=The Irish Times|date=26 June 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629182557/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/waterford-city-and-st-john-s-newfoundland-to-be-twinned-1.1061907|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of municipalities in Newfoundland and Labrador]]\n* [[Mundy Pond, Newfoundland|Mundy Pond]]\n* [[Parkway (St. John's)]]\n{{Clear right}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=statcan2011>{{cite web\n   |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=1001519&Geo2=CMA&Code2=001&Data=Count&SearchText=St.%20John%27s&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1\n   |title=2011 Census Profile: St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador\n   |author=Statistics Canada\n   |authorlink=Statistics Canada\n   |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Harding, Les.
