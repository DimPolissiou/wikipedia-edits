In 1995, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit, often dressed in an adult-sized [[romper suit]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''.\n\nHe again appeared with Reeves & Mortimer in the BBC series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall & Hopkirk]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with [[David Walliams]], with whom he had already worked in both ''[[Mash and Peas]]'' and ''[[Sir Bernard's Stately Homes]]'', to create ''[[Rock Profile]]'', a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nHis music video appearances include the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\", \"Jesusland\" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and \"[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]\" by [[Fat Les]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' at The Venue, London. He played the performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]].\n\n===''Little Britain''===\n''[[Little Britain]]'' is Lucas's most commercially successful work. The show came about when trainee BBC radio producer, [[Ashley Blaker]], tasked with coming up with ideas for a TV or radio series, bumped into Lucas in London.<ref name=\"jc\">[https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/comedian-ashley-blaker-my-unorthodox-life-in-little-britain-1.59969] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The two were old friends from Haberdashers' and Lucas took Blaker to the [[Groucho Club]], where he told Blaker of his ideas for a sketch show. Little Britain was launched as a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]] and it later became a TV series. Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently \"disabled\" [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], [[homophobic]] homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]], and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]]. In January 2005 Lucas and Walliams were named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful people in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Methven|first1=Nicola|date=11 January 2005|title=Lucas & Walliams 'funniest'|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lucas+%26+Walliams+%27funniest%27-a0126878529|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=MGN Ltd.|access-date=13 September 2017|via=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\n===After ''Little Britain''===\nIn 2005, he took his first role in a television drama, a supporting part as a [[Venice|Venetian]] duke in the BBC historical serial ''[[Casanova (2005 TV serial)|Casanova]]'', written by [[Russell T Davies]].

The show saw Walliams and Lucas each playing multiple characters but, unlike ''Little Britain'', it focused entirely on the working environment of the airline industry. In an interview shown on BBC 3 on 9 February 2011, it was stated that the creators considered bringing travel agent character Carol Beer from ''Little Britain'' to the new series, but decided against it, as they did not want viewers to see the new show as merely a spinoff. Instead, all new characters were introduced.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, Lucas appeared as the \"Generation X\" guest on the Australian game show ''[[Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation]]''.

He is best known for his partnership with [[David Walliams]] on the [[BBC]] [[sketch comedy]] series [[Rock Profile|''Rock Profile'']] (1999\u20132000, 2009), [[Little Britain|''Little Britain'']] (2003\u20132007) and [[Come Fly with Me (2010 TV series)|''Come Fly With Me'']] (2010). Lucas played the role of [[Nardole]] in the BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (2015-2017). He has also appeared in films such as [[The Infidel (2010 film)|''The Infidel'']] (2010), [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|''Alice in Wonderland'']] (2010) and its [[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|sequel]] (2016), [[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|''Bridesmaids'']] (2011) and [[Small Apartments|''Small Apartments'']] (2012).\n\n==Early life==\nLucas was born in [[Paddington]], London, the son of Diana (n\u00e9e Williams) (born 1945) and John Stanley Lucas (1944\u20131996), who ran a chauffeuring business. He is [[Jewish]]; some of Lucas's mother's family fled from Germany just before the [[Second World War]]. Lucas has had [[Alopecia universalis|alopecia]] since his childhood, and lost all of his hair when he was six years old.<ref name=es1>{{cite news |title=Matt Lucas has the last laugh |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/matt-lucas-has-the-last-laugh-7256366.html |first=Alison |last=Bowyer |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=26 April 2005}}</ref> Lucas's father died of a heart attack aged 52 in [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], Greater London.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6408740.ece?token=null&offset=24&page=3 |title=Matt Lucas on fame, body image and relationships|first=Robert |last=Crampton |newspaper=The Times|date=6 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nLucas was educated at Aylward Primary School and [[The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], an independent school in [[Borehamwood]] in Hertfordshire, the same school attended by comic actors [[David Baddiel]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].

In 1995, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit, often dressed in an adult-sized [[romper suit]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''.\n\nHe again appeared with Reeves & Mortimer in the BBC series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall & Hopkirk]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with [[David Walliams]], with whom he had already worked in both ''[[Mash and Peas]]'' and ''[[Sir Bernard's Stately Homes]]'', to create ''[[Rock Profile]]'', a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nHis music video appearances include the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\", \"Jesusland\" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and \"[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]\" by [[Fat Les]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' at The Venue, London. He played the performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]].\n\n===''Little Britain''===\n''[[Little Britain]]'' is Lucas's most commercially successful work. The show came about when trainee BBC radio producer, [[Ashley Blaker]], tasked with coming up with ideas for a TV or radio series, bumped into Lucas in London.<ref name=\"jc\">[https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/comedian-ashley-blaker-my-unorthodox-life-in-little-britain-1.59969] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The two were old friends from Haberdashers' and Lucas took Blaker to the [[Groucho Club]], where he told Blaker of his ideas for a sketch show. Little Britain was launched as a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]] and it later became a TV series. Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently \"disabled\" [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], [[homophobic]] homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]], and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]].

The actual bell from [[HMS Duke of York (17)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] can still be seen mounted on a bell-shed at the front school parade ground between the school chapel and the hall.

The founding principal/headmaster was R. H. James<ref name=\"auto1\"/>.\n\nOriginally the school was reserved for white students only within the racial system of colonial Kenya Colony. All teachers (masters, as they were called at the time), were also white. The students were drawn from the sons of British settlers, most of whom were farmers in outlying areas. This required a primarily boarding facility for the students, although originally there were a few \"day\" students who came daily. The school system was modelled after the English \"public school\" system.\n\nBy the early 1960s the school was fully developed with its own well kept 9-hole [[golf course]], [[rifle range]], [[horse stable]]s, a [[cricket oval]] with a [[cricket pavilion]] and ample sports fields for [[rugby union|rugby]], [[Association football|football]], [[hockey]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], tennis, [[squash (sport)|squash]], and other sports. The [[astronomy]] club as well endowed with telescopes, the science labs well equipped, and off-site school facilities provided for sailing, [[mountain climbing]] and other distractions most of which are still available to date. The school had its own water supply from boreholes, and its own sewage treatment plant which were still in operation well into the late 1980s. A large contingent of resident \"subordinate\" staff were housed on the campus, and saw to the well-being of the faculty and students. They provided all janitorial, laundry, dining, groundskeeping and similar labour, leaving the students free to pursue learning and leisure activities. The main railway line from [[Nairobi]] city to western [[Kenya]] passes along the front border of the school, passing over a bridge (nicknamed ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'') which marks the front gate of the school. During the colonial era the train would drop off and pick up students going or coming from the school holidays.\n\nAfter Kenya's independence in 1963 there were gradual changes that led to the first few black and Asian students being admitted in the mid 1960s. These pioneer students were subjected to severe conditions and discrimination as they opened the doors to other Kenyans to come behind them. Black teachers began to be employed in the early 1970s and were similarly subjected to difficult circumstances.\n\nThe school was renamed Lenana School in 1969 after the central person in the interaction of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] with invading British imperialists and spiritual leader of the Maasai, Laibon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/maasai/beliefs.htm#laiboni|title=Maasai religion and beliefs - Traditional Music & Cultures of Kenya|website=www.bluegecko.org}}</ref> Lenana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000063888/the-life-and-times-of-paramount-chief-lenana|title=The life and times of paramount chief Lenana|first=Amos|last=Kareithi|website=The Standard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_rulers_of_the_Maasai&oldid=926626240|title=List of rulers of the Maasai|date=17 November 2019|via=Wikipedia}}</ref>, around the end of the 19th century through to the early 20th century. The first Kenyan headmaster (principal) of the school was Mr. James Kamunge. The referral to old students of the school changed from the phrase ''Old Yorkist'' to ''Laibons'' the latter being a title given to religious figures of the Maasai. A picture of Lenana painted by a student artist called Sam Madoka can be seen hanging next to the steps that lead to the 2nd floor of the administration block.\n\nLenana School currently has 1200 students. In 2006, it was ranked 26th best high school in Kenya based on [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]] results.<ref>[http://eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143965494&date=1/03/2007 ]{{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> Through the 1980s and into the 21st century, Lenana High School has maintained high academic standards ranking in the top 10 and top 20 respectively for many years in the 1980s.

Its nationwide recruitment objectives means that each entering class of fresh students is large and extremely diverse having representatives from all over the country. The classes offered run the full gamut of sciences and arts as well as life skills classes for the students thus inclined. The curriculum might be considered heavy on the sciences but equal attention is paid to providing the students with extensive humanities classes ensuring that all benefit from a well-rounded experience and maximum opportunities for life after high school. The school routinely has a good showing in the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]]<ref name=\"nation_d49li7\"/> (KCSE) nationwide and is consistently ranked highly in its category of schools with large enrolment.<ref>[http://elimu.education.go.ke/KCSE/natschdisp.asp]</ref>{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} <ref>[http://elimu.education.go.ke/KCSE/schtop450disp.asp]</ref>{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\nStudents graduating from Lenana School go on to pursue a myriad of careers.\n\nThe old education system ([[O Level]] and [[A Level]] system<ref name=\"nation_d49li7\"/>) consisted of first form to [[sixth form]] students. first form to fourth form had four streams of classes with approximately 40 students each. The subjects done in first form to second form were English Literature, Mathematics, Geography, History, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Music, Fine Art, Swahili, French, Wood Work and Metal Work (the wood and metal work classes were taken in alternating years of form 1 and form 2 respectively). Fifth form and [[sixth form]] were divided in the particular subjects the students took i.e. sciences and arts. In fifth form and [[sixth form]] a student could take either 3 or 4 subjects with suitable combinations being determined by the school on selection.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nBeing a boarding school, extracurricular activities play a huge part in the day-to-day of the student. To this end, there is no shortage of activities into which the students can throw themselves into. Some of these activities are mandated by the school and so time is allotted to the completion of these activities. [[Community work]] (''not so popularly referred to as Comm work'') is designed to empower the student to take charge of maintaining his surroundings, basically janitorial duties performed at early morning hours and extended hours of weekend mornings, except Sunday. Students also participate in drama activities. There are intramural (between houses) competitions in drama, music and all manner of sports that are taken very seriously and from these contests are the school representatives selected to compete externally.\n\nThere are a large number of clubs catering to different niches that provide students with opportunities to interact with others of like interest within and without the school. Examples of these clubs include the [[Commonwealth]] Club (formerly United Nations Club), the Junior Achievement club (known as J.A), the French Club, the Rifle Club, the St. John Ambulance club, the [[The Kenya Scouts Association|Boy Scouts]], the Duma (prefects' club) and [[Christian Union (students)|Christian Union]], to name a few. From time to time, the school is called upon to host festivals and functions with invited guests from other schools, near and far. These include Drama festivals/contests, music festivals/contests, Science Congress and many others. School magazines are also a popular activity, be they the formal school newsletter, the ''Laibon'' or those of the satirical gossip variety (Scandal, Peep, etc.).\n\n== Cadet training era ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lenana School cadet students of the then \u2018Duke of York School\u2019 (now Lenana School), parade for inspection in fully para-military attire and armory at the School\u2019s main parade ground in 1962.png|thumb|right|550px| Lenana School student's Combined Cadet Force (CCF), then \u2018The Duke of York School\u2019, parade for inspection in full para-military attire and arms at the School\u2019s  main parade ground in 1962. The CCF was affiliated to the Kenya Regiment, & later the Kenyan military, in which many of the pupils resident in Kenya proceeded for national military service.\u00a0 Like most schools pre-independence, membership of the CCF was compulsory. It was termed Combined Cadet Force because the officers were teachers at the school concerned & not because the three sections of the armed forces were represented.\u00a0 The Cadet Corp continued on post-independence up until 1982 and in 1983 to 1985 it was only a \u2018march-past company\u2019 mainly for special occasions & a rifle club that held annual rifle events at the school\u2019s shooting range next to the CCF armoury (now the basketball court).]] -->\nLenana High School had a Combined [[Cadet]] Force (CCF)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mccrow.org.uk/EastAfrica/Duke%20of%20York%20School/CCFDuko.htm|title=Duke of York School}}</ref> training course of para-military standards in which interested students enrolled. The cadet course was started in the colonial era when [[Mau Mau]] activity was at its peak to provide basic training for conscription in the all-white [[Kenya Regiment]] and was mandatory for all students over 14 years of age. After the colonial era Lenana went on with the cadet course until it was stopped by the government after the unsuccessful 1982 coup d'\u00e9tat. The cadet section had uniforms, guns, [[ammunition]], an [[armory (military)|armoury]], a [[parade]] ground with adjacent stores and offices, an obstacle course and a [[shooting range]]. Wednesday afternoons were free of lessons for students so that the cadets could undertake their various training activities. The cadets took part in march pasts during various national days. They also used to be assigned sentry duty at the main gate and around the school at night. Successful cadets who passed out would be issued rank. The cadets, after completion of their form 6 education, could further their careers by joining the armed forces as officer cadets. When the cadet training course was shut down the government collected all the guns and ammunition from the armoury but left the cadet uniforms behind. Once every year until the late 1980s teachers would hold a supervised shooting competition. Most of the competitions took place during the school's Founders Day holiday that is celebrated on 28 January.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[Image:MeanMaroon82.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Lenana School 1982 15-a-side rugby squad poses for a team photo.

This means that there are as many different sporting activities as there are student backgrounds. Most students come into ''Changez'' having previously been involved in organised sports and for those who have not, they soon get involved in intramural contests. Given the size and the make-up of the student body, there is a heightened competitive nature prevailing within these friendly confines. Facilities are available for many of the sporting activities ranging from rugby and soccer pitches, athletics tracks, hockey fields, cricket pavilion, a gymnasium, tennis and basketball courts, competition-size swimming pool, squash court, wooded terrain (ideal for cross-country), a rifle range and a nine-hole golf course. The inter-house competitions are held with regularity. From these ripe fields are the school's representatives selected. The school always fields competitive teams in soccer, athletics, cross-country, basketball, swimming, hockey, karate and volleyball.\n\nTheir rugby is steeped in school tradition and has been a major part of the school's scenery since the school's inception in 1949. Back then the sport (and the school) was the reserve of the elite (predominantly white). Since then Lenana has been one of the four elite rugby schools,<ref name=\"archive1\">{{cite web|url=http://kenyapage.net/rugby/reviews/rugby-review.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024211705/http://kenyapage.net/rugby/reviews/rugby-review.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-24 |title=A Review Of Kenyan Rugby |date= |accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref> winning many accolades, trophies, tournaments and being the only high school team ever to win a championship at club level (see [[Eric Shirley Shield]] 1977).

The school also hosts the John Andrews Memorial 7-a-side Rugby Tournament, in honour of a former student. Many former students have gone on to represent the country on the national team in international tournaments as well as play professionally abroad.<ref name=\"archive1\"/> The team is known as the 'Mean Maroon' and adorns the maroon jersey emblazoned with the white rose for home meets.

These are the full School Colours, full House Colours & '49 Club half Colour that were issued to students for achievements in sports and worn on their school blazers.]]\nThe school had an awards scheme where students were awarded school or house colours depending on the sport they excelled in. The colours consisted of a piece of maroon cloth approximately three inches in length, three-quarters on an inch in width and two-eighths of an inch thick. Its border and wording in the middle was embroidered with silver or white thread. There were two categories which are full and half colours. If someone was awarded a full colour in for example rugby the text on the colour would read RUGBY at the recipient would wear it on the left side of his school [[blazer]] just below the school badge. If a student acquired three full colours he was awarded a silver lining which was a thick silver or white thread that was sown all around the edge of his blazer. The half colours had the words 49 CLUB (49 being the year the school was founded) embroidered on them, two half colours equalled a full colour. Full colours bearing the name of the sport you excelled in could only be awarded at school level. If you were awarded full colours at the house level it could only indicate your house name and not the sport you received it for. House half colours also bore the name 49 CLUB. A silver lining was awarded by the principal.\n\n== Blocks/Houses ==\n\n[[Image:CareyFrancis1969.jpg|thumb|right|550px| Carey Francis House 1969.

[[Henry Odein Ajumogobia]] (1st form standing 2nd row extreme left). Joseph Olewe Owiti 1st row, fifth from extreme left]].\nThere were 5 blocks consisting of 2 houses each. Each of the block has its own dining hall where students take their meals. The block dining halls are headed by a council secretary head of block. It is the head of blocks dining halls that are appointed by the teachers after every successful council body elections. The four are under supervision of Boarding captain. Each house consisted of all the class streams i.e. form 1 to 6 (in the old system) and form 1 to 4 (in the new system). In the old system form 1 to 4 had approximately 18 students each per house and form 5 to 6 had approximately 10 to 12 students each per house. The house was divided into 2 categories, Form 1 to 3 were known as juniors and they had their own sporting [[Sports league|league]]s. Form 4 to 6 formed the seniors and they too had their separate leagues. When it came to school team selection this was open to both juniors and seniors. Form 1 to 4 students slept in [[dormitories]]. Some form 5's slept in the form 4 dorms while the rest and all form 6 students slept in studies either 2 sharing one or in singles e.g. the Head of House and his deputy and the sports prefect.\n\nEach house was governed by a [[house master]] who consisted of a senior teacher living adjacent to the house. The student in charge of the house was known as a Head of House (HoH) and was a 6th form student. Assisting him run the house was a deputy head of house and about 5 or 6 other [[prefect]]s all drawn from the form 6 students. The prefect roles were divided amongst the activities of the house and the most influential being the sports prefect. A new set of prefects was selected towards the end of the year (3rd term) from amongst the form 5 students. Each block of 2 houses shared a [[dining hall]] except for Block 1 and 4 where four houses shared one dining hall. Each house had one janitor who took care of the laundry services for the students and the general upkeep of the house.\n\nThe dormitories have had some names changed over the course of time. This was done to acknowledge the changing times from the colonial era to independence and the many heroes involved in the independence movement in Kenya, as well as folk heroes. A few of the houses still retain their original names, evidently.\n\n[[File:Lenana School Blocks-Houses-Colours.jpg|thumb||right|950px| Lenana School house colours arranged left to right by blocks.

It still stands as it was when the school was known as The Duke of York School. The restoration of this chapel was launched and blessed on 26th August 2018 by The Most Reverend Dr. Jackson N. Ole Sapit, Archbishop of the Anglican Church of Kenya.]]\nThe founders of Lenana School (then The Duke of York School) placed a high priority on the religious aspect of student life.  An Anglican Church School Chapel (now Anglican Church of Kenya \u2013 ACK) was among the first building to be added after the School was built.  In later years, the School converted the gymnasium building into a Catholic Chapel and a Muslim Mosque was built on a site next to the cadet\u2019s shooting range. \nAs the School has grown to about 1,700 students, so has the presence of students from all religious faiths from across the 47 counties of Kenya.  The School\u2019s 2020-2030 strategic plan aims to improve inter-denominational religious facilities (in line with the National Values laid out in Section 10 of Chapter 2 of the [[Constitution of Kenya]] and with MoE recommendations) to accommodate a planned 3,000 student capacity in shared multi-faith facilities, while retaining the legacy religious facilities that currently exist in good condition.\nThe restoration of this chapel, named St. Luke\u2019s Chapel Lenana, was launched and blessed on 26th August 2018 by The Most Reverend Dr. [[Jackson Ole Sapit]], [[Archbishop]] of the [[Anglican Church of Kenya]].\n\n== School sanatorium ==\n\n[[File: LenanaSchoolSanatorium.jpg|thumb|right|450px| The front view of the  Lenana School Sanatorium in 2011.

It is equipped with a doctor/medical officer/nurse clinic and both general and private wards for in-patient treatment. The School, through the sanatorium staff and facilities, preserves the health and nutritional status of its residents as well as provides basic medical treatment and stabilisation in cases of emergencies. The School Sanatorium also provides medical counselling services.\nThe School Sanatorium treats about 40 students per day.  It has five (5) rooms for its out-patient activities, and six (6) rooms that can accommodate 10 students for in-patient treatment.  It has some basic medical equipment and a budget for basic drugs and medicines.  In 2019, the [[Ministry of Health (Kenya)]] (MoH) designated the Lenana School Sanatorium a MoH Level Two (2)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usaidassist.org/sites/default/files/kqmh_in-service_training_module_1.1.pdf |title= Health Care System in Kenya|last= |first= |date= |website=www.usaidassist.org |format=PDF|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> Health Clinic, which assists it in obtaining [[National Hospital Insurance Fund]] (NHIF) funded services.

The farm produces milk, fish, pork, mutton and vegetables.  In the early years, the School Farm was limited in its productivity due to a lack of an irrigation system.  In 2019, the [[Nairobi City Council]]\u2019s (NCC) Urban Sanitation Project agreed to increase the capacity of the initiated school dam on the School grounds to 163,000 cubic metres and include a pump station and irrigation pipes.  This is expected to be complete in early 2020. As of early 2020, it holds a 160,000 cubic metres capacity.\nThe School has at least 25 acres of lands that is suitable for crop production, plus cow sheds for at least 20 cows and stalls for about 30 pigs.  In 2019, the School, had about 6 acres under crop production, plus about 27 cattle, 31 pigs and 17 sheep, and 3 fish ponds.  The School Farm makes an approximate annual net profit of KShs. 670,000 ($ 6,500) after operational costs are factored in.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Inside Lenana School Chapel.jpg|Inside Lenana School Chapel\nFile:Lenana School Gate Jan 2012.JPG|Entrance to Lenana School\nFile:Lenana School bell.jpg|Lenana School Bell from the ship [[HMS Duke of York]]\nFile:Lenana School Chapel Bible3 (1).jpg|The Lenana School Chapel Bible signed and presented by [[King George VI]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{see also|Category:Alumni of Lenana School}}\n*[[John Dunt]], former Royal Navy officer\n*[[Geoffrey Kent]], founder, chairman, and CEO of Abercrombie & Kent\n*[[Jonathan Leakey]], businessman and former palaeoanthropologist\n*Odero Otieno, founder and CEO of DawaSwift\n*[[Richard Leakey]]\n*[[John Sibi-Okumu]]\n*[[Binyavanga Wainaina]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"nation_d49li7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/The-history-of-the-Kenyan-education-system/1190-1377574-d49li7/index.html|title=The history of the Kenyan education system|website=Daily Nation}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.laibonsociety.org Official Alumni website]\n*http://www.oldyorkist.com\n\n[[Category:Education in Nairobi]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Kenya]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1949]]\n[[Category:1949 establishments in Kenya]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name = Lenana School\n| image = Lenana_School_Badge2.jpg\n| motto = Nihil Praeter Optimum (Nothing But The Best)\n| established = 1949\n| type = National, Public\n| head = Mr. William Kemei\n| city = Nairobi\n| country = Kenya\n| coordinates = 1\u00b0 18' 0.957\" S, 36\u00b0 43' 41.775\" E <ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=-1.300245,36.728207&spn=0.007347,0.009978&t=k&z=17&om=1 |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n| campus = Karen, Nairobi\n| students = 1750\n| free_label =whiterose \n| free = \n| colors = Maroon, Grey and White\n| alumni_name = The Laibon Society\n| website = \n}}\n\n'''Lenana School''' is a Secondary School in [[Nairobi]], Kenya.

The founding principal/headmaster was R. H. James<ref name=\"auto1\"/>.\n\nOriginally the school was reserved for white students only within the racial system of colonial Kenya Colony. All teachers (masters, as they were called at the time), were also white. The students were drawn from the sons of British settlers, most of whom were farmers in outlying areas. This required a primarily boarding facility for the students, although originally there were a few \"day\" students who came daily. The school system was modelled after the English \"public school\" system.\n\nBy the early 1960s the school was fully developed with its own well kept 9-hole [[golf course]], [[rifle range]], [[horse stable]]s, a [[cricket oval]] with a [[cricket pavilion]] and ample sports fields for [[rugby union|rugby]], [[Association football|football]], [[hockey]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], tennis, [[squash (sport)|squash]], and other sports. The [[astronomy]] club as well endowed with telescopes, the science labs well equipped, and off-site school facilities provided for sailing, [[mountain climbing]] and other distractions most of which are still available to date. The school had its own water supply from boreholes, and its own sewage treatment plant which were still in operation well into the late 1980s. A large contingent of resident \"subordinate\" staff were housed on the campus, and saw to the well-being of the faculty and students. They provided all janitorial, laundry, dining, groundskeeping and similar labour, leaving the students free to pursue learning and leisure activities. The main railway line from [[Nairobi]] city to western [[Kenya]] passes along the front border of the school, passing over a bridge (nicknamed ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'') which marks the front gate of the school. During the colonial era the train would drop off and pick up students going or coming from the school holidays.\n\nAfter Kenya's independence in 1963 there were gradual changes that led to the first few black and Asian students being admitted in the mid 1960s. These pioneer students were subjected to severe conditions and discrimination as they opened the doors to other Kenyans to come behind them. Black teachers began to be employed in the early 1970s and were similarly subjected to difficult circumstances.\n\nThe school was renamed Lenana School in 1969 after the central person in the interaction of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] with invading British imperialists and spiritual leader of the Maasai, Laibon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/maasai/beliefs.htm#laiboni|title=Maasai religion and beliefs - Traditional Music & Cultures of Kenya|website=www.bluegecko.org}}</ref> Lenana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000063888/the-life-and-times-of-paramount-chief-lenana|title=The life and times of paramount chief Lenana|first=Amos|last=Kareithi|website=The Standard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_rulers_of_the_Maasai&oldid=926626240|title=List of rulers of the Maasai|date=17 November 2019|via=Wikipedia}}</ref>, around the end of the 19th century through to the early 20th century. The first Kenyan headmaster (principal) of the school was Mr. James Kamunge. The referral to old students of the school changed from the phrase ''Old Yorkist'' to ''Laibons'' the latter being a title given to religious figures of the Maasai.

Its nationwide recruitment objectives means that each entering class of fresh students is large and extremely diverse having representatives from all over the country. The classes offered run the full gamut of sciences and arts as well as life skills classes for the students thus inclined. The curriculum might be considered heavy on the sciences but equal attention is paid to providing the students with extensive humanities classes ensuring that all benefit from a well-rounded experience and maximum opportunities for life after high school. The school routinely has a good showing in the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]]<ref name=\"nation_d49li7\"/> (KCSE) nationwide and is consistently ranked highly in its category of schools with large enrolment.<ref>[http://elimu.education.go.ke/KCSE/natschdisp.asp]</ref>{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} <ref>[http://elimu.education.go.ke/KCSE/schtop450disp.asp]</ref>{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\nStudents graduating from Lenana School go on to pursue a myriad of careers.\n\nThe old education system ([[O Level]] and [[A Level]] system<ref name=\"nation_d49li7\"/>) consisted of first form to [[sixth form]] students. first form to fourth form had four streams of classes with approximately 40 students each. The subjects done in first form to second form were English Literature, Mathematics, Geography, History, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Music, Fine Art, Swahili, French, Wood Work and Metal Work (the wood and metal work classes were taken in alternating years of form 1 and form 2 respectively). Fifth form and [[sixth form]] were divided in the particular subjects the students took i.e. sciences and arts. In fifth form and [[sixth form]] a student could take either 3 or 4 subjects with suitable combinations being determined by the school on selection.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nBeing a boarding school, extracurricular activities play a huge part in the day-to-day of the student. To this end, there is no shortage of activities into which the students can throw themselves into. Some of these activities are mandated by the school and so time is allotted to the completion of these activities. [[Community work]] (''not so popularly referred to as Comm work'') is designed to empower the student to take charge of maintaining his surroundings, basically janitorial duties performed at early morning hours and extended hours of weekend mornings, except Sunday. Students also participate in drama activities. There are intramural (between houses) competitions in drama, music and all manner of sports that are taken very seriously and from these contests are the school representatives selected to compete externally.\n\nThere are a large number of clubs catering to different niches that provide students with opportunities to interact with others of like interest within and without the school. Examples of these clubs include the [[Commonwealth]] Club (formerly United Nations Club), the Junior Achievement club (known as J.A), the French Club, the Rifle Club, the St. John Ambulance club, the [[The Kenya Scouts Association|Boy Scouts]], the Duma (prefects' club) and [[Christian Union (students)|Christian Union]], to name a few. From time to time, the school is called upon to host festivals and functions with invited guests from other schools, near and far. These include Drama festivals/contests, music festivals/contests, Science Congress and many others. School magazines are also a popular activity, be they the formal school newsletter, the ''Laibon'' or those of the satirical gossip variety (Scandal, Peep, etc.).\n\n== Cadet training era ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lenana School cadet students of the then \u2018Duke of York School\u2019 (now Lenana School), parade for inspection in fully para-military attire and armory at the School\u2019s main parade ground in 1962.png|thumb|right|550px| Lenana School student's Combined Cadet Force (CCF), then \u2018The Duke of York School\u2019, parade for inspection in full para-military attire and arms at the School\u2019s  main parade ground in 1962. The CCF was affiliated to the Kenya Regiment, & later the Kenyan military, in which many of the pupils resident in Kenya proceeded for national military service.\u00a0 Like most schools pre-independence, membership of the CCF was compulsory. It was termed Combined Cadet Force because the officers were teachers at the school concerned & not because the three sections of the armed forces were represented.\u00a0 The Cadet Corp continued on post-independence up until 1982 and in 1983 to 1985 it was only a \u2018march-past company\u2019 mainly for special occasions & a rifle club that held annual rifle events at the school\u2019s shooting range next to the CCF armoury (now the basketball court).]] -->\nLenana High School had a Combined [[Cadet]] Force (CCF)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mccrow.org.uk/EastAfrica/Duke%20of%20York%20School/CCFDuko.htm|title=Duke of York School}}</ref> training course of para-military standards in which interested students enrolled. The cadet course was started in the colonial era when [[Mau Mau]] activity was at its peak to provide basic training for conscription in the all-white [[Kenya Regiment]] and was mandatory for all students over 14 years of age. After the colonial era Lenana went on with the cadet course until it was stopped by the government after the unsuccessful 1982 coup d'\u00e9tat. The cadet section had uniforms, guns, [[ammunition]], an [[armory (military)|armoury]], a [[parade]] ground with adjacent stores and offices, an obstacle course and a [[shooting range]]. Wednesday afternoons were free of lessons for students so that the cadets could undertake their various training activities. The cadets took part in march pasts during various national days. They also used to be assigned sentry duty at the main gate and around the school at night. Successful cadets who passed out would be issued rank. The cadets, after completion of their form 6 education, could further their careers by joining the armed forces as officer cadets. When the cadet training course was shut down the government collected all the guns and ammunition from the armoury but left the cadet uniforms behind. Once every year until the late 1980s teachers would hold a supervised shooting competition. Most of the competitions took place during the school's Founders Day holiday that is celebrated on 28 January.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[Image:MeanMaroon82.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Lenana School 1982 15-a-side rugby squad poses for a team photo.

This means that there are as many different sporting activities as there are student backgrounds. Most students come into ''Changez'' having previously been involved in organised sports and for those who have not, they soon get involved in intramural contests. Given the size and the make-up of the student body, there is a heightened competitive nature prevailing within these friendly confines. Facilities are available for many of the sporting activities ranging from rugby and soccer pitches, athletics tracks, hockey fields, cricket pavilion, a gymnasium, tennis and basketball courts, competition-size swimming pool, squash court, wooded terrain (ideal for cross-country), a rifle range and a nine-hole golf course. The inter-house competitions are held with regularity. From these ripe fields are the school's representatives selected. The school always fields competitive teams in soccer, athletics, cross-country, basketball, swimming, hockey, karate and volleyball.\n\nTheir rugby is steeped in school tradition and has been a major part of the school's scenery since the school's inception in 1949. Back then the sport (and the school) was the reserve of the elite (predominantly white). Since then Lenana has been one of the four elite rugby schools,<ref name=\"archive1\">{{cite web|url=http://kenyapage.net/rugby/reviews/rugby-review.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024211705/http://kenyapage.net/rugby/reviews/rugby-review.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-24 |title=A Review Of Kenyan Rugby |date= |accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref> winning many accolades, trophies, tournaments and being the only high school team ever to win a championship at club level (see [[Eric Shirley Shield]] 1977).

These are the full School Colours, full House Colours & '49 Club half Colour that were issued to students for achievements in sports and worn on their school blazers.]]\nThe school had an awards scheme where students were awarded school or house colours depending on the sport they excelled in. The colours consisted of a piece of maroon cloth approximately three inches in length, three-quarters on an inch in width and two-eighths of an inch thick. Its border and wording in the middle was embroidered with silver or white thread. There were two categories which are full and half colours. If someone was awarded a full colour in for example rugby the text on the colour would read RUGBY at the recipient would wear it on the left side of his school [[blazer]] just below the school badge. If a student acquired three full colours he was awarded a silver lining which was a thick silver or white thread that was sown all around the edge of his blazer. The half colours had the words 49 CLUB (49 being the year the school was founded) embroidered on them, two half colours equalled a full colour. Full colours bearing the name of the sport you excelled in could only be awarded at school level. If you were awarded full colours at the house level it could only indicate your house name and not the sport you received it for. House half colours also bore the name 49 CLUB. A silver lining was awarded by the principal.\n\n== Blocks/Houses ==\n\n[[Image:CareyFrancis1969.jpg|thumb|right|550px| Carey Francis House 1969.

Each of the block has its own dining hall where students take their meals. The block dining halls are headed by a council secretary head of block. It is the head of blocks dining halls that are appointed by the teachers after every successful council body elections. The four are under supervision of Boarding captain. Each house consisted of all the class streams i.e. form 1 to 6 (in the old system) and form 1 to 4 (in the new system). In the old system form 1 to 4 had approximately 18 students each per house and form 5 to 6 had approximately 10 to 12 students each per house. The house was divided into 2 categories, Form 1 to 3 were known as juniors and they had their own sporting [[Sports league|league]]s. Form 4 to 6 formed the seniors and they too had their separate leagues. When it came to school team selection this was open to both juniors and seniors. Form 1 to 4 students slept in [[dormitories]]. Some form 5's slept in the form 4 dorms while the rest and all form 6 students slept in studies either 2 sharing one or in singles e.g. the Head of House and his deputy and the sports prefect.\n\nEach house was governed by a [[house master]] who consisted of a senior teacher living adjacent to the house. The student in charge of the house was known as a Head of House (HoH) and was a 6th form student. Assisting him run the house was a deputy head of house and about 5 or 6 other [[prefect]]s all drawn from the form 6 students. The prefect roles were divided amongst the activities of the house and the most influential being the sports prefect. A new set of prefects was selected towards the end of the year (3rd term) from amongst the form 5 students. Each block of 2 houses shared a [[dining hall]] except for Block 1 and 4 where four houses shared one dining hall. Each house had one janitor who took care of the laundry services for the students and the general upkeep of the house.\n\nThe dormitories have had some names changed over the course of time. This was done to acknowledge the changing times from the colonial era to independence and the many heroes involved in the independence movement in Kenya, as well as folk heroes. A few of the houses still retain their original names, evidently.\n\n[[File:Lenana School Blocks-Houses-Colours.jpg|thumb||right|950px| Lenana School house colours arranged left to right by blocks.

An Anglican Church School Chapel (now Anglican Church of Kenya \u2013 ACK) was among the first building to be added after the School was built.  In later years, the School converted the gymnasium building into a Catholic Chapel and a Muslim Mosque was built on a site next to the cadet\u2019s shooting range. \nAs the School has grown to about 1,700 students, so has the presence of students from all religious faiths from across the 47 counties of Kenya.  The School\u2019s 2020-2030 strategic plan aims to improve inter-denominational religious facilities (in line with the National Values laid out in Section 10 of Chapter 2 of the [[Constitution of Kenya]] and with MoE recommendations) to accommodate a planned 3,000 student capacity in shared multi-faith facilities, while retaining the legacy religious facilities that currently exist in good condition.\nThe restoration of this chapel, named St. Luke\u2019s Chapel Lenana, was launched and blessed on 26th August 2018 by The Most Reverend Dr. [[Jackson Ole Sapit]], [[Archbishop]] of the [[Anglican Church of Kenya]].\n\n== School sanatorium ==\n\n[[File: LenanaSchoolSanatorium.jpg|thumb|right|450px| The front view of the  Lenana School Sanatorium in 2011.

The farm produces milk, fish, pork, mutton and vegetables.  In the early years, the School Farm was limited in its productivity due to a lack of an irrigation system.  In 2019, the [[Nairobi City Council]]\u2019s (NCC) Urban Sanitation Project agreed to increase the capacity of the initiated school dam on the School grounds to 163,000 cubic metres and include a pump station and irrigation pipes.  This is expected to be complete in early 2020. As of early 2020, it holds a 160,000 cubic metres capacity.\nThe School has at least 25 acres of lands that is suitable for crop production, plus cow sheds for at least 20 cows and stalls for about 30 pigs.  In 2019, the School, had about 6 acres under crop production, plus about 27 cattle, 31 pigs and 17 sheep, and 3 fish ponds.  The School Farm makes an approximate annual net profit of KShs. 670,000 ($ 6,500) after operational costs are factored in.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Inside Lenana School Chapel.jpg|Inside Lenana School Chapel\nFile:Lenana School Gate Jan 2012.JPG|Entrance to Lenana School\nFile:Lenana School bell.jpg|Lenana School Bell from the ship [[HMS Duke of York]]\nFile:Lenana School Chapel Bible3 (1).jpg|The Lenana School Chapel Bible signed and presented by [[King George VI]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{see also|Category:Alumni of Lenana School}}\n*[[John Dunt]], former Royal Navy officer\n*[[Geoffrey Kent]], founder, chairman, and CEO of Abercrombie & Kent\n*[[Jonathan Leakey]], businessman and former palaeoanthropologist\n*Odero Otieno, founder and CEO of DawaSwift\n*[[Richard Leakey]]\n*[[John Sibi-Okumu]]\n*[[Binyavanga Wainaina]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"nation_d49li7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/The-history-of-the-Kenyan-education-system/1190-1377574-d49li7/index.html|title=The history of the Kenyan education system|website=Daily Nation}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.laibonsociety.org Official Alumni website]\n*http://www.oldyorkist.com\n\n[[Category:Education in Nairobi]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Kenya]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1949]]\n[[Category:1949 establishments in Kenya]]\n", "name_user": "Arvid-maxime", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a link to Kenya", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenana_School"}

On the advice of the senate the Romans then set out into the surrounding regions in the search for wives to establish families with. The Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the all the peoples that they appealed to including the [[Sabines]], who populated the neighboring areas. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans. Consequently, the Romans devised a plan to abduct the Sabine women during the festival of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune Equester]].

Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.\n\nThe Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.\n\nRoman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).\n\nThe Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for \"what they bore on their arms\", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was buried on or thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].\n\nThe Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.\n\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld]]]]\n\nAt this point in the story, however, the Sabine women intervened:\n\n{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, \"that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children. If you are dissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn your resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and of bloodshed to our husbands and parents.

Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.\n\nThe new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]</ref>\n\n== Historical Analysis ==\nThe motivation behind the abduction of the Sabine women is contested among ancient sources. Livy writes that Rome's motivation for abducting the Sabine women was solely to increase the cities population and claims that no direct sexual assault took place during the abduction. Livy says that Romulus offered the Sabine women free choice as well as civic and property rights. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring \"that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and \u2014dearest of all to human nature-would be the mothers of freemen.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=1|title=Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 1, chapter pr|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> Scholars like [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] argue that it was an attempt to secure an alliance with the Sabine's through the women's newly founded relationships with Roman men.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Robert|date=1995|title=Livy's Sabine Women and the Ideal of Concordia|url=|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association|volume=125|pages=291\u2013319|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Livy's account is reinforced in some ways through the works of [[Cicero]]. In Cicero's work De re publica, he reiterates Livy's view that the plan to abduct the Sabine women at the festival was done in order \"to strengthen the new state\" and \"safeguard the resources of his kingdom and people.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike Livy, Cicero, and Dionysius, [[Ovid]] looks at the abduction of the Sabine as an avenue for the men of Rome to fulfill their sexual desires rather than an attempt at taking wives to produce children for the city.<ref name=\":1\" /> While he does make note of the issue surrounding Rome's lack of women, he does not make it out to be a factor in the planning of the abduction.\n\n==Artistic representations==\nMany treatments of the legend combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.\n\nThe subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].\n\n=== Edgar Degas ===\n[[Edgar Degas]] painted ''The Rape of the Sabines''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edgar-degas.org/The-Rape-of-the-Sabines.html|title=The Rape of the Sabines \u2013 Edgar Degas \u2013 www.edgar-degas.org|website=www.edgar-degas.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref> (after [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]]), c. 1861\u20131862.\n\n\"The masters must be copied over and over again\", Degas said, \"and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature.\" Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen.

The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes.

With Rome growing at such a steady rate in comparison to its neighbors, Romulus became concerned with maintaining the cities strength. His main concern was that w'''i'''thout any women inhabitants their was no chance at continuing to populate the city, and if without the ability to maintain its population, the city may not last longer than a generation. On the advice of the senate the Romans then set out into the surrounding regions in the search for wives to establish families with. The Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the all the peoples that they appealed to including the [[Sabines]], who populated the neighboring areas. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans. Consequently, the Romans devised a plan to abduct the Sabine women during the festival of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus%20equestris|Neptune Equester]]. They planned and announced a festival of games to attract people from all the nearby towns. According to [[Livy]], many people from Rome's neighboring towns including folk from the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]], [[Crustumerium|Crustumini]], and [[Antemnae|Antemnates]], attended the festival along with the Sabines, eager to see the newfound city for themselves. At the festival, Romulus gave a signal by \"rising and folding his cloak and then throwing it round him again,\" at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. In total, thirty Sabine women were abducted by the Romans at the festival. All of the women abducted at the festival were said to have been virgins except for one married woman, [[Hersilia]], who would later become Romulus' wife and be the one to intervene and stop the ensuing war between the Romans and the Sabines. The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept the Roman men as their new husbands.\n\n==War with Sabines and other tribes==\n\n[[File:Stella, Jacques, The Rape of the Sabines, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Stella]], ''The Rape of the Sabines'', mid 17th century, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]][[File:Giambologna sabine.jpg|thumb|''The Kidnapping of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]], in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Florence|alt=|left]]Outraged at the occurrence, the king of the Caeninenses entered upon Roman territory with his army.  Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.\n\nThe Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.\n\nRoman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).\n\nThe Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for \"what they bore on their arms\", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was buried on or thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].\n\nThe Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.\n\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld]]]]\n\nAt this point in the story, however, the Sabine women intervened:\n\n{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, \"that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children. If you are dissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn your resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and of bloodshed to our husbands and parents. It were better that we perish than live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you.\"<ref>Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a13 1.13]</ref>}}\n\nThe battle came to an end, and the Sabines agreed to unite in one nation with the Romans. Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.\n\nThe new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]</ref>\n\n== Historical Analysis ==\nThe motivation behind the abduction of the Sabine women is contested among ancient sources. Livy writes that Rome's motivation for abducting the Sabine women was solely to increase the cities population and claims that no direct sexual assault took place during the abduction. Livy says that Romulus offered the Sabine women free choice as well as civic and property rights. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring \"that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and \u2014dearest of all to human nature-would be the mothers of freemen.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=1|title=Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 1, chapter pr|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> Scholars like [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] argue that it was an attempt to secure an alliance with the Sabine's through the women's newly founded relationships with Roman men.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Robert|date=1995|title=Livy's Sabine Women and the Ideal of Concordia|url=|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association|volume=125|pages=291\u2013319|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Livy's account is reinforced in some ways through the works of [[Cicero]]. In Cicero's work De re publica, he reiterates Livy's view that the plan to abduct the Sabine women at the festival was done in order \"to strengthen the new state\" and \"safeguard the resources of his kingdom and people.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike Livy, Cicero, and Dionysius, [[Ovid]] looks at the abduction of the Sabine as an avenue for the men of Rome to fulfill their sexual desires rather than an attempt at taking wives to produce children for the city.<ref name=\":1\" /> While he does make note of the issue surrounding Rome's lack of women, he does not make it out to be a factor in the planning of the abduction.\n\n==Artistic representations==\nMany treatments of the legend combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.\n\nThe subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].\n\n=== Edgar Degas ===\n[[Edgar Degas]] painted ''The Rape of the Sabines''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edgar-degas.org/The-Rape-of-the-Sabines.html|title=The Rape of the Sabines \u2013 Edgar Degas \u2013 www.edgar-degas.org|website=www.edgar-degas.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref> (after [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]]), c. 1861\u20131862.\n\n\"The masters must be copied over and over again\", Degas said, \"and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature.\" Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen.

Semler, ''The English Mannerist Poets and the Visual Arts'' 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3759-3}}, page 34.</ref> Originally intended as nothing more than a demonstration of the artist's ability to create a complex sculptural group, its subject matter, the legendary rape of the Sabines, had to be invented after [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], decreed that it be put on public display in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Piazza della Signoria]], Florence.\n\nThe proposed site for the sculpture, opposite [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s statue of [[Perseus]], prompted suggestions that the group should illustrate a theme related to the former work, such as the rape of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] by [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.\n\nThe work is signed <small>OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII</small> (\"The work of Johannes of Boulogne of [[Flanders]], 1582\"). An early preparatory [[bronze]] featuring only two figures is in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]]. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The artist's full-scale [[gesso]] for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]].\n\nThe woman and the kneeling man reference figures from the ancient sculpture ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/673 673] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/673 }}</ref>\n\nBronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Nicolas Poussin - L'Enl\u00e8vement des Sabines (1634-5).jpg|thumb|''The Abduction of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], (1634\u20131635) ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n[[File:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'', by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637\u201338 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]\n\n===Nicolas Poussin===\n[[Nicolas Poussin]] produced two major versions of this subject.

Israel then achieved victories in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]], with wins for [[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]], with the song \"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\", and [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]], with \"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\". In {{escyr|1980}}, the IBA declined to host the contest for the second successive year for financial reasons, and as the date for the contest in [[The Hague]] conflicted with [[Yom Hazikaron]] \u2013 Israeli Memorial Day \u2013 Israel did not participate. This is the only time that the winning country did not compete the following year. The country's best results in the 1980s were the second-place finishes for [[Avi Toledano]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] and [[Ofra Haza]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Former winner Izhar Cohen returned to place fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], before [[Duo Datz]] finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]. Israel achieved its third victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], with [[Dana International]] and \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]\". [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] then finished fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]. As of 2019, Israel has the record for most participations and most wins in the contest without ever coming last, but it has placed second to last in the final three times, in {{escyr|1986}}, {{escyr|1993}} and {{escyr|2006}}.\n\nSince the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Israel has failed to reach the final six times. In {{escyr|2005}}, [[Shiri Maimon]] gave the country its tenth top five result, finishing fourth. Having failed to qualify for the final for four consecutive years (2011\u201314), Israel reached the final for the first time in five years, with [[Nadav Guedj]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2015}}, and the country has participated in the final every year since. Israel's fourth victory came when [[Netta Barzilai|Netta]] won the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]], with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Victories===\nTo date there have been four Israeli victories in the contest. [[Izhar Cohen]] and [[Alphabeta]] won in Paris in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with the uptempo ''[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]''. On home ground in [[Jerusalem]] the following year, Israel won again, this time with the anthemic ''[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]'' performed by [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]. Unusually, Israel did not defend the title in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]] (''see below''). The third victory came almost 20 years later in [[Birmingham]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. Singer [[Dana International]] took top honours with the song ''[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]'', setting off widespread celebrations in Israel. Twenty years later, Israel earned their fourth victory at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018 contest]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. The song was \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\" by [[Netta Barzilai]], which earned Israel their highest-ever score of 529 points.\n\n===Other performances===\nIsrael's earliest selections were picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. The first singer to represent the country in 1973 was [[Ilanit]], who finished 4th. Criticism increased after she was sent again four years later, leading to a rule that the winner of the already established Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival would also represent Israel at the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest winners of 1978 and 1979 were selected by this method. From 1981 the selection process was handled by the [[Kdam Eurovision]] with the exceptions of 1990, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002\u20132004, 2006\u20132007 and 2010 where the selections were again picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]].\n\nAfter winning the contest in 1978 and 1979, the IBA was financially and logistically unable to organise the event for the second consecutive year. The organization of the festival was subsequently handed over to the Netherlands who finally agreed to stage it. Because much time had already passed, it was difficult to find a suitable date for the Song Contest. The date chosen coincided with a [[Yom Hazikaron|memorial day]] in Israel, and the country was forced to withdraw. This made Israel the only country to date unable to defend its title. The 1980 Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival therefore did not double as a national final that year unlike the last two years, and the winning song \"Pizmon Chozer\" by the band [[The Brothers & the Sisters]] was never given the chance to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984 Israel once again refrained from participating due to the same date conflict.\n\nApart from its victories, Israel's entries have had a mixed reception at the contest. [[Avi Toledano]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]]) and [[Ofra Haza]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]) scored well with big revivalist numbers, but the all-singing, all-dancing style became less popular later in the decade and Israel's 1986 entry, [[Yavo Yom]] by Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel, came in 19th, the country's worst showing yet.\n\nIn 1987 Israel finished 8th with [[Shir Habatlanim]] by the satiric duo Lazy Bums. Due to its satiric nature, it prompted then Israeli Minister of Culture, [[Yitzhak Navon]], to threaten to resign, if the song went on to represent Israel on the night of the contest. However, he didn't.\n\nIn 1990 [[Rita Kleinstein|Rita's]] sensuous [[ballad]] was not well received, but in 1991, Orna and Moshe Datz finished third, Israel's best result since 1983. Israel's third victory occurred in 1998, when [[Dana International]] won the crown with her song \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]].\" Israel also had a 5th-place finish by [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] when it hosted the 1999 contest. However, [[PingPong (band)|Ping-Pong]]'s [[disco]] effort in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] failed badly, though the group was noted for their largely optimistic lyrics and message of reconciliation and peace in Western Asia. They went as far as waving [[Syria]]n flags at the end of their performance, angering some Israelis.\n\nIn 2004 [[David D'Or]] came in 11th in the semifinal with the song \"[[Leha'amin]]\" (\u05dc\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05df), leaving Israel out of the finals for the first time since 1997. [[Shiri Maymon]]'s performance in Kiev in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] brought Israel back to the top five, and ensured a place in the Athens [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 final]]. In 2006, Israel was represented by singer [[Eddie Butler (singer)|Eddie Butler]], who had finished 5th as part of Eden in 1999; however, his performance of the song \"Together We Are One\" finished 23rd, with just four points.\n\n[[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]'s Eurovision committee chose the band [[Teapacks]] to represent Israel in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final in Helsinki.  Their humorous entry \"Push the Button\" did not fare well, finishing in 24th place out of a semifinal field of 28 and failing to reach the final. Israel had to compete in the semi-final in Belgrade 2008, from which it passed on to the final; [[Boaz Mauda|Boaz]] finished ninth. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], an Arab citizen of Israel represented the country for the first time, as [[Mira Awad]] performed along with Jewish-Israeli singer [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] in Moscow. Israel was represented in 2010 by [[Harel Skaat]], who came in 14th in the final.\n\nIsrael's participations from 2011 to 2014 were less successful, as former Eurovision winner [[Dana International]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the band [[Izabo]] in [[Baku]], [[Moran Mazor]] in [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Mei Finegold]] in [[Copenhagen]], all failed to qualify for the final. However, 16-year-old [[Nadav Guedj]] qualified with Golden Boy in 2015, the first Israeli song without a [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] lyric. Prior to their fourth win, they also managed to qualify in 2016 with [[Hovi Star]] and \"[[Made of Stars]]\" (which finished 14th) and in 2017 with [[Imri Ziv]] and \"[[I Feel Alive]]\" (which finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2006). In 2019 as host country Israel was pre-qualified for the final, however, they eventually finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2017), making it the fourth time since 2015 that the host country ranked in the bottom five.\n\nIn early 2020, it was confirmed that the 2020 season of ''HaKokhav HaBa'' would be the last time it would be used to select the Israeli entrant, with a separate national final to select the winning artist's Eurovision entry. Beginning in 2021, a new national final hosted by [[Lucy Ayoub]] is planned to select the Israeli entry.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FC3\"|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CCC\"|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#C96\"|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n<!--|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FE8080\"|\u25c1\n|Last place-->\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#A4EAA9\"|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete \n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1973}}\n|[[Ilanit]]\n|[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]\n|\"[[Ey Sham]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|4 \n|align=center|97\n|rowspan=\"7\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1974}}\n|[[Kaveret]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Natati La Khayay]]\" {{small|(\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|11 \n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1975}}\n|[[Shlomo Artzi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[At Va'Ani]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|40\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1976}}\n|[[Chocolate, Menta, Mastik]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Emor Shalom]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|77\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1977}}\n|Ilanit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ahava Hi Shir Lishnayim]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|11 \n|align=center|49\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1978}}\n|[[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\" {{small|(\u05d0-\u05d1-\u05e0\u05d9-\u05d1\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|1 \n|align=center|157\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1979}}\n|[[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|125\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1980}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1981}}\n|[[Hakol Over Habibi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Halayla]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|56\n|rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1982}}\n|[[Avi Toledano]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hora (song)|Hora]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|100\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1983}}\n|[[Ofra Haza]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hi (Ofra Haza song)|Hi]]\" {{small|(\u05d7\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|2 \n|align=center|136\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1984}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1985}}\n|Izhar Cohen\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9 (song)|Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9]]\" {{small|(\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|5 \n|align=center|93\n|rowspan=\"8\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1986}}\n|Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Yavo Yom]]\" {{small|(\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|19 \n|align=center|7\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1987}}\n|Lazy Bums\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shir Habatlanim]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd)}}\t\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|73\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1988}}\n|[[Yardena Arazi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ben Adam]]\" {{small|(\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1989}}\n|Gili & Galit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Derekh Hamelekh]]\" {{small|(\u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da)}}\n|align=center|12 \n|align=center|50\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1990}}\n|[[Rita Kleinstein|Rita]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shara Barkhovot]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea)}}\n|align=center|18 \n|align=center|16\n|-style=\"background:#c96;\"\n!{{Escyr|1991}}\n|[[Duo Datz]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Kan (song)|Kan]]\" {{small|(\u05db\u05d0\u05df)}}\n|align=center|3 \n|align=center|139\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1992}}\n|[[Dafna Dekel]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ze Rak Sport]]\" {{small|(\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e8\u05e7 \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8)}}\t\n|align=center|6 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1993}}\n|Sarah'le Sharon & [[The Shiru Group]]\n|Hebrew, [[English language|English]]\n|\"[[Shiru]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5)}}\n|align=center|24 \n|align=center|4\n|colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1994}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1995}}\n|Liora\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Amen (Liora song)|Amen]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05df)}}\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|81\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1996}}}}{{Efn|Israel failed to qualify for the 1996 contest.

When it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that Israel was going to win the contest, JRTV abruptly ended the transmission.<ref name=\"50yrs\">{{cite book|last = O'Connor|first = John Kennedy|year = 2005|title = The Eurovision Song Contest 50 Years The Official History|publisher=Carlton Books Limited|location = London|isbn = 1-84442-586-X}}</ref> Afterwards, the Jordanian news media refused to acknowledge the fact that Israel had won, and announced that the winner was Belgium (which had actually come in second).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=esctoday.com|year=2005|url=http://www.esctoday.com/annual/1978/participants.php|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1978|accessdate=8 May 2007}}</ref> By coincidence, Israel did not broadcast the victory either, as the IBA did not buy enough broadcasting time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The victory was broadcast the next day.\n\nAt the time, Israeli Television was in its infancy and broadcasting in black & white. Many/most Israelis therefore watched international events in colour, using the signal from neighbouring Jordan. As Jordan did not broadcast the Israeli entry and the IBA did not broadcast the results part of the event, the win only became known as a result of radio broadcasts.\n\nBecause of Israel's participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], many [[Arab]] states that are eligible to participate do not do so. [[Tunisia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Tunisia]], [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]], and [[Lebanon in the Eurovision Song Contest|Lebanon]] are cases in point.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for Morocco and Tunisia not participating due to Israel|date=October 2013}} Tunisia was about to participate in 1977, but decided not to do so in the end; Lebanon was just about to participate in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] when it withdrew (incurring a fine by the EBU) because Lebanese law does not allow recognition of Israel, and consequently Lebanese television would not transmit any Israeli material \u2013 which would have been a violation of the EBU's rules.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]|date=18 March 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4362373.stm|title=Lebanon withdraws from Eurovision|accessdate=15 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Music of Israel]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Israel in Eurovision}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits}}\n\n[[Category:Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest| ]]\n[[Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox song contest country\n| Name = Israel\n| Member station = [[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation|Kan]]\n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''Former members''' \n | '''1973\u20132017:''' [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]\n}}\n| National selection event = \n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''Internal selection'''\n | 1973\u20131977\n | 1988 (artist)\n | 1990\n | 1998\u20132000\n | 2002\u20132004\n | 2007\n | 2012\n | 2015 (song)\n | 2017\u20132019 (song)\n | 2021\n}}\n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''National final'''\n | '''Israel Song Festival'''\n | 1978\u20131979\n | '''[[Kdam Eurovision]]'''\n | 1981\u20131983\n | 1985\u20131987\n | 1988 (song)\n | 1989\n | 1991\u20131993\n | 1995\u20131996\n | 2001\n | 2005\u20132006\n | 2008\u20132011\n | 2013\u20132014\n | '''[[HaKokhav HaBa]]'''\n | 2015 (artist)\n | 2016\n | 2017-2019 (artist)\n}}\n| ESC apps = 42 (36 finals)\n| ESC first = {{Escyr|1973}}\n| ESC best = 1st: {{Escyr|1978}}, {{Escyr|1979}}, {{Escyr|1998}}, {{Escyr|2018}}\n| ESC worst = 24th {{small|SF}}: {{Escyr|2007}}\n| Website = [https://www.kan.org.il/page.aspx?landingpageId=7 Kan page]\n| EBU page = https://eurovision.tv/country/israel\n| Current = 2019\n}}\n\n'''[[Israel]]''' has participated in the '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' 42 times since making its debut in {{Escyr|1973}}. Israel was able to enter the contest as the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) was an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), which is responsible for the event. Israel has won the contest four times, and has hosted the contest in [[Jerusalem]] twice in {{escyr|1979}} and {{escyr|1999}}. Israel hosted the contest for the third time in [[Tel Aviv]] in {{Escyr|2019}}.\n\nIsrael's first appearance at the contest in 1973 was successful, with [[Ilanit]] finishing fourth. Israel then achieved victories in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]], with wins for [[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]], with the song \"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\", and [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]], with \"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\". In {{escyr|1980}}, the IBA declined to host the contest for the second successive year for financial reasons, and as the date for the contest in [[The Hague]] conflicted with [[Yom Hazikaron]] \u2013 Israeli Memorial Day \u2013 Israel did not participate. This is the only time that the winning country did not compete the following year. The country's best results in the 1980s were the second-place finishes for [[Avi Toledano]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] and [[Ofra Haza]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Former winner Izhar Cohen returned to place fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], before [[Duo Datz]] finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]. Israel achieved its third victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], with [[Dana International]] and \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]\". [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] then finished fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]. As of 2019, Israel has the record for most participations and most wins in the contest without ever coming last, but it has placed second to last in the final three times, in {{escyr|1986}}, {{escyr|1993}} and {{escyr|2006}}.\n\nSince the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Israel has failed to reach the final six times. In {{escyr|2005}}, [[Shiri Maimon]] gave the country its tenth top five result, finishing fourth. Having failed to qualify for the final for four consecutive years (2011\u201314), Israel reached the final for the first time in five years, with [[Nadav Guedj]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2015}}, and the country has participated in the final every year since. Israel's fourth victory came when [[Netta Barzilai|Netta]] won the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]], with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Victories===\nTo date there have been four Israeli victories in the contest. [[Izhar Cohen]] and [[Alphabeta]] won in Paris in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with the uptempo ''[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]''. On home ground in [[Jerusalem]] the following year, Israel won again, this time with the anthemic ''[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]'' performed by [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]. Unusually, Israel did not defend the title in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]] (''see below''). The third victory came almost 20 years later in [[Birmingham]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. Singer [[Dana International]] took top honours with the song ''[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]'', setting off widespread celebrations in Israel. Twenty years later, Israel earned their fourth victory at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018 contest]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. The song was \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\" by [[Netta Barzilai]], which earned Israel their highest-ever score of 529 points.\n\n===Other performances===\nIsrael's earliest selections were picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. The first singer to represent the country in 1973 was [[Ilanit]], who finished 4th. Criticism increased after she was sent again four years later, leading to a rule that the winner of the already established Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival would also represent Israel at the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest winners of 1978 and 1979 were selected by this method. From 1981 the selection process was handled by the [[Kdam Eurovision]] with the exceptions of 1990, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002\u20132004, 2006\u20132007 and 2010 where the selections were again picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]].\n\nAfter winning the contest in 1978 and 1979, the IBA was financially and logistically unable to organise the event for the second consecutive year. The organization of the festival was subsequently handed over to the Netherlands who finally agreed to stage it. Because much time had already passed, it was difficult to find a suitable date for the Song Contest. The date chosen coincided with a [[Yom Hazikaron|memorial day]] in Israel, and the country was forced to withdraw. This made Israel the only country to date unable to defend its title. The 1980 Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival therefore did not double as a national final that year unlike the last two years, and the winning song \"Pizmon Chozer\" by the band [[The Brothers & the Sisters]] was never given the chance to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984 Israel once again refrained from participating due to the same date conflict.\n\nApart from its victories, Israel's entries have had a mixed reception at the contest. [[Avi Toledano]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]]) and [[Ofra Haza]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]) scored well with big revivalist numbers, but the all-singing, all-dancing style became less popular later in the decade and Israel's 1986 entry, [[Yavo Yom]] by Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel, came in 19th, the country's worst showing yet.\n\nIn 1987 Israel finished 8th with [[Shir Habatlanim]] by the satiric duo Lazy Bums. Due to its satiric nature, it prompted then Israeli Minister of Culture, [[Yitzhak Navon]], to threaten to resign, if the song went on to represent Israel on the night of the contest. However, he didn't.\n\nIn 1990 [[Rita Kleinstein|Rita's]] sensuous [[ballad]] was not well received, but in 1991, Orna and Moshe Datz finished third, Israel's best result since 1983. Israel's third victory occurred in 1998, when [[Dana International]] won the crown with her song \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]].\" Israel also had a 5th-place finish by [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] when it hosted the 1999 contest. However, [[PingPong (band)|Ping-Pong]]'s [[disco]] effort in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] failed badly, though the group was noted for their largely optimistic lyrics and message of reconciliation and peace in Western Asia. They went as far as waving [[Syria]]n flags at the end of their performance, angering some Israelis.\n\nIn 2004 [[David D'Or]] came in 11th in the semifinal with the song \"[[Leha'amin]]\" (\u05dc\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05df), leaving Israel out of the finals for the first time since 1997. [[Shiri Maymon]]'s performance in Kiev in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] brought Israel back to the top five, and ensured a place in the Athens [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 final]]. In 2006, Israel was represented by singer [[Eddie Butler (singer)|Eddie Butler]], who had finished 5th as part of Eden in 1999; however, his performance of the song \"Together We Are One\" finished 23rd, with just four points.\n\n[[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]'s Eurovision committee chose the band [[Teapacks]] to represent Israel in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final in Helsinki.  Their humorous entry \"Push the Button\" did not fare well, finishing in 24th place out of a semifinal field of 28 and failing to reach the final. Israel had to compete in the semi-final in Belgrade 2008, from which it passed on to the final; [[Boaz Mauda|Boaz]] finished ninth. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], an Arab citizen of Israel represented the country for the first time, as [[Mira Awad]] performed along with Jewish-Israeli singer [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] in Moscow. Israel was represented in 2010 by [[Harel Skaat]], who came in 14th in the final.\n\nIsrael's participations from 2011 to 2014 were less successful, as former Eurovision winner [[Dana International]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the band [[Izabo]] in [[Baku]], [[Moran Mazor]] in [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Mei Finegold]] in [[Copenhagen]], all failed to qualify for the final. However, 16-year-old [[Nadav Guedj]] qualified with Golden Boy in 2015, the first Israeli song without a [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] lyric. Prior to their fourth win, they also managed to qualify in 2016 with [[Hovi Star]] and \"[[Made of Stars]]\" (which finished 14th) and in 2017 with [[Imri Ziv]] and \"[[I Feel Alive]]\" (which finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2006). In 2019 as host country Israel was pre-qualified for the final, however, they eventually finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2017), making it the fourth time since 2015 that the host country ranked in the bottom five.\n\nIn early 2020, it was confirmed that the 2020 season of ''HaKokhav HaBa'' would be the last time it would be used to select the Israeli entrant, with a separate national final to select the winning artist's Eurovision entry. Beginning in 2021, a new national final hosted by [[Lucy Ayoub]] is planned to select the Israeli entry.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FC3\"|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CCC\"|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#C96\"|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n<!--|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FE8080\"|\u25c1\n|Last place-->\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#A4EAA9\"|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete \n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1973}}\n|[[Ilanit]]\n|[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]\n|\"[[Ey Sham]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|4 \n|align=center|97\n|rowspan=\"7\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1974}}\n|[[Kaveret]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Natati La Khayay]]\" {{small|(\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|11 \n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1975}}\n|[[Shlomo Artzi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[At Va'Ani]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|40\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1976}}\n|[[Chocolate, Menta, Mastik]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Emor Shalom]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|77\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1977}}\n|Ilanit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ahava Hi Shir Lishnayim]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|11 \n|align=center|49\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1978}}\n|[[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\" {{small|(\u05d0-\u05d1-\u05e0\u05d9-\u05d1\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|1 \n|align=center|157\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1979}}\n|[[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|125\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1980}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1981}}\n|[[Hakol Over Habibi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Halayla]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|56\n|rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1982}}\n|[[Avi Toledano]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hora (song)|Hora]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|100\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1983}}\n|[[Ofra Haza]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hi (Ofra Haza song)|Hi]]\" {{small|(\u05d7\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|2 \n|align=center|136\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1984}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1985}}\n|Izhar Cohen\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9 (song)|Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9]]\" {{small|(\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|5 \n|align=center|93\n|rowspan=\"8\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1986}}\n|Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Yavo Yom]]\" {{small|(\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|19 \n|align=center|7\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1987}}\n|Lazy Bums\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shir Habatlanim]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd)}}\t\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|73\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1988}}\n|[[Yardena Arazi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ben Adam]]\" {{small|(\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1989}}\n|Gili & Galit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Derekh Hamelekh]]\" {{small|(\u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da)}}\n|align=center|12 \n|align=center|50\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1990}}\n|[[Rita Kleinstein|Rita]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shara Barkhovot]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea)}}\n|align=center|18 \n|align=center|16\n|-style=\"background:#c96;\"\n!{{Escyr|1991}}\n|[[Duo Datz]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Kan (song)|Kan]]\" {{small|(\u05db\u05d0\u05df)}}\n|align=center|3 \n|align=center|139\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1992}}\n|[[Dafna Dekel]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ze Rak Sport]]\" {{small|(\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e8\u05e7 \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8)}}\t\n|align=center|6 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1993}}\n|Sarah'le Sharon & [[The Shiru Group]]\n|Hebrew, [[English language|English]]\n|\"[[Shiru]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5)}}\n|align=center|24 \n|align=center|4\n|colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1994}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1995}}\n|Liora\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Amen (Liora song)|Amen]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05df)}}\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|81\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1996}}}}{{Efn|Israel failed to qualify for the 1996 contest.

A rheumatologist holds a board certification after specialized training after attaining a medical degree through fellowship programs in the United States, or specialist registrar positions in the United Kingdom, or DM in India or equivalent programs elsewhere in the world.  In the United States, training in this field requires four years undergraduate school, four years of medical school, and then three years of residency, followed by two or three years additional Fellowship training. The requirements may vary in other countries. Rheumatologists are [[internist]]s who are qualified by additional postgraduate training and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis and other diseases of the joints, muscles and bones. Many Rheumatologists also conduct research to determine the cause and better treatments for these disabling and sometimes fatal diseases. Treatment modalities are based on scientific research, currently, practice of rheumatology is largely evidence based.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/What_is_a_Rheumatologist_/|title=What is a Rheumatologist?|website=www.rheumatology.org}}</ref>\n\nRheumatologists treat [[arthritis]], [[autoimmune]] diseases, pain disorders affecting joints, and [[osteoporosis]]. There are more than 200 types of these diseases, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[gout]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], back pain, [[osteoporosis]], and [[tendinitis]]. Some of these are very serious diseases that can be difficult to diagnose and treat.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often need a long term, coordinated and a multidisciplinary team approach towards management of individual patients. Treatment is often tailored according to the individual needs of each patient which is also dependent on the response and the tolerability of medications. \n\n===Rheumasurgery===\n''Rheumasurgery'' - sometimes called rheumatoid surgery - is a subfield of [[orthopedics]] occupied with the surgical treatment of patients with [[rheumatic diseases]].<ref>[http://tidsskriftet.no/article/1115480/ \"Norsk forening for revmakirurgi - Med hovedbase p\u00e5 Diakonhjemmet\"] LB Johannessen  Tidsskr Nor L\u00e6geforen 2004; 124:3110 Nr. 23 \u2013 2.

The one is early [[Synovectomy|synovectomies]], that is the removal of the inflamed [[synovia]] in order to prevent spreading and stop destruction. The other group is the so-called corrective intervention, i.e. an intervention done after destruction has taken place.<ref>Den sykehusmessige revmatikeromsorgen i Norge (K\u00e5ss and Stene 1970), page 24.</ref> Among the corrective interventions are joint replacements, removal of loose bone or cartilage fragments, and a variety of interventions aimed at repositioning and/or stabilizing joints,<ref>[http://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Patients/Programs-and-Services/Rheumatology/Treatments/Surgery-for-Rheumatic-Diseases.aspx \"Surgery for Rheumatic Diseases\"] Cedars Sinai (http://www.cedars-sinai.edu)</ref> such as [[arthrodesis]].\n\n== Research directions ==\nRecently, a large body of scientific research deals with the background of [[autoimmune disease]], the cause of many rheumatic disorders. Also, the field of [[osteoimmunology]] has emerged to further examine the interactions between the immune system, joints and bones.

[[Physician]]s who have undergone formal training in rheumatology are called '''rheumatologists'''. Rheumatologists deal mainly with immune-mediated disorders of the [[musculoskeletal system]], [[soft tissue]]s, [[autoimmune diseases]], [[vasculitis|vasculitides]], and heritable connective tissue disorders.\n\nMany of these diseases are now known to be disorders of the [[immune system]]. Rheumatology is considered to be the study and practice of [[immunology|medical immunology]].\n\nBeginning in the 2000s, the incorporation of drugs called the [[biologics]] (which include inhibitors of [[TNF-alpha]], certain [[interleukins]], and the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]]) into standards of care is one of the paramount developments in modern rheumatology.<ref>Katherine S.

A rheumatologist holds a board certification after specialized training after attaining a medical degree through fellowship programs in the United States, or specialist registrar positions in the United Kingdom, or DM in India or equivalent programs elsewhere in the world.  In the United States, training in this field requires four years undergraduate school, four years of medical school, and then three years of residency, followed by two or three years additional Fellowship training. The requirements may vary in other countries. Rheumatologists are [[internist]]s who are qualified by additional postgraduate training and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis and other diseases of the joints, muscles and bones. Many Rheumatologists also conduct research to determine the cause and better treatments for these disabling and sometimes fatal diseases. Treatment modalities are based on scientific research, currently, practice of rheumatology is largely evidence based.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/What_is_a_Rheumatologist_/|title=What is a Rheumatologist?|website=www.rheumatology.org}}</ref>\n\nRheumatologists treat [[arthritis]], [[autoimmune]] diseases, pain disorders affecting joints, and [[osteoporosis]]. There are more than 200 types of these diseases, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[gout]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], back pain, [[osteoporosis]], and [[tendinitis]]. Some of these are very serious diseases that can be difficult to diagnose and treat.

[[Occupational therapy]] can help patients find alternative ways for common movements which would otherwise be restricted by their disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often need a long term, coordinated and a multidisciplinary team approach towards management of individual patients. Treatment is often tailored according to the individual needs of each patient which is also dependent on the response and the tolerability of medications. \n\n===Rheumasurgery===\n''Rheumasurgery'' - sometimes called rheumatoid surgery - is a subfield of [[orthopedics]] occupied with the surgical treatment of patients with [[rheumatic diseases]].<ref>[http://tidsskriftet.no/article/1115480/ \"Norsk forening for revmakirurgi - Med hovedbase p\u00e5 Diakonhjemmet\"] LB Johannessen  Tidsskr Nor L\u00e6geforen 2004; 124:3110 Nr. 23 \u2013 2.

The one is early [[Synovectomy|synovectomies]], that is the removal of the inflamed [[synovia]] in order to prevent spreading and stop destruction. The other group is the so-called corrective intervention, i.e. an intervention done after destruction has taken place.<ref>Den sykehusmessige revmatikeromsorgen i Norge (K\u00e5ss and Stene 1970), page 24.</ref> Among the corrective interventions are joint replacements, removal of loose bone or cartilage fragments, and a variety of interventions aimed at repositioning and/or stabilizing joints,<ref>[http://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Patients/Programs-and-Services/Rheumatology/Treatments/Surgery-for-Rheumatic-Diseases.aspx \"Surgery for Rheumatic Diseases\"] Cedars Sinai (http://www.cedars-sinai.edu)</ref> such as [[arthrodesis]].\n\n== Research directions ==\nRecently, a large body of scientific research deals with the background of [[autoimmune disease]], the cause of many rheumatic disorders.

Several routes in the past concurrently used the Orient Express name, or slight variations. Although the original Orient Express was simply a normal international railway service, the name became synonymous with intrigue and [[luxury trains|luxury travel]].

Its most famous train remains the Orient-Express.\n\nThe train was composed of:\n* Baggage car\n* Sleeping coach with 16 beds (with [[bogie]]s)\n* Sleeping coach with 14 beds (3 axles)\n* Restaurant coach (nr. 107)\n* Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles)\n* Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles)\n* Baggage car (complete 101 ton)\nThe first menu on board (October 10, 1882): oysters, soup with Italian pasta, [[turbot]] with green sauce, chicken \u2018\u00e0 la chasseur\u2019, fillet of beef with \u2018ch\u00e2teau\u2019 potatoes, \u2018chaud-froid\u2019 of game animals, lettuce, chocolate pudding, buffet of desserts.<ref name=\"Inke\">{{cite web | url = http://www.travelthruhistory.com/html/exotic47.html | title = Memories of the Orient Express | accessdate = 2013-03-13 | last = Piegsa-quischotte | first = Inke | work = Travel Through History}}</ref>\n[[File:L'Orient Express vers 1930 (c) wagons-lits diffusion.jpg|thumb|centre|Orient Express cars, 1930|750x750px]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Routes ==\n{{wide image|Orient-Express Historic Routes (en).svg|800px|Historic routes of Orient Express \u2014 the cross denotes the Simplon tunnel}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Original train==\n[[File:Orientexpress1883.JPG|thumb|300px|The first Orient Express in 1883]]\nOn June 5, 1883, the first ''Express d'Orient'' left [[Paris]] for [[Vienna]]. Vienna remained the terminus until October 4, 1883.

At Giurgiu, passengers were ferried across the [[Danube]] to [[Ruse, Bulgaria]], to pick up another train to [[Varna]]. They then completed their journey to [[Constantinople]]<!--Using the name Constantinople instead of Istanbul--> by [[ferry]]. In 1885, another route began operations, this time reaching Constantinople<!--Still known as such from 1885--> via rail from Vienna to [[Belgrade]] and [[Ni\u0161]], carriage to [[Plovdiv]], and rail again to \u0130stanbul.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:WL ORIENT EXPRESS.jpg|thumb|WL Orient Express]]\nIn 1889, the train's eastern terminus became [[Varna]] in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], where passengers could take a ship to Constantinople. On June 1, 1889, the first direct train to Constantinople left Paris (Gare de l'Est). Istanbul, known as Constantinople until circa 1930 in English,<!--See [[:en:Names of Istanbul]]--> remained its easternmost stop until 19 May 1977. The eastern terminus was the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] by the [[Golden Horn]]. Ferry service from piers next to the terminal would take passengers across the [[Bosphorus]] to [[Istanbul Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal|Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]], the terminus of the Asian lines of the [[Chemins de Fer Ottomans d'Anatolie|Ottoman Railways]].<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nThe onset of the [[First World War]] in 1914 saw Orient Express services suspended. They resumed at the end of hostilities in 1918, and in 1919 the opening of the [[Simplon Tunnel]] allowed the introduction of a more southerly route via [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Trieste]]. The service on this route was known as the Simplon Orient Express, and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] contained a clause requiring [[Austria]] to accept this train: formerly, Austria allowed international services to pass through Austrian territory (which included Trieste at the time) only if they ran via Vienna. The Simplon Orient Express soon became the most important rail route between Paris and \u0130stanbul.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:Orient Express Buchs.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Badge of the ''Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits'' on a car of the Orient Express]]\nThe 1930s saw the Orient Express services at its most popular, with three parallel services running: the Orient Express, the Simplon Orient Express, and also the [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express, which ran via [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Innsbruck]] to Budapest, with sleeper cars running onwards from there to Bucharest and [[Athens]]. During this time, the Orient Express acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury, carrying sleeping-cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their [[cuisine]]. [[Royal family|Royalty]], [[nobility|nobles]], [[diplomacy|diplomats]], [[businessperson|business people]], and the [[bourgeoisie]] in general patronized it. Each of the Orient Express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from [[Calais]] to Paris, thus extending the service from one end of continental Europe to the other.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:WL GOLDEN ARROW.jpg|thumb|WL Golden Arrow]]\nThe start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 again interrupted the service, which did not resume until 1945. During the war, the German [[Mitropa]] company had run some services on the route through the [[Balkans]],<ref name=\"EngRail\">{{cite web | url = http://www.engrailhistory.info/r045.html | title = The Orient Express \u2013 Across Europe from London to Istanbul | accessdate = 2013-03-13 | work = Eng Rail History | publisher = engrailhistory.info}}</ref> but [[Yugoslav Partisans]] frequently sabotaged the track, forcing a stop to this service.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the war, normal services resumed except on the Athens leg, where the closure of the border between [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] prevented services from running. That border re-opened in 1951, but the closure of the [[Bulgaria]]n\u2013[[Turkey|Turkish]] border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to \u0130stanbul during that time. As the [[Iron Curtain]] fell across Europe, the service continued to run, but [[Warsaw Pact|the Communist nations]] increasingly replaced the ''[[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Wagon-Lits]]'' cars with carriages run by their own railway services.\n\n[[File:\u00c9tiquette \u00e0 bagage, (c)wagons-lits diffusion, paris.jpg|thumb|Luggage tag]]\n\nBy 1962, the Orient Express and [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express had stopped running, leaving only the Simplon Orient Express. This was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the Direct Orient Express, which ran daily cars from Paris to Belgrade, and twice weekly services from Paris to \u0130stanbul and Athens.\n\nIn 1971, the ''Wagon-Lits'' company stopped running carriages itself and making revenues from a ticket supplement. Instead, it sold or leased all its carriages to the various national railway companies, but continued to provide staff for the carriages. 1976 saw the withdrawal of the Paris\u2013Athens direct service, and in 1977, the Direct Orient Express was withdrawn completely, with the last Paris\u2013\u0130stanbul service running on May 19 of that year.<ref name=\"Independent\"/><ref name=\"Christie\"/>\n\nThe withdrawal of the Direct Orient Express was thought by many to signal the end of the Orient Express as a whole, but in fact a service under this name continued to run from Paris to [[Bucharest]] as before (via Strasbourg, Munich, and Budapest). However, a through sleeping car from Paris to Bucharest \u2014 and even eastwards from Vienna \u2014 was only operated until 1982, and also a through seating car was only operated seasonally. This meant, that Paris\u2013Budapest and Vienna\u2013Bucharest coaches were running overlapped, so a journey was only possible with changing carriages \u2014 despite the unchanged name and numbering of the train. In 1991 the Budapest-Bucharest leg of the train was canceled, the new final station has become Budapest. In the summer season of 1999 and 2000 a sleeping car from Bucharest to Paris reappeared twice a week \u2014 now operated by [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]]. This continued until 2001, when the service was cut back to just Paris\u2013[[Vienna]], already in [[EuroNight]] quality \u2014 but in both cases the coaches were in fact rather attached to a Paris\u2013[[Strasbourg]] express. This service continued daily, listed in the timetables under the name ''Orient Express'', until June 8, 2007.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nWith the opening of the [[LGV Est]] Paris\u2013Strasbourg high speed rail line on June 10, 2007, the ''Orient Express'' service was further cut back to Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, departing nightly at 22:20 from Strasbourg, and still bearing the name,<ref name=\"Christie\" /><ref name=\"Seat61\" /> but lost the number 262/263 which was owned for decades. \nThe remains of the train had a convenient connection from/to the Strasbourg-Paris [[TGV]], but due to the less flexible prices the changing has become less attractive. In the last years through coaches between Vienna and [[Karlsruhe]] (continuing first to [[Dortmund]], then to [[Amsterdam]], and finally \u2014 partly from Budapest \u2014 to [[Frankfurt]]) were attached. The very last train with the name Orient-Express (now with a hyphen) departed from Vienna on the 10th of December 2009, and one day later from Strasbourg.[[File:Sirkeci-station Orient Express.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] in [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\n== Route legacy ==\nThough the final service ran only from [[Strasbourg]] to [[Vienna]], it was possible to retrace the entire original Orient Express route with four trains: Paris\u2013Strasbourg, Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, Vienna\u2013[[Belgrade]], and Belgrade-[[\u0130stanbul]], each of which were operated daily. Other routes from Paris to \u0130stanbul exist even today, such as Paris\u2013[[Munich]]\u2013[[Budapest]]\u2013[[Bucharest]]\u2013\u0130stanbul, or Paris\u2013Z\u00fcrich\u2013Belgrade\u2013\u0130stanbul, all of which have comparable travel times of approximately 60 hours without delays. Train services across the border to [[Turkey]] were stopped through several years due to construction works, but they were reintroduced in June 2017, however, ending in \u0130stanbul's suburb [[Halkal\u0131 railway station|Halkal\u0131]], from where a transfer bus is provided to the city centre.\n\nThe luxurious dining car, where scenes for ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and other movies were filmed, is now in the OSE museum of [[Thessalonica|Thessalon\u00edka]]. The local authorities plan to refit the train to make it available for tourist use around [[the Balkans]] in the near future.\n\n== Privately run trains using the name ==\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\nIn 1976, the Swiss travel company ''Intraflug AG'' had first hired, then also bought, several CIWL-carriages, and operated them as Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express from Z\u00fcrich to [[\u0130stanbul]]. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the Orient-Express was celebrated by a trip of this train from Paris to \u0130stanbul, and in 1988 it was run to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] via the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]]. From there it was transferred by ferry to [[Japan]], and used there for some excursions after regauging.\n\nAfter the failure of the American European Express (see below), ''Intraflug'' became bankrupt, and the carriages were taken over by the Reiseb\u00fcro Mittelthurgau. The sleeping cars and some other coaches (Pullmans, dining cars, luggage vans) were transferred to [[Russia]] and used between Moscow and the Mongolian-Chinese border. (The adjacent Chinese train was also branded for a while as China Orient Express; nowadays it's known as Shangri-La Express.) The remaining vehicles were used in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] as diner trains until the company's 2003 bankruptcy. Since then the trains have been standing unused in different countries, as the new owners sort out problems with operations due to a lawsuit about the usage rights of the name Orient Express.\n\nIn 1982, the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express]] was established as a private venture, running restored 1920s and 1930s carriages from London to [[Venice]]. This service runs between March and November, and is firmly aimed at leisure travellers, with tickets costing over $3,120 per person from [[London]] to [[Venice]] (via [[Paris]], [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Innsbruck]], and [[Verona]]\u2014also, despite its name, the train is running via the [[Brenner Pass]] instead of the Simplon tunnel) including meals. Two or three times a year, [[Prague]] or [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]] are also accessed, starting from Venice, and returning to Paris and London. Every September the train also goes from London and Paris to [[\u0130stanbul]] via [[Budapest]], [[Sinaia]], and [[Bucharest]]\u2014in the last three cities a sightseeing (and in the two capitals an overnight in hotel) also takes place\u2014the return trip on the same route ends up in Venice.\nWhile the above-mentioned routes are available almost every year, some seasons have also included unique destinations, among them [[Cologne]], [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Lucerne]], the [[High Tatras]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Dresden]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Stockholm]]. Such a journey is provided currently to [[Berlin]].\n\n[[File:Orient.Express.in.Poland.02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Venice-Simplon Orient Express in [[Poland]], in 2007]]\n\nThe company also offers a similarly themed luxury train in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Thailand]] called the [[Eastern and Oriental Express]], and operates other luxury overnight trains in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Peru]].\n\nThe Pullman Orient Express was established by the CIWL in 1994. This train has only Pullman and dining cars, but no sleepers. It's used for gourmet trips in France. After the legal disputes about the name it was taken over by the [[SNCF]] and operated since then as ''Pullman Orient-Express''.\n\nIn [[North America]], the [[American Orient Express]], formerly the American European Express and later GrandLuxe Express, operated several train sets in charter service between 1989 and 2008.\n\n[[File:CIWL ORIENT EXPRESS TAURUS, (c) wagons-lits diffusion.jpg|thumb|Orient Express poster]]\n\n== CIWL phototheque and historical archives ==\nThe CIWL archives contain more than 100 years of posters, photos, plans, and communication material that represents a tremendous interest for cultural, academic, or commercial projects. Creators and artists have been hired by CIWL since 1883 in order to create luxury conditions and comfort in travel, as well as a particular graphic style that is now recognized worldwide by its quality. Great efforts have been made to digitalize images (photos, plans, and posters), although vast paper archives remain preserved, waiting to be sorted and classified in the future.\nAs of today, available digital archives consist of more than 250 CIWL posters, 800 PLM posters, and more than 6,000 archive photos, representing probably one of the most extensive poster collections in the world with works dating from the end of the 19th century to the late 1950s.

At Giurgiu, passengers were ferried across the [[Danube]] to [[Ruse, Bulgaria]], to pick up another train to [[Varna]]. They then completed their journey to [[Constantinople]]<!--Using the name Constantinople instead of Istanbul--> by [[ferry]]. In 1885, another route began operations, this time reaching Constantinople<!--Still known as such from 1885--> via rail from Vienna to [[Belgrade]] and [[Ni\u0161]], carriage to [[Plovdiv]], and rail again to \u0130stanbul.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:WL ORIENT EXPRESS.jpg|thumb|WL Orient Express]]\nIn 1889, the train's eastern terminus became [[Varna]] in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], where passengers could take a ship to Constantinople. On June 1, 1889, the first direct train to Constantinople left Paris (Gare de l'Est). Istanbul, known as Constantinople until circa 1930 in English,<!--See [[:en:Names of Istanbul]]--> remained its easternmost stop until 19 May 1977. The eastern terminus was the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] by the [[Golden Horn]]. Ferry service from piers next to the terminal would take passengers across the [[Bosphorus]] to [[Istanbul Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal|Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]], the terminus of the Asian lines of the [[Chemins de Fer Ottomans d'Anatolie|Ottoman Railways]].<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nThe onset of the [[First World War]] in 1914 saw Orient Express services suspended. They resumed at the end of hostilities in 1918, and in 1919 the opening of the [[Simplon Tunnel]] allowed the introduction of a more southerly route via [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Trieste]]. The service on this route was known as the Simplon Orient Express, and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] contained a clause requiring [[Austria]] to accept this train: formerly, Austria allowed international services to pass through Austrian territory (which included Trieste at the time) only if they ran via Vienna. The Simplon Orient Express soon became the most important rail route between Paris and \u0130stanbul.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:Orient Express Buchs.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Badge of the ''Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits'' on a car of the Orient Express]]\nThe 1930s saw the Orient Express services at its most popular, with three parallel services running: the Orient Express, the Simplon Orient Express, and also the [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express, which ran via [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Innsbruck]] to Budapest, with sleeper cars running onwards from there to Bucharest and [[Athens]]. During this time, the Orient Express acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury, carrying sleeping-cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their [[cuisine]]. [[Royal family|Royalty]], [[nobility|nobles]], [[diplomacy|diplomats]], [[businessperson|business people]], and the [[bourgeoisie]] in general patronized it. Each of the Orient Express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from [[Calais]] to Paris, thus extending the service from one end of continental Europe to the other.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:WL GOLDEN ARROW.jpg|thumb|WL Golden Arrow]]\nThe start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 again interrupted the service, which did not resume until 1945. During the war, the German [[Mitropa]] company had run some services on the route through the [[Balkans]],<ref name=\"EngRail\">{{cite web | url = http://www.engrailhistory.info/r045.html | title = The Orient Express \u2013 Across Europe from London to Istanbul | accessdate = 2013-03-13 | work = Eng Rail History | publisher = engrailhistory.info}}</ref> but [[Yugoslav Partisans]] frequently sabotaged the track, forcing a stop to this service.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the war, normal services resumed except on the Athens leg, where the closure of the border between [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] prevented services from running. That border re-opened in 1951, but the closure of the [[Bulgaria]]n\u2013[[Turkey|Turkish]] border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to \u0130stanbul during that time. As the [[Iron Curtain]] fell across Europe, the service continued to run, but [[Warsaw Pact|the Communist nations]] increasingly replaced the ''[[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Wagon-Lits]]'' cars with carriages run by their own railway services.\n\n[[File:\u00c9tiquette \u00e0 bagage, (c)wagons-lits diffusion, paris.jpg|thumb|Luggage tag]]\n\nBy 1962, the Orient Express and [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express had stopped running, leaving only the Simplon Orient Express. This was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the Direct Orient Express, which ran daily cars from Paris to Belgrade, and twice weekly services from Paris to \u0130stanbul and Athens.\n\nIn 1971, the ''Wagon-Lits'' company stopped running carriages itself and making revenues from a ticket supplement. Instead, it sold or leased all its carriages to the various national railway companies, but continued to provide staff for the carriages. 1976 saw the withdrawal of the Paris\u2013Athens direct service, and in 1977, the Direct Orient Express was withdrawn completely, with the last Paris\u2013\u0130stanbul service running on May 19 of that year.<ref name=\"Independent\"/><ref name=\"Christie\"/>\n\nThe withdrawal of the Direct Orient Express was thought by many to signal the end of the Orient Express as a whole, but in fact a service under this name continued to run from Paris to [[Bucharest]] as before (via Strasbourg, Munich, and Budapest). However, a through sleeping car from Paris to Bucharest \u2014 and even eastwards from Vienna \u2014 was only operated until 1982, and also a through seating car was only operated seasonally. This meant, that Paris\u2013Budapest and Vienna\u2013Bucharest coaches were running overlapped, so a journey was only possible with changing carriages \u2014 despite the unchanged name and numbering of the train. In 1991 the Budapest-Bucharest leg of the train was canceled, the new final station has become Budapest. In the summer season of 1999 and 2000 a sleeping car from Bucharest to Paris reappeared twice a week \u2014 now operated by [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]]. This continued until 2001, when the service was cut back to just Paris\u2013[[Vienna]], already in [[EuroNight]] quality \u2014 but in both cases the coaches were in fact rather attached to a Paris\u2013[[Strasbourg]] express. This service continued daily, listed in the timetables under the name ''Orient Express'', until June 8, 2007.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nWith the opening of the [[LGV Est]] Paris\u2013Strasbourg high speed rail line on June 10, 2007, the ''Orient Express'' service was further cut back to Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, departing nightly at 22:20 from Strasbourg, and still bearing the name,<ref name=\"Christie\" /><ref name=\"Seat61\" /> but lost the number 262/263 which was owned for decades. \nThe remains of the train had a convenient connection from/to the Strasbourg-Paris [[TGV]], but due to the less flexible prices the changing has become less attractive. In the last years through coaches between Vienna and [[Karlsruhe]] (continuing first to [[Dortmund]], then to [[Amsterdam]], and finally \u2014 partly from Budapest \u2014 to [[Frankfurt]]) were attached. The very last train with the name Orient-Express (now with a hyphen) departed from Vienna on the 10th of December 2009, and one day later from Strasbourg.[[File:Sirkeci-station Orient Express.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] in [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\n== Route legacy ==\nThough the final service ran only from [[Strasbourg]] to [[Vienna]], it was possible to retrace the entire original Orient Express route with four trains: Paris\u2013Strasbourg, Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, Vienna\u2013[[Belgrade]], and Belgrade-[[\u0130stanbul]], each of which were operated daily. Other routes from Paris to \u0130stanbul exist even today, such as Paris\u2013[[Munich]]\u2013[[Budapest]]\u2013[[Bucharest]]\u2013\u0130stanbul, or Paris\u2013Z\u00fcrich\u2013Belgrade\u2013\u0130stanbul, all of which have comparable travel times of approximately 60 hours without delays. Train services across the border to [[Turkey]] were stopped through several years due to construction works, but they were reintroduced in June 2017, however, ending in \u0130stanbul's suburb [[Halkal\u0131 railway station|Halkal\u0131]], from where a transfer bus is provided to the city centre.\n\nThe luxurious dining car, where scenes for ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and other movies were filmed, is now in the OSE museum of [[Thessalonica|Thessalon\u00edka]]. The local authorities plan to refit the train to make it available for tourist use around [[the Balkans]] in the near future.\n\n== Privately run trains using the name ==\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\nIn 1976, the Swiss travel company ''Intraflug AG'' had first hired, then also bought, several CIWL-carriages, and operated them as Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express from Z\u00fcrich to [[\u0130stanbul]]. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the Orient-Express was celebrated by a trip of this train from Paris to \u0130stanbul, and in 1988 it was run to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] via the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]]. From there it was transferred by ferry to [[Japan]], and used there for some excursions after regauging.\n\nAfter the failure of the American European Express (see below), ''Intraflug'' became bankrupt, and the carriages were taken over by the Reiseb\u00fcro Mittelthurgau. The sleeping cars and some other coaches (Pullmans, dining cars, luggage vans) were transferred to [[Russia]] and used between Moscow and the Mongolian-Chinese border. (The adjacent Chinese train was also branded for a while as China Orient Express; nowadays it's known as Shangri-La Express.) The remaining vehicles were used in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] as diner trains until the company's 2003 bankruptcy. Since then the trains have been standing unused in different countries, as the new owners sort out problems with operations due to a lawsuit about the usage rights of the name Orient Express.\n\nIn 1982, the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express]] was established as a private venture, running restored 1920s and 1930s carriages from London to [[Venice]]. This service runs between March and November, and is firmly aimed at leisure travellers, with tickets costing over $3,120 per person from [[London]] to [[Venice]] (via [[Paris]], [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Innsbruck]], and [[Verona]]\u2014also, despite its name, the train is running via the [[Brenner Pass]] instead of the Simplon tunnel) including meals. Two or three times a year, [[Prague]] or [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]] are also accessed, starting from Venice, and returning to Paris and London. Every September the train also goes from London and Paris to [[\u0130stanbul]] via [[Budapest]], [[Sinaia]], and [[Bucharest]]\u2014in the last three cities a sightseeing (and in the two capitals an overnight in hotel) also takes place\u2014the return trip on the same route ends up in Venice.\nWhile the above-mentioned routes are available almost every year, some seasons have also included unique destinations, among them [[Cologne]], [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Lucerne]], the [[High Tatras]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Dresden]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Stockholm]]. Such a journey is provided currently to [[Berlin]].\n\n[[File:Orient.Express.in.Poland.02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Venice-Simplon Orient Express in [[Poland]], in 2007]]\n\nThe company also offers a similarly themed luxury train in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Thailand]] called the [[Eastern and Oriental Express]], and operates other luxury overnight trains in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Peru]].\n\nThe Pullman Orient Express was established by the CIWL in 1994. This train has only Pullman and dining cars, but no sleepers. It's used for gourmet trips in France. After the legal disputes about the name it was taken over by the [[SNCF]] and operated since then as ''Pullman Orient-Express''.\n\nIn [[North America]], the [[American Orient Express]], formerly the American European Express and later GrandLuxe Express, operated several train sets in charter service between 1989 and 2008.\n\n[[File:CIWL ORIENT EXPRESS TAURUS, (c) wagons-lits diffusion.jpg|thumb|Orient Express poster]]\n\n== CIWL phototheque and historical archives ==\nThe CIWL archives contain more than 100 years of posters, photos, plans, and communication material that represents a tremendous interest for cultural, academic, or commercial projects. Creators and artists have been hired by CIWL since 1883 in order to create luxury conditions and comfort in travel, as well as a particular graphic style that is now recognized worldwide by its quality. Great efforts have been made to digitalize images (photos, plans, and posters), although vast paper archives remain preserved, waiting to be sorted and classified in the future.\nAs of today, available digital archives consist of more than 250 CIWL posters, 800 PLM posters, and more than 6,000 archive photos, representing probably one of the most extensive poster collections in the world with works dating from the end of the 19th century to the late 1950s.

The best known of them were passed in 1865 and 1866 by [[Southern United States|Southern states]], after the [[American Civil War]], in order to restrict African Americans' freedom, and to compel them to work for low wages. However, Black Codes existed before the Civil War, and many Northern states had them. In 1832, \"in most of the United States, there is a distinction in respect to political privileges, between free white persons and free coloured persons of African blood; and in no part of the country do the latter, in point of fact, participate equally with the whites, in the exercise of civil and political rights.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n|first=James\n|last=Kent\n|title=Commentaries on American Law\n|year=1832\n|edition=2nd\n|volume=2\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FVoZsc_TY5IC/page/n260 258]\n|location=New-York\n|publisher=O.

Black codes were essentially replacements for slave codes in those states. Before the war, Northern states that had prohibited slavery also enacted Black Codes: Connecticut, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,<ref name=\"The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio by Stephen K. Middleton\">'' The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio'' by Stephen Middleton. (2005. Ohio University Press) [https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws (https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws]</ref> and New York enacted laws to discourage free blacks from residing in those states. They were denied equal political rights, including the right to vote, the right to attend public schools, and the right to equal treatment under the law.  Some of the Northern states{{which|date=October 2019}} repealed such laws around the same time that the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished by constitutional amendment.\n\nSince the colonial period, colonies and states had passed laws that discriminated against [[Free negro|free Blacks]]. In the South, these were generally included in \"[[slave codes]]\"; the goal was to reduce the influence of free blacks (particularly after slave rebellions) because of their potential influence on slaves. Restrictions included prohibiting them from voting (although North Carolina had allowed this before 1831), bearing arms, gathering in groups for worship, and learning to read and write. The purpose of these laws was to preserve slavery in slave societies.\n\nIn the first two years after the Civil War, white-dominated Southern legislatures passed Black Codes modeled after the earlier slave codes. They were particularly concerned with controlling movement and labor of freedmen, as slavery had been replaced by a free labor system. Although freedmen had been emancipated, their lives were greatly restricted by the Black Codes.\n\nThe name Black Codes was given by \"negro leaders and the Republican organs\", according to historian John S.

Chattel slaves basically lived under the complete control of their owners, so there was little need for extensive legislation. \"All Southern states imposed at least minimal limits on slave punishment, for example, by making murder or life-threatening injury of slaves a crime, and a few states allowed slaves a limited right of self-defense.\"<ref name=Ranney15>Ranney, ''In the Wake of Slavery'' (2006), p. 15.</ref> As slaves could not use the courts or sheriff, or give testimony against a white man, in practice these meant little.\n\nNorth Carolina<sup>Only?</sup> restricted slaves from leaving their plantation; if a male slave tried to court (date) a female slave on another property, he needed a pass in order to pursue this relationship.

Both agencies preserved 'white man's rule,' and though both of them did, as George Bently said of the Freedmen's Bureau, 'maintain a fairly strong guard against any form of reenslavement of the Negroes', their interest in the welfare and happiness of the freedmen did not, as a whole, extend far beyond that safeguard in 1865 and 1866.

Although blacks did not all abruptly stop working, they did try to work less. In particular, many sought to reduce their Saturday work hours, and women wanted to spend more time on [[child care]].<ref>Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), pp. 54\u201355. \"The larger problem, however, was labor for agriculture, the mainstay of the southern economy. Increasingly the freedmen, whose work day was from sunrise to sunset, refused to work more than a half day, if at all, on Saturday.&nbsp;... The greatest loss to the labor force resulted from the decision of growing numbers of negro women to devote their time to their homes and children.\"</ref> In the view of one contemporary economist, freed people exhibited this \"noncapitalist behavior\" because the condition of being owned had \"shielded the slaves from the [[market economy]]\" and they were therefore unable to perform \"careful calculation of economic opportunities\".<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nAn alternative explanation treats the labor slowdown as a form of gaining leverage through collective action.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), pp. 16\u201317.</ref> Another possibility is that freed blacks assigned value to leisure and family time in excess of the monetary value of additional paid labor. Indeed, freedpeople certainly did not ''want'' to work the long hours that had been forced upon them for their whole lives.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 14.</ref> Whatever its causes, the sudden reduction of available labor posed a challenge to the Southern economy, which had relied upon intense physical labor to profitably harvest [[cash crop]]s, particularly [[King Cotton]].<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 29.</ref>\n\nSouthern Whites also perceived Black vagrancy as a sudden and dangerous social problem.<ref>Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), p. 53. \"Most southern towns were not very large and the influx of even a few hundred undoubtedly gave witnesses a false impression of the size of the movement.&nbsp;...

Of these, eight allowed [[Convict lease|convict leasing]] (a system in which state prison hired out convicts for labor) and five allowed prisoner labor for public works projects.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 33. \"Of the nine states that adopted vagrancy laws in 1865 \u2013 1866, all except North Carolina provided for the hiring-out of [[vagrant]]s. These same states also enacted convict laws allowing for the hiring-out of other county prisoners who could not pay their fines and costs. In addition, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia made it legal for county authorities to put prisoners to work on public projects such as roads and bridges.\"</ref> This created a system that established incentives to arrest black men, as convicts were supplied to local governments and planters as free workers. The planters or other supervisors were responsible for their board and food, and black convicts were kept in miserable conditions. As [[Douglas Blackmon]] wrote, it was \"slavery by another name\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Because of their reliance on convict leasing, Southern states did not build any prisons until the late 19th century.\n\nAnother important part of the Codes were the annual labor contracts, which Black people had to keep and present to authorities to avoid vagrancy charges.<ref name=Daniel96>Daniel, ''Metamorphosis of Slavery'' (1979), p. 96. \"The yearly contract was one of the most important elements in the landlord's control over labor \u2014 not what the contract stated explicitly, but what it implied and how it was executed.

The constant threat of violence against Black people (and White people who sympathized with them) maintained a system of extralegal [[Terrorism|terror]]. Although this system is now well known for prohibiting [[Black suffrage#United States|Black suffrage]] after the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], it also served to enforce coercive labor relations.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 97.</ref> Fear of random violence provided new support for a [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] relationship between plantation owners and their Black workers.<ref name=Daniel91>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 91. \"Freedmen, however, did not cooperate with the plans to reenslave them.

Quote: \"Generally, Restoration legislatures tried to preserve as many prewar restrictions as possible while making at least a slight bow to Northern public opinion.\"</ref> Even states that carefully eliminated most of the overt discrimination in their Black Codes retained laws authorizing harsher sentences for Black people.<ref name=\"ranney51\"/>\n\nMississippi was the first state to legislate a new Black Code after the war, beginning with \"An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen\". This law allowed Blacks to rent land only within cities\u2014effectively preventing them from earning money through independent farming. It required Blacks to present, each January, written proof of employment. The law defined violation of this requirement as vagrancy, punishable by arrest\u2014for which the arresting officer would be paid $5, to be taken from the arrestee's wages. Provisions akin to [[fugitive slave laws]] mandated the return of runaway workers, who would lose their wages for the year.<ref name=paxson>Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer, ''A History of the United States since the Civil War'' (1917) 1:128\u2013129. Quote: \"Negroes must make [[Indentured servant|annual contracts for their labor]] in writing; if they should run away from their tasks, they forfeited their wages for the year. Whenever it was required of them they must present licenses (in a town from the mayor; elsewhere from a member of the board of police of the beat) citing their places of residence and authorizing them to work. Fugitives from labor were to be arrested and carried back to their employers. Five dollars a head and mileage would be allowed such negro catchers. It was made a misdemeanor, punishable with fine or imprisonment, to persuade a freedman to leave his employer, or to feed the runaway. Minors were to be apprenticed, if males until they were twenty-one, if females until eighteen years of age. Such corporal punishment as a father would administer to a child might be inflicted upon apprentices by their masters. Vagrants were to be fined heavily, and if they could not pay the sum, they were to be hired out to service until the claim was satisfied. Negroes must not carry knives or firearms unless they were licensed so to do. It was an offence, to be punished by a fine of $50 and imprisonment for thirty days, to give or sell intoxicating liquors to a negro. When negroes could not pay the fines and costs after legal proceedings, they were to be hired at public outcry by the sheriff to the lowest  bidder....\"</ref><ref name=Novak2 /><ref name=Forte601 />  An amended version of the vagrancy law included punishments for sympathetic whites:<ref name=Stewart2261 /><ref name=Novak2>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>That all freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in this State, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereafter, without lawful employment or business, or found unlawfully assembling themselves together, either in the day or night time, and all white persons so assembling themselves with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, or usually associating with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, on terms of equality, or living in adultery or fornication with a freed woman, free negro or mulatto, shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not exceeding, in the case of a freedman, free negro, or mulatto, fifty dollars, and a white man two hundred dollars, and imprisoned, at the discretion of the court, the free negro not exceeding ten days, and the white man not exceeding six months.</blockquote>\n\nWhites could avoid the code's penalty by swearing a [[pauper's oath]].

Conviction for vagrancy allowed the state to \"hire out\" blacks for no pay. The law also called for a special tax on blacks (all males and unmarried females), with non-paying blacks again guilty of vagrancy. The law enabled forcible apprenticeship of children of impoverished parents, or of parents who did not convey \"habits of industry and honesty\".<ref name=Novak4 /> The law did not include the same punishments for Whites in dealing with fugitives.<ref>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), pp. 4\u20135. \"Notably, the use of criminal penalties to prevent the enticement of a servant or his harboring was not included in the South Carolina codes at this time.\"</ref>\n\nThe South Carolina law created separate courts for Black people, and authorized [[capital punishment]] for crimes including theft of cotton.<ref>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p.

Its vagrancy laws did not specify Black culprits, though they did provide a \"good behavior\" loophole subject to plausibly racist interpretation. Louisiana passed harsher fugitive worker laws and required blacks to present dismissal paperwork to new employers.<ref>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 5. \"The vagrancy law, which made no racial distinctions, was broadened in its compass, and provision was made for the hiring out of convicted vagrants (here an out was given to those who could convince a judge of their good behavior and future industry, obviously to provide a safety valve for convicted whites) and the penalty was  raised from six months to a year. Enticement, harboring, or employing 'runaway servants' was made a penal offense, and the legislature added a new twist, demanding that all employers be shown a written discharge from the laborer's former master.</ref>\n\nState legislation was amplified by local authorities, who ran less risk of backlash from the federal government. [[Opelousas, Louisiana]], passed a notorious code which required freedpeople to have written authorization to enter the town.

By 1860, 45.6% of the black population in the state was already free. Former slave owners rushed to place the children of freedpeople in multi-year apprenticeships; the Freedmen's Bureau and some others tried to stop them. The legislature stripped Baltimore Judge [[Hugh Lennox Bond]] of his position because he cooperated with the Bureau in this matter. [[Salmon Chase]], as Chief Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]], eventually overruled the Maryland apprentice laws on the grounds of their violation of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]].<ref>{{Cite book |first=Joseph A. |last=Ranney |title=In the Wake of Slavery |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-98972-0 |publisher=Praeger |page=48}}</ref>\n\n===North Carolina===\nNorth Carolina's Black Code specified racial differences in punishment, establishing harsher sentences for Blacks convicted of rape.<ref name=DuBois177 />\n\n===Texas===\nThe Texas Constitutional Convention met in February 1866, declined to ratify the (already effective) Thirteenth Amendment, provided that Blacks would be \"protected in their rights of person and property by appropriate legislation\" and guaranteed some degree of rights to testify in court.<ref>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), p. 21.</ref> Texas modeled its laws on South Carolina's.<ref name=Ranney46 />\n\nThe legislature defined Negroes as people with at least one African great-grandparent.<ref name=Crouch23 /> Negroes could choose their employer, before a deadline.

It was called peonage after the labor practice in Mexico and through an unlikely set of circumstances violated an 1867 federal state in the United States. The law lay dormant for thirty-four years, but peonage was widespread in the South by the turn of the century, and it was especially virulent in the [[cotton belt]], the [[Mississippi Delta]], and the [[turpentine belt]].\"</ref> In 1907, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Charles Joseph Bonaparte]] issued a report, ''Peonage Matters'', which found that, beyond [[Peon|debt peonage]], there was a widespread system of laws \"considered to have been passed to force negro laborers to work\".<ref name=Cohen31 />\n\nAfter creating the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Section]] in 1939, the [[United States Department of Justice|Federal Department of Justice]] launched a wave of successful [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] prosecutions against involuntary servitude in the South.\n\nMany of the Southern vagrancy laws remained in force until the Supreme Court's ''[[Papachristou v. Jacksonville]]'' decision in 1972.<ref name=Stewart2262>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), p. 2262.</ref> Although the laws were defended as preventing crime, the Court held that Jacksonville's vagrancy law \"furnishes a convenient tool for 'harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure.'\"<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), p. 2263.</ref>\n\nEven after ''Papachristou'', police activity in many parts of the United States discriminates against racial minority groups. Gary Stewart has identified contemporary [[gang injunction]]s\u2014which target young Black or Latino men who gather in public\u2014as a conspicuous legacy of Southern Black Codes.<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), pp. 2263\u20132264.</ref> Stewart argues that these laws maintain a system of white supremacy and reflect a system of racist prejudice, even though racism is rarely acknowledged explicitly in their creation and enforcement.<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), pp. 2268\u20132270.</ref> Contemporary Black commentators have argued that the current [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|disproportionate]] [[Incarceration in the United States|incarceration]] of African Americans, with a concomitant rise in prison labor, is comparable (perhaps unfavorably) with the historical Black Codes.<ref>Bruce A.

Vagrancy laws and peonage systems are widespread features of post-slavery societies.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 95.</ref> One theory suggests that particularly restrictive laws emerge in larger countries (compare Jamaica with the United States) where the ruling group does not occupy land at a high enough density to prevent the freed people from gaining their own.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), pp. 93\u201394.</ref> It seems that the United States was uniquely successful in maintaining involuntary servitude after legal emancipation.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 94.\"Yet West Indian planters were not as successful as were southern planters in perpetuating involuntary servitude among freedmen. Despite vagrancy and contract laws in Jamaica, compulsion did not work.

Like emancipation, decolonization was a landmark political change\u2014but its significance, according to some historians, was tempered by the [[neocolonialism|continuity of economic exploitation]].<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 23. \"By breaking their colonial links, the undeveloped or underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa were expected to be able finally to follow the path of sustained economic growth that Europe and North America had walked in the past.

The best known of them were passed in 1865 and 1866 by [[Southern United States|Southern states]], after the [[American Civil War]], in order to restrict African Americans' freedom, and to compel them to work for low wages. However, Black Codes existed before the Civil War, and many Northern states had them. In 1832, \"in most of the United States, there is a distinction in respect to political privileges, between free white persons and free coloured persons of African blood; and in no part of the country do the latter, in point of fact, participate equally with the whites, in the exercise of civil and political rights.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n|first=James\n|last=Kent\n|title=Commentaries on American Law\n|year=1832\n|edition=2nd\n|volume=2\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FVoZsc_TY5IC/page/n260 258]\n|location=New-York\n|publisher=O. Halsted\n|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FVoZsc_TY5IC}}</ref>\n\nBlack Codes were part of a larger pattern of whites trying to maintain political dominance and suppress the [[freedmen]], newly emancipated African-American slaves.  Black codes were essentially replacements for slave codes in those states. Before the war, Northern states that had prohibited slavery also enacted Black Codes: Connecticut, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,<ref name=\"The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio by Stephen K. Middleton\">'' The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio'' by Stephen Middleton. (2005. Ohio University Press) [https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws (https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws]</ref> and New York enacted laws to discourage free blacks from residing in those states. They were denied equal political rights, including the right to vote, the right to attend public schools, and the right to equal treatment under the law.  Some of the Northern states{{which|date=October 2019}} repealed such laws around the same time that the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished by constitutional amendment.\n\nSince the colonial period, colonies and states had passed laws that discriminated against [[Free negro|free Blacks]]. In the South, these were generally included in \"[[slave codes]]\"; the goal was to reduce the influence of free blacks (particularly after slave rebellions) because of their potential influence on slaves. Restrictions included prohibiting them from voting (although North Carolina had allowed this before 1831), bearing arms, gathering in groups for worship, and learning to read and write. The purpose of these laws was to preserve slavery in slave societies.\n\nIn the first two years after the Civil War, white-dominated Southern legislatures passed Black Codes modeled after the earlier slave codes. They were particularly concerned with controlling movement and labor of freedmen, as slavery had been replaced by a free labor system. Although freedmen had been emancipated, their lives were greatly restricted by the Black Codes.\n\nThe name Black Codes was given by \"negro leaders and the Republican organs\", according to historian John S. Reynolds.<ref>James Calvin Hemphill, \"John Schreiner Reynolds\", ''Men of Mark in South Carolina: Ideals of American Life'' Vol. II; Washington, D.C.: Men of Mark Publishing Co., 1908.</ref><ref>Kermit L.

Introduced by aristocratic and landowning classes, they had the dual purpose of restricting access of \"undesirable\" classes to public spaces and of ensuring a labor pool.

Chattel slaves basically lived under the complete control of their owners, so there was little need for extensive legislation. \"All Southern states imposed at least minimal limits on slave punishment, for example, by making murder or life-threatening injury of slaves a crime, and a few states allowed slaves a limited right of self-defense.\"<ref name=Ranney15>Ranney, ''In the Wake of Slavery'' (2006), p. 15.</ref> As slaves could not use the courts or sheriff, or give testimony against a white man, in practice these meant little.\n\nNorth Carolina<sup>Only?</sup> restricted slaves from leaving their plantation; if a male slave tried to court (date) a female slave on another property, he needed a pass in order to pursue this relationship.

In addition, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia made it legal for county authorities to put prisoners to work on public projects such as roads and bridges.\"</ref> This created a system that established incentives to arrest black men, as convicts were supplied to local governments and planters as free workers. The planters or other supervisors were responsible for their board and food, and black convicts were kept in miserable conditions. As [[Douglas Blackmon]] wrote, it was \"slavery by another name\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Because of their reliance on convict leasing, Southern states did not build any prisons until the late 19th century.\n\nAnother important part of the Codes were the annual labor contracts, which Black people had to keep and present to authorities to avoid vagrancy charges.<ref name=Daniel96>Daniel, ''Metamorphosis of Slavery'' (1979), p. 96. \"The yearly contract was one of the most important elements in the landlord's control over labor \u2014 not what the contract stated explicitly, but what it implied and how it was executed.

Newly elected governor [[James Lawrence Orr]] said that blacks must be \"restrained from theft, idleness, vagrancy and crime, and taught the ''absolute necessity'' of strictly complying with their contracts for labor\".<ref name=Novak4>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 4.</ref>\n\nSouth Carolina's new law on \"Domestic Relations of Persons of Color\" established wide-ranging rules on vagrancy resembling Mississippi's. Conviction for vagrancy allowed the state to \"hire out\" blacks for no pay. The law also called for a special tax on blacks (all males and unmarried females), with non-paying blacks again guilty of vagrancy. The law enabled forcible apprenticeship of children of impoverished parents, or of parents who did not convey \"habits of industry and honesty\".<ref name=Novak4 /> The law did not include the same punishments for Whites in dealing with fugitives.<ref>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), pp. 4\u20135. \"Notably, the use of criminal penalties to prevent the enticement of a servant or his harboring was not included in the South Carolina codes at this time.\"</ref>\n\nThe South Carolina law created separate courts for Black people, and authorized [[capital punishment]] for crimes including theft of cotton.<ref>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p.

One planter suggested that the new laws would require paramilitary enforcement: \"As for making the negroes work under the present state of affairs it seems to me a waste of time and energy&nbsp;...

James Hemphill said: \"It will be hard to persuade the freedom shriekers that the American citizens of African descent are obtaining their rights.\"<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 76\u201377.</ref> Orr moved to block further laws containing explicit racial discrimination.<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 77.</ref> In 1866, the South Carolina code came under increasing scrutiny in the Northern press and was compared unfavorably to freedmen's laws passed in neighboring Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 78.</ref>\n\nIn a special session held in September 1866, the legislature passed some new laws in concession to the rights of free Blacks. Shortly after, it rejected the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 79.</ref>\n\n===Louisiana===\nThe Louisiana legislature, seeking to ensure that freedmen were \"available to the agricultural interests of the state\", passed similar yearly contract laws and expanded its vagrancy laws. Its vagrancy laws did not specify Black culprits, though they did provide a \"good behavior\" loophole subject to plausibly racist interpretation. Louisiana passed harsher fugitive worker laws and required blacks to present dismissal paperwork to new employers.<ref>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 5. \"The vagrancy law, which made no racial distinctions, was broadened in its compass, and provision was made for the hiring out of convicted vagrants (here an out was given to those who could convince a judge of their good behavior and future industry, obviously to provide a safety valve for convicted whites) and the penalty was  raised from six months to a year. Enticement, harboring, or employing 'runaway servants' was made a penal offense, and the legislature added a new twist, demanding that all employers be shown a written discharge from the laborer's former master.</ref>\n\nState legislation was amplified by local authorities, who ran less risk of backlash from the federal government. [[Opelousas, Louisiana]], passed a notorious code which required freedpeople to have written authorization to enter the town. The code prevented freedpeople from living in the town or walking at night except under supervision of a White resident.<ref name=DuBois177>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/176/mode/2up 177].</ref>\n\n[[Thomas W. Conway]], the Freedmen's Bureau commissioner for Louisiana, testified in 1866:<ref name=DuBois178>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/178/mode/2up 178].</ref>\n<blockquote>Some of the leading officers of the state down there\u2014men who do much to form and control the opinions of the masses\u2014instead of doing as they promised, and quietly submitting to the authority of the government, engaged in issuing slave codes and in promulgating them to their subordinates, ordering them to carry them into execution, and this to the knowledge of state officials of a higher character, the governor and others.&nbsp;... These codes were simply the old black code of the state, with the word 'slave' expunged, and 'Negro' substituted. The most odious features of slavery were preserved in them.</blockquote>\n\nConway describes surveying the Louisiana jails and finding large numbers of Black men who had been secretly incarcerated. These included members of the Seventy-Fourth Colored Infantry who had been arrested the day after they were discharged.<ref name=DuBois178 />\n\nThe state passed a harsher version of its code in 1866, criminalizing \"impudence\", \"swearing\", and other signs of \"disobedience\" as determined by whites.<ref name=\"Forte603\"/>\n\n===Florida===\nOf the Black Codes passed in 1866 (after the Northern reaction had become apparent), only Florida's rivaled those of Mississippi and South Carolina in severity.<ref>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 365.</ref> Florida's slaveowners seemed to hold out hope that the institution of slavery would simply be restored.<ref>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 366.</ref> Advised by the [[Governor of Florida|Florida governor]] and [[Attorney General of Florida|attorney general]] as well as by the Freedmen's Bureau that it could not constitutionally revoke Black people's right to bear arms, the Florida legislature refused to repeal this part of the codes.<ref name=Richardson373>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 373.</ref>\n\nThe Florida vagrancy law allowed for punishments of up to one year of labor.<ref name=Richarson374 /> Children whose parents were convicted of vagrancy could be hired out as apprentices.<ref>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 375.</ref>\n\nThese laws applied to any \"person of color\", which was defined as someone with [[octaroon|at least one Negro great-grandparent]], or one-eighth black ancestry.<ref name=Richarson374 >Richardson, ''Florida Black Codes'' (1969), p. 374.</ref> White women could not live with men of color.<ref name=Richarson374 /> Colored workers could be punished for disrespecting White employers.<ref name=\"Forte603\"/> The explicit racism in the law was supplemented by racist [[enforcement discretion]] (and other inequalities) in the practice of law enforcement and legal systems.<ref>Richardson, ''Florida Black Codes'' (1969), pp. 376\u2013377.</ref>\n\n===Maryland===\nIn Maryland, a fierce battle began immediately after emancipation (by the [[Maryland Constitution of 1864]]) over requiring apprenticeship of young black people. By 1860, 45.6% of the black population in the state was already free. Former slave owners rushed to place the children of freedpeople in multi-year apprenticeships; the Freedmen's Bureau and some others tried to stop them. The legislature stripped Baltimore Judge [[Hugh Lennox Bond]] of his position because he cooperated with the Bureau in this matter. [[Salmon Chase]], as Chief Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]], eventually overruled the Maryland apprentice laws on the grounds of their violation of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]].<ref>{{Cite book |first=Joseph A. |last=Ranney |title=In the Wake of Slavery |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-98972-0 |publisher=Praeger |page=48}}</ref>\n\n===North Carolina===\nNorth Carolina's Black Code specified racial differences in punishment, establishing harsher sentences for Blacks convicted of rape.<ref name=DuBois177 />\n\n===Texas===\nThe Texas Constitutional Convention met in February 1866, declined to ratify the (already effective) Thirteenth Amendment, provided that Blacks would be \"protected in their rights of person and property by appropriate legislation\" and guaranteed some degree of rights to testify in court.<ref>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), p. 21.</ref> Texas modeled its laws on South Carolina's.<ref name=Ranney46 />\n\nThe legislature defined Negroes as people with at least one African great-grandparent.<ref name=Crouch23 /> Negroes could choose their employer, before a deadline.

Interracial marriage was banned.<ref name=Crouch23>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), p. 23. \"The legislature prohibited blacks from marrying whites or testifying against them, serving on juries, holding office, voting, homesteading on the public domain, and serving in the militia, and confined public education to white children. It provisionally authorized the Board of Managers to purchase twenty-six acres of land for a '[[Lunatic Asylum]]' for the benefit of 'Insane Negroes', if it was deemed 'expedient' to do so. They set aside $10,000 to buy the property and make improvements.\"</ref><ref name=Crouch28 /> Rape sentencing laws stipulated either capital punishment, or life in prison, or a minimum sentence of five years.

As [[List of governors of Tennessee|military governor of Tennessee]], Andrew Johnson declared a suspension of the slave code in September 1864. However, these laws were still enforced in lower courts.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 41.</ref> In 1865, Tennessee freedpeople had no legal status whatsoever, and local jurisdictions often filled the void with extremely harsh Black Codes.<ref name=Forehand61>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 61.</ref> During that year, Blacks went from one-fiftieth to one-third of the State's prison population.<ref name=Forehand61 />\n\nTennessee had a particularly urgent desire to re-enter the Union's good graces and end the occupation.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 9.</ref> When the [[Tennessee Legislature]] began to debate a Black Code, it received such negative attention in the Northern press that no comprehensive Code was ever established.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 42\u201343, 54.</ref> Instead, the State legalized Black suffrage and passed a civil rights law guaranteeing Blacks equal rights in commerce and access to the Courts.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nHowever, Tennessee society, including its judicial system, retained the same racist attitudes as did other states. Although its legal code did not discriminate against Blacks so explicitly, its law enforcement and criminal justice systems relied more heavily on racist [[enforcement discretion]] to create a ''de facto'' Black Code.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 13.</ref> The state already had vagrancy and apprenticeship laws which could easily be enforced in the same way as Black Codes in other states.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 50.</ref> Vagrancy laws came into much more frequent use after the war.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 57.</ref> And just as in Mississippi, Black children were often bound in apprenticeship to their former owners.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe legislature passed two laws on May 17, 1865; one to \"Punish all Armed Prowlers, Guerilla, [[Brigand]]s, and [[Highwayman|Highway Robbers]]\"; the other to authorize capital punishment for thefts, [[burglary]], and [[arson]]. These laws were targeted at Blacks and enforced disproportionately against Blacks, but did not discuss race explicitly.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\nTennessee law permitted Blacks to testify against Whites in 1865, but this change did not immediately take practical effect in the lower courts.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 39\u201340, 62.</ref> Blacks could not sit on juries.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 58.</ref> Still on the books were laws specifying capital punishment for a Black man who raped a White woman.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nTennessee enacted new vagrancy and enticement laws in 1875.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 31.</ref><ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 53.</ref>\n\n===Kentucky===\nKentucky had established a system of [[Convict leasing|leasing prison labor]] in 1825.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 76.</ref> This system drew a steady supply of laborers from the decisions of \"negro courts\", informal tribunals which included slaveowners.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 77.</ref> Free Blacks were frequently arrested and forced into labor.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 77\u201378.</ref>\n\nKentucky did not secede from the Union and therefore gained wide leeway from the federal government during Reconstruction.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 3.</ref> With Delaware, Kentucky did not ratify the Thirteenth Amendment and maintained legal slavery until it was nationally prohibited when the Amendment went into effect in December 1865.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 102.</ref> After the Thirteenth Amendment took effect, the state was obligated to rewrite its laws.<ref name=Forehand107>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 107.</ref>\n\nThe result was a set of Black Codes passed in early 1866. These granted a set of rights: to own property, make contracts, and some other innovations.<ref name=Forehand107 /> They also included new vagrancy and apprentice laws, which did not mention Blacks explicitly but were clearly directed toward them.<ref name=Forehand108>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 108.</ref> The vagrancy law covered loitering, \"rambling without a job\" and \"keeping a disorderly house\".<ref name=Forehand108 /> City jails filled up; wages dropped below pre-war rates.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nThe Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky was especially weak and could not mount a significant response.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 105\u2013106.</ref> The Bureau attempted to cancel a racially discriminatory apprenticeship law (which stipulated that only White children learn to read) but found itself thwarted by local authorities.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 117.</ref>\n\nSome legislation also created informal, ''de facto'' discrimination against Blacks. A new law against hunting on Sundays, for example, prevented Black workers from hunting on their only day off.<ref name=Forehand109>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 13, 109.</ref>\n\nKentucky law prevented Blacks from [[Testimony|testifying]] against Whites, a restriction which the federal government sought to remedy by providing access to federal courts through the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. Kentucky challenged the constitutionality of these courts and prevailed in ''Blyew v. United States'' (1872).<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 64\u201366.</ref> All contracts required the presence of a White witness.<ref name=Forehand109 /> Passage of the Fourteenth Amendment did not have a great effect on Kentucky's Black Codes.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and interventions==\nThis regime of white-dominated labor was not identified by the North as involuntary servitude until after 1900.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 89. \"It came as a shock, then, in 1901, when a new kind of slavery was discovered. It was called peonage after the labor practice in Mexico and through an unlikely set of circumstances violated an 1867 federal state in the United States. The law lay dormant for thirty-four years, but peonage was widespread in the South by the turn of the century, and it was especially virulent in the [[cotton belt]], the [[Mississippi Delta]], and the [[turpentine belt]].\"</ref> In 1907, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Charles Joseph Bonaparte]] issued a report, ''Peonage Matters'', which found that, beyond [[Peon|debt peonage]], there was a widespread system of laws \"considered to have been passed to force negro laborers to work\".<ref name=Cohen31 />\n\nAfter creating the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Section]] in 1939, the [[United States Department of Justice|Federal Department of Justice]] launched a wave of successful [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] prosecutions against involuntary servitude in the South.\n\nMany of the Southern vagrancy laws remained in force until the Supreme Court's ''[[Papachristou v. Jacksonville]]'' decision in 1972.<ref name=Stewart2262>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), p. 2262.</ref> Although the laws were defended as preventing crime, the Court held that Jacksonville's vagrancy law \"furnishes a convenient tool for 'harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure.'\"<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), p. 2263.</ref>\n\nEven after ''Papachristou'', police activity in many parts of the United States discriminates against racial minority groups. Gary Stewart has identified contemporary [[gang injunction]]s\u2014which target young Black or Latino men who gather in public\u2014as a conspicuous legacy of Southern Black Codes.<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), pp. 2263\u20132264.</ref> Stewart argues that these laws maintain a system of white supremacy and reflect a system of racist prejudice, even though racism is rarely acknowledged explicitly in their creation and enforcement.<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), pp. 2268\u20132270.</ref> Contemporary Black commentators have argued that the current [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|disproportionate]] [[Incarceration in the United States|incarceration]] of African Americans, with a concomitant rise in prison labor, is comparable (perhaps unfavorably) with the historical Black Codes.<ref>Bruce A.

Vagrancy laws and peonage systems are widespread features of post-slavery societies.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 95.</ref> One theory suggests that particularly restrictive laws emerge in larger countries (compare Jamaica with the United States) where the ruling group does not occupy land at a high enough density to prevent the freed people from gaining their own.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), pp. 93\u201394.</ref> It seems that the United States was uniquely successful in maintaining involuntary servitude after legal emancipation.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 94.\"Yet West Indian planters were not as successful as were southern planters in perpetuating involuntary servitude among freedmen. Despite vagrancy and contract laws in Jamaica, compulsion did not work. [\u2026] In the United States the legal machinery and violence were more successful in forcing plantation laborers to work.\"</ref>\n\nHistorians have also compared the end of the slavery in the United States to the formal [[decolonization]] of [[decolonization of Asia|Asian]] and [[decolonization of Africa|African]] nations. Like emancipation, decolonization was a landmark political change\u2014but its significance, according to some historians, was tempered by the [[neocolonialism|continuity of economic exploitation]].<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 23. \"By breaking their colonial links, the undeveloped or underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa were expected to be able finally to follow the path of sustained economic growth that Europe and North America had walked in the past. In reality, the act of decolonization itself did not change the economic position of the newly independent countries, and in some cases decolonization actually slowed economic growth or even reversed it, because the scarce factors of production were used in creating an army or in experimenting with a different division of land.\"</ref> The end of legal slavery in the United States did not seem to have major effects on the global economy or international relations.<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), pp. 26\u201328.</ref> Given the pattern of economic continuity, writes economist Pieter Emmer, \"the words ''emancipation'' and ''abolition'' must be regarded with the utmost suspicion.\"<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 24.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[40 acres and a mule]]\n* [[Apartheid in South Africa]]\n* [[Code Noir]]\n* [[Grandfather clause]]\n* [[Judicial aspects of race in the United States]]\n* [[List of Jim Crow law examples by state]]\n* [[Oregon black exclusion laws]]\n* [[Racial segregation in the United States]]\n* [[Redlining]]\n* [[Republic of New Afrika]]\n* [[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\n* [[Wage slavery]]\n* [[History of unfree labor in the United States]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Belz, Herman.
