It was introduced at the January 2002 [[North American International Auto Show]], but was not put into production until 2004.\n\n==Development==\nThe Dodge Ram SRT was created by DaimlerChrysler's PVO ([[Performance Vehicle Operations]]) division, using [[Dodge Viper]] and [[Plymouth Prowler]] engineers. Extensive wind tunnel testing was used in styling the exterior of the Ram SRT-10. This is the second time that Dodge has put a Viper engine into a Ram pickup. At the 1996 [[Chicago Auto Show]], Dodge introduced a concept Dodge Ram with a Viper Generation 2 engine, but it was not put into production. The Dodge Ram VTS was painted Banzai Blue with dual white skunk stripes, housed an 8.0 L (488 cid) V10, a six-speed Borg-Warner manual gearbox, and {{convert|17|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} Viper GTS wheels wrapped in BF Goodrich 275/60-HR17 Comp T/A HR4 tires.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Ram SRT engine.jpg|right|thumb|Dodge Ram SRT-10 engine (with aftermarket intake tube)]]The SRT-10 featured an 8.3 liter (Chrysler 8.3 L Viper V10) [[V10 engine|V10]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/02q1/dodge_ram_srt-10-auto_shows |title=Dodge Ram SRT-10 - Auto Shows |publisher=Car and Driver |date= January 2002|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> This engine produced {{convert|500|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|525|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 4,200 rpm.

A fully hydroformed Dodge Ram [[chassis|frame]] was used in conjunction with a custom-tuned suspension, lowering the Ram SRT-10's ride height one inch in the front and 2.5&nbsp;inches in the rear. [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein shock absorbers]], performance-tuned springs and unique aerodynamic aids were used to enhance the Ram SRT-10's higher-speed performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/112_0401_2004_dodge_ram_srt10/performance.html |title=2004 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Dimensions and Performance |publisher=Motor Trend |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>\nAn additional 5th shock was used on the rear axle to prevent wheel hop during wheel-spin.\n\n===Exterior===\nThe Ram SRT-10 had a unique hood that featured a wide power bulge and honeycomb grill hood scoop. The hood scoop allowed cool air to enter as well as forcing hot air to exit from the engine bay, thus helping the engine to run cooler. \"Viper Powered\" badges were added to the sides of the power bulge, to indicate the SRT-10 engine under the hood. Large chrome SRT-10 logos were mounted to the driver and passenger side doors and rear tailgate right side on the Quad cab and Single Cab 2005 models replaced in 2006 by smaller chrome and red SRT-10 logo badges . All models were outfitted with large molded kickerpanels painted to match body color. Another exterior feature was a [[tonneau cover]] with an attached [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] that was supposed to come standard on the 2005 Quad Cab version and all 2006 models, but due to manufacturing problems was not installed on nearly half of the Ram SRT-10s intended. To help remedy this situation, Dodge added a $1000 credit and a regular spoiler to the Ram SRT-10s that did not receive the tonneau cover. In addition to style, the spoiler also helped with air flow and provided a reduction in lift and drag. The Ram SRT-10 had a bed size of {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, giving the regular cab an overall length of {{convert|17|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|19|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} overall length for the Quad Cab.\n\n===Interior===\nThe Truck audio had 3 options of the Dodge Ram SRT-10 by 2006 and consisted of 8 [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] brand [[loudspeaker|speakers]] with a DVD based large color LCD map navigation system and a mid-tier CD turn by turn graphics CD-based system with small color LCD, and finally a standard LED Radio with CD player; all built and designed by Infinity audio and 10 inch woofer mounted in between the seats with silver bezel and 575 watts of total system output, Bluetooth by U-Connect for hands free communication through your car stereo as a factory option also full digital Satellite radio. The doors on both the Standard cab and Quad had silver accents along the middle above the arm rest. It also came with a leather trimmed [[steering wheel]] and with heavily bolstered racing-derived suede-trimmed charcoal leather seats. The center stack was adorned with silver trim, and a silver trim strip with the SRT-10 logo resided under the passenger-side [[air bag]] cover. Taking a cue from the Dodge Viper, the Ram SRT-10 came with a red start button on the dash. The manual transmission regular cab featured a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shift lever, which sprouted from a silver metal shift bezel and was fitted with a Viper shift knob. Aluminum performance-inspired pedals replaced the stock setup. The gauge cluster featured satin silver-faced gauges and Viper font and graphics. The [[speedometer]] and [[tachometer]] were re-calibrated to match the Ram SRT-10's increased performance.\n\n===Colors===\nExcluding the special editions, the 2004-2005 Ram SRT-10 came in three colors: Black Clear Coat, Bright Silver Metallic Clear Coat, and Flame Red Clear Coat. The redesigned 2006 Ram SRT-10 came in Mineral Gray Metallic, Inferno Red Crystal Pearl Coat, Brilliant Black Crystal Clear Coat, Flame Red Clear Coat and Black Clear Coat.\n\n===Wheels and brakes===\nThe stock {{convert|22|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheels were fitted with [[Pirelli]] Scorpion P305/40R-22 performance tires and modeled after the 10-spoke wheels available on the Viper. The brakes for the 2004 model (front and rear) and 2005-06 (rear) were modified from the Ram Heavy Duty truck for use in the Ram SRT-10. The standard ABS-equipped brakes were fitted with {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} rotors in front and {{convert|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Rotor (brake)|rotors]] out back. 2004 models used red-painted two-piston sliding brake [[Brake caliper|calipers]] front and rear; these were replaced with larger four-piston monoblock calipers up front in 2005\u201306, designed by TRW and unique to the SRT-10. Two [[NASCAR]]-inspired brake cooling ducts integrated into the front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] provide cooling for the Ram SRT-10's brakes.\n\n==Quad Cab==\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2005 Dodge RAM SRT-10 8.3 Front.jpg\n| image2 = 2005 Dodge RAM SRT-10 8.3 Side.jpg\n| image3 = 2005 Dodge RAM SRT-10 8.3 Rear.jpg\n| caption3 = Dodge RAM SRT-10 extended cab\n}}\nFollowing the success of the Ram SRT-10 regular cab, Dodge decided to introduce a Quad Cab version starting in the 2005 model year.  The new Quad Cab was aimed at the performance truck enthusiast who wanted a performance pickup, but not at the expense of room for passengers and towing capacity.  The Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab was fitted with a 4.56 final-drive gear ratio to improve low-end acceleration and was rated at {{convert|7500|lb|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} towing capacity. A body-color aluminum tonneau cover with an aerodynamic spoiler came standard on the Quad Cab. The Quad Cab was only offered with a 4-speed automatic transmission, a 48RE borrowed from the Ram Heavy Duty with the Cummins ISB turbo diesel. The 48RE was rated to handle up to {{convert|700|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} of torque.\n\n==Special editions==\nDodge released several limited editions of the Ram SRT-10 alongside the standard regular cab and Quad Cab versions.\n\n* VCA (Viper Club of America) Edition - 52 produced, released at the 2004 Daytona Motor Speedway Race in February. Where people were able to enter a raffle, and only the winners of the raffle were able to purchase the vehicle, but, of course the winners were able to sell them again to a third-party. Its paint scheme was white rally stripes on Electric Blue. Engine was also signed by Wolfgang Bernhard, [[Chrysler|Chrysler Group's]] former [[Chief Operating Officer]]. Available as a 2004 model.  50 of the VCA Edition trucks were manual transmission.  2 were converted to Automatic transmissions to be Pace Vehicles. The whereabouts of these two RAM SRT-10's is unknown and presumed decommissioned by FCA.\n* Yellow Fever - 500 produced was announced, final total produced 497, painted in Solar Yellow exterior paint and black \"fanged\" stripe on top of hood, came with two-tone interior which featured a yellow center stack bezel, yellow door spears, yellow stitching on steering wheel, seats and Regular Cab manual transmission shifter and yellow embroidering on the SRT-10 floor mats.

[[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein shock absorbers]], performance-tuned springs and unique aerodynamic aids were used to enhance the Ram SRT-10's higher-speed performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/112_0401_2004_dodge_ram_srt10/performance.html |title=2004 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Dimensions and Performance |publisher=Motor Trend |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>\nAn additional 5th shock was used on the rear axle to prevent wheel hop during wheel-spin.\n\n===Exterior===\nThe Ram SRT-10 had a unique hood that featured a wide power bulge and honeycomb grill hood scoop. The hood scoop allowed cool air to enter as well as forcing hot air to exit from the engine bay, thus helping the engine to run cooler. \"Viper Powered\" badges were added to the sides of the power bulge, to indicate the SRT-10 engine under the hood. Large chrome SRT-10 logos were mounted to the driver and passenger side doors and rear tailgate right side on the Quad cab and Single Cab 2005 models replaced in 2006 by smaller chrome and red SRT-10 logo badges . All models were outfitted with large molded kickerpanels painted to match body color. Another exterior feature was a [[tonneau cover]] with an attached [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] that was supposed to come standard on the 2005 Quad Cab version and all 2006 models, but due to manufacturing problems was not installed on nearly half of the Ram SRT-10s intended. To help remedy this situation, Dodge added a $1000 credit and a regular spoiler to the Ram SRT-10s that did not receive the tonneau cover. In addition to style, the spoiler also helped with air flow and provided a reduction in lift and drag. The Ram SRT-10 had a bed size of {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, giving the regular cab an overall length of {{convert|17|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|19|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} overall length for the Quad Cab.\n\n===Interior===\nThe Truck audio had 3 options of the Dodge Ram SRT-10 by 2006 and consisted of 8 [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] brand [[loudspeaker|speakers]] with a DVD based large color LCD map navigation system and a mid-tier CD turn by turn graphics CD-based system with small color LCD, and finally a standard LED Radio with CD player; all built and designed by Infinity audio and 10 inch woofer mounted in between the seats with silver bezel and 575 watts of total system output, Bluetooth by U-Connect for hands free communication through your car stereo as a factory option also full digital Satellite radio. The doors on both the Standard cab and Quad had silver accents along the middle above the arm rest. It also came with a leather trimmed [[steering wheel]] and with heavily bolstered racing-derived suede-trimmed charcoal leather seats. The center stack was adorned with silver trim, and a silver trim strip with the SRT-10 logo resided under the passenger-side [[air bag]] cover. Taking a cue from the Dodge Viper, the Ram SRT-10 came with a red start button on the dash. The manual transmission regular cab featured a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shift lever, which sprouted from a silver metal shift bezel and was fitted with a Viper shift knob. Aluminum performance-inspired pedals replaced the stock setup. The gauge cluster featured satin silver-faced gauges and Viper font and graphics. The [[speedometer]] and [[tachometer]] were re-calibrated to match the Ram SRT-10's increased performance.\n\n===Colors===\nExcluding the special editions, the 2004-2005 Ram SRT-10 came in three colors: Black Clear Coat, Bright Silver Metallic Clear Coat, and Flame Red Clear Coat. The redesigned 2006 Ram SRT-10 came in Mineral Gray Metallic, Inferno Red Crystal Pearl Coat, Brilliant Black Crystal Clear Coat, Flame Red Clear Coat and Black Clear Coat.\n\n===Wheels and brakes===\nThe stock {{convert|22|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheels were fitted with [[Pirelli]] Scorpion P305/40R-22 performance tires and modeled after the 10-spoke wheels available on the Viper. The brakes for the 2004 model (front and rear) and 2005-06 (rear) were modified from the Ram Heavy Duty truck for use in the Ram SRT-10. The standard ABS-equipped brakes were fitted with {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} rotors in front and {{convert|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Rotor (brake)|rotors]] out back. 2004 models used red-painted two-piston sliding brake [[Brake caliper|calipers]] front and rear; these were replaced with larger four-piston monoblock calipers up front in 2005\u201306, designed by TRW and unique to the SRT-10. Two [[NASCAR]]-inspired brake cooling ducts integrated into the front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] provide cooling for the Ram SRT-10's brakes.\n\n==Quad Cab==\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2005 Dodge RAM SRT-10 8.3 Front.jpg\n| image2 = 2005 Dodge RAM SRT-10 8.3 Side.jpg\n| image3 = 2005 Dodge RAM SRT-10 8.3 Rear.jpg\n| caption3 = Dodge RAM SRT-10 extended cab\n}}\nFollowing the success of the Ram SRT-10 regular cab, Dodge decided to introduce a Quad Cab version starting in the 2005 model year.  The new Quad Cab was aimed at the performance truck enthusiast who wanted a performance pickup, but not at the expense of room for passengers and towing capacity.  The Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab was fitted with a 4.56 final-drive gear ratio to improve low-end acceleration and was rated at {{convert|7500|lb|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} towing capacity. A body-color aluminum tonneau cover with an aerodynamic spoiler came standard on the Quad Cab. The Quad Cab was only offered with a 4-speed automatic transmission, a 48RE borrowed from the Ram Heavy Duty with the Cummins ISB turbo diesel. The 48RE was rated to handle up to {{convert|700|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} of torque.\n\n==Special editions==\nDodge released several limited editions of the Ram SRT-10 alongside the standard regular cab and Quad Cab versions.\n\n* VCA (Viper Club of America) Edition - 52 produced, released at the 2004 Daytona Motor Speedway Race in February. Where people were able to enter a raffle, and only the winners of the raffle were able to purchase the vehicle, but, of course the winners were able to sell them again to a third-party. Its paint scheme was white rally stripes on Electric Blue. Engine was also signed by Wolfgang Bernhard, [[Chrysler|Chrysler Group's]] former [[Chief Operating Officer]]. Available as a 2004 model.  50 of the VCA Edition trucks were manual transmission.  2 were converted to Automatic transmissions to be Pace Vehicles. The whereabouts of these two RAM SRT-10's is unknown and presumed decommissioned by FCA.\n* Yellow Fever - 500 produced was announced, final total produced 497, painted in Solar Yellow exterior paint and black \"fanged\" stripe on top of hood, came with two-tone interior which featured a yellow center stack bezel, yellow door spears, yellow stitching on steering wheel, seats and Regular Cab manual transmission shifter and yellow embroidering on the SRT-10 floor mats.

They are large cast-iron sculptures scattered throughout the city of Paris, France, mainly along the most-frequented sidewalks. They are named after the Englishman [[Richard Wallace (art collector)|Richard Wallace]], who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the [[Wallace Collection]] in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Paris went through difficult times. The city was quickly rebuilt, despite the ravages it had suffered. In less than ten years, it was transformed, with new buildings (the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], for example) and new boulevards (the [[Boulevard Raspail|Raspail]] and the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain|St-Germain]]). Additionally, [[philanthropy]] was in fashion among the wealthy ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', who financed numerous \"good works\" (such as the [[Red Cross]] and the [[Salvation Army]]) to uphold their image.\n\n==Sir Richard Wallace==\n[[File:Richard Wallace by Georges Lafosse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sir Richard Wallace caricatured as a Wallace fountain, by Georges Lafosse published in ''Le Trombinoscope'']]\nAmong these philanthropists, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace]] (1818\u20131890) was one of the most eclectic and reserved. Having inherited a large fortune from his father in August 1870, he decided that all Parisians should profit from it, which made him popular. Wallace's devotion led him to remain in his Parisian villa even as the city was besieged, rather than take refuge on one of his palatial estates, to be in Paris when he was needed.\n\nHe founded a hospital, where he personally welcomed victims of the bombings and distributed supplies, among his other efforts on behalf of Parisians at war. He remained faithful to his adopted nation, France, and is buried at [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\nOf his numerous contributions to Parisian heritage, the best known today are the fountains which bear his name.\n\n==Why fountains?==\nAs a result of the siege of Paris and the [[Paris Commune|Commune]] episode, many [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s had been destroyed, and the price of water, already higher than normal, increased considerably. Because of this, most of the poor had to pay for water. Moreover most of the water provided by vendors was drawn from the Seine river and was likely to be dirty, as run-off from streets and many of sewers drained into it. Hence it was safer to drink beer or other alcoholic beverages, and almost as cheap as water. The temptation to take to liquor was strong among the lower classes, and it was considered a moral duty to keep them from falling into [[alcoholism]].  Even today, when water and hygiene are not a problem for the majority of Parisians, these fountains are often the only sources of free water for the [[homeless]].\n\nThe poor are not the only beneficiaries of these installations. Even if the aim of the fountains was to allow people of modest means to have access to drinking water, they are not the only ones who use them. Anyone passing by may quench his thirst, fulfilling this vital need. There was already a programme of constructing [[temperance fountains]] in both the United States and in the United Kingdom.\n\nNot only did the fountains accomplish Wallace's philosophy of helping the needy, but they also beautified Paris.\n\n==Conception==\nRichard Wallace designed the fountains himself and intended them to be beautiful as well as useful. The fountains had to meet several strict guidelines:\n\n*Height: They had to be tall enough to be seen from afar but not so tall as to destroy the harmony of the surrounding landscape.\n*Form: Both practical to use and pleasing to the eye.\n*Price: Affordable enough to allow the installation of dozens.\n*Materials: Resistant to the elements, easy to shape, and simple to maintain.\n\nThe locations, as well as the color (a dark green, like all urban development of that era, in order to blend in with the parks and tree-lined avenues), were quickly chosen by the city government.\n\nWallace created two different models, which were followed by two additional models, thus there were four types of Wallace fountains varying in such properties as height and motif.  They were made of cast iron.  Inexpensive, easy to mold, and robust, it was one of the most popular materials of the age.  The majority of the cost was paid for by Wallace.  The city of Paris allocated 1,000 francs for the large model and 450 francs for the wall-mounted model.\n\nThe fountains are still molded by the historical foundry [[:fr:G.H.M_(G\u00e9n\u00e9rale_d'Hydraulique_et_de_M\u00e9canique)|G.H.M]] \n\n<br />\n\n==Sculptor==\nWishing that his project be completed as rapidly as possible, Wallace called on [[Charles-Auguste Lebourg]], a sculptor from [[Nantes]] whom he knew and whose talents were already renowned.  Lebourg improved Wallace's sketches, already studied and thought-provoking, to make the fountains true works of art.\n\nFor the large model, Lebourg created four caryatids representing [[kindness]], [[simplicity]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and [[sobriety]].  Each one is different from her sisters, by the way she bends her knees and where her tunic is tucked into her blouse.\n{{multiple image\n|align=center\n|image1=Cariatide Wallace 1.jpg|width1=145|caption1=\n|image2=Cariatide Wallace 2.jpg|width2=145|caption2=\n|image3=Cariatide Wallace 3.jpg|width3=145|caption3=\n|image4=Cariatide Wallace 4.jpg|width4=145|caption4=\n|footer='''The four caryatids'''|footer_align=center}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Different models==\nThe first two models (large model and applied model) were conceived and financed by Sir Richard Wallace.  The two other models were created following the success of their predecessors inspired by the same styles and the resemblance is obvious. The more recent designs are not as strongly steeped in Wallace's aesthetic ideals, that in true [[Renaissance]] style, they should be useful, beautiful, and symbolic, in addition to being real works of art.\n\n===Large model===\n(size: 2.71 m, 610&nbsp;kg)\n\nThe large model was conceived by Sir Richard Wallace, and was inspired by the ''[[Fontaine des Innocents]]''.  On a foundation of [[Hauteville-Lompnese|Hauteville stone]] rests an octagonal pedestal on which four [[caryatid]]s are affixed with their backs turned and their arms supporting a pointed [[dome]] decorated by [[dolphins]].\n\nThe water is distributed in a slender trickle issuing from the center of the dome and falls down into a basin that is protected by a grille. To make distribution easier, two tin-plated, iron cups attached to the fountain by a small chain were at the drinker's desire, staying always submerged for cleanliness.  These cups were removed in 1952 \"for Hygiene reasons\" by demand of the Council of Public Hygiene of the old Department of the Seine.\n\n''For more information, see the [http://membres.lycos.fr/savoy/fiche.html#fichet Technical File] (in French).''\n\n===Wall-mounted model===\n(size: 1.96 m, 300&nbsp;kg)\n\nSir Richard's other model.<ref>The French term 'Mod\u00e8le en applique' is similar to [[:fr:Applique murale]] meaning wall lamp or [[sconce (light fixture)|sconce]], as opposed to a free-standing model.</ref> In the middle of a semi-circular [[pediment]], the head of a naiad issues a trickle of water that falls into a basin resting between two [[pilasters]].  Two goblets allowed the water to be drunk, but they were retired under the 1952 law cited above.  This model, costing little to install, was to have been many units along the lengths of the walls of buildings with strong [[humanitarian]] focus, e.g. hospitals.  This was not the case, and they do not remain today except for one situated on rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.\n\n===Small model===\n(size: 1.32 m, 130&nbsp;kg)\n\nThese are simple pushbutton fountains that one can find in squares and public gardens and are marked with the Parisian Seal (although the one installed on the Place des [[Invalides]] lacks this seal).  They are familiar to mothers who bring their children to play in the many small parks in Paris.\n\nMeasuring only 4'-3\" and weighing 286&nbsp;lbs., they were commissioned by the [[mayor of Paris]] more frequently than its older sister models.\n\n===Colonnade model===\n(size: 2.50 m, a little more than 500&nbsp;kg)\n\nThis model was the last to be realized.  The general shape resembles that of the Large Model and the caryatids were replaced with small columns to reduce the cost of fabrication.  The dome was also less pointy and the lower part more curved.\n\nAlthough 30 of these were made, today there remain only two, one on rue de R\u00e9musat and the other on avenue des Ternes.\n\n{{multiple image\n|align=center\n|image1=Fontaine Wallace revisit\u00e9e.jpg|width1=140|caption1=<center>A large model painted red<br>at Avenue d'Ivry</center>\n|image2=Fontaine Wallace applique.jpg|width2=128|caption2=<center>The applied model</center>\n|image3=Font Wallace Pt Pasteur.jpg|width3=157|caption3=<center>The small model</center>\n|image4=Wallace \u00e0 colonnes rue R\u00e9musat.jpg|width4=140|caption4=<center>The colonnade model</center>\n|header='''The four models of Wallace fountains'''|header_align=center}}\n\n==Placement==\n[[File:Fontaine Wallace, Paris, 1911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|People drinking from a Wallace fountain during Bastille Day celebrations in 1911]]\nThe choice of the location of the fountains was left to the city of Paris.  They needed to be placed at the will of the public in a practical manner and integrated in the most harmonious fashion with the environment.  Most were placed in squares or at the intersections of two roads.  The responsibility for choosing such locatioins fell to Eugene Belgrand, a hydraulic engineer and Director of Water and Sewers of Paris who worked with the prefect [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]].\n\n==Today==\nMost of the 100 grand model Wallace fountains currently in Paris function and distribute perfectly potable water. Once, these fountains were rare points of free water in the city, much to the relief of the homeless and poor. Today, they are among more than 1,200 points of free, clean drinking water dispensed to citizens and visitors by the city water company, Eau de Paris.  Sir Richard Wallace has achieved his goal. \n\nThe fountains work from 15 March to 15 November (the risk of freezing during the months of winter would imperil the internal plumbing), are regularly maintained and are repainted every few years.\n\nThey are an integral part of the Parisian landscape, of the same importance as the [[Eiffel Tower]] or the street urchins of [[Montmartre]].  In ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'', the cinegraphic piece about the glory of Parisian folklore, [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] baptised a personality Madeleine Wallace (she cried like a madeleine, or like a Wallace fountain), although the English subtitled version renamed the character of Madeleine, to Madeleine Wells for cultural understanding.\n\nWallace Fountains have been a beloved part of the Paris streetscape for almost 150 years. These monuments have never suffered from public criticism. They have always been respected. However, only two Wallace Fountains, both located in Place Louis L\u00e9pine, are classified as registered historic monuments.<ref>http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&REQ=((PA00086269):REF)</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the Society of the Wallace Fountains (La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fontaines Wallace) was registered in France as an international, non-profit association governed by the French law of July 1901.  The Society\u2019s purpose is education and information. Its mission is to promote, preserve and protect the Wallace Fountains for future generation.  In addition, the Society recognizes and encourages partnerships for the common good in the spirit of Sir Richard Wallace.\n\n==Locations==\n\n===Paris===\n[[File:Rue Jean-Anouilh, fontaine Wallace 02.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|A large model at rue Jean-Anouilh]]\n\n====67 large model fountains====\n3rd ''[[arrondissement]]''\n\n* Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol, square Chautemps\n* Passage du Pont aux biches\n* Rue de la corderie, place Nathalie Lemel\n\n4th ''arrondissement''\n\n* [[Place Louis L\u00e9pine]], next to the Chambre de Commerce\n* [[Place Louis L\u00e9pine]], next to the H\u00f4tel-dieu\n* 7, Boulevard du Palais\n* 123, rue Saint-Antoine\n\n5th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Rue Poliveau, face rue de l'Essai\n* Place Maubert (fountain removed)\n* 37, [[rue de la B\u00fbcherie]]\n* Rue des Patriarches \n\n\n6th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\n* [[Place Saint-Sulpice]]\n* Pont Neuf, Quai des Grands Augustins\n* Rue Vavin, at rue Br\u00e9a\n* Place Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts\n\n[[File:Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet, fontaine Wallace 05.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|A large model at Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet]]\n\n8th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Rue de St-P\u00e9tersbourg, at rue de Turin\n* Av. des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Chevaux de Marly (north side)\n* Av. des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Chevaux de Marly (south side)\n\n9th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Gustave Toudouze\n* Place de Budapest\n\n10th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Juliette Dodu\n* Place Jacques Bonsergent\n* Place Robert Desnos\n\n11th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 143, rue de la Roquette\n* 197, Boulevard Voltaire\n* 44, rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud\n* 94, rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud\n* 1, [[Boulevard Richard Lenoir]]\n* 89, [[Boulevard Richard Lenoir]]\n\n12th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Cours de Vincennes, face Blvd de Picpus\n* Angle de St-Mand\u00e9, at rue du Rendez-vous\n* Rue Descot, face Mairie du XIIe arrondissement\n\n[[File:P1060475 Paris XX bd Menilmontant fontaine Wallace rwk.JPG|thumbnail|right|150px|A large model at boulevard Menilmontant]]\n\n13th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 82, avenue d'Italie\n* Rue de la Butte-aux-cailles, at rue de l'Esp\u00e9rance\n* ZAC Baudricourt, at avenue d'Ivry\n\n14th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Avenue Reille, at avenue Ren\u00e9 Coty\n* Place Jules H\u00e9naffe\n* Place Edgard quinet, at rue de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9\n* Place Denfert-Rochereau, at Blvd Raspail\n* [[Avenue du Maine]], face Mairie du XIV\u00e8 arrondissement\n\n15th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Henri Rollet\n* 2, boulevard Pasteur\n* Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Beuret\n* Place Charles Vallin\n\n16th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 10, boulevard Delessert\n* 194, avenue de Versailles\n* Place Jean Lorrain\n* Place de Passy\n* Place du P\u00e8re Marcellin Campagnat\n\n[[File:Paris 13e - Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A large model at Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet]]\n\n17th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 112, avenue de Villiers\n* Place Aim\u00e9 Maillard\n* 15, avenue Niel\n* 1, avenue de Wagram\n* 112, boulevard des Batignolles\n* Place de L\u00e9vis\n\n18th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Emile Goudeau\n* 42, boulevard Rochechouart\n* Rue Saint-Eleuth\u00e8re, at rue Aza\u00efs\n* Place des Abbesses\n* Rue de la Goutte d'or, at rue de Chartres\n\n19th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 214, boulevard de la Villette\n* 139, Rue Meaux at Rue du Rhin\n\n20th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place \u00c9dith Piaf\n* 6, rue Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand\n* 29, boulevard de M\u00e9nilmontant\n* Place Maurice Chevalier\n* Rue Piat, face au square\n\n====11 small model fountains====\n[[File:Font Wallace Pt Invalides.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|A small model at the Place des Invalides]]\n\n4th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Louis Lepine\n* Quai de la Corse\n\n7th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place des Invalides\n\n11th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 32, boulevard Richard Lenoir\n* 74, boulevard Richard Lenoir\n\n13th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Paul Verlaine\n\n15th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Alain Chartier\n* Place Saint Charles\n* 19, Place du Commerce\n* 35, boulevard Pasteur\n\n17th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 5, Place de L\u00e9vis\n\n====2 colonnaded fountains====\n16th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Rue de R\u00e9musat, at Rue de Mirabeau\n\n17th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Avenue des Ternes, at Place Pierre Demours\n\n====Wall-mounted model====\n5th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Intersection of [[:fr:Rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] and [[:fr:Rue Cuvier]]\n\n===Outside Paris===\n\n====[[Nantes]]====\nThe sculptor who created the fountains, Charles Auguste Lebourg, was originally from Nantes.

They are large cast-iron sculptures scattered throughout the city of Paris, France, mainly along the most-frequented sidewalks. They are named after the Englishman [[Richard Wallace (art collector)|Richard Wallace]], who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the [[Wallace Collection]] in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Paris went through difficult times. The city was quickly rebuilt, despite the ravages it had suffered. In less than ten years, it was transformed, with new buildings (the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], for example) and new boulevards (the [[Boulevard Raspail|Raspail]] and the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain|St-Germain]]). Additionally, [[philanthropy]] was in fashion among the wealthy ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', who financed numerous \"good works\" (such as the [[Red Cross]] and the [[Salvation Army]]) to uphold their image.\n\n==Sir Richard Wallace==\n[[File:Richard Wallace by Georges Lafosse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sir Richard Wallace caricatured as a Wallace fountain, by Georges Lafosse published in ''Le Trombinoscope'']]\nAmong these philanthropists, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace]] (1818\u20131890) was one of the most eclectic and reserved. Having inherited a large fortune from his father in August 1870, he decided that all Parisians should profit from it, which made him popular. Wallace's devotion led him to remain in his Parisian villa even as the city was besieged, rather than take refuge on one of his palatial estates, to be in Paris when he was needed.\n\nHe founded a hospital, where he personally welcomed victims of the bombings and distributed supplies, among his other efforts on behalf of Parisians at war. He remained faithful to his adopted nation, France, and is buried at [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\nOf his numerous contributions to Parisian heritage, the best known today are the fountains which bear his name.\n\n==Why fountains?==\nAs a result of the siege of Paris and the [[Paris Commune|Commune]] episode, many [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s had been destroyed, and the price of water, already higher than normal, increased considerably. Because of this, most of the poor had to pay for water. Moreover most of the water provided by vendors was drawn from the Seine river and was likely to be dirty, as run-off from streets and many of sewers drained into it. Hence it was safer to drink beer or other alcoholic beverages, and almost as cheap as water. The temptation to take to liquor was strong among the lower classes, and it was considered a moral duty to keep them from falling into [[alcoholism]].  Even today, when water and hygiene are not a problem for the majority of Parisians, these fountains are often the only sources of free water for the [[homeless]].\n\nThe poor are not the only beneficiaries of these installations. Even if the aim of the fountains was to allow people of modest means to have access to drinking water, they are not the only ones who use them. Anyone passing by may quench his thirst, fulfilling this vital need. There was already a programme of constructing [[temperance fountains]] in both the United States and in the United Kingdom.\n\nNot only did the fountains accomplish Wallace's philosophy of helping the needy, but they also beautified Paris.\n\n==Conception==\nRichard Wallace designed the fountains himself and intended them to be beautiful as well as useful. The fountains had to meet several strict guidelines:\n\n*Height: They had to be tall enough to be seen from afar but not so tall as to destroy the harmony of the surrounding landscape.\n*Form: Both practical to use and pleasing to the eye.\n*Price: Affordable enough to allow the installation of dozens.\n*Materials: Resistant to the elements, easy to shape, and simple to maintain.\n\nThe locations, as well as the color (a dark green, like all urban development of that era, in order to blend in with the parks and tree-lined avenues), were quickly chosen by the city government.\n\nWallace created two different models, which were followed by two additional models, thus there were four types of Wallace fountains varying in such properties as height and motif.  They were made of cast iron.  Inexpensive, easy to mold, and robust, it was one of the most popular materials of the age.  The majority of the cost was paid for by Wallace.  The city of Paris allocated 1,000 francs for the large model and 450 francs for the wall-mounted model.\n\nThe fountains are still molded by the historical foundry [[:fr:G.H.M_(G\u00e9n\u00e9rale_d'Hydraulique_et_de_M\u00e9canique)|G.H.M]] \n\n<br />\n\n==Sculptor==\nWishing that his project be completed as rapidly as possible, Wallace called on [[Charles-Auguste Lebourg]], a sculptor from [[Nantes]] whom he knew and whose talents were already renowned.  Lebourg improved Wallace's sketches, already studied and thought-provoking, to make the fountains true works of art.\n\nFor the large model, Lebourg created four caryatids representing [[kindness]], [[simplicity]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and [[sobriety]].  Each one is different from her sisters, by the way she bends her knees and where her tunic is tucked into her blouse.\n{{multiple image\n|align=center\n|image1=Cariatide Wallace 1.jpg|width1=145|caption1=\n|image2=Cariatide Wallace 2.jpg|width2=145|caption2=\n|image3=Cariatide Wallace 3.jpg|width3=145|caption3=\n|image4=Cariatide Wallace 4.jpg|width4=145|caption4=\n|footer='''The four caryatids'''|footer_align=center}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Different models==\nThe first two models (large model and applied model) were conceived and financed by Sir Richard Wallace.  The two other models were created following the success of their predecessors inspired by the same styles and the resemblance is obvious. The more recent designs are not as strongly steeped in Wallace's aesthetic ideals, that in true [[Renaissance]] style, they should be useful, beautiful, and symbolic, in addition to being real works of art.\n\n===Large model===\n(size: 2.71 m, 610&nbsp;kg)\n\nThe large model was conceived by Sir Richard Wallace, and was inspired by the ''[[Fontaine des Innocents]]''.  On a foundation of [[Hauteville-Lompnese|Hauteville stone]] rests an octagonal pedestal on which four [[caryatid]]s are affixed with their backs turned and their arms supporting a pointed [[dome]] decorated by [[dolphins]].\n\nThe water is distributed in a slender trickle issuing from the center of the dome and falls down into a basin that is protected by a grille. To make distribution easier, two tin-plated, iron cups attached to the fountain by a small chain were at the drinker's desire, staying always submerged for cleanliness.  These cups were removed in 1952 \"for Hygiene reasons\" by demand of the Council of Public Hygiene of the old Department of the Seine.\n\n''For more information, see the [http://membres.lycos.fr/savoy/fiche.html#fichet Technical File] (in French).''\n\n===Wall-mounted model===\n(size: 1.96 m, 300&nbsp;kg)\n\nSir Richard's other model.<ref>The French term 'Mod\u00e8le en applique' is similar to [[:fr:Applique murale]] meaning wall lamp or [[sconce (light fixture)|sconce]], as opposed to a free-standing model.</ref> In the middle of a semi-circular [[pediment]], the head of a naiad issues a trickle of water that falls into a basin resting between two [[pilasters]].  Two goblets allowed the water to be drunk, but they were retired under the 1952 law cited above.  This model, costing little to install, was to have been many units along the lengths of the walls of buildings with strong [[humanitarian]] focus, e.g. hospitals.  This was not the case, and they do not remain today except for one situated on rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.\n\n===Small model===\n(size: 1.32 m, 130&nbsp;kg)\n\nThese are simple pushbutton fountains that one can find in squares and public gardens and are marked with the Parisian Seal (although the one installed on the Place des [[Invalides]] lacks this seal).  They are familiar to mothers who bring their children to play in the many small parks in Paris.\n\nMeasuring only 4'-3\" and weighing 286&nbsp;lbs., they were commissioned by the [[mayor of Paris]] more frequently than its older sister models.\n\n===Colonnade model===\n(size: 2.50 m, a little more than 500&nbsp;kg)\n\nThis model was the last to be realized.  The general shape resembles that of the Large Model and the caryatids were replaced with small columns to reduce the cost of fabrication.  The dome was also less pointy and the lower part more curved.\n\nAlthough 30 of these were made, today there remain only two, one on rue de R\u00e9musat and the other on avenue des Ternes.\n\n{{multiple image\n|align=center\n|image1=Fontaine Wallace revisit\u00e9e.jpg|width1=140|caption1=<center>A large model painted red<br>at Avenue d'Ivry</center>\n|image2=Fontaine Wallace applique.jpg|width2=128|caption2=<center>The applied model</center>\n|image3=Font Wallace Pt Pasteur.jpg|width3=157|caption3=<center>The small model</center>\n|image4=Wallace \u00e0 colonnes rue R\u00e9musat.jpg|width4=140|caption4=<center>The colonnade model</center>\n|header='''The four models of Wallace fountains'''|header_align=center}}\n\n==Placement==\n[[File:Fontaine Wallace, Paris, 1911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|People drinking from a Wallace fountain during Bastille Day celebrations in 1911]]\nThe choice of the location of the fountains was left to the city of Paris.  They needed to be placed at the will of the public in a practical manner and integrated in the most harmonious fashion with the environment.  Most were placed in squares or at the intersections of two roads.  The responsibility for choosing such locatioins fell to Eugene Belgrand, a hydraulic engineer and Director of Water and Sewers of Paris who worked with the prefect [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]].\n\n==Today==\nMost of the 100 grand model Wallace fountains currently in Paris function and distribute perfectly potable water. Once, these fountains were rare points of free water in the city, much to the relief of the homeless and poor. Today, they are among more than 1,200 points of free, clean drinking water dispensed to citizens and visitors by the city water company, Eau de Paris.  Sir Richard Wallace has achieved his goal. \n\nThe fountains work from 15 March to 15 November (the risk of freezing during the months of winter would imperil the internal plumbing), are regularly maintained and are repainted every few years.\n\nThey are an integral part of the Parisian landscape, of the same importance as the [[Eiffel Tower]] or the street urchins of [[Montmartre]].  In ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'', the cinegraphic piece about the glory of Parisian folklore, [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] baptised a personality Madeleine Wallace (she cried like a madeleine, or like a Wallace fountain), although the English subtitled version renamed the character of Madeleine, to Madeleine Wells for cultural understanding.\n\nWallace Fountains have been a beloved part of the Paris streetscape for almost 150 years. These monuments have never suffered from public criticism. They have always been respected. However, only two Wallace Fountains, both located in Place Louis L\u00e9pine, are classified as registered historic monuments.<ref>http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&REQ=((PA00086269):REF)</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the Society of the Wallace Fountains (La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fontaines Wallace) was registered in France as an international, non-profit association governed by the French law of July 1901.  The Society\u2019s purpose is education and information. Its mission is to promote, preserve and protect the Wallace Fountains for future generation.  In addition, the Society recognizes and encourages partnerships for the common good in the spirit of Sir Richard Wallace.\n\n==Locations==\n\n===Paris===\n[[File:Rue Jean-Anouilh, fontaine Wallace 02.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|A large model at rue Jean-Anouilh]]\n\n====67 large model fountains====\n3rd ''[[arrondissement]]''\n\n* Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol, square Chautemps\n* Passage du Pont aux biches\n* Rue de la corderie, place Nathalie Lemel\n\n4th ''arrondissement''\n\n* [[Place Louis L\u00e9pine]], next to the Chambre de Commerce\n* [[Place Louis L\u00e9pine]], next to the H\u00f4tel-dieu\n* 7, Boulevard du Palais\n* 123, rue Saint-Antoine\n\n5th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Rue Poliveau, face rue de l'Essai\n* Place Maubert (fountain removed)\n* 37, [[rue de la B\u00fbcherie]]\n* Rue des Patriarches \n\n\n6th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\n* [[Place Saint-Sulpice]]\n* Pont Neuf, Quai des Grands Augustins\n* Rue Vavin, at rue Br\u00e9a\n* Place Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts\n\n[[File:Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet, fontaine Wallace 05.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|A large model at Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet]]\n\n8th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Rue de St-P\u00e9tersbourg, at rue de Turin\n* Av. des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Chevaux de Marly (north side)\n* Av. des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Chevaux de Marly (south side)\n\n9th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Gustave Toudouze\n* Place de Budapest\n\n10th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Juliette Dodu\n* Place Jacques Bonsergent\n* Place Robert Desnos\n\n11th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 143, rue de la Roquette\n* 197, Boulevard Voltaire\n* 44, rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud\n* 94, rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud\n* 1, [[Boulevard Richard Lenoir]]\n* 89, [[Boulevard Richard Lenoir]]\n\n12th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Cours de Vincennes, face Blvd de Picpus\n* Angle de St-Mand\u00e9, at rue du Rendez-vous\n* Rue Descot, face Mairie du XIIe arrondissement\n\n[[File:P1060475 Paris XX bd Menilmontant fontaine Wallace rwk.JPG|thumbnail|right|150px|A large model at boulevard Menilmontant]]\n\n13th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 82, avenue d'Italie\n* Rue de la Butte-aux-cailles, at rue de l'Esp\u00e9rance\n* ZAC Baudricourt, at avenue d'Ivry\n\n14th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Avenue Reille, at avenue Ren\u00e9 Coty\n* Place Jules H\u00e9naffe\n* Place Edgard quinet, at rue de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9\n* Place Denfert-Rochereau, at Blvd Raspail\n* [[Avenue du Maine]], face Mairie du XIV\u00e8 arrondissement\n\n15th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Henri Rollet\n* 2, boulevard Pasteur\n* Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Beuret\n* Place Charles Vallin\n\n16th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 10, boulevard Delessert\n* 194, avenue de Versailles\n* Place Jean Lorrain\n* Place de Passy\n* Place du P\u00e8re Marcellin Campagnat\n\n[[File:Paris 13e - Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A large model at Esplanade Pierre-Vidal-Naquet]]\n\n17th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 112, avenue de Villiers\n* Place Aim\u00e9 Maillard\n* 15, avenue Niel\n* 1, avenue de Wagram\n* 112, boulevard des Batignolles\n* Place de L\u00e9vis\n\n18th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Emile Goudeau\n* 42, boulevard Rochechouart\n* Rue Saint-Eleuth\u00e8re, at rue Aza\u00efs\n* Place des Abbesses\n* Rue de la Goutte d'or, at rue de Chartres\n\n19th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 214, boulevard de la Villette\n* 139, Rue Meaux at Rue du Rhin\n\n20th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place \u00c9dith Piaf\n* 6, rue Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand\n* 29, boulevard de M\u00e9nilmontant\n* Place Maurice Chevalier\n* Rue Piat, face au square\n\n====11 small model fountains====\n[[File:Font Wallace Pt Invalides.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|A small model at the Place des Invalides]]\n\n4th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Louis Lepine\n* Quai de la Corse\n\n7th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place des Invalides\n\n11th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 32, boulevard Richard Lenoir\n* 74, boulevard Richard Lenoir\n\n13th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Paul Verlaine\n\n15th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Place Alain Chartier\n* Place Saint Charles\n* 19, Place du Commerce\n* 35, boulevard Pasteur\n\n17th ''arrondissement''\n\n* 5, Place de L\u00e9vis\n\n====2 colonnaded fountains====\n16th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Rue de R\u00e9musat, at Rue de Mirabeau\n\n17th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Avenue des Ternes, at Place Pierre Demours\n\n====Wall-mounted model====\n5th ''arrondissement''\n\n* Intersection of [[:fr:Rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] and [[:fr:Rue Cuvier]]\n\n===Outside Paris===\n\n====[[Nantes]]====\nThe sculptor who created the fountains, Charles Auguste Lebourg, was originally from Nantes.

Through pressure tactics, threats of legal action, and other ways, she would dupe or coerce birth parents, mostly poor single mothers, to turn the children over to her custody, often under false pretenses. Alma Simple, one of Tann's victims, described her as \"a stern-looking woman with close-cropped grey hair, round wireless glasses and an air of utter authority.\"{{sfn|Bisantz Raymond|2007|p=vii}} Tann also arranged for the taking of children born to inmates at Tennessee mental institutions and those born to wards of the state through her connections. To meet demand, she resorted to [[kidnapping]]s. \n\nIn some cases, single parents would drop their children off at [[nursery school]]s, only to be told that welfare agents had taken the children. In others, children would be temporarily placed in an orphanage because a family was experiencing illness or [[unemployment]], only to find out later that the orphanage had adopted them out or had no record of the children ever being placed. Tann was also documented as taking children born to unwed mothers at birth, claiming that the newborns required medical care.

However, in a letter drafted in 1947, Tann's attorney, Abe Waldauer, said that the prospective adoptive couple had \"complete custody and control of a child for one year; may submit the child to any physical or mental examination they wish and take any steps they may desire to ascertain they have a healthy and normal child.

Kelley also severed custody of divorced mothers, placing the children with Tann, who then arranged for adoption of the children into \"homes better able to provide for the children's care.\" However, many of the children were placed into homes where they were used as [[child labor]] on farms, or with abusive families.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} \n\nBypassing Shelby County Probate Court, most of the adoption cases were handled in the counties of [[Dyer County, Tennessee|Dyer]], [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood]], and [[Hardeman County, Tennessee|Hardeman]].<ref name=Austin/> Tann also had connections with former Memphis, Tennessee, mayor [[E.

Through pressure tactics, threats of legal action, and other ways, she would dupe or coerce birth parents, mostly poor single mothers, to turn the children over to her custody, often under false pretenses. Alma Simple, one of Tann's victims, described her as \"a stern-looking woman with close-cropped grey hair, round wireless glasses and an air of utter authority.\"{{sfn|Bisantz Raymond|2007|p=vii}} Tann also arranged for the taking of children born to inmates at Tennessee mental institutions and those born to wards of the state through her connections. To meet demand, she resorted to [[kidnapping]]s. \n\nIn some cases, single parents would drop their children off at [[nursery school]]s, only to be told that welfare agents had taken the children. In others, children would be temporarily placed in an orphanage because a family was experiencing illness or [[unemployment]], only to find out later that the orphanage had adopted them out or had no record of the children ever being placed. Tann was also documented as taking children born to unwed mothers at birth, claiming that the newborns required medical care.

However, in a letter drafted in 1947, Tann's attorney, Abe Waldauer, said that the prospective adoptive couple had \"complete custody and control of a child for one year; may submit the child to any physical or mental examination they wish and take any steps they may desire to ascertain they have a healthy and normal child. If it is not, the Tennessee Children's Home takes it back without question.\"{{sfn|Blade|2012|p=136}}\n\nTann's crimes were accomplished with the aid of Memphis Family Court Judge [[Camille Kelley]], who used her position of authority to sanction Tann's tactics and activities. Tann would identify children as being from homes which could not provide for their care, and Kelley would push the matter through her dockets. Kelley also severed custody of divorced mothers, placing the children with Tann, who then arranged for adoption of the children into \"homes better able to provide for the children's care.\" However, many of the children were placed into homes where they were used as [[child labor]] on farms, or with abusive families.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} \n\nBypassing Shelby County Probate Court, most of the adoption cases were handled in the counties of [[Dyer County, Tennessee|Dyer]], [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood]], and [[Hardeman County, Tennessee|Hardeman]].<ref name=Austin/> Tann also had connections with former Memphis, Tennessee, mayor [[E.

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}</ref> Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy. The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

In Amy's speech, she encourages young girls around the world to study whatever they want.

After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5\u00bc-inch [[floppy disk]]).

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship.

There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

In [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|the series finale]], both Sheldon and Amy are recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for their discovery of super asymmetry which they first worked on moments before their wedding. In Amy's speech, she encourages young girls around the world to study whatever they want. Instead of giving a self-centered speech, Sheldon [[The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_12)#speech|thanks]] his family, his friends and his wife Amy for always supporting him.\n\nHe once idolized fictional prodigy [[Wesley Crusher]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5\u00bc-inch [[floppy disk]]). Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers [[Barry Kripke]] and [[Leslie Winkle]]. Later, Wheaton managed to patch things up with Sheldon, only to inadvertently pass the enemy list spot to [[Brent Spiner]].<ref name=S05E05>{{cite episode|title=The Russian Rocket Reaction|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep5|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 13, 2011|season=5|number=5|minutes=}}</ref> Sheldon would later resume his enmity with Wheaton in season 11's \"The Proton Regeneration\" when they compete for the lead role in an Internet reboot of Sheldon's childhood favorite science TV series, ''Professor Proton'', and Wheaton gets the part; however, when he sees how well Wheaton plays the role and on the advice of Howard, he apologizes to him.\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n=== General ===\n[[File:\u0414\u0432\u0443\u0445\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442.jpg|thumb|Sheldon Cooper doing the [[Vulcan salute]], stencil graffiti on a wall in [[Volgograd]], [[Russia]]]]\nBoth the character and Parsons' portrayal have received widespread acclaim, and is often cited as the main reason for the program's success by critics and fans alike.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/the_tab/the_buzz-39481582.html|title=The buzz: Jim Parsons as Sheldon|last=Oswald|first=Brad|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=January 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313081930/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/the_tab/the_buzz-39481582.html|archivedate=March 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Entertainment/Television/article/575764|title=Nerd herd doing a bang-up job|last=Salem|first=Rob|date=January 24, 2009|work=The Toronto Star|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/02/08/gentle_twists_on_reliable_formulas_keep_viewers_hooked/|title=Gentle twists on reliable formulas keep viewers hooked|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|date=February 8, 2009|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: \"It's hard to imagine what ''The Big Bang Theory'' would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great portrayal of Sheldon Cooper\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/946/946275p1.html|title=\"The Friendship Algorithm\" Review|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' stated that \"there's a spark of divine inspiration in Jim Parsons' uproarious Sheldon Cooper\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/matt-roush-daily-review/what-a-year-3521.html|title=What a Year!|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218155304/http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/matt-roush-daily-review/what-a-year-3521.html|archivedate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that: \"Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic\".<ref name=\"EW2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20237937,00.html|title=The Big Bang Theory|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 2009, Parsons was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/2009ptemmys/61stemmys_noms.php|title=61st Primetime Emmy\u00ae Awards &#124; Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|publisher=Cdn.emmys.tv|date=July 19, 2012|accessdate=July 27, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106152818/http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/2009ptemmys/61stemmys_nomswin_pt.php?action=search_db#1|archivedate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> He was nominated again for the same award on July 8, 2010, and eventually won the award on August 29, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf|title=Complete Emmy listings|accessdate=July 8, 2010|publisher=Emmy Award|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215131620/http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf|archive-date=December 15, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On August 1, 2009, he won the [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy]], with the show itself winning the award for [[TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy|Outstanding Achievement in Comedy]] for season 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/08/tca-awards-television-critics-association-news-.html|title=TCA Awards hail 'True Blood' and (finally) 'Battlestar Galactica'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> He was nominated again for the same award in 2010 and 2012.

{"title_page": "Soda fountain", "text_new": "{{hatnote|This article is about a type of drink dispenser. For the dining establishments sometimes called soda fountains, see [[Lunch counter]], [[Soda shop]], and [[Ice cream parlor]].}}\n[[Image:Soda fountain in China 01.jpg|thumb|A [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] soda fountain in [[Hainan, China]], April 2010.]]\nA '''soda fountain''' is a device that dispenses [[carbonated]] [[soft drinks]], called '''fountain drinks'''. They can be found in [[restaurant]]s, [[concession stand]]s and other locations such as [[convenience store]]s. The device combines [[flavored syrup]] or syrup [[concentrate]] and [[carbon dioxide]] with chilled and [[purified water]] to make soft drinks, either manually, or in a [[vending machine]] which is essentially an automated soda fountain that is operated using a [[soda gun]]. Today, the syrup often is pumped from a special container called a [[bag-in-box]] (BiB).\n\nFountain coke is an often confused term normally referring to a handheld dispenser behind a bar or counter that are used in many countries, including Spain, France and the United Kingdom. The term \u2018fountain\u2019 helps differentiate from, \u2018machine\u2019 cola as the fountain more easily controlled and offers more flavours.\n\nA soda fountain is also referred to as a [[postmix]] machine in some markets. Any [[List of brand name soft drinks products|brand of soft drink]] that is available as postmix syrup may be dispensed by a fountain.\n\nThe term may also refer to a small eating establishment or lunch counter, common from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, often inside a [[drugstore]] or other business, where a [[soda jerk]] served [[carbonated water|carbonated]] beverages, [[ice cream]], and sometimes light meals. The soda jerk's fountain generally dispensed only unflavored carbonated water, to which various syrups were added by hand.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Soda jerk NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|A \"[[soda jerk]]\" serving an [[ice cream soda]].

Many civilizations believed that drinking, and bathing, in these mineral waters cured diseases. Large industries often sprang up around hot springs, such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in England (CE 43) or the many [[onsen]] of Japan. \n\nAlthough vessels to bottle and transport water were part of the earliest human civilizations,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rong|first1=Xu Gan|last2=Fa|first2=Bao Tong|title=Primitive-Aged Drinking Vessels|url=http://www.sytu.edu.cn/zhgjiu/u7-2.htm|website=Grandiose Survey of Chinese Alcoholic Drinks and Beverages|publisher=Jiangnan University|accessdate=17 October 2013|ref=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120230718/http://www.sytu.edu.cn/zhgjiu/u7-2.htm|archive-date=20 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  bottling water began in the United Kingdom with the first water bottling at the [[Holy Well, Malvern|Holy Well]] in 1621.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Malvern Conservation Area: Appraisal and Management Strategy|url=http://www.malvernhills.gov.uk/documents/10558/125552/mhc-planning-dpc-gtmalvernfinalapril08.pdf/8899084b-7fec-4d4b-9d40-18dae5db81f8|website=Malvern Hills District Council: Planning Services|publisher=April 2008|accessdate=22 July 2014|ref=2|page=5}}</ref> The demand for bottled water was fueled in large part by the resurgence in [[Spa|spa-going]] and [[Water cure (therapy)|water therapy]] among Europeans and American colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last1=Back|first1=William|last2=Landa|first2=Edward|last3=Meeks|first3=Lisa|title=Bottled Water, Spas, and Early Years of Water Chemistry|date=1995|page=606|edition=Groundwater Volume 33, Issue 4|ref=3}}</ref> The first commercially distributed water in America was bottled and sold by Jackson's Spa in Boston in 1767.<ref name=\"greatlakeslaw.org\">{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Noah|title=A Brief History of Bottled Water in America|url=http://www.greatlakeslaw.org/blog/2009/03/a-brief-history-of-bottled-water-in-america.html|website=Great Lakes Law|accessdate=17 October 2013|ref=4}}</ref>  Early drinkers of bottled spa waters believed that the water at these [[mineral spring]]s had therapeutic properties, and that bathing in, or drinking, the water could help treat many common ailments.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Many types of [[mineral water]] are [[Carbonated water|sparkling]], and thus so were they when bottled.\n\nEarly scientists tried to create effervescent waters with curative powers, including [[Robert Boyle]], [[Friedrich Hoffmann]], [[Jean Baptiste van Helmont]], William Brownrigg, [[Antoine Laurent Lavoisier]], and [[David Macbride]]. In the early 1770s, Swedish chemist [[Torbern Bergman]], and (separately) English scientist [[Joseph Priestley]] invented equipment for saturating water with carbon dioxide. In 1774 John Mervin Nooth demonstrated an apparatus that improved upon Priestley's design. In 1807 Henry Thompson received the first British patent for a method of impregnating water with carbon dioxide. This was commonly called [[soda water]], although it contained no [[sodium bicarbonate]]).{{sfn|Funderburg|2002|pp=5-8}}\n\nThe soda fountain began in Europe, but achieved its greatest success in the U.S. [[Benjamin Silliman]], a Yale chemistry professor, was among the first to introduce soda water to America. In 1806 Silliman purchased a Nooth apparatus and began selling mineral waters in New Haven, Connecticut. Sales were brisk, so he built a bigger apparatus, opened a pump room, and took in three partners. This partnership opened soda fountains in [[New York City]] and [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. At roughly the same time, other businessmen opened fountains in New York City and [[Philadelphia]]. Although Silliman's business eventually failed, he played an important role in popularizing soda water.{{sfn|Funderburg|2002|pp=10-17}}\n\nIn 1832 [[John Matthews (soda water manufacturer)|John Matthews]] of New York City and John Lippincott of Philadelphia began manufacturing soda fountains. Both added innovations that improved soda-fountain equipment, and the industry expanded as retail outlets installed newer, better fountains. Other pioneering manufacturers were Alvin Puffer, Andrew Morse, Gustavus Dows, and James Tufts. In 1891 the four largest manufacturers\u2014Tufts, Puffer, Lippincott, and Matthews\u2014formed the American Soda Fountain Company, which was a trust designed to monopolize the industry. The four manufacturers continued to produce and market fountains under their company names. The trust controlled prices and forced some smaller manufacturers out of business.{{sfn|Funderburg|2002|pp=21-29}}\n\nBefore mechanical refrigeration, soda fountains used ice to cool drinks and ice cream. Ice harvesters cut ice from frozen lakes and ponds in the winter and stored the blocks in [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]] for use in the summer. In the early 20th century, new companies entered the soda fountain business, marketing \"iceless\" fountains that used [[brine]].\n\n[[File:BramwellSodaJerk.jpg|thumb|left|A \"[[soda jerk]]\" serving an [[ice cream soda]] in a century-old diner in Bramwell, WV (2013)]]\nThe L.A. Becker Company, the Liquid Carbonic Company, and the Bishop & Babcock Company dominated the iceless fountain business. In 1888 Jacob Baur of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] founded the Liquid Carbonics Manufacturing Company in Chicago, becoming the Midwest's first manufacturer of liquefied carbon dioxide. In 1903 Liquid Carbonic began market-testing its prototype iceless fountain in a Chicago confectionery. Louis A. Becker was a salesman who started his own manufacturing business in 1898, making the 20th-Century Sanitary Soda Fountain. In 1904 Becker's company produced its first iceless fountain. In 1908 William H. Wallace obtained a patent for an iceless fountain and installed his prototype in an Indianapolis drugstore. He sold his patent to Marietta Manufacturing Company, which was absorbed by Bishop & Babcock of Cleveland.\n\n[[File:Nizhny-Novgorod-Soda-Fountains-0535.jpg|thumb|Two rare Soviet-style vending machine soda fountains, [[Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhny Novgorod, Russia]], August 2007.]]\nLiquid Carbonic spawned another leading soda fountain manufacturer, the Bastian-Blessing Company. Two Liquid Carbonic employees, Charles Bastian and Lewis Blessing, started their company in 1908. The newer manufacturers competed with the American Soda Fountain Company and took a large share of the market. The trust was broken up, and its member companies struggled to stay in business. During World War I, some manufacturers marketed \"50% fountains,\" which used a combination of ice and mechanical refrigeration.

They can be found in [[restaurant]]s, [[concession stand]]s and other locations such as [[convenience store]]s. The device combines [[flavored syrup]] or syrup [[concentrate]] and [[carbon dioxide]] with chilled and [[purified water]] to make soft drinks, either manually, or in a [[vending machine]] which is essentially an automated soda fountain that is operated using a [[soda gun]]. Today, the syrup often is pumped from a special container called a [[bag-in-box]] (BiB).\n\nFountain coke is an often confused term normally referring to a handheld dispenser behind a bar or counter that are used in many countries, including Spain, France and the United Kingdom. The term \u2018fountain\u2019 helps differentiate from, \u2018machine\u2019 cola as the fountain more easily controlled and offers more flavours.\n\nA soda fountain is also referred to as a [[postmix]] machine in some markets. Any [[List of brand name soft drinks products|brand of soft drink]] that is available as postmix syrup may be dispensed by a fountain.\n\nThe term may also refer to a small eating establishment or lunch counter, common from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, often inside a [[drugstore]] or other business, where a [[soda jerk]] served [[carbonated water|carbonated]] beverages, [[ice cream]], and sometimes light meals. The soda jerk's fountain generally dispensed only unflavored carbonated water, to which various syrups were added by hand.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Soda jerk NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|A \"[[soda jerk]]\" serving an [[ice cream soda]].

Many civilizations believed that drinking, and bathing, in these mineral waters cured diseases. Large industries often sprang up around hot springs, such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in England (CE 43) or the many [[onsen]] of Japan. \n\nAlthough vessels to bottle and transport water were part of the earliest human civilizations,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rong|first1=Xu Gan|last2=Fa|first2=Bao Tong|title=Primitive-Aged Drinking Vessels|url=http://www.sytu.edu.cn/zhgjiu/u7-2.htm|website=Grandiose Survey of Chinese Alcoholic Drinks and Beverages|publisher=Jiangnan University|accessdate=17 October 2013|ref=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120230718/http://www.sytu.edu.cn/zhgjiu/u7-2.htm|archive-date=20 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  bottling water began in the United Kingdom with the first water bottling at the [[Holy Well, Malvern|Holy Well]] in 1621.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Malvern Conservation Area: Appraisal and Management Strategy|url=http://www.malvernhills.gov.uk/documents/10558/125552/mhc-planning-dpc-gtmalvernfinalapril08.pdf/8899084b-7fec-4d4b-9d40-18dae5db81f8|website=Malvern Hills District Council: Planning Services|publisher=April 2008|accessdate=22 July 2014|ref=2|page=5}}</ref> The demand for bottled water was fueled in large part by the resurgence in [[Spa|spa-going]] and [[Water cure (therapy)|water therapy]] among Europeans and American colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last1=Back|first1=William|last2=Landa|first2=Edward|last3=Meeks|first3=Lisa|title=Bottled Water, Spas, and Early Years of Water Chemistry|date=1995|page=606|edition=Groundwater Volume 33, Issue 4|ref=3}}</ref> The first commercially distributed water in America was bottled and sold by Jackson's Spa in Boston in 1767.<ref name=\"greatlakeslaw.org\">{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Noah|title=A Brief History of Bottled Water in America|url=http://www.greatlakeslaw.org/blog/2009/03/a-brief-history-of-bottled-water-in-america.html|website=Great Lakes Law|accessdate=17 October 2013|ref=4}}</ref>  Early drinkers of bottled spa waters believed that the water at these [[mineral spring]]s had therapeutic properties, and that bathing in, or drinking, the water could help treat many common ailments.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Many types of [[mineral water]] are [[Carbonated water|sparkling]], and thus so were they when bottled.\n\nEarly scientists tried to create effervescent waters with curative powers, including [[Robert Boyle]], [[Friedrich Hoffmann]], [[Jean Baptiste van Helmont]], William Brownrigg, [[Antoine Laurent Lavoisier]], and [[David Macbride]]. In the early 1770s, Swedish chemist [[Torbern Bergman]], and (seperately) English scientist [[Joseph Priestley]] invented equipment for saturating water with carbon dioxide. In 1774 John Mervin Nooth demonstrated an apparatus that improved upon Priestley's design. In 1807 Henry Thompson received the first British patent for a method of impregnating water with carbon dioxide. This was commonly called [[soda water]], although it contained no [[sodium bicarbonate]]).{{sfn|Funderburg|2002|pp=5-8}}\n\nThe soda fountain began in Europe, but achieved its greatest success in the U.S. [[Benjamin Silliman]], a Yale chemistry professor, was among the first to introduce soda water to America. In 1806 Silliman purchased a Nooth apparatus and began selling mineral waters in New Haven, Connecticut. Sales were brisk, so he built a bigger apparatus, opened a pump room, and took in three partners. This partnership opened soda fountains in [[New York City]] and [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. At roughly the same time, other businessmen opened fountains in New York City and [[Philadelphia]]. Although Silliman's business eventually failed, he played an important role in popularizing soda water.{{sfn|Funderburg|2002|pp=10-17}}\n\nIn 1832 [[John Matthews (soda water manufacturer)|John Matthews]] of New York City and John Lippincott of Philadelphia began manufacturing soda fountains. Both added innovations that improved soda-fountain equipment, and the industry expanded as retail outlets installed newer, better fountains. Other pioneering manufacturers were Alvin Puffer, Andrew Morse, Gustavus Dows, and James Tufts. In 1891 the four largest manufacturers\u2014Tufts, Puffer, Lippincott, and Matthews\u2014formed the American Soda Fountain Company, which was a trust designed to monopolize the industry. The four manufacturers continued to produce and market fountains under their company names. The trust controlled prices and forced some smaller manufacturers out of business.{{sfn|Funderburg|2002|pp=21-29}}\n\nBefore mechanical refrigeration, soda fountains used ice to cool drinks and ice cream. Ice harvesters cut ice from frozen lakes and ponds in the winter and stored the blocks in [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]] for use in the summer. In the early 20th century, new companies entered the soda fountain business, marketing \"iceless\" fountains that used [[brine]].\n\n[[File:BramwellSodaJerk.jpg|thumb|left|A \"[[soda jerk]]\" serving an [[ice cream soda]] in a century-old diner in Bramwell, WV (2013)]]\nThe L.A. Becker Company, the Liquid Carbonic Company, and the Bishop & Babcock Company dominated the iceless fountain business. In 1888 Jacob Baur of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] founded the Liquid Carbonics Manufacturing Company in Chicago, becoming the Midwest's first manufacturer of liquefied carbon dioxide. In 1903 Liquid Carbonic began market-testing its prototype iceless fountain in a Chicago confectionery. Louis A. Becker was a salesman who started his own manufacturing business in 1898, making the 20th-Century Sanitary Soda Fountain. In 1904 Becker's company produced its first iceless fountain. In 1908 William H. Wallace obtained a patent for an iceless fountain and installed his prototype in an Indianapolis drugstore. He sold his patent to Marietta Manufacturing Company, which was absorbed by Bishop & Babcock of Cleveland.\n\n[[File:Nizhny-Novgorod-Soda-Fountains-0535.jpg|thumb|Two rare Soviet-style vending machine soda fountains, [[Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhny Novgorod, Russia]], August 2007.]]\nLiquid Carbonic spawned another leading soda fountain manufacturer, the Bastian-Blessing Company. Two Liquid Carbonic employees, Charles Bastian and Lewis Blessing, started their company in 1908. The newer manufacturers competed with the American Soda Fountain Company and took a large share of the market. The trust was broken up, and its member companies struggled to stay in business. During World War I, some manufacturers marketed \"50% fountains,\" which used a combination of ice and mechanical refrigeration. In the early 1920s, many retail outlets purchased soda fountains using ammonia refrigeration.{{sfn|Funderburg|2002|pp=114-125}}\n\n[[File:Packaging for fountain soda syrups in a restaurant in Virginia.jpg|thumb|Flavored syrups packaged for insertion into a contemporary soda fountain]]\nIn their heyday, soda fountains flourished in [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]], [[ice cream parlors]], candy stores, [[dime store]]s, [[department stores]], [[milk bar]]s and [[train stations]].
