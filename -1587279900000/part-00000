{"title_page": "Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2011}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2011}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau de l'\u00c9tat-major g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''' (\"Second Bureau of the General Staff\") was France's external [[military intelligence|military]] [[intelligence agency]] from 1871 to 1940. It was dissolved together with the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] upon the armistice with Germany. However the term \"'''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau'''\" ({{IPA-fr|d\u00f8zj\u025bm by\u0281o|lang}}), like \"[[MI5]]\" or \"[[SMERSH]]\", outlived the original organization as a general label for the country's intelligence service.\n\nFrench military intelligence was composed of two separate bureaus prior to World War II. The [[Premier Bureau]] was charged with informing the high command about the state of French, allied and friendly troops, while the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau developed intelligence concerning enemy troops. The Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau was celebrated for its [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalytical]] work, but it was criticized for its involvement in the [[Dreyfus Affair]] and its consistent overestimation of German military formations prior to World War II.\n\nIts final director was [[Colonel]] Louis Rivet.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nOn June 8, 1871, the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of War]] authorized the creation of a service charged with performing \"research on enemy plans and operations\".<ref>[http://www.aassdn.org/hsvEXhis01.html Anciens des Services Sp\u00e9ciaux de la D\u00e9fense Nationale] (France)</ref>\n\nIn 1872, the Ministry authorized the creation of a military [[counter-espionage]] service.\n\nIn 1876, a ''Statistiques et de reconnaissances militaires'' (\"Military Statistics and Recognition\") section was added to the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau.\n\nIn 1886, a law was passed penalizing espionage activity (another would be passed in 1934).\n\nIn October 1894 the Dreyfus Affair occurred and proved so politically divisive that, in May 1899, the government shifted responsibility for counter-espionage to the [[Ministry of the Interior]]. A small intelligence section remained within the General Staff, but the Service de surveillance du territoire (''Territorial Surveillance Service'', SST), an agency of the [[National Police (France)|S\u00fbret\u00e9]] g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, became responsible for the pursuit of foreign spies on French soil. Counter-espionage was to be handled by special [[S\u00fbret\u00e9]] police chiefs. The Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau's statistical section remained in operation until 1 September 1899, when it was disbanded.\n\nThe name (literally, Second Desk) refers to the organization of the French general staff in four desks: 1st for personnel, 2nd for intelligence, 3rd for operations, 4th for logistics. This numerical designation survives in the first four staff numbers of the [[Staff_(military)#Continental_Staff_System|continental staff system]] practiced by most NATO armies: S1 for personnel, S2 for intelligence, S3 for operations, S4 for logistics. (See also the French version of this page.)\n===1900s\u20131920===\nIn 1906 [[Georges Clemenceau]] became [[French government ministers|Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil]]. With complete control of [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Ministry]] funding, he created special counter-espionage units, the \"brigades du Tigre\", a reference to Clemenceau's nickname. Commanded by [[police commissioner]] [[C\u00e9lestin Hennion]], the mobile brigades were to handle special operations of the [[Direction Centrale de la Police Judiciaire|judicial police]] related to counter-espionage.\n\nIn February 1907, the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau was reactivated and was reassigned some of the  contre-espionnage responsibilities it had had prior to the Dreyfus affair. Commanded by General [[Charles-Joseph Dupont]], the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau worked with the Interior Ministry, and especially Commissioner Hennion's mobile counter-espionage brigades, which worked closely with France's [[border guard|border patrols]].\n\nIn August 1911, the oversight of counter-espionage activities was assigned to the administration of the judiciary police that supervised the mobile brigades. In 1913, the government officially assigned counter-espionage operations on foreign soil to the Ministry of War, with the Ministry of the Interior being responsible for border security and prosecution.\n\nIn May 1915, the ''Section de Centralisation du Renseignement'' (\"Central Intelligence Section\", SCR) was created and assigned to Commandant Ladoux.It was attached to the 2\u00e8me Bureau, which also administered the operations of the Bureaux centraux de renseignement (BCR). Altogether the organization was known as the 5\u00e8me Bureau. The SCR was attached to the ''Section de renseignements'' (''Intelligence Section'', SR) in April 1917.\n\nIn February 1917, the Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil put a commissioner of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nationale in charge of the criminal police, general intelligence, and counter-espionage. His command included a filing and archiving section, a section devoted to [[propaganda]] (''propagande r\u00e9volutionnaire'', PR) and the SR and SCR. The SR provided a clearinghouse for centralized intelligence-gathering while the SCR was a small team of specialized counter-intelligence officers reporting to the Ministry of War, while a team of police officers were in charge of the arrest of suspects and judicial enquiries.\n\n===1930s===\nIn April 1934, the [[Surete|''Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00fbret\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale'']] was changed to the ''Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00fbret\u00e9 nationale'', with a post of Controller-General in command of Counter-Intelligence. In March 1935, the position was given authority over the territorial police, the ''Police de l\u2019Air'', the TSF and the police [[Homing pigeon|carrier pigeon service]].\n\nIn June 1936, Colonel Louis Rivet succeeded Colonel Roux as head of the intelligence service and of a new organization, the ''Service de centralisation des renseignements'' (\"Central Intelligence Service\", SCR).  The SCR, headquartered at 2 bis avenue de Tourville, Paris, was run by [[Commandant]] Guy Schlesser.\n\nIn March 1937, the government decreed that territorial surveillance was the responsibility of the police alone, to be executed by strictly legal means. A new organization, the ''Bureau central de Renseignements'' (\"Central Intelligence Bureau\", BCR) was established the same month and a special section devoted to \"preventative  defence\" was created within the SCR.\n\nIn July 1939, at the prompting of military intelligence, a counter-intelligence charter was established and the National Council amended the [[penal code]] (article 75 and following) to integrate all 1810, 1886, and 1934 counter-intelligence laws.\n\n==Directors==\n* Colonel [[Jean Sandherr]], between 1886 and 1895\n* [[Georges Picquart]], between 1895 and 1896\n* [[Hubert-Joseph Henry]], from 1897 to 1898\n* Colonel [[Charles Dupont]] from 1911 to 1918\n* Colonel [[Maurice-Henri Gauch\u00e9]], from 1937 to 1940\n* Colonel Louis Rivet, 1940\n\n==20th century operations and agents==\nThe Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau developed a reputation as Europe's top cryptoanalytical service in the early 20th century. It scored a notable success at the outbreak of World War I when it cracked the German diplomatic cryptographic system. The French cryptoanalysts were able to decipher the lengthy telegram containing the German declaration of war before the German Ambassador in Paris could decipher it.\n\nIn June 1918, Captain [[Georges Painvin]], a DB cryptoanalyst, was able to crack part of the Germans' ADFGVX [[cipher]].\n\nThese intercepts allowed an effective response to the movements of the German Army's 15 division-strong advances under [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at [[Montdidier, Somme|Montdidier]] and [[Compi\u00e8gne]], about 50 miles north of Paris.\n\nPrior to World War II, a Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau agent codenamed 'Rex' made contact with [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]], a German cipher clerk, in the Grand Hotel of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] town of [[Verviers]]. Schmidt, who worked at Defence Ministry Cipher Office in Berlin, sold the French the manuals explaining how to operate the top secret [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]] being used by the German Army. Schmidt ultimately provided all the information necessary to crack the complex ciphers, which would play a key role in the Allied victory.\n\nIn September 1939, when France declared war on Germany in response to Germany's [[invasion of Poland]], [[Josephine Baker]] was recruited by the Bureau and provided them with information as an \"honorable correspondent\".\n\nRaymond Arthur Schuhl, a French propagandist who had served in the 6th Section of the Deuxieme Bureau until the fall of France, became the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Chief of Morale Operations in Switzerland and was its principal forger through the war. Schuhl operated for the OSS under the cover name Robert Salembier (code name \"Mutt\"). He oversaw a prolific print shop in [[Geneva]] that produced millions of white and black pamphlets, leaflets, cards, [[postage stamps]], and other forms of printed [[propaganda]].\n\n==World War II reorganization==\n{{main|Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action}}\nFollowing the defeat of France in 1940, the [[Vichy France]] regime's intelligence service was organized within the ''Centre d\u2019information gouvernemental'' (CIG), under the direction of Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]]. Under the command of Colonel Louis Rivet, head of the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau since 1936, they set up the ''[[Bureau des Men\u00e9es Antinationales]]'' (BMA, the \"Bureau of Anti-national Activities\"), officially an organization opposing [[Communist]] activities and [[French Resistance|resistance]] efforts and accepted by the Germans under the terms of the armistice.\n\nMeanwhile, on 1 July 1940, the [[Free French]] [[government-in-exile]] in [[London]] created its own intelligence service. Under the leadership of General [[Charles de Gaulle]], Major [[Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin]] was assigned to command the organization. Initially known as the ''Service de Renseignements (SR)'', the agency changed its name to ''Bureau Central de Renseignements et d\u2019Action Militaire (BCRAM)'' in April 1941, and again in January 1942 to ''[[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d\u2019Action]]'' (BCRA) the name by which it was best known.\n\nAt the end of the war, in 1945, this became the modern French counter-espionage service, the ''[[Service de documentation ext\u00e9rieure et de contre-espionnage]]'' (SDECE, \"Foreign Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service\").\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{cite book |first=J.

A small intelligence section remained within the General Staff, but the Service de surveillance du territoire (''Territorial Surveillance Service'', SST), an agency of the [[National Police (France)|S\u00fbret\u00e9]] g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, became responsible for the pursuit of foreign spies on French soil. Counter-espionage was to be handled by special [[S\u00fbret\u00e9]] police chiefs. The Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau's statistical section remained in operation until 1 September 1899, when it was disbanded.\n\nThe name (literally, Second Desk) refers to the organization of the French general staff in four desks: 1st for personnel, 2nd for intelligence, 3rd for operations, 4th for logistics. This numerical designation survives in the first four staff numbers of the [[Staff_(military)#Continental_Staff_System|continental staff system]] practiced by most NATO armies: S1 for personnel, S2 for intelligence, S3 for operations, S4 for logistics. (See also the French version of this page.)\n\n\n===1900s\u20131920===\nIn 1906 [[Georges Clemenceau]] became [[French government ministers|Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil]]. With complete control of [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Ministry]] funding, he created special counter-espionage units, the \"brigades du Tigre\", a reference to Clemenceau's nickname. Commanded by [[police commissioner]] [[C\u00e9lestin Hennion]], the mobile brigades were to handle special operations of the [[Direction Centrale de la Police Judiciaire|judicial police]] related to counter-espionage.\n\nIn February 1907, the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau was reactivated and was reassigned some of the  contre-espionnage responsibilities it had had prior to the Dreyfus affair. Commanded by General [[Charles-Joseph Dupont]], the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau worked with the Interior Ministry, and especially Commissioner Hennion's mobile counter-espionage brigades, which worked closely with France's [[border guard|border patrols]].\n\nIn August 1911, the oversight of counter-espionage activities was assigned to the administration of the judiciary police that supervised the mobile brigades. In 1913, the government officially assigned counter-espionage operations on foreign soil to the Ministry of War, with the Ministry of the Interior being responsible for border security and prosecution.\n\nIn May 1915, the ''Section de Centralisation du Renseignement'' (\"Central Intelligence Section\", SCR) was created and assigned to Commandant Ladoux.It was attached to the 2\u00e8me Bureau, which also administered the operations of the Bureaux centraux de renseignement (BCR). Altogether the organization was known as the 5\u00e8me Bureau. The SCR was attached to the ''Section de renseignements'' (''Intelligence Section'', SR) in April 1917.\n\nIn February 1917, the Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil put a commissioner of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nationale in charge of the criminal police, general intelligence, and counter-espionage. His command included a filing and archiving section, a section devoted to [[propaganda]] (''propagande r\u00e9volutionnaire'', PR) and the SR and SCR. The SR provided a clearinghouse for centralized intelligence-gathering while the SCR was a small team of specialized counter-intelligence officers reporting to the Ministry of War, while a team of police officers were in charge of the arrest of suspects and judicial enquiries.\n\n===1930s===\nIn April 1934, the [[Surete|''Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00fbret\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale'']] was changed to the ''Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00fbret\u00e9 nationale'', with a post of Controller-General in command of Counter-Intelligence. In March 1935, the position was given authority over the territorial police, the ''Police de l\u2019Air'', the TSF and the police [[Homing pigeon|carrier pigeon service]].\n\nIn June 1936, Colonel Louis Rivet succeeded Colonel Roux as head of the intelligence service and of a new organization, the ''Service de centralisation des renseignements'' (\"Central Intelligence Service\", SCR).  The SCR, headquartered at 2 bis avenue de Tourville, Paris, was run by [[Commandant]] Guy Schlesser.\n\nIn March 1937, the government decreed that territorial surveillance was the responsibility of the police alone, to be executed by strictly legal means. A new organization, the ''Bureau central de Renseignements'' (\"Central Intelligence Bureau\", BCR) was established the same month and a special section devoted to \"preventative  defence\" was created within the SCR.\n\nIn July 1939, at the prompting of military intelligence, a counter-intelligence charter was established and the National Council amended the [[penal code]] (article 75 and following) to integrate all 1810, 1886, and 1934 counter-intelligence laws.\n\n==Directors==\n* Colonel [[Jean Sandherr]], between 1886 and 1895\n* [[Georges Picquart]], between 1895 and 1896\n* [[Hubert-Joseph Henry]], from 1897 to 1898\n* Colonel [[Charles Dupont]] from 1911 to 1918\n* Colonel [[Maurice-Henri Gauch\u00e9]], from 1937 to 1940\n* Colonel Louis Rivet, 1940\n\n==20th century operations and agents==\nThe Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau developed a reputation as Europe's top cryptoanalytical service in the early 20th century. It scored a notable success at the outbreak of World War I when it cracked the German diplomatic cryptographic system. The French cryptoanalysts were able to decipher the lengthy telegram containing the German declaration of war before the German Ambassador in Paris could decipher it.\n\nIn June 1918, Captain [[Georges Painvin]], a DB cryptoanalyst, was able to crack part of the Germans' ADFGVX [[cipher]].\n\nThese intercepts allowed an effective response to the movements of the German Army's 15 division-strong advances under [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at [[Montdidier, Somme|Montdidier]] and [[Compi\u00e8gne]], about 50 miles north of Paris.\n\nPrior to World War II, a Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau agent codenamed 'Rex' made contact with [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]], a German cipher clerk, in the Grand Hotel of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] town of [[Verviers]]. Schmidt, who worked at Defence Ministry Cipher Office in Berlin, sold the French the manuals explaining how to operate the top secret [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]] being used by the German Army. Schmidt ultimately provided all the information necessary to crack the complex ciphers, which would play a key role in the Allied victory.\n\nIn September 1939, when France declared war on Germany in response to Germany's [[invasion of Poland]], [[Josephine Baker]] was recruited by the Bureau and provided them with information as an \"honorable correspondent\".\n\nRaymond Arthur Schuhl, a French propagandist who had served in the 6th Section of the Deuxieme Bureau until the fall of France, became the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Chief of Morale Operations in Switzerland and was its principal forger through the war. Schuhl operated for the OSS under the cover name Robert Salembier (code name \"Mutt\"). He oversaw a prolific print shop in [[Geneva]] that produced millions of white and black pamphlets, leaflets, cards, [[postage stamps]], and other forms of printed [[propaganda]].\n\n==World War II reorganization==\n{{main|Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action}}\nFollowing the defeat of France in 1940, the [[Vichy France]] regime's intelligence service was organized within the ''Centre d\u2019information gouvernemental'' (CIG), under the direction of Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]]. Under the command of Colonel Louis Rivet, head of the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau since 1936, they set up the ''[[Bureau des Men\u00e9es Antinationales]]'' (BMA, the \"Bureau of Anti-national Activities\"), officially an organization opposing [[Communist]] activities and [[French Resistance|resistance]] efforts and accepted by the Germans under the terms of the armistice.\n\nMeanwhile, on 1 July 1940, the [[Free French]] [[government-in-exile]] in [[London]] created its own intelligence service. Under the leadership of General [[Charles de Gaulle]], Major [[Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin]] was assigned to command the organization. Initially known as the ''Service de Renseignements (SR)'', the agency changed its name to ''Bureau Central de Renseignements et d\u2019Action Militaire (BCRAM)'' in April 1941, and again in January 1942 to ''[[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d\u2019Action]]'' (BCRA) the name by which it was best known.\n\nAt the end of the war, in 1945, this became the modern French counter-espionage service, the ''[[Service de documentation ext\u00e9rieure et de contre-espionnage]]'' (SDECE, \"Foreign Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service\").\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{cite book |first=J.

The manuscript measures {{convert|23.5| by |16.2| by |5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with hundreds of [[vellum parchment|vellum]] pages collected into 18 [[Paper quire|quires]]. The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted.<ref name=\"MS 408\">{{harvnb|Shailor}}</ref> The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using numerals consistent with the 1400s, and the top righthand corner of each [[recto and verso|recto]] (righthand) page has been numbered from 1 to 116, using numerals of a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, it seems likely that in the past the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book's [[wikt:bifolio|bifolios]] were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what it is today.<ref name=analysis>{{harvnb|Barabe|2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Pelling\">{{harvnb|Pelling|2006}}</ref>\n\n=== Parchment, covers, and binding ===\n[[Radiocarbon dating]] of samples from various parts of the manuscript was performed at the [[University of Arizona]] in 2009.

Based on modern analysis using [[polarized light microscopy]] (PLM), it has been determined that a [[quill]] pen and [[iron gall ink]] were used for the text and figure outlines; the colored paint was applied (somewhat crudely) to the figures, possibly at a later date. The ink of the drawings, text and page and quire numbers have similar microscopic characteristics. [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) performed in 2009 revealed that the inks contained major amounts of iron, [[sulfur]], [[potassium]], calcium and carbon and [[trace element|trace amounts]] of copper and occasionally zinc. EDS did not show the presence of lead, while [[X-ray diffraction]] (XRD) identified potassium [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|lead oxide]], potassium hydrogen sulphate and [[syngenite]] in one of the samples tested. The similarity between the drawing inks and text inks suggested a contemporaneous origin.<ref name=analysis />\n\n=== Paint ===\nThe blue, white, red-brown, and green paints of the manuscript have been analyzed using PLM, XRD, EDS, and [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM). The blue paint proved to be ground [[azurite]] with minor traces of the copper oxide [[cuprite]]. The white paint is likely a mixture of eggwhite and [[calcium carbonate]], while the green paint is tentatively characterized by copper and copper-[[chlorine]] resinate; the crystalline material might be [[atacamite]] or another copper-chlorine compound. Analysis of the red-brown paint indicated a red [[ochre]] with the crystal phases [[hematite]] and iron sulfide. Minor amounts of lead sulfide and [[palmierite]] were possibly present in the red-brown paint.<ref name=analysis /> The pigments were considered inexpensive.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin />\n\n=== Retouching ===\nComputer scientist [[Jorge Stolfi]] of the [[University of Campinas]] highlighted that parts of the text and drawings are modified, using darker ink over a fainter earlier script. Evidence for this is visible in various folios, for example ''f1r'', ''f3v'', ''f26v'', ''f57v'', ''f67r2'', ''f71r'', ''f72v1'', ''f72v3'' and ''f73r''.<ref name=Stolfi>{{cite web |author=Stolfi, Jorge |date=July 22, 2004 |title=Evidence of text retouching of f1r |url=http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/04-07-15-retouching/ |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Text ===\n[[File:Voynich Manuscript (119).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 119; ''f66r'', showing characteristics of the text]]\n[[File:Voynich manuscript recipe example 107r crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Page 191; ''f107r'', text detail]]\nEvery page in the manuscript contains text, mostly in an unidentified language, but some have extraneous writing in [[Latin script]]. The bulk of the text in the 240-page manuscript is written in an unknown script, running left to right. Most of the characters are composed of one or two simple pen strokes. Some dispute exists as to whether certain characters are distinct, but a script of 20\u201325 characters would account for virtually all of the text; the exceptions are a few dozen rarer characters that occur only once or twice each. There is no obvious [[punctuation]].<ref name=nsa />\n\nMuch of the text is written in a single column in the body of a page, with a slightly ragged right margin and paragraph divisions and sometimes with stars in the left margin.<ref name=\"MS 408\" /> Other text occurs in charts or as labels associated with illustrations.

This is taken to be a reference to Jakub Ho\u0159\u010dick\u00fd of Tepenec, also known by his Latin name [[Jacobus Sinapius]]. [[Rudolph II]] had ennobled him in 1607, had appointed him his Imperial Distiller, and had made him curator of his botanical gardens as well as one of his personal physicians. Voynich (and many other people after him) concluded that Jacobus owned the Voynich manuscript prior to Baresch, and he drew a link from that to Rudolf's court, in confirmation of Mnishovsky's story.\n\nJacobus's name is still clearly visible under ultraviolet light; however, it does not match the copy of his signature in a document located by Jan Hurych in 2003.<ref name=\"ngvideo\" /><ref name=\"Sinapius\">{{cite web |url=http://hurontaria.baf.cz/CVM/b12.htm |title=The New Signature of Horczicky and the Comparison of them all |website=Hurontaria.baf.cz |access-date=8 June 2016<!-- 21 August 2008 --> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126223023/http://hurontaria.baf.cz/CVM/b12.htm |archivedate=26 January 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> As a result, it has been suggested that the signature was added later, possibly even fraudulently by Voynich himself.<ref name=ngvideo /> <!-- the following sentence hidden because, without a source, it represents original research or pure speculation: Yet the difference between the two signatures does not necessarily disprove Ho\u0159\u010dick\u00fd's ownership, because the writing on page ''f1r'' might well have been an ownership mark added by a librarian at the time. -->\n\nBaresch's letter bears some resemblance to a hoax that orientalist [[Andreas M\u00fcller (orientalist)|Andreas Mueller]] once played on [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Indeed, the disclaimer in the Voynich manuscript cover letter could mean that Marci suspected some kind of deception.<ref name=Hurych2 />\n\nIn his 2006 book, [[Nick Pelling]] proposed that the Voynich manuscript was written by 15th&nbsp;century North Italian architect [[Filarete|Antonio Averlino]] (also known as \"Filarete\"), a theory broadly consistent with the radiocarbon dating.<ref name=\"Pelling\" />\n\n== Language hypotheses ==\nMany hypotheses have been developed about the Voynich manuscript's \"language\", called ''Voynichese'':\n\n{{Original research section|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Ciphers ===\n[[File:Voynich manuscript excerpt.svg|thumb|The Voynich manuscript is written in an unknown [[writing system|script]].]]\n[[File:Vigen\u00e8re square shading.svg|thumb|The Vigen\u00e8re square or table has been used for encryption and decryption.]]\nAccording to the \"letter-based cipher\" theory, the Voynich manuscript contains a meaningful text in some European language that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the Voynich manuscript \"alphabet\" through a [[cipher]] of some sort\u2014an [[algorithm]] that operated on individual letters. This was the working hypothesis for most 20th-century deciphering attempts, including an informal team of [[NSA]] [[cryptographer]]s led by [[William F. Friedman]] in the early 1950s.<!--more names? SSG?--><ref name=Reeds1994 />\n\nThe main argument for this theory is that it is difficult to explain a European author using a strange alphabet\u2014except as an attempt to hide information. Indeed, even Roger Bacon knew about ciphers, and the estimated date for the manuscript roughly coincides with the birth of [[cryptography]] in Europe as a relatively systematic discipline.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe counterargument is that almost all cipher systems consistent with that era fail to match what is seen in the Voynich manuscript. For example, simple [[substitution cipher]]s would be excluded because the distribution of letter frequencies does not resemble that of any known language; while the small number of different letter shapes used implies that [[nomenclator cipher|nomenclator]] and [[homophonic cipher]]s would be ruled out, because these typically employ larger cipher alphabets. [[Polyalphabetic cipher]]s were invented by [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] in the 1460s and included the later [[Vigen\u00e8re cipher]], but they usually yield ciphertexts where all cipher shapes occur with roughly equal probability, quite unlike the language-like letter distribution which the Voynich manuscript appears to have.\n\nHowever, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as \"or\", \"ar\", \"ol\", \"al\", \"an\", \"ain\", \"aiin\", \"air\", \"aiir\", \"am\", \"ee\", \"eee\", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a \"verbose cipher\", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page ''f15v'' (seen above) contain \"{{not a typo|oror or}}\" and \"{{not a typo|or or oro r}}\", which strongly resemble how Roman numbers such as \"CCC\" or \"XXXX\" would look if verbosely enciphered.<ref name=Pelling2009>{{cite web |author=Pelling, Nick |date=August 27, 2009 |title=Voynich cipher structure |url=http://ciphermysteries.com/2009/08/27/voynich-cipher-structure |access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe theory that the encryption system started from a fundamentally simple cipher and then was augmented by adding nulls (meaningless symbols), homophones (duplicate symbols), transposition cipher (letter rearrangement), false word breaks, and more is also entirely possible.\n\n=== Codes ===\nAccording to the \"codebook cipher\" theory, the Voynich manuscript \"words\" would actually be [[code (cryptography)|codes]] to be looked up in a \"dictionary\" or [[codebook]]. The main evidence for this theory is that the internal structure and length distribution of many words are similar to those of [[Roman numeral]]s, which at the time would be a natural choice for the codes. However, book-based ciphers would be viable for only short messages, because they are very cumbersome to write and to read. {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Shorthand ===\nIn 1943, Joseph Martin Feely claimed that the manuscript was a scientific diary written in shorthand. According to D\u2019Imperio,<ref name=enigma /> this was \u201cLatin, but in a system of abbreviated forms not considered acceptable by other scholars, who unanimously rejected his readings of the text\u201d.\n\n=== Steganography ===\nThis theory holds that the text of the Voynich manuscript is mostly meaningless, but contains meaningful information hidden in inconspicuous details\u2014e.g., the second letter of every word, or the number of letters in each line. This technique, called [[steganography]], is very old and was described by [[Johannes Trithemius]] in 1499. Though the plain text was speculated to have been extracted by a [[Cardan grille]] (an overlay with cut-outs for the meaningful text) of some sort, this seems somewhat unlikely because the words and letters are not arranged on anything like a regular grid.<!--Why does it need to be regular? Any grid could function for the obviously ingenious writer of this manuscript--> Still, steganographic claims are hard to prove or disprove, since [[stegotext]]s can be arbitrarily hard to find.\n\nIt has been suggested that the meaningful text could be encoded in the length or shape of certain pen strokes.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Vogt, Elmar |date=September 22, 2009 |title=An Outline of the Stroke Theory as a Possible Method of Encipherment of the Voynich Manuscript |url=https://voynichthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/stroke.pdf |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> There are indeed examples of steganography from about that time <!-- Trithemius? --> that use letter shape ([[Emphasis (typography)|italic]] vs. upright) to hide information. However, when examined at high magnification, the Voynich manuscript pen strokes seem quite natural, and substantially affected by the uneven surface of the vellum.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Natural language ===\nStatistical analysis of the text reveals patterns similar to those of [[natural language]]s.

Instead of trying to find the meaning, Amancio's team used complex network modelling to look for connections and clusters of words. By employing concepts such as frequency and intermittence, which measure occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the manuscript's keywords and create three-dimensional models of the text's structure and word frequencies. Their conclusion was that in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that the book is an actual piece of text in an actual language, and not well-planned [[gibberish]].<ref name=\"amancio et al\" />\n\n{{quote|The use of the framework was exemplified with the analysis of the Voynich manuscript, with the final conclusion that it differs from a random sequence of words, being compatible with natural languages.

Friedman]] to conjecture that the text could be a [[constructed language]]. In 1950, Friedman asked the British army officer [[John Tiltman]] to analyze a few pages of the text, but Tiltman did not share this conclusion. In a paper in 1967, Brigadier Tiltman said:\n{{quote|After reading my report, Mr. Friedman disclosed to me his belief that the basis of the script was a very primitive form of synthetic [[universal language]] such as was developed in the form of a philosophical classification of ideas by [[John Wilkins|Bishop Wilkins]] in 1667 and [[George Dalgarno|Dalgarno]] a little later. It was clear that the productions of these two men were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution.<ref name=nsa>{{harvnb|Tiltman|1967}}</ref>}}\n\nThe concept of a constructed language is quite old, as attested by [[John Wilkins]]'s ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|Philosophical Language]]'' (1668), but still postdates the generally accepted origin of the Voynich manuscript by two centuries. In most known examples, categories are subdivided by adding [[suffix]]es; as a consequence, a text in a particular subject would have many words with similar prefixes\u2014for example, all plant names would begin with similar letters, and likewise for all diseases, etc. This feature could then explain the repetitious nature of the Voynich text. However, no one has been able yet to assign a plausible meaning to any prefix or suffix in the Voynich manuscript.<ref name=\"plan\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1967|pp=870\u2013871}}</ref>\n\n=== Hoax ===\n[[File:Voynich Manuscript (175).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 175; ''f99r'', of the pharmaceutical section]]\n[[File:Voynich Manuscript (135).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 135; ''f75r'', from the balneological section showing apparent [[nymphs]]]]\nThe unusual features of the Voynich manuscript text, such as the doubled and tripled words, and the suspicious contents of its illustrations support the idea that the manuscript is a [[hoax]].

Kennedy and Churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis, but consider it plausible. In the culminating chapter of their work, Kennedy states his belief that it is a hoax or forgery. Churchill acknowledges the possibility that the manuscript is either a synthetic forgotten language (as advanced by Friedman), or else a forgery, as the preeminent theory. However, he concludes that, if the manuscript is a genuine creation, mental illness or delusion seems to have affected the author.<ref name=\"KennedyChurchill2004\" />\n\n== Decipherment claims ==\nSince the manuscript's modern rediscovery in 1912, there have been a number of claimed decipherings.\n\n=== William Romaine Newbold ===\nOne of the earliest efforts to unlock the book's secrets (and the first of many premature claims of decipherment) was made in 1921 by [[William Romaine Newbold]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} His singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless itself, but that each apparent \"letter\" is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings discernible only under [[magnification]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} These markings were supposed to be based on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[shorthand]], forming a second level of script that held the real content of the writing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Newbold claimed to have used this knowledge to work out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of Bacon and recording his use of a [[compound microscope]] four hundred years before [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} A circular drawing in the astronomical section depicts an irregularly shaped object with four curved arms, which Newbold interpreted as a picture of a galaxy, which could be obtained only with a [[telescope]].<ref name=nsa /> Similarly, he interpreted other drawings as [[cell (biology)|cells]] seen through a [[microscope]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nHowever, Newbold's analysis has since been dismissed as overly speculative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/newbold_wm_romaine.html |title=Penn Biographies \u2013 William Romaine Newbold (1865{{ndash}}1926) |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |date=September 6, 1926 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> after [[John Matthews Manly]] of the [[University of Chicago]] pointed out serious flaws in his theory. Each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations, with no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case. Newbold's method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible [[Latin language|Latin]] was produced. These factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be discerned from the [[microscopic]] markings. Although evidence of [[micrography]] using the [[Hebrew language]] can be traced as far back as the ninth century, it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes Newbold made out. Close study of the manuscript revealed the markings to be artefacts caused by the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum. Perceiving significance in these artefacts can be attributed to [[pareidolia]]. Thanks to Manly's thorough refutation, the micrography theory is now generally disregarded.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kahn|1967|pp=867\u2013869}}</ref>\n\n=== Joseph Martin Feely ===\nIn 1943, Joseph Martin Feely published ''Roger Bacon's Cipher: The Right Key Found'', in which he claimed that the book was a scientific diary written by Roger Bacon.

The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams. Some pages are foldable sheets.\n\nThe Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur [[cryptographer]]s, including American and British [[codebreakers]] from both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].<ref name=\"MH2013\">{{cite web |author=Hogenboom, Melissa |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22975809 |title=Mysterious Voynich manuscript has 'genuine message' |website=BBC News |date=June 21, 2013 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> The manuscript has never been demonstrably deciphered, and the mystery of its meaning and origin has excited the popular imagination, making it the subject of novels and speculation.

The manuscript measures {{convert|23.5| by |16.2| by |5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with hundreds of [[vellum parchment|vellum]] pages collected into 18 [[Paper quire|quires]]. The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted.<ref name=\"MS 408\">{{harvnb|Shailor}}</ref> The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using numerals consistent with the 1400s, and the top righthand corner of each [[recto and verso|recto]] (righthand) page has been numbered from 1 to 116, using numerals of a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, it seems likely that in the past the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book's [[wikt:bifolio|bifolios]] were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what it is today.<ref name=analysis>{{harvnb|Barabe|2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Pelling\">{{harvnb|Pelling|2006}}</ref>\n\n=== Parchment, covers, and binding ===\n[[Radiocarbon dating]] of samples from various parts of the manuscript was performed at the [[University of Arizona]] in 2009. The results were consistent for all samples tested and indicated a date for the parchment between 1404 and 1438.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin /> Protein testing in 2014 revealed that the parchment was made from calf skin, and multispectral analysis showed that it was unwritten on before the manuscript was created. The parchment was created with care, but deficiencies exist and the quality is assessed as average, at best.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, Ren\u00e9 |title=The origin of the Voynich MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/origin.html#n04 |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> The parchment is prepared from \"at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins\".<ref name=\"EamonDuffy\"/>\n\nSome folios are thicker than the usual parchment thickness, such as folios 42 and 47.<ref name=voynich.nu_carbon>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, Ren\u00e9 |title=The Radio-Carbon Dating of the Voynich MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/extra/carbon.html |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe goat skin<ref>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, Ren\u00e9 |title=About the binding of the MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/descr.html#cover |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 27, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2016}}</ref> binding and covers are not original to the book, but date to its possession by the [[Collegio Romano]].<ref name=\"MS 408\" /> Insect holes are present on the first and last folios of the manuscript in the current order and suggest that a wooden cover was present before the later covers, and discolouring on the edges points to a tanned-leather inside cover.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin />\n\n=== Ink ===\nMany pages contain substantial drawings or charts which are colored with paint. Based on modern analysis using [[polarized light microscopy]] (PLM), it has been determined that a [[quill]] pen and [[iron gall ink]] were used for the text and figure outlines; the colored paint was applied (somewhat crudely) to the figures, possibly at a later date. The ink of the drawings, text and page and quire numbers have similar microscopic characteristics. [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) performed in 2009 revealed that the inks contained major amounts of iron, [[sulfur]], [[potassium]], calcium and carbon and [[trace element|trace amounts]] of copper and occasionally zinc. EDS did not show the presence of lead, while [[X-ray diffraction]] (XRD) identified potassium [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|lead oxide]], potassium hydrogen sulphate and [[syngenite]] in one of the samples tested. The similarity between the drawing inks and text inks suggested a contemporaneous origin.<ref name=analysis />\n\n=== Paint ===\nThe blue, white, red-brown, and green paints of the manuscript have been analyzed using PLM, XRD, EDS, and [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM). The blue paint proved to be ground [[azurite]] with minor traces of the copper oxide [[cuprite]]. The white paint is likely a mixture of eggwhite and [[calcium carbonate]], while the green paint is tentatively characterized by copper and copper-[[chlorine]] resinate; the crystalline material might be [[atacamite]] or another copper-chlorine compound. Analysis of the red-brown paint indicated a red [[ochre]] with the crystal phases [[hematite]] and iron sulfide. Minor amounts of lead sulfide and [[palmierite]] were possibly present in the red-brown paint.<ref name=analysis /> The pigments were considered inexpensive.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin />\n\n=== Retouching ===\nComputer scientist [[Jorge Stolfi]] of the [[University of Campinas]] highlighted that parts of the text and drawings are modified, using darker ink over a fainter earlier script. Evidence for this is visible in various folios, for example ''f1r'', ''f3v'', ''f26v'', ''f57v'', ''f67r2'', ''f71r'', ''f72v1'', ''f72v3'' and ''f73r''.<ref name=Stolfi>{{cite web |author=Stolfi, Jorge |date=July 22, 2004 |title=Evidence of text retouching of f1r |url=http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/04-07-15-retouching/ |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Text ===\n[[File:Voynich Manuscript (119).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 119; ''f66r'', showing characteristics of the text]]\n[[File:Voynich manuscript recipe example 107r crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Page 191; ''f107r'', text detail]]\nEvery page in the manuscript contains text, mostly in an unidentified language, but some have extraneous writing in [[Latin script]]. The bulk of the text in the 240-page manuscript is written in an unknown script, running left to right. Most of the characters are composed of one or two simple pen strokes. Some dispute exists as to whether certain characters are distinct, but a script of 20\u201325 characters would account for virtually all of the text; the exceptions are a few dozen rarer characters that occur only once or twice each. There is no obvious [[punctuation]].<ref name=nsa />\n\nMuch of the text is written in a single column in the body of a page, with a slightly ragged right margin and paragraph divisions and sometimes with stars in the left margin.<ref name=\"MS 408\" /> Other text occurs in charts or as labels associated with illustrations. There are no indications of any errors or corrections made at any place in the document. The [[wikt:ductus|ductus]] flows smoothly, giving the impression that the symbols were not [[cipher|enciphered]]; there is no delay between characters, as would normally be expected in written encoded text.\n\n==== Extraneous writing ====\nOnly a few of the words in the manuscript are thought to have not been written in the unknown script:<ref name=enigma />\n* ''f1r'': A sequence of Latin letters in the right margin parallel with characters from the unknown script, also the now unreadable signature of \"[[Jacobus Sinapius|Jacobj \u00e0 Tepenece]]\" is found in the bottom margin.\n* ''f17r'': A line of writing in the Latin script in the top margin.\n* ''f70v\u2013f73v'': The astrological series of diagrams in the astronomical section has the names of 10 of the months (from March to December) written in Latin script, with spelling suggestive of the medieval languages of France, northwest Italy, or the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inamidst.com/voynich/months |author=Palmer, Sean B. |year=2004 |title=Voynich Manuscript: Months |website=Inamidst.com |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n* ''f66r'': A small number of words in the bottom left corner near a drawing of a nude man have been read as \"''der musz del''\", a High German<ref name=enigma /> phrase for \"a widow's share\".\n* ''f116v'': Four lines written in rather distorted Latin script, except for two words in the unknown script.

This is taken to be a reference to Jakub Ho\u0159\u010dick\u00fd of Tepenec, also known by his Latin name [[Jacobus Sinapius]]. [[Rudolph II]] had ennobled him in 1607, had appointed him his Imperial Distiller, and had made him curator of his botanical gardens as well as one of his personal physicians. Voynich (and many other people after him) concluded that Jacobus owned the Voynich manuscript prior to Baresch, and he drew a link from that to Rudolf's court, in confirmation of Mnishovsky's story.\n\nJacobus's name is still clearly visible under ultraviolet light; however, it does not match the copy of his signature in a document located by Jan Hurych in 2003.<ref name=\"ngvideo\" /><ref name=\"Sinapius\">{{cite web |url=http://hurontaria.baf.cz/CVM/b12.htm |title=The New Signature of Horczicky and the Comparison of them all |website=Hurontaria.baf.cz |access-date=8 June 2016<!-- 21 August 2008 --> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126223023/http://hurontaria.baf.cz/CVM/b12.htm |archivedate=26 January 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> As a result, it has been suggested that the signature was added later, possibly even fraudulently by Voynich himself.<ref name=ngvideo /> <!-- the following sentence hidden because, without a source, it represents original research or pure speculation: Yet the difference between the two signatures does not necessarily disprove Ho\u0159\u010dick\u00fd's ownership, because the writing on page ''f1r'' might well have been an ownership mark added by a librarian at the time. -->\n\nBaresch's letter bears some resemblance to a hoax that orientalist [[Andreas M\u00fcller (orientalist)|Andreas Mueller]] once played on [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Indeed, the disclaimer in the Voynich manuscript cover letter could mean that Marci suspected some kind of deception.<ref name=Hurych2 />\n\nIn his 2006 book, [[Nick Pelling]] proposed that the Voynich manuscript was written by 15th&nbsp;century North Italian architect [[Filarete|Antonio Averlino]] (also known as \"Filarete\"), a theory broadly consistent with the radiocarbon dating.<ref name=\"Pelling\" />\n\n== Language hypotheses ==\nMany hypotheses have been developed about the Voynich manuscript's \"language\", called ''Voynichese'':\n\n{{Original research section|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Ciphers ===\n[[File:Voynich manuscript excerpt.svg|thumb|The Voynich manuscript is written in an unknown [[writing system|script]].]]\n[[File:Vigen\u00e8re square shading.svg|thumb|The Vigen\u00e8re square or table has been used for encryption and decryption.]]\nAccording to the \"letter-based cipher\" theory, the Voynich manuscript contains a meaningful text in some European language that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the Voynich manuscript \"alphabet\" through a [[cipher]] of some sort\u2014an [[algorithm]] that operated on individual letters. This was the working hypothesis for most 20th-century deciphering attempts, including an informal team of [[NSA]] [[cryptographer]]s led by [[William F. Friedman]] in the early 1950s.<!--more names? SSG?--><ref name=Reeds1994 />\n\nThe main argument for this theory is that it is difficult to explain a European author using a strange alphabet\u2014except as an attempt to hide information. Indeed, even Roger Bacon knew about ciphers, and the estimated date for the manuscript roughly coincides with the birth of [[cryptography]] in Europe as a relatively systematic discipline.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe counterargument is that almost all cipher systems consistent with that era fail to match what is seen in the Voynich manuscript. For example, simple [[substitution cipher]]s would be excluded because the distribution of letter frequencies does not resemble that of any known language; while the small number of different letter shapes used implies that [[nomenclator cipher|nomenclator]] and [[homophonic cipher]]s would be ruled out, because these typically employ larger cipher alphabets. [[Polyalphabetic cipher]]s were invented by [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] in the 1460s and included the later [[Vigen\u00e8re cipher]], but they usually yield ciphertexts where all cipher shapes occur with roughly equal probability, quite unlike the language-like letter distribution which the Voynich manuscript appears to have.\n\nHowever, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as \"or\", \"ar\", \"ol\", \"al\", \"an\", \"ain\", \"aiin\", \"air\", \"aiir\", \"am\", \"ee\", \"eee\", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a \"verbose cipher\", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page ''f15v'' (seen above) contain \"{{not a typo|oror or}}\" and \"{{not a typo|or or oro r}}\", which strongly resemble how Roman numbers such as \"CCC\" or \"XXXX\" would look if verbosely enciphered.<ref name=Pelling2009>{{cite web |author=Pelling, Nick |date=August 27, 2009 |title=Voynich cipher structure |url=http://ciphermysteries.com/2009/08/27/voynich-cipher-structure |access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe theory that the encryption system started from a fundamentally simple cipher and then was augmented by adding nulls (meaningless symbols), homophones (duplicate symbols), transposition cipher (letter rearrangement), false word breaks, and more is also entirely possible.\n\n=== Codes ===\nAccording to the \"codebook cipher\" theory, the Voynich manuscript \"words\" would actually be [[code (cryptography)|codes]] to be looked up in a \"dictionary\" or [[codebook]]. The main evidence for this theory is that the internal structure and length distribution of many words are similar to those of [[Roman numeral]]s, which at the time would be a natural choice for the codes. However, book-based ciphers would be viable for only short messages, because they are very cumbersome to write and to read. {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Shorthand ===\nIn 1943, Joseph Martin Feely claimed that the manuscript was a scientific diary written in shorthand. According to D\u2019Imperio,<ref name=enigma /> this was \u201cLatin, but in a system of abbreviated forms not considered acceptable by other scholars, who unanimously rejected his readings of the text\u201d.\n\n=== Steganography ===\nThis theory holds that the text of the Voynich manuscript is mostly meaningless, but contains meaningful information hidden in inconspicuous details\u2014e.g., the second letter of every word, or the number of letters in each line. This technique, called [[steganography]], is very old and was described by [[Johannes Trithemius]] in 1499. Though the plain text was speculated to have been extracted by a [[Cardan grille]] (an overlay with cut-outs for the meaningful text) of some sort, this seems somewhat unlikely because the words and letters are not arranged on anything like a regular grid.<!--Why does it need to be regular? Any grid could function for the obviously ingenious writer of this manuscript--> Still, steganographic claims are hard to prove or disprove, since [[stegotext]]s can be arbitrarily hard to find.\n\nIt has been suggested that the meaningful text could be encoded in the length or shape of certain pen strokes.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Vogt, Elmar |date=September 22, 2009 |title=An Outline of the Stroke Theory as a Possible Method of Encipherment of the Voynich Manuscript |url=https://voynichthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/stroke.pdf |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> There are indeed examples of steganography from about that time <!-- Trithemius? --> that use letter shape ([[Emphasis (typography)|italic]] vs. upright) to hide information. However, when examined at high magnification, the Voynich manuscript pen strokes seem quite natural, and substantially affected by the uneven surface of the vellum.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Natural language ===\nStatistical analysis of the text reveals patterns similar to those of [[natural language]]s. For instance, the [[Entropy (information theory)|word entropy]] (about 10 bits per word) is similar to that of English or Latin texts.<ref name=\"Landini\">{{harvnb|Landini|2001|pp=275\u2013295}}</ref> In 2013, Diego Amancio ''et al'' argued that the Voynich manuscript \"is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts\".<ref name=\"amancio et al\">{{harvnb|Amancio|Altmann|Rybski|Oliveira Jr.|2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Voynich Manuscript (3).jpg|thumb|The first page includes two large red symbols, which have been compared to a Chinese-style book title, upside-down.<ref name=welt2002/>]]\nThe linguist [[Jacques Guy]] once suggested that the Voynich manuscript text could be some little-known natural language, written [[plaintext|in the plain]] with an invented alphabet.

Instead of trying to find the meaning, Amancio's team used complex network modelling to look for connections and clusters of words. By employing concepts such as frequency and intermittence, which measure occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the manuscript's keywords and create three-dimensional models of the text's structure and word frequencies. Their conclusion was that in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that the book is an actual piece of text in an actual language, and not well-planned [[gibberish]].<ref name=\"amancio et al\" />\n\n{{quote|The use of the framework was exemplified with the analysis of the Voynich manuscript, with the final conclusion that it differs from a random sequence of words, being compatible with natural languages.

Friedman]] to conjecture that the text could be a [[constructed language]]. In 1950, Friedman asked the British army officer [[John Tiltman]] to analyze a few pages of the text, but Tiltman did not share this conclusion. In a paper in 1967, Brigadier Tiltman said:\n{{quote|After reading my report, Mr. Friedman disclosed to me his belief that the basis of the script was a very primitive form of synthetic [[universal language]] such as was developed in the form of a philosophical classification of ideas by [[John Wilkins|Bishop Wilkins]] in 1667 and [[George Dalgarno|Dalgarno]] a little later. It was clear that the productions of these two men were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution.<ref name=nsa>{{harvnb|Tiltman|1967}}</ref>}}\n\nThe concept of a constructed language is quite old, as attested by [[John Wilkins]]'s ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|Philosophical Language]]'' (1668), but still postdates the generally accepted origin of the Voynich manuscript by two centuries. In most known examples, categories are subdivided by adding [[suffix]]es; as a consequence, a text in a particular subject would have many words with similar prefixes\u2014for example, all plant names would begin with similar letters, and likewise for all diseases, etc. This feature could then explain the repetitious nature of the Voynich text. However, no one has been able yet to assign a plausible meaning to any prefix or suffix in the Voynich manuscript.<ref name=\"plan\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1967|pp=870\u2013871}}</ref>\n\n=== Hoax ===\n[[File:Voynich Manuscript (175).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 175; ''f99r'', of the pharmaceutical section]]\n[[File:Voynich Manuscript (135).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 135; ''f75r'', from the balneological section showing apparent [[nymphs]]]]\nThe unusual features of the Voynich manuscript text, such as the doubled and tripled words, and the suspicious contents of its illustrations support the idea that the manuscript is a [[hoax]].

Various hoax theories have been proposed over time.\n\nIn 2003, computer scientist [[Gordon Rugg]] showed that text with characteristics similar to the Voynich manuscript could have been produced using a table of word prefixes, stems, and suffixes, which would have been selected and combined by means of a perforated paper overlay.<ref>{{cite web | title=Replicating the Voynich Manuscript |publisher=Keele |location=UK |url=http://www.scm.keele.ac.uk/staff/g_rugg/voynich/ |author=Gordon Rugg |access-date=June 8, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/25/arts.highereducation |title= Secret of historic code: it's gibberish |location=UK |author=McKie, Robin |date=January 25, 2004 |website=The Observer |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> The latter device, known as a [[Cardan grille]], was invented around 1550 as an encryption tool, more than 100 years after the estimated creation date of the Voynich manuscript.

Kennedy and Churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis, but consider it plausible. In the culminating chapter of their work, Kennedy states his belief that it is a hoax or forgery. Churchill acknowledges the possibility that the manuscript is either a synthetic forgotten language (as advanced by Friedman), or else a forgery, as the preeminent theory. However, he concludes that, if the manuscript is a genuine creation, mental illness or delusion seems to have affected the author.<ref name=\"KennedyChurchill2004\" />\n\n== Decipherment claims ==\nSince the manuscript's modern rediscovery in 1912, there have been a number of claimed decipherings.\n\n=== William Romaine Newbold ===\nOne of the earliest efforts to unlock the book's secrets (and the first of many premature claims of decipherment) was made in 1921 by [[William Romaine Newbold]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} His singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless itself, but that each apparent \"letter\" is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings discernible only under [[magnification]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} These markings were supposed to be based on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[shorthand]], forming a second level of script that held the real content of the writing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Newbold claimed to have used this knowledge to work out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of Bacon and recording his use of a [[compound microscope]] four hundred years before [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} A circular drawing in the astronomical section depicts an irregularly shaped object with four curved arms, which Newbold interpreted as a picture of a galaxy, which could be obtained only with a [[telescope]].<ref name=nsa /> Similarly, he interpreted other drawings as [[cell (biology)|cells]] seen through a [[microscope]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nHowever, Newbold's analysis has since been dismissed as overly speculative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/newbold_wm_romaine.html |title=Penn Biographies \u2013 William Romaine Newbold (1865{{ndash}}1926) |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |date=September 6, 1926 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> after [[John Matthews Manly]] of the [[University of Chicago]] pointed out serious flaws in his theory. Each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations, with no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case. Newbold's method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible [[Latin language|Latin]] was produced. These factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be discerned from the [[microscopic]] markings. Although evidence of [[micrography]] using the [[Hebrew language]] can be traced as far back as the ninth century, it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes Newbold made out. Close study of the manuscript revealed the markings to be artefacts caused by the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum. Perceiving significance in these artefacts can be attributed to [[pareidolia]]. Thanks to Manly's thorough refutation, the micrography theory is now generally disregarded.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kahn|1967|pp=867\u2013869}}</ref>\n\n=== Joseph Martin Feely ===\nIn 1943, Joseph Martin Feely published ''Roger Bacon's Cipher: The Right Key Found'', in which he claimed that the book was a scientific diary written by Roger Bacon.

Strong]], a cancer research scientist and amateur cryptographer, believed that the solution to the Voynich manuscript was a \"peculiar double system of arithmetical progressions of a multiple alphabet\".

The function of the sky burial is simply to dispose of the remains in as generous a way as possible (the origin of the practice's Tibetan name). In much of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a [[grave]], and due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical than the traditional [[Buddhist practice]] of [[cremation]].

Additionally, subsurface interment is difficult since the [[active layer]] is not more than a few centimeters deep, with solid rock or [[permafrost]] beneath the surface.\n\nThe customs are first recorded in an indigenous 12th-century Buddhist treatise, which is colloquially known as the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]'' ([[Bardo Thodol]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|1991|p=212}}.</ref> Tibetan [[tantra|tantricism]] appears to have influenced the  procedure.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramachandra Rao|1977|p=5}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wylie|1964}}.</ref> The body is cut up according to instructions given by a lama or adept.<ref name=\"GossKlass\">{{harvnb|Goss|Klass|1997|p=385}}.</ref>\n[[File:Vultures on Lhasa sky burial rock 1.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Vultures feeding on cut pieces of body at a 1985 sky burial in Lhasa, Tibet]]\nMongolians traditionally buried their dead (sometimes with human or animal sacrifice for the wealthier chieftains) but the [[T\u00fcmed]] adopted sky burial following their conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under [[Altan Khan]] during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and other banners subsequently converted under the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name=hei>Heike, Michel. \"[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/corff/im/Texte/burial.html The Open-Air Sacrificial Burial of the Mongols]\".

As a result of these policies, many corpses would simply be buried or thrown in rivers. Many families believed the souls of these people would never escape purgatory and became ghosts. Sky burial nonetheless continued to be practiced in rural areas and has even received official protection in recent years. However, the practice continues to diminish for a number of reasons, including restrictions on its practice near urban areas and diminishing numbers of vultures in rural districts. Finally, Tibetan practice holds that the [[yak]] carrying the body to the charnel grounds should be set free{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, making the rite much more expensive than a service at a [[crematorium]].<ref name=dif/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.sina.com/china/2012/1213/537423.html|title=Funeral reforms edge along in Tibetan areas|date=2012-12-13|accessdate=2012-12-16|publisher=Xinhua}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose and meaning==\n[[File:Ragbya carries corps from Lhasa for Sky burial.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Corpse being carried from Lhasa for sky burial about 1920]]\nFor Tibetan Buddhists, sky burial and cremation are templates of instructional teaching on the impermanence of life.<ref name=\"GossKlass\" /> ''Jhator'' is considered an act of generosity on the part of the deceased, since the deceased and his/her surviving relatives are providing food to sustain living beings.

Pieces of the [[human skeleton]] were employed in ritual tools such as the [[Kapala|skullcup]], [[Kangling|thigh-bone trumpet]].\n\nThe 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: {{IAST|a\u1e63\u1e6dhiamudr\u0101}}; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as \"[[mudra]]\" or 'seals'. The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' identifies the Symbolic Bone Ornaments with the [[Five Wisdoms]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] in his commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' explains this further.<ref name=\"Kongtrul_2005_493\">{{harvnb|Kongtrul|2005|p=493}}.</ref>\n\n==Setting==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-12-50-06, Tibetexpedition, Ragyapa, Geier.jpg|thumb|300x300px|1938 photo of Sky burial from the [[German Federal Archives|Bundesarchiv]]]]\nA traditional ''jhator'' is performed in specified locations in [[Tibet]] (and surrounding areas traditionally occupied by Tibetans). [[Drigung Monastery]] is one of the three most important ''jhator'' sites.\n\nThe procedure takes place on a large flat rock long used for the purpose. The charnel ground (''durtro'') is always higher than its surroundings. It may be very simple, consisting only of the flat rock, or it may be more elaborate, incorporating temples and [[stupa]] (''chorten'' in Tibetan).\n\nRelatives may remain nearby<ref>{{harvnb|Ash|1992|p=59}}.</ref> during the ''jhator'', possibly in a place where they cannot see it directly. The ''jhator'' usually takes place at dawn.\n\nThe full ''jhator'' procedure (as described below) is elaborate and expensive. Those who cannot afford it simply place their deceased on a high rock where the body decomposes or is eaten by birds and animals.\n\nIn 2010, a prominent Tibetan incarnate lama, Metrul Tendzin Gyatso, visited the sky burial site near the [[Larung Gar]] Buddhist Institute in Sertar County, Sichuan, and was dismayed by its poor condition. With the stated goal of restoring dignity to the dead and creating a better environment for the vultures, the lama subsequently rebuilt and improved the platform where bodies are cut up, adding many statues and other carved features around it, and constructed a large parking lot for the convenience of visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://read01.com/a78nP7.html#.XbiyNi-ZNhE|title=\u5587\u69ae\u4e94\u660e\u4f5b\u5b78\u9662\u5c4d\u9640\u6797\uff1a\u5e36\u4f60\u8d70\u9032\u751f\u547d\u8f2a\u8ff4\u7684\u771f\u76f8|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Procedure==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}\nAccounts from observers vary. The following description is assembled from multiple accounts by observers from the U.S. and Europe. References appear at the end.\n\n===Participants===\nPrior to the procedure, [[Tibetan Buddhism#Monasticism|monks]] may chant [[mantra]] around the body and burn juniper [[incense]] \u2013 although ceremonial activities often take place on the preceding day.\n\nThe work of disassembling of the body may be done by a monk, or, more commonly, by ''rogyapas'' (\"body-breakers\").\n\nAll the eyewitness accounts remarked on the fact that the ''rogyapas'' did not perform their task with gravity or ceremony, but rather talked and laughed as during any other type of physical labor. According to Buddhist teaching, this makes it easier for the soul of the deceased to move on from the uncertain plane between life and death onto the next life.\n\nSome accounts refer to individuals who carry out sky burial rituals as a \u2018Tokden\u2019 which is Tibetan for \u2018Sky Burial Master\u2019. While a Tokden has an important role in burial rites, they are often people of low social status and sometimes receive payment from the families of the deceased.\n\n===Disassembling the body===\n[[File:Skyburial.JPG|thumb|A body being prepared for Sky burial in [[Sichuan]]|300x300px]]\n\nAccording to most accounts, vultures are given the whole body. Then, when only the bones remain, these are broken up with mallets, ground with [[tsampa]] (barley flour with tea and [[yak]] butter, or milk), given to the crows and hawks that have waited for the vultures to depart.\n\nIn one account, the leading ''rogyapa'' cut off the limbs and hacked the body to pieces, handing each part to his assistants, who used rocks to pound the flesh and bones together to a pulp, which they mixed with tsampa before the vultures were summoned to eat. In some cases, a Todken will use butcher's tools to divide the body.\n\nSometimes the internal organs were removed and processed separately, but they too were consumed by birds. The hair is removed from the head and may be simply thrown away; at Drigung, it seems, at least some hair is kept in a room of the monastery.\n\nNone of the eyewitness accounts specify which kind of knife is used in the ''jhator''. One source states that it is a \"ritual flaying knife\" or ''trigu'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''[[kartika (knife)|kartika]]''), but another source expresses skepticism, noting that the ''trigu'' is considered a woman's tool (''rogyapas'' seem to be exclusively male).\n\n===Vultures===\n[[File:Vulture - Sky burial.jpg|thumb|Skeletal remains as vultures feed|300x300px]]\nThe species contributing to the ritual are typically the [[griffon vulture|griffon]] and [[Himalayan vulture]]s.\n\nIn places where there are several ''jhator'' offerings each day, the birds sometimes have to be coaxed to eat, which may be accomplished with a ritual dance. If a small number of vultures come down to eat, or if portions of the body are left over after the vultures fly away, or if the body is completely left untouched, it is considered to be a bad omen in Buddhist beliefs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MaMing|first=Roller|last2=Lee|first2=Li|last3=Yang|first3=Xiaomin|last4=Buzzard|first4=Paul|date=2018-03-29|title=Vultures and sky burials on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/vulnew/article/view/168874|journal=Vulture News|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22|doi=10.4314/vulnew.v71i1.2|issn=1606-7479|doi-access=free}}</ref>In these cases, according to Buddhist belief, there are negative implications for the individual and/or the individual's family, such as the individual being buried lived a bad life or accumulated bad karma throughout their lifetime and throughout their past lives, thus predetermining them to a bad rebirth.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gouin|first=Margaret|title=Tibetan Rituals of Death: Buddhist Funerary Practices|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780203849989|location=|pages=70}}</ref>\n\nIn places where fewer bodies are offered, the vultures are more eager, and sometimes have to be fended off with sticks during the initial preparations. Often there is a limit to how many corpses can be consumed at a certain burial site, prompting lamas to find different areas.

Additionally, subsurface interment is difficult since the [[active layer]] is not more than a few centimeters deep, with solid rock or [[permafrost]] beneath the surface.\n\nThe customs are first recorded in an indigenous 12th-century Buddhist treatise, which is colloquially known as the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]'' ([[Bardo Thodol]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|1991|p=212}}.</ref> Tibetan [[tantra|tantricism]] appears to have influenced the  procedure.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramachandra Rao|1977|p=5}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wylie|1964}}.</ref> The body is cut up according to instructions given by a lama or adept.<ref name=\"GossKlass\">{{harvnb|Goss|Klass|1997|p=385}}.</ref>\n[[File:Vultures on Lhasa sky burial rock 1.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Vultures feeding on cut pieces of body at a 1985 sky burial in Lhasa, Tibet]]\nMongolians traditionally buried their dead (sometimes with human or animal sacrifice for the wealthier chieftains) but the [[T\u00fcmed]] adopted sky burial following their conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under [[Altan Khan]] during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and other banners subsequently converted under the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name=hei>Heike, Michel. \"[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/corff/im/Texte/burial.html The Open-Air Sacrificial Burial of the Mongols]\".

As a result of these policies, many corpses would simply be buried or thrown in rivers. Many families believed the souls of these people would never escape purgatory and became ghosts. Sky burial nonetheless continued to be practiced in rural areas and has even received official protection in recent years. However, the practice continues to diminish for a number of reasons, including restrictions on its practice near urban areas and diminishing numbers of vultures in rural districts. Finally, Tibetan practice holds that the [[yak]] carrying the body to the charnel grounds should be set free{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, making the rite much more expensive than a service at a [[crematorium]].<ref name=dif/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.sina.com/china/2012/1213/537423.html|title=Funeral reforms edge along in Tibetan areas|date=2012-12-13|accessdate=2012-12-16|publisher=Xinhua}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose and meaning==\n[[File:Ragbya carries corps from Lhasa for Sky burial.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Corpse being carried from Lhasa for sky burial about 1920]]\nFor Tibetan Buddhists, sky burial and cremation are templates of instructional teaching on the impermanence of life.<ref name=\"GossKlass\" /> ''Jhator'' is considered an act of generosity on the part of the deceased, since the deceased and his/her surviving relatives are providing food to sustain living beings.

Pieces of the [[human skeleton]] were employed in ritual tools such as the [[Kapala|skullcup]], [[Kangling|thigh-bone trumpet]].\n\nThe 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: {{IAST|a\u1e63\u1e6dhiamudr\u0101}}; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as \"[[mudra]]\" or 'seals'.

[[Drigung Monastery]] is one of the three most important ''jhator'' sites.\n\nThe procedure takes place on a large flat rock long used for the purpose. The charnel ground (''durtro'') is always higher than its surroundings. It may be very simple, consisting only of the flat rock, or it may be more elaborate, incorporating temples and [[stupa]] (''chorten'' in Tibetan).\n\nRelatives may remain nearby<ref>{{harvnb|Ash|1992|p=59}}.</ref> during the ''jhator'', possibly in a place where they cannot see it directly. The ''jhator'' usually takes place at dawn.\n\nThe full ''jhator'' procedure (as described below) is elaborate and expensive. Those who cannot afford it simply place their deceased on a high rock where the body decomposes or is eaten by birds and animals.\n\nIn 2010, a prominent Tibetan incarnate lama, Metrul Tendzin Gyatso, visited the sky burial site near the [[Larung Gar]] Buddhist Institute in Sertar County, Sichuan, and was dismayed by its poor condition. With the stated goal of restoring dignity to the dead and creating a better environment for the vultures, the lama subsequently rebuilt and improved the platform where bodies are cut up, adding many statues and other carved features around it, and constructed a large parking lot for the convenience of visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://read01.com/a78nP7.html#.XbiyNi-ZNhE|title=\u5587\u69ae\u4e94\u660e\u4f5b\u5b78\u9662\u5c4d\u9640\u6797\uff1a\u5e36\u4f60\u8d70\u9032\u751f\u547d\u8f2a\u8ff4\u7684\u771f\u76f8|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Procedure==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}\nAccounts from observers vary. The following description is assembled from multiple accounts by observers from the U.S. and Europe. References appear at the end.\n\n===Participants===\nPrior to the procedure, [[Tibetan Buddhism#Monasticism|monks]] may chant [[mantra]] around the body and burn juniper [[incense]] \u2013 although ceremonial activities often take place on the preceding day.\n\nThe work of disassembling of the body may be done by a monk, or, more commonly, by ''rogyapas'' (\"body-breakers\").\n\nAll the eyewitness accounts remarked on the fact that the ''rogyapas'' did not perform their task with gravity or ceremony, but rather talked and laughed as during any other type of physical labor. According to Buddhist teaching, this makes it easier for the soul of the deceased to move on from the uncertain plane between life and death onto the next life.\n\nSome accounts refer to individuals who carry out sky burial rituals as a \u2018Tokden\u2019 which is Tibetan for \u2018Sky Burial Master\u2019. While a Tokden has an important role in burial rites, they are often people of low social status and sometimes receive payment from the families of the deceased.\n\n===Disassembling the body===\n[[File:Skyburial.JPG|thumb|A body being prepared for Sky burial in [[Sichuan]]|300x300px]]\n\nAccording to most accounts, vultures are given the whole body. Then, when only the bones remain, these are broken up with mallets, ground with [[tsampa]] (barley flour with tea and [[yak]] butter, or milk), given to the crows and hawks that have waited for the vultures to depart.\n\nIn one account, the leading ''rogyapa'' cut off the limbs and hacked the body to pieces, handing each part to his assistants, who used rocks to pound the flesh and bones together to a pulp, which they mixed with tsampa before the vultures were summoned to eat. In some cases, a Todken will use butcher's tools to divide the body.\n\nSometimes the internal organs were removed and processed separately, but they too were consumed by birds. The hair is removed from the head and may be simply thrown away; at Drigung, it seems, at least some hair is kept in a room of the monastery.\n\nNone of the eyewitness accounts specify which kind of knife is used in the ''jhator''. One source states that it is a \"ritual flaying knife\" or ''trigu'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''[[kartika (knife)|kartika]]''), but another source expresses skepticism, noting that the ''trigu'' is considered a woman's tool (''rogyapas'' seem to be exclusively male).\n\n===Vultures===\n[[File:Vulture - Sky burial.jpg|thumb|Skeletal remains as vultures feed|300x300px]]\nThe species contributing to the ritual are typically the [[griffon vulture|griffon]] and [[Himalayan vulture]]s.\n\nIn places where there are several ''jhator'' offerings each day, the birds sometimes have to be coaxed to eat, which may be accomplished with a ritual dance. If a small number of vultures come down to eat, or if portions of the body are left over after the vultures fly away, or if the body is completely left untouched, it is considered to be a bad omen in Buddhist beliefs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MaMing|first=Roller|last2=Lee|first2=Li|last3=Yang|first3=Xiaomin|last4=Buzzard|first4=Paul|date=2018-03-29|title=Vultures and sky burials on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/vulnew/article/view/168874|journal=Vulture News|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22|doi=10.4314/vulnew.v71i1.2|issn=1606-7479|doi-access=free}}</ref>In these cases, according to Buddhist belief, there are negative implications for the individual and/or the individual's family, such as the individual being buried lived a bad life or accumulated bad karma throughout their lifetime and throughout their past lives, thus predetermining them to a bad rebirth.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gouin|first=Margaret|title=Tibetan Rituals of Death: Buddhist Funerary Practices|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780203849989|location=|pages=70}}</ref>\n\nIn places where fewer bodies are offered, the vultures are more eager, and sometimes have to be fended off with sticks during the initial preparations. Often there is a limit to how many corpses can be consumed at a certain burial site, prompting lamas to find different areas. It is believed that if too many corpses are disposed in a certain burial site, ghosts may appear.\n\nNot only are vultures an important aspect to celestial burial but also to its habitat's ecology. They contribute to carcass removal and nutrient recycling, as they are scavengers of the land.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MaMing|first=Roller|last2=Xu|first2=Guohua|date=2015-11-12|title=Status and threats to vultures in China|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/vulnew/article/view/125620|journal=Vulture News|volume=68|issue=1|pages=10|doi=10.4314/vulnew.v68i1.1|issn=1606-7479|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> Due to an alarming drop in their population, in 1988, the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Wildlife added certain species of vultures into the \"rare\" or \"threatened\" categories of their national list of protected wild animals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MaMing|first=Roller|last2=Xu|first2=Guohua|date=2015-11-12|title=Status and threats to vultures in China|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/vulnew/article/view/125620|journal=Vulture News|volume=68|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.4314/vulnew.v68i1.1|issn=1606-7479|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> Local Chinese governments surrounding sky burial locations have established regulations to avoid disturbance of the vultures during these rituals, as well as to not allow individuals who have passed away due to infectious diseases or toxicosis from receiving a sky burial in order to prevent compromising the health of the vultures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MaMing|first=Roller|last2=Lee|first2=Li|last3=Yang|first3=Xiaomin|last4=Buzzard|first4=Paul|date=2018-03-29|title=Vultures and sky burials on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/vulnew/article/view/168874|journal=Vulture News|volume=71|issue=1|pages=30|doi=10.4314/vulnew.v71i1.2|issn=1606-7479|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Zoroastrianism==\nAncient [[Zoroastrians]] believed the dead body should be put in a structure called a [[Tower of Silence|Dakhma]] to be feasted upon by birds of prey, because the burial or burning of the corpses would cause water and soil to become dirty, which is forbidden in the ancient religion.\n\n==In popular culture==\nA ''jhator'' was filmed, with permission from the family, for [[Frederique Darragon]]'s documentary ''[[Secret Towers of the Himalayas]],'' which aired on the [[Science Channel]] in fall 2008.
