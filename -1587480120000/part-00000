Gotenks fights Buu, first in the time dimension, then in the real world until the thirty-minute fusion time limit expires. Through Buu's treachery they, along with [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], are absorbed by Buu, thus increasing his power. Once freed, Trunks, along with Goten, Gohan, and Piccolo are killed when Buu blows up the Earth. After being resurrected, Trunks helped to rally the people on Earth to support Goku's ''Genki-Dama'' in his defeat of Majin Buu.

The producer at [[Toei Animation]] and the editorial department discussed that, perhaps, it would be better if they changed to a different voice actor for the child version. At that time, the serialization was still going on, and Toriyama did not know how the manga story would end; young Trunks might have ended up growing up and the story might have continued to the same time period when teenage Trunks returned to the future. In that case, if the voice actor would have been changed, it would have sounded strange.

Akira Toriyama stated that it was difficult to decide on Present Trunks' voice. The producer at [[Toei Animation]] and the editorial department discussed that, perhaps, it would be better if they changed to a different voice actor for the child version. At that time, the serialization was still going on, and Toriyama did not know how the manga story would end; young Trunks might have ended up growing up and the story might have continued to the same time period when teenage Trunks returned to the future. In that case, if the voice actor would have been changed, it would have sounded strange. Eventually, Kusao ended up also voicing Trunks as a child and, after listening a few times, Toriyama felt that it was the right choice.<ref name=\"Animation2\">{{cite book |title=DRAGON\u3000BALL\u3000\u5927\u5168\u96c6\u30005: TV ANIMATION PART 2 |language=Japanese |publisher=Shueisha |year=1995 |pages=206\u2013210 |isbn=4-08-782755-0}}</ref> However, the cries given by the character's infant form were provided by [[Hiromi Tsuru]] in an uncredited role.<ref>{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL \u5929\u4e0b\u4e00\u4f1d\u8aac|year=2004|publisher=Shueisha|pages=158\u2013161|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the English-language dub by [[Funimation Entertainment|Funimation]], [[Eric Vale]] voices him both as a teen and as an adult in all ''Dragon Ball'' media,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-11-09/anime-expo-trumpets-to-the-heavens/eric-vale-the-first-guest-of-honor-for-ax2013|title=Anime Expo Trumpets to the Heavens: Eric Vale - The First Guest of Honor for AX2013|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> while [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] voices him as a child in the series, as well as the movie, ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'', as well as the other non-canon movies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-02-24/anime-usa-announces-laura-bailey-and-travis-willingham|title=Anime USA Announces Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> [[Alexis Tipton]] voices him as a child starting from ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-14/dragon-ball-super-anime-enters-universe-survival-arc-in-february/.109915|title=Dragon Ball Super Anime Enters 'Universe Survival' Arc in February|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Appearances in other media ==\nIn ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', Trunks has become the President of Capsule Corporation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dragonballgt.com/characters/trunks|title=Dragon Ball GT {{!}} Trunks|website=Dragon Ball GT|publisher=Funimation|language=en-US|access-date=February 25, 2017|quote=Trunks is the current President of the Capsule Corporation, but don't let his new digs fool you.}}</ref> but does not take the job seriously.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peckham|first=Eric Mylonas|title=Dragonball GT : Transformation|year=2005|publisher=Prima Games|isbn=9780761546788|chapter=T}}</ref> He accompanies Goku and [[Pan (Dragon Ball)|Pan]] into space to recover the Black Star Dragon Balls.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roach|first=Gina Misiroglu with David A.|title=The Superhero Book : The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|year=2004|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=9781578591541|page=[https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse/page/191 191]|edition=1.|url=https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse/page/191}}</ref> They have many strange encounters and meet many unusual characters including the robot named Giru, who would act as the gang's Dragon Radar.

By 2011, she was studying Arabic literature at Hasakah University. Before the Syrian Civil War's outbreak, Felat claims that she had intended to eventually attend the national military academy and become a [[Syrian Army]] officer. Upon the spread of the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|civil uprising]] against [[Bashar al-Assad]] in 2011, however, she decided to leave Hasakah University and return to her hometown Qamishli, where she quickly joined the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]]'s [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG).<ref name=\"dark victory\"/>{{efn|name=fn1}}\n\n=== Military service ===\n==== Siege of Koban\u00ee and first commands ====\nWith the uprising escalating into a civil war, Felat just got a few days of [[Recruit training|training]] before she was issued a weapon.

Around late 2014, however, she was in [[Euphrates Region|Koban\u00ee Canton]] and among the YPG/YPJ forces that ended up [[Siege of Koban\u00ee|being besieged]] in the town of [[Koban\u00ee]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL).

Despite the bitter resistance of the YPG/YPJ, the hill eventually fell to ISIL, whereupon Felat and her squad retreated further into Koban\u00ee. By the time the siege was broken in January 2015, Felat had been wounded by shrapnel, and five of her subordinates killed while two others were also wounded. The rest of her squad eventually returned to civilian life, and only Felat continued to be active in the military. When the YPG/YPJ launched a counter-offensive to drive ISIL from the countryside surrounding Koban\u00ee in early 2015, Felat was first given command of 45 fighters, and then 300.<ref name=\"dark victory\"/> From that point on she rose to one of the YPG/YPJ's most important commanders.<ref name=\"Revolutionary\" /><ref name=\"profil\" />\n\n==== Operations in eastern Syria and Raqqa campaign ====\nFelat took part in the capture of [[Tell Hamis]] during the [[eastern al-Hasakah offensive]], the [[Tell Abyad offensive]],<ref name=\"meet\" /> and the [[Al-Shaddadi offensive (2016)|Al-Shaddadi offensive]].<ref name=\"Revolutionary\" /> In May 2016 she led a [[Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016)|first offensive]] against the ''de facto'' capital of ISIL, [[Raqqa]], while commanding 15,000 fighters.<ref name=\"Revolutionary\" /><ref name=\"profil\" /> Her forces captured 23 villages,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/2016/05/31/%d9%82%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d9%8a%d9%85%d9%82%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b7%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%af%d9%85-%d9%86%d8%ad%d9%88-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a8-2/|title=\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0646\u062d\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0633\u064a\u0637\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 12 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0632\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0642\u062a\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645 \"\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629\" \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u062d\u0648 80|publisher=Syrian Observatory on Human rights}}</ref> though in the end the offensive stalled, as the SDF redeployed its fighters for the more successful [[Manbij offensive]], in which Felat also took part.<ref name=\"general\" /> Sometime in mid 2016, an ISIL bombing at a wedding in al-Hasakah killed 22 of her family members and relatives.<ref name=\"general\" />\n\nIn November 2016, the SDF launched [[Raqqa campaign (2016\u20132017)|another campaign]] to capture Raqqa, with Felat in overall charge of the operations in the northern Raqqa countryside.

By 2011, she was studying Arabic literature at Hasakah University. Before the Syrian Civil War's outbreak, Felat claims that she had intended to eventually attend the national military academy and become a [[Syrian Army]] officer. Upon the spread of the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|civil uprising]] against [[Bashar al-Assad]] in 2011, however, she decided to leave Hasakah University and return to her hometown Qamishli, where she quickly joined the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]]'s [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG).<ref name=\"dark victory\"/>{{efn|name=fn1}}\n\n=== Military service ===\n==== Siege of Koban\u00ee and first commands ====\nWith the uprising escalating into a civil war, Felat just got a few days of [[Recruit training|training]] before she was issued a weapon. She went on to fight against Islamist rebel forces in the [[al-Hasakah Governorate campaign (2012\u201313)]]. Around late 2014, however, she was in [[Euphrates Region|Koban\u00ee Canton]] and among the YPG/YPJ forces that ended up [[Siege of Koban\u00ee|being besieged]] in the town of [[Koban\u00ee]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). By this time a [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] in the [[Women's Protection Units]] (YPJ), Felat commanded a small, lightly armed squad of eleven other women during the siege.<ref name=\"dark victory\"/>\n\nHer unit took part in the Battle for Mishtanour Hill, where she fought alongside [[Arin Mirkan]] who became famous for her [[suicide attack]] on an ISIL tank. Despite the bitter resistance of the YPG/YPJ, the hill eventually fell to ISIL, whereupon Felat and her squad retreated further into Koban\u00ee. By the time the siege was broken in January 2015, Felat had been wounded by shrapnel, and five of her subordinates killed while two others were also wounded. The rest of her squad eventually returned to civilian life, and only Felat continued to be active in the military. When the YPG/YPJ launched a counter-offensive to drive ISIL from the countryside surrounding Koban\u00ee in early 2015, Felat was first given command of 45 fighters, and then 300.<ref name=\"dark victory\"/> From that point on she rose to one of the YPG/YPJ's most important commanders.<ref name=\"Revolutionary\" /><ref name=\"profil\" />\n\n==== Operations in eastern Syria and Raqqa campaign ====\nFelat took part in the capture of [[Tell Hamis]] during the [[eastern al-Hasakah offensive]], the [[Tell Abyad offensive]],<ref name=\"meet\" /> and the [[Al-Shaddadi offensive (2016)|Al-Shaddadi offensive]].<ref name=\"Revolutionary\" /> In May 2016 she led a [[Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016)|first offensive]] against the ''de facto'' capital of ISIL, [[Raqqa]], while commanding 15,000 fighters.<ref name=\"Revolutionary\" /><ref name=\"profil\" /> Her forces captured 23 villages,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/2016/05/31/%d9%82%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d9%8a%d9%85%d9%82%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b7%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%af%d9%85-%d9%86%d8%ad%d9%88-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a8-2/|title=\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0646\u062d\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0633\u064a\u0637\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 12 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0632\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0642\u062a\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645 \"\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629\" \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u062d\u0648 80|publisher=Syrian Observatory on Human rights}}</ref> though in the end the offensive stalled, as the SDF redeployed its fighters for the more successful [[Manbij offensive]], in which Felat also took part.<ref name=\"general\" /> Sometime in mid 2016, an ISIL bombing at a wedding in al-Hasakah killed 22 of her family members and relatives.<ref name=\"general\" />\n\nIn November 2016, the SDF launched [[Raqqa campaign (2016\u20132017)|another campaign]] to capture Raqqa, with Felat in overall charge of the operations in the northern Raqqa countryside.

The first people to live in the area were [[Orang Asal|indigenous tribes]] that still remain; they were followed by the [[Malay people|Malays]], who moved there from mainland Asia in ancient times. [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Indian Culture|Indian]] cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased with immigration to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include [[Persian culture|Persian]], [[Arabic culture|Arabic]], [[British culture|British]]. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover.\n\nArts and music have a long tradition in Malaysia, with Malay art dating back to the Malay sultanates. Traditional art was centred on fields such as carving, silversmithing, and weaving. [[Islam]]ic taboos restricted artwork depicting humans until the mid-20th century. Performing arts and shadow puppet shows are popular, and often show Indian influences. Various influences can be seen in architecture, from individual cultures in Malaysia and from other countries. Large modern structures have been built, including the tallest twin buildings in the world, the [[Petronas Twin Towers]]. Malaysian music has a variety of origins, and is largely based around percussion instruments. Much early Malaysian literature was based on Indian epics, which remained unchanged even as Malays converted to Islam; this has expanded in recent decades. English literature remained restricted to the higher class until the arrival of the printing press. Locally created Chinese and Indian literature appeared in the 19th century.\n\nCuisine is often divided along ethnic lines, but some dishes exist which have mixed foods from different ethnicities. Each major religious group has its major holy days declared as official holidays. Official holidays differ by state; the most widespread one is [[Hari Merdeka|Merdeka day]] which celebrates the independence of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. Although festivals often stem from a specific ethnic background, they are celebrated by all people in Malaysia. Traditional sports are popular in Malaysia, while it has become a powerhouse in international sports such as [[badminton]]. Malaysia hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1998, the first Commonwealth Games where the torch passed through more countries than England and the host.\n\nThe Malaysian government has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the \"1971 National Culture Policy\", which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. This especially affected language; only [[Malaysian language|Malay]] texts are considered official cultural texts. Government control over the media is strong, and most media outlets are related to the government in some way.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malaysia states named.png|thumb|600px|alt=Map of Malaysia with labels of each state and federal territory|[[Peninsular Malaysia]] (left) is 40% of [[Malaysia]]'s territory, and is predominately [[Islamic]]. The two states of [[East Malaysia]] are mostly [[Christians|Christian]]. The capital of Malaysia is [[Kuala Lumpur]].]]\n[[Malaysia]] consists of two distinct geographical regions: [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[East Malaysia]].

Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the \"[[Hari Merdeka]]\" (Independence Day), otherwise known as \"Merdeka\" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]]. This, as well as [[Labour Day]] (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>  [[Malaysia Day]], held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], and [[Sarawak]], although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/142747 |title=Independence again on Malaysia Day |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=16 September 1963 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nNew Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> [[Muslim holidays]] are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is ''Hari Raya Puasa'' (also called ''Hari Raya Aidilfitri''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/hrya_puasa.htm |title=Festival of Malaysia ~ Hari Raya Puasa |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> which is the Malay translation of [[Eid al-Fitr]]. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of [[Ramadan]], the fasting month. They also celebrate [[Hari Raya Haji]] (also called ''Hari Raya Aidiladha'', the translation of [[Eid ul-Adha]]), Awal Muharram ([[Islamic New Year]]) and [[Mawlid|Maulidur Rasul]] (Birthday of the Prophet).<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\n[[Malaysian Chinese]] typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. [[Chinese New Year]] is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate [[Deepavali]], the festival of light,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> while [[Thaipusam]] is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the [[Batu Caves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/thaipusam.htm |title=Festivals of Malaysia ~ Thaipusam Festival |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> [[Vesak|Wesak]] (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of [[Gawai Dayak|Gawai]] in Sarawak and [[Kaamatan]] in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.<ref name=\"goto1\">{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/holidays.htm |title=Malaysia&nbsp;\u2014 Holidays |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of ''Kongsi Raya'', which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term ''Kongsi Raya'' (which means \"sharing the celebration\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) was coined because of the similarity between the word ''kongsi'' and the Chinese New Year greeting of ''Gong xi fa cai''. Similarly, the portmanteau ''Deepa Raya'' was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf#page=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516014935/http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2011 |title=The English Teacher|publisher=Malaysian English Language Teaching Association|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nA practice known as \"open house\" (''rumah terbuka'') is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend.<ref name=\"matic1\"/> Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as ''balik kampung'' and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=New Straits Times|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010|title=Ripple effect of the festive rush|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914123615/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article|archivedate=14 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main article|Sport in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Man in a workshop making Waus; a purple wau with gold outlines hangs in front of him, as does an empty frame|A [[Wau bulan|wau]] workshop]]\nPopular sports in Malaysia include [[badminton]], [[bowling]], [[Association football|football]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], and [[field hockey]].<ref name=\"Tourism Malaysia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |title=Sports and recreation |work=[[Tourism Malaysia]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902094553/http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |archivedate=2 September 2009 }}</ref> Malaysia has small-scale traditional sports.

The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of [[Laila Majnun]] by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following [[World War II]], most films were directed by directors from [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, [[Permata di-Perlembahan]], was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.<ref name=\"Voices\">{{cite web|author=Hassan Muthalib |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=17 |title=Voices of Malaysian Cinema |publisher=Criticine |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the [[National Film Development Corporation Malaysia|National Film Development Corporation]] in 1981.<ref name=\"Voices\"/> Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.<ref>{{cite web|author=Khoo Gaik Cheng |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=20 |title=Art, Entertainment and Politics |publisher=Criticine |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Malaysia}}\n* [[Malaysian cultural outfits]]\n* [[Television in Malaysia]]\n* [[List of museums in Malaysia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101005111246/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/malaysia.html Malaysia \u2013 Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette]\n* For an informal and highly subjective overview of contemporary Malaysian culture and performing arts, see [https://platypusflatus.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/bolehland-a-cultural-overview/ BOLEHLAND: AN UPDATED CULTURAL OVERVIEW] by arts reviewer Antares\n\n{{Malaysia topics}}\n{{Southeast Asia topic|Culture of}}\n{{Culture of Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culture Of Malaysia}}\n[[Category:Malaysian culture| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=December 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2014}}\nThe '''culture of Malaysia''' draws on the varied cultures of the different people of [[Malaysia]]. The first people to live in the area were [[Orang Asal|indigenous tribes]] that still remain; they were followed by the [[Malay people|Malays]], who moved there from mainland Asia in ancient times. [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Indian Culture|Indian]] cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased with immigration to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include [[Persian culture|Persian]], [[Arabic culture|Arabic]], [[British culture|British]]. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover.\n\nArts and music have a long tradition in Malaysia, with Malay art dating back to the Malay sultanates. Traditional art was centred on fields such as carving, silversmithing, and weaving. [[Islam]]ic taboos restricted artwork depicting humans until the mid-20th century. Performing arts and shadow puppet shows are popular, and often show Indian influences. Various influences can be seen in architecture, from individual cultures in Malaysia and from other countries. Large modern structures have been built, including the tallest twin buildings in the world, the [[Petronas Twin Towers]]. Malaysian music has a variety of origins, and is largely based around percussion instruments. Much early Malaysian literature was based on Indian epics, which remained unchanged even as Malays converted to Islam; this has expanded in recent decades. English literature remained restricted to the higher class until the arrival of the printing press. Locally created Chinese and Indian literature appeared in the 19th century.\n\nCuisine is often divided along ethnic lines, but some dishes exist which have mixed foods from different ethnicities. Each major religious group has its major holy days declared as official holidays. Official holidays differ by state; the most widespread one is [[Hari Merdeka|Merdeka day]] which celebrates the independence of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. Although festivals often stem from a specific ethnic background, they are celebrated by all people in Malaysia. Traditional sports are popular in Malaysia, while it has become a powerhouse in international sports such as [[badminton]]. Malaysia hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1998, the first Commonwealth Games where the torch passed through more countries than England and the host.\n\nThe Malaysian government has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the \"1971 National Culture Policy\", which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. This especially affected language; only [[Malaysian language|Malay]] texts are considered official cultural texts. Government control over the media is strong, and most media outlets are related to the government in some way.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malaysia states named.png|thumb|600px|alt=Map of Malaysia with labels of each state and federal territory|[[Peninsular Malaysia]] (left) is 40% of [[Malaysia]]'s territory, and is predominately [[Islamic]].

Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the \"[[Hari Merdeka]]\" (Independence Day), otherwise known as \"Merdeka\" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]]. This, as well as [[Labour Day]] (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>  [[Malaysia Day]], held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], and [[Sarawak]], although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/142747 |title=Independence again on Malaysia Day |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=16 September 1963 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nNew Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> [[Muslim holidays]] are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is ''Hari Raya Puasa'' (also called ''Hari Raya Aidilfitri''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/hrya_puasa.htm |title=Festival of Malaysia ~ Hari Raya Puasa |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> which is the Malay translation of [[Eid al-Fitr]]. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of [[Ramadan]], the fasting month. They also celebrate [[Hari Raya Haji]] (also called ''Hari Raya Aidiladha'', the translation of [[Eid ul-Adha]]), Awal Muharram ([[Islamic New Year]]) and [[Mawlid|Maulidur Rasul]] (Birthday of the Prophet).<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\n[[Malaysian Chinese]] typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. [[Chinese New Year]] is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate [[Deepavali]], the festival of light,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> while [[Thaipusam]] is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the [[Batu Caves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/thaipusam.htm |title=Festivals of Malaysia ~ Thaipusam Festival |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> [[Vesak|Wesak]] (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of [[Gawai Dayak|Gawai]] in Sarawak and [[Kaamatan]] in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.<ref name=\"goto1\">{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/holidays.htm |title=Malaysia&nbsp;\u2014 Holidays |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of ''Kongsi Raya'', which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term ''Kongsi Raya'' (which means \"sharing the celebration\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) was coined because of the similarity between the word ''kongsi'' and the Chinese New Year greeting of ''Gong xi fa cai''. Similarly, the portmanteau ''Deepa Raya'' was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf#page=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516014935/http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2011 |title=The English Teacher|publisher=Malaysian English Language Teaching Association|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nA practice known as \"open house\" (''rumah terbuka'') is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend.<ref name=\"matic1\"/> Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as ''balik kampung'' and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=New Straits Times|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010|title=Ripple effect of the festive rush|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914123615/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article|archivedate=14 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main article|Sport in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Man in a workshop making Waus; a purple wau with gold outlines hangs in front of him, as does an empty frame|A [[Wau bulan|wau]] workshop]]\nPopular sports in Malaysia include [[badminton]], [[bowling]], [[Association football|football]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], and [[field hockey]].<ref name=\"Tourism Malaysia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |title=Sports and recreation |work=[[Tourism Malaysia]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902094553/http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/images/Powerpoint/15%20-%20Sports%20and%20Recreation.pps |archivedate=2 September 2009 }}</ref> Malaysia has small-scale traditional sports.

The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of [[Laila Majnun]] by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following [[World War II]], most films were directed by directors from [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, [[Permata di-Perlembahan]], was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.<ref name=\"Voices\">{{cite web|author=Hassan Muthalib |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=17 |title=Voices of Malaysian Cinema |publisher=Criticine |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the [[National Film Development Corporation Malaysia|National Film Development Corporation]] in 1981.<ref name=\"Voices\"/> Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.<ref>{{cite web|author=Khoo Gaik Cheng |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=20 |title=Art, Entertainment and Politics |publisher=Criticine |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Malaysia}}\n* [[Malaysian cultural outfits]]\n* [[Television in Malaysia]]\n* [[List of museums in Malaysia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101005111246/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/malaysia.html Malaysia \u2013 Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette]\n* For an informal and highly subjective overview of contemporary Malaysian culture and performing arts, see [https://platypusflatus.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/bolehland-a-cultural-overview/ BOLEHLAND: AN UPDATED CULTURAL OVERVIEW] by arts reviewer Antares\n\n{{Malaysia topics}}\n{{Southeast Asia topic|Culture of}}\n{{Culture of Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culture Of Malaysia}}\n[[Category:Malaysian culture| ]]\n", "name_user": "83.137.205.37", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Malaysia"}

They were accused by many of subverting student [[democracy]] and taking through [[legislation]] what they had failed to win in the student [[vote]].\n\nAfter USAC [[ex post facto]] declared Monserratt ineligible, the Third World Coalition sought to put forth a new candidate in his place. However, this was not permitted by the USAC.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a ''canting keel'' shifts angle to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of leeway (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of jib and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and trysail (in place of the mainsail).

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a ''canting keel'' shifts angle to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of leeway (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of jib and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and trysail (in place of the mainsail). Performance yachts are likely to have full-battened kevlar or carbon-fiber mainsails.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Classes ===\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "{{short description|Private sailing vessel with overnight accommodations}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_yacht"}
