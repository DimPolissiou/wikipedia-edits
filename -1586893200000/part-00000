The film stars [[Kristanna Loken]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Matthew Davis]], [[Will Sanderson]], [[Billy Zane]], [[Udo Kier]], [[Michael Par\u00e9]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Ben Kingsley]], and [[Geraldine Chaplin]]. The screenplay by [[Guinevere Turner]] is based on the [[BloodRayne|video game of the same name]] from [[Majesco Entertainment]] and the game developer, [[Terminal Reality]].\n\nThe third [[List of films based on video games|video game]] [[film adaptation]] by Boll, who previously made the films based on ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'', ''BloodRayne'' received extremely negative reviews upon release and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $3.7 million from a $25 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Synopsis}}\nThe film centers on the character of [[Rayne (BloodRayne)|Rayne]], an unholy breed of human and [[vampire]] known as a [[dhampir]]. Dhampir are unaffected by crucifixes and do not thirst for human blood, but maintain a vampire weakness to holy water. She is the daughter of the Vampire King, Kagan, who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human, in order to annihilate the human race. She was conceived when Kagan [[rape]]d her mother, and she later witnessed him killing her when she rejected his advances.\n\nSebastian, Vladimir, and Katarin are three members of the Brimstone Society, a group of warriors sworn to fight vampires. They hear of a carnival freak who may be a dhampir, so Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. Kagan is also hunting for her, fearing she will interfere with his plans. Rayne escapes captivity at the carnival when her keeper tries to rape her. On the road, she encounters and saves a family being attacked by vampires. A fortune teller reveals to Rayne that Kagan has become the most powerful vampire in the land and resides in a well-protected castle. She tells Rayne that Kagan seeks an ancient talisman, a mystical eye, and if she finds it, it would allow her to gain an audience with him. Rayne sets out to the monastery where it is hidden to find it.\n\nRayne shelters for the night at the monastery and later sneaks away to where the talisman is guarded by a hammer-wielding, deformed monk, who she kills. The talisman is further protected by booby traps, and when Rayne lifts it from its pedestal, the chamber floods with holy water. As Rayne hangs from the ceiling to avoid the water, the talisman falls from the box but she catches the eyeball. Examining it closely, the eye magically becomes absorbed into her own eye, and when she falls into the water she is somehow unaffected by it.\n\nWhen she leaves the chamber, the monks explain the artifact is one of three body parts which came from an ancient vampire called [[Belial]], who had found a way to overcome the weaknesses of a vampire. The eye overcomes holy water, the rib overcomes the cross, and the heart overcomes sunlight. When Belial died, the parts of his body were hidden across the land. As Kagan desires all these parts in order to assume Belial's powers, it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him.\n\nRayne is brought to the headquarters of the Brimstone Society and they agree to work together to kill Kagan. Katarin does not trust Rayne and betrays Brimstone to her father, Elrich, who has fallen in league with Kagan, but seeks to betray him and gain power for himself. The location of the heart talisman is known to Katarin as her grandfather hid it in water-filled caves. She seeks it out but Rayne kills her and takes it. With the talisman, Rayne attempts to gain an audience before Kagan, but he takes the heart and throws her in the dungeon. He plans to extract the eye as part of a ritual. He realizes too late that Rayne had only given him an empty box and not the heart.\n\nSebastian and Vladimir intervene, battling Kagan and his minions, but both are fatally wounded, leaving Rayne in a final battle against Kagan. As Sebastian dies he fires a final bolt from his crossbow, but Kagan is too quick and is able to catch it. Rayne is able to summon her last reserves of strength and plunge the bolt into his heart. The battle ends, and Sebastian chooses to die rather than let Rayne save him. Rayne seats herself in Kagan's throne, and reflects on the events that led to her father's death. The film ends when Rayne leaves the castle and rides into the mountains.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Characters|Cast and Characters}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kristanna Loken]] as [[Rayne (BloodRayne)|Rayne]], a [[dhampir]] who seeks to kill her father, Kagan.<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8531405583612264332&q=bloodrayne Portable Hollywood, Behind the Scenes of BLOODRAYNE] PocketCinema.com</ref>\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Vladimir, a senior member of the Brimstone Society.\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Kagan, the King of Vampires and Rayne's father.\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Katarin, a member of the Brimstone Society who distrusts Rayne.\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Sebastian, a member of the Brimstone Society who bonds with Rayne.\n* [[Will Sanderson]] as Domastir\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Fortune Teller\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Regal Monk\n* [[Meat Loaf]] as Leonid, a hedonistic vampire lord tasked with keeping Rayne imprisoned, and who is subsequently killed by the Brimstone Society.\n* [[Michael Par\u00e9]] as Iancu\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Elrich, father of Katarin and a powerful nobleman.

The film stars [[Kristanna Loken]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Matthew Davis]], [[Will Sanderson]], [[Billy Zane]], [[Udo Kier]], [[Michael Par\u00e9]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Ben Kingsley]], and [[Geraldine Chaplin]]. The screenplay by [[Guinevere Turner]] is based on the [[BloodRayne|video game of the same name]] from [[Majesco Entertainment]] and the game developer, [[Terminal Reality]].\n\nThe third [[List of films based on video games|video game]] [[film adaptation]] by Boll, who previously made the films based on ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'', ''BloodRayne'' received extremely negative reviews upon release and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $3.7 million from a $25 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Synopsis}}\nThe film centers on the character of [[Rayne (BloodRayne)|Rayne]], an unholy breed of human and [[vampire]] known as a [[dhampir]]. Dhampir are unaffected by crucifixes and do not thirst for human blood, but maintain a vampire weakness to holy water. She is the daughter of the Vampire King, Kagan, who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human, in order to annihilate the human race. She was conceived when Kagan [[rape]]d her mother, and she later witnessed him killing her when she rejected his advances.\n\nSebastian, Vladimir, and Katarin are three members of the Brimstone Society, a group of warriors sworn to fight vampires. They hear of a carnival freak who may be a dhampir, so Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. Kagan is also hunting for her, fearing she will interfere with his plans. Rayne escapes captivity at the carnival when her keeper tries to rape her. On the road, she encounters and saves a family being attacked by vampires. A fortune teller reveals to Rayne that Kagan has become the most powerful vampire in the land and resides in a well-protected castle. She tells Rayne that Kagan seeks an ancient talisman, a mystical eye, and if she finds it, it would allow her to gain an audience with him. Rayne sets out to the monastery where it is hidden to find it.\n\nRayne shelters for the night at the monastery and later sneaks away to where the talisman is guarded by a hammer-wielding, deformed monk, who she kills. The talisman is further protected by booby traps, and when Rayne lifts it from its pedestal, the chamber floods with holy water. As Rayne hangs from the ceiling to avoid the water, the talisman falls from the box but she catches the eyeball. Examining it closely, the eye magically becomes absorbed into her own eye, and when she falls into the water she is somehow unaffected by it.\n\nWhen she leaves the chamber, the monks explain the artifact is one of three body parts which came from an ancient vampire called [[Belial]], who had found a way to overcome the weaknesses of a vampire. The eye overcomes holy water, the rib overcomes the cross, and the heart overcomes sunlight. When Belial died, the parts of his body were hidden across the land. As Kagan desires all these parts in order to assume Belial's powers, it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him.\n\nRayne is brought to the headquarters of the Brimstone Society and they agree to work together to kill Kagan. Katarin does not trust Rayne and betrays Brimstone to her father, Elrich, who has fallen in league with Kagan, but seeks to betray him and gain power for himself. The location of the heart talisman is known to Katarin as her grandfather hid it in water-filled caves. She seeks it out but Rayne kills her and takes it. With the talisman, Rayne attempts to gain an audience before Kagan, but he takes the heart and throws her in the dungeon. He plans to extract the eye as part of a ritual. He realizes too late that Rayne had only given him an empty box and not the heart.\n\nSebastian and Vladimir intervene, battling Kagan and his minions, but both are fatally wounded, leaving Rayne in a final battle against Kagan. As Sebastian dies he fires a final bolt from his crossbow, but Kagan is too quick and is able to catch it. Rayne is able to summon her last reserves of strength and plunge the bolt into his heart. The battle ends, and Sebastian chooses to die rather than let Rayne save him. Rayne seats herself in Kagan's throne, and reflects on the events that led to her father's death. The film ends when Rayne leaves the castle and rides into the mountains.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Characters|Cast and Characters}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kristanna Loken]] as [[Rayne (BloodRayne)|Rayne]], a [[dhampir]] who seeks to kill her father, Kagan.<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8531405583612264332&q=bloodrayne Portable Hollywood, Behind the Scenes of BLOODRAYNE] PocketCinema.com</ref>\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Vladimir, a senior member of the Brimstone Society.\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Kagan, the King of Vampires and Rayne's father.\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Katarin, a member of the Brimstone Society who distrusts Rayne.\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Sebastian, a member of the Brimstone Society who bonds with Rayne.\n* [[Will Sanderson]] as Domastir\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Fortune Teller\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Regal Monk\n* [[Meat Loaf]] as Leonid, a hedonistic vampire lord tasked with keeping Rayne imprisoned, and who is subsequently killed by the Brimstone Society.\n* [[Michael Par\u00e9]] as Iancu\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Elrich, father of Katarin and a powerful nobleman.

In that letter, he applied mathematics to the records of deaths during a recent [[smallpox]] epidemic, proposing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"If the latent cause of epidemics cannot be discovered, the mode in which it operates may be investigated.  The laws of its action may be determined by observation, as well as the circumstances in which epidemics arise, or by which they may be controlled.\"<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 95.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe showed that during the smallpox epidemic, a plot of the number of deaths per quarter followed a roughly bell-shaped or \"[[normal distribution|normal curve]]\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Farr |first1=William |title=Causes of death in England and Wales |journal=Second Annual Report of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England |date=1840 |volume=2 |pages=69-98 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101064041955&view=1up&seq=71}} On p. 97, Farr stated that during a recent smallpox epidemic, the number of deaths versus time followed a roughly normal curve:  \"The rates vary with the density of the population, the numbers susceptible of attack, the mortality, and the accidental circumstances; so that to obtain the mean rates applicable to the whole population, or to any portion of the population, several epidemics should be investigated.  It appears probable, however, that the small-pox increases at an accelerated and then a retarded rate; that it declines first at a slightly accelerated, and at a rapidly accelerated, and lastly at a retarded rate, until the disease attains the minimum intensity, and remains stationary.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownlee |first1=John |title=Historical note on Farr's theory of the epidemic |journal=The British Medical Journal, Part 2 |date=1915 |pages=250-252 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858012721373&view=1up&seq=298&size=125}}  From p. 250:  \"He specially considered the decline of the [smallpox] epidemic, and fitted the figures to a curve calculated by a method described.  Though he gives no equation of the form of the curve, it is quite obviously the normal curve of error.\"</ref> and that recent epidemics of other diseases had followed a similar pattern.<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 98. \"Table (q) exhibits the progress of four more epidemic diseases in the metropolis, \u2014 measles, typhus, hooping-cough, and scarlatina, \u2014 which have not yet been effectively controlled by medical science.  They exhibit the same regularity, but the laws which govern their course will be more conveniently discussed when the abstract of the observations has been extended over another year.\"</ref>\n\n==Research on cholera==\nThere was a major outbreak of [[cholera]] in London in 1849 which killed around 15,000 people.  Early industrialisation had made London the most populous city in the world at the time, and the [[River Thames]] was heavily polluted with untreated sewage. Farr subscribed to the conventional theory that cholera was carried by polluted air rather than water \u2013 the [[miasma theory of disease|miasmic theory]]. In addition, through his analysis of several variables and their association with death from cholera, Farr held the belief that elevation was the major contributor to the occurrence of the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Bingham\n| first = P.\n| last2 = Verlander\n| first2 = N.

In that letter, he applied mathematics to the records of deaths during a recent [[smallpox]] epidemic, proposing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"If the latent cause of epidemics cannot be discovered, the mode in which it operates may be investigated.  The laws of its action may be determined by observation, as well as the circumstances in which epidemics arise, or by which they may be controlled.\"<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 95.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe showed that during the smallpox epidemic, a plot of the number of deaths per quarter followed a roughly bell-shaped or \"[[normal distribution|normal curve]]\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Farr |first1=William |title=Causes of death in England and Wales |journal=Second Annual Report of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England |date=1840 |volume=2 |pages=69-98 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101064041955&view=1up&seq=71}} On p. 97, Farr stated that during a recent smallpox epidemic, the number of deaths versus time followed a roughly normal curve:  \"The rates vary with the density of the population, the numbers susceptible of attack, the mortality, and the accidental circumstances; so that to obtain the mean rates applicable to the whole population, or to any portion of the population, several epidemics should be investigated.  It appears probable, however, that the small-pox increases at an accelerated and then a retarded rate; that it declines first at a slightly accelerated, and at a rapidly accelerated, and lastly at a retarded rate, until the disease attains the minimum intensity, and remains stationary.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownlee |first1=John |title=Historical note on Farr's theory of the epidemic |journal=The British Medical Journal, Part 2 |date=1915 |pages=250-252 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858012721373&view=1up&seq=298&size=125}}  From p. 250:  \"He specially considered the decline of the [smallpox] epidemic, and fitted the figures to a curve calculated by a method described.  Though he gives no equation of the form of the curve, it is quite obviously the normal curve of error.\"</ref> and that recent epidemics of other diseases had followed a similar pattern.<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 98. \"Table (q) exhibits the progress of four more epidemic diseases in the metropolis, \u2014 measles, typhus, hooping-cough, and scarlatina, \u2014 which have not yet been effectively controlled by medical science.  They exhibit the same regularity, but the laws which govern their course will be more conveniently discussed when the abstract of the observations has been extended over another year.\"</ref>\n\n==Research on cholera==\nThere was a major outbreak of [[cholera]] in London in 1849 which killed around 15,000 people.  Early industrialisation had made London the most populous city in the world at the time, and the [[River Thames]] was heavily polluted with untreated sewage. Farr subscribed to the conventional theory that cholera was carried by polluted air rather than water \u2013 the [[miasma theory of disease|miasmic theory]]. In addition, through his analysis of several variables and their association with death from cholera, Farr held the belief that elevation was the major contributor to the occurrence of the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Bingham\n| first = P.\n| last2 = Verlander\n| first2 = N.
