However he was overlooked in the 2011 AFL National Draft. He then played for the Burnie Dockers, and was part of their 2012 Tasmanian State League (TSL) flag, kicking a goal in the grand final<ref>https://www.tasmanianstateleague.com.au/2012-season/</ref>. After this he made the move to Melbourne and started playing with Maribyrnong Park in the Essendon District Football League (EDFL) for the 2013 season in the hopes of securing a place in the VFL. Prior to the 2014 season he was offered a place at the Werribee VFL side.\n\n==VFL Career==\nIn 2014, Mihocek signed with VFL club Werribee for 2 seasons, but when Werribee became fully aligned with AFL side North Melbourne, Mihocek sought a move. He met with Port Melbourne coach Gary Ayres, and moved to Port Melbourne searching for team success.<ref>https://www.sen.com.au/news/2018/07/19/mature-magpie-mihocek-recalls-his-prolonged-passage-to-the-afl/</ref>.

At the conclusion of the 2017 season, the AFL side Collingwood made the move to draft Mihocek.\n\n==AFL Career==\nMihocek plays as a tall marking forward who possesses considerable marking and goalkicking skills. However he occasionally floats up onto a wing and plays a link-up role to send the ball inside the forward 50. Perhaps the most notable facet of his game, his work ethic, is what sets him apart as he's constantly running, applying pressure and positioning himself in the forward half.\n\n===2018===\nCollingwood had been watching Mihocek closely in the VFL for a couple years, and decided to pick him with pick 22 in the 2018 Rookie Draft. While he played primarily as a defender in the VFL, he made his debut as a tall forward against Fremantle in round 11 2018 to immediate effect, kicking 4 goals. He found himself a regular in Collingwood's best 22, playing every remaining game in the season, including the finals series and the 2018 Grand Final loss against the West Coast Eagles where he kicked 1 goal. He finished the season with 29 goals from 16 games.\n\n===2019===\nOff the back of an impressive debut season Mihocek was a walk-up starter for Collingwood, arguably the most important person in their forward line with his marking prowess, running and work-ethic great assests. As Collingwood struggled with injuries and suspensions to a host of their forwards, Mihocek's importance to Collingwood was underlined, as he played every game for the season, and led Collingwood's goalkicking with 36 goals.

'''The Black boy tingz''', is a British [[programmer]], born in 1969, living in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]]. He created the [[computer virus]]es 'Pathogen' and '[[Queeg]]'. He was also a prolific programmer of the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and MGT [[SAM Coup\u00e9]] 8-bit home computers, writing Pro-DOS, a [[CP/M]] [[emulator]] for the SAM, an implementation of the [[arcade game]] [[Defender (video game)|Defender]], and the [[Dr Kode]] assembler for the ZX Spectrum, as well as [[Dr Scroll]] VTX5000 modem software.\n\nFrom the mid to late 1980s Pile was programming Z80 code for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Many of his programs were utilities: they included the Dr Kode editor/assembler, the Ultra208 high-capacity disk formatter for the ZX Spectrum +3 and software to allow any ZX Spectrum equipped with a VTX5000 modem to access the many on-line Bulletin Board systems (BBS) which were popular at the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Pile also had several utility programs published in the popular Your Sinclair magazine, including graphics routines for fast circle drawing and [[flood fill]]. Pile was also a semi-regular contributor to the game hacking pages within the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nAround 1990 Pile turned his attention to the newly released SAM Coup\u00e9 home computer. He produced two highly acclaimed pieces of software for this machine, namely ProDOS (a CP/M implementation) and, late in the SAM Coup\u00e9's life, a very faithful port of the classic game Defender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, Pile was imprisoned for 18 months after being convicted of writing two PC computer viruses known as ''SMEG.Pathogen'' and ''SMEG.Queeg'' and the virus [[polymorphic engine]] known as ''[[Smeg Virus Construction Kit|SMEG]]''.\n\nThe SMEG engine was produced as an object file which non-programmers could download and trivially link into an existing virus which, in turn, would make the resulting virus polymorphic and much harder to detect using anti-virus software. SMEG was also the first polymorphic engine with the ability to generate random CALLs to randomly generated subroutines within its encryptors.

'''The Black Baron''', is a British [[programmer]], born in 1969, living in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]]. He created the [[computer virus]]es 'Pathogen' and '[[Queeg]]'. He was also a prolific programmer of the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and MGT [[SAM Coup\u00e9]] 8-bit home computers, writing Pro-DOS, a [[CP/M]] [[emulator]] for the SAM, an implementation of the [[arcade game]] [[Defender (video game)|Defender]], and the [[Dr Kode]] assembler for the ZX Spectrum, as well as [[Dr Scroll]] VTX5000 modem software.\n\nFrom the mid to late 1980s Pile was programming Z80 code for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Many of his programs were utilities: they included the Dr Kode editor/assembler, the Ultra208 high-capacity disk formatter for the ZX Spectrum +3 and software to allow any ZX Spectrum equipped with a VTX5000 modem to access the many on-line Bulletin Board systems (BBS) which were popular at the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Pile also had several utility programs published in the popular Your Sinclair magazine, including graphics routines for fast circle drawing and [[flood fill]]. Pile was also a semi-regular contributor to the game hacking pages within the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nAround 1990 Pile turned his attention to the newly released SAM Coup\u00e9 home computer. He produced two highly acclaimed pieces of software for this machine, namely ProDOS (a CP/M implementation) and, late in the SAM Coup\u00e9's life, a very faithful port of the classic game Defender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, Pile was imprisoned for 18 months after being convicted of writing two PC computer viruses known as ''SMEG.Pathogen'' and ''SMEG.Queeg'' and the virus [[polymorphic engine]] known as ''[[Smeg Virus Construction Kit|SMEG]]''.\n\nThe SMEG engine was produced as an object file which non-programmers could download and trivially link into an existing virus which, in turn, would make the resulting virus polymorphic and much harder to detect using anti-virus software. SMEG was also the first polymorphic engine with the ability to generate random CALLs to randomly generated subroutines within its encryptors. This gave the generated polymorphic code a more realistic appearance. SMEG also used exclusively 8086 machine language instructions, which meant it ran cleanly on any 80x86 based PC.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe name \"Queeg\", SMEG and Pathogen, as well as some of the virus activation messages, are from the British TV show [[Red Dwarf]].<ref name=independent/>\n\nTowards the late 1990s Pile spent some time as a commercial games programmer, working mainly on the Nintendo Game Boy, Sega Game Gear and Master System consoles.

He would later recall... \"Medically, as a prisoner of war, we saw conditions which are now unknown\".<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n==Post-war academic career==\n\nIn 1946, Frankland began full-time work in the Allergy Department of [[St Mary's Hospital, London]].<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\" /> He and his colleagues undertook a series of trials on between 25,000 and 30,000 patients,<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/> which proved that [[antihistamine]] tablets neither reduced nor increased the incidence of pollen asthma. Frankland has continued to contribute articles to [[academic journals]] beyond his official retirement and his 100th birthday.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n===Hygiene hypothesis===\n\nFrankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life; the so-called [[hygiene hypothesis]]. He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former East Germany for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic\".<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in London with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of year when levels would tend to be at their highest. St. Mary's Hospital employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, through daily news outlets, from 1963.\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect [[Rhodnius prolixus]]. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as a [[Specialist registrar|registrar]] to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed. Later, Frankland wrote a chapter on penicillin for a book edited by Fleming. Although largely content with the initial draft, Fleming is reported to have replaced Frankland's closing comment that \"due to increased use, allergy to penicillin is expected to increase\" with \"due to increased purity [of production], allergy to penicillin is likely to decrease.\"\n\nFrankland has since acknowledged that Fleming may have been \"partly right\" because the quality of penicillin production at the time was poor.\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A. W.|last2=Augustin|first2=R.|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(54)91620-7|pmid=13164324|title=Prophylaxis of Summer Hay-Fever and Asthma|journal=The Lancet|volume=263|issue=6821|pages=1055\u20137|year=1954}}</ref> The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.\n\nThe results suggested that the active vaccines were much more effective in reducing allergy symptoms than the controls. The study was notable for being the first in the field which used randomised, controlled methods and a standardised approach to every patient.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keirns|first1=Carla C|editor1-last=Kroker|editor1-first=Kenton|editor2-last=Keelan|editor2-first=Jennifer|editor3-last=Muzumdar|editor3-first=Pauline|chapterurl=http://www.stonybrook.edu/bioethics/gvandallergy.pdf|chapter=Germs, vaccines, and the rise of allergy|title=Crafting Immunity: Working Histories of Clinical Immunology|year=2008|publisher=Aldershot|page=93}}</ref> The trial, along with his work on the pollen count, was one of the contributing factors to Frankland being awarded the [[European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|EAACI]] Noon Award for significant contributions to immunotherapy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eaaci.org/resources/grants-a-awards/awardees/1669-eaaci-noon-award-2011.html|title=Grants and Awards|publisher=EACCI|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Saddam Hussein===\n\nIn 1979 Frankland treated Iraq\u2019s then president [[Saddam Hussein]]. Contacted to visit a VIP in Baghdad having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland has said \u201cTo my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state. I heard some time later that he had had a disagreement with his secretary of state for health, so he took him outside and shot him.

He worked at Guy's on this basis for another twenty years on peanut [[anaphylaxis]] and [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] allergies. After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.

Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, through daily news outlets, from 1963.\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nHe was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique which aims to reduce the level of immune response to allergens by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect [[Rhodnius prolixus]]. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects which Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as a [[Specialist registrar|registrar]] to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland has said that he cannot recall a patient ever being discussed. Later, Frankland wrote a chapter on penicillin for a book edited by Fleming. Although largely content with the initial draft, Fleming is reported to have replaced Frankland's closing comment that \"due to increased use, allergy to penicillin is expected to increase\" with \"due to increased purity [of production], allergy to penicillin is likely to decrease.\"\n\nFrankland has since acknowledged that Fleming may have been \"partly right\" because the quality of penicillin production at the time was poor.\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"Prophylaxis of summer Hay-fever and Asthma\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A. W.|last2=Augustin|first2=R.|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(54)91620-7|pmid=13164324|title=Prophylaxis of Summer Hay-Fever and Asthma|journal=The Lancet|volume=263|issue=6821|pages=1055\u20137|year=1954}}</ref> The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.\n\nThe results suggested that the active vaccines were much more effective in reducing allergy symptoms than the controls. The study was notable for being the first in the field which used randomised, controlled methods and a standardised approach to every patient.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keirns|first1=Carla C|editor1-last=Kroker|editor1-first=Kenton|editor2-last=Keelan|editor2-first=Jennifer|editor3-last=Muzumdar|editor3-first=Pauline|chapterurl=http://www.stonybrook.edu/bioethics/gvandallergy.pdf|chapter=Germs, vaccines, and the rise of allergy|title=Crafting Immunity: Working Histories of Clinical Immunology|year=2008|publisher=Aldershot|page=93}}</ref> The trial, along with his work on the pollen count, was one of the contributing factors to Frankland being awarded the [[European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|EAACI]] Noon Award for significant contributions to immunotherapy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eaaci.org/resources/grants-a-awards/awardees/1669-eaaci-noon-award-2011.html|title=Grants and Awards|publisher=EACCI|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Saddam Hussein===\n\nIn 1979 Frankland treated Iraq\u2019s then president [[Saddam Hussein]]. Contacted to visit a VIP in Baghdad having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland has said \u201cTo my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state. I heard some time later that he had had a disagreement with his secretary of state for health, so he took him outside and shot him. Maybe I was lucky.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/105-year-old-doctor-william-frankland-pow-camp-second-world-war-saddam-hussein-treat-a7660611.html|title=105-year-old doctor still working after surviving Second World War POW camp and treating Saddam Hussein|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=31 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Horton|first1=Helena|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/31/meet-105-year-old-doctor-still-hard-work/|title=Meet the 105-year-old doctor who is still hard at work|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 March 2017}}</ref> Hussein was executed in Baghdad on 30 December 2006 following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n\n===Retirement===\nFrankland retired from his job at St Mary's Hospital at 65, but was then offered an unpaid consultancy role in the Department of Medicine at [[Guy's Hospital]]. He worked at Guy's on this basis for another twenty years on peanut [[anaphylaxis]] and [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] allergies. After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.

There was a bridge named Wuchu (\u5434\u695a\u6865) at Shigang (\u8a93\u6e2f), According to legend, the bridge was at the boundary point of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu states]] in the [[Warring States period]] (476\u2013221 BC). The unearthed earthenwares at [[Mawangdui]] proved that  at latest Tongguan started to produce potteries in the [[Han Dynasty|western Han Periods]]  (206 BC\u20139 AD). The archaeological excavation at [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site|Tongguan Kiln Site]] showed that, the technology of [[Underglaze|underglazed color figure]] was originated there in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618\u2013907 AC) and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties periods]] (907\u2013960 AC). The production of underglaze wares was once prosperous at the later [[Tang Dynasty|Tang period]], and declined in the [[Five Dynasties|Five Dynasties periods]] in the place.<ref name=\"Hunandaily\"/>\n\n[[File:Tang earthenware fragment with sancai glaze end of 7th early 8th century excavated in Nishapur Iran.jpg|thumb|[[Tang Dynasty]] earthenware fragment with ''[[sancai]]'' glaze, excavated in [[Nishapur]], [[Iran]].]]\n\nDuring [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755 \u2013 763 AC), the Land traffic from the [[North China|North]], [[Northwest China]] to the [[Middle East|Middle East Arabdom]] and [[Persian Empire|Persia]] was blocked, meanwhile the maritime trade was thriving in the South China. As a commercial port and  one of pottery industrial centres, early in the Tang Dynasty, pottery trade between Tongguan and other areas already began, the place should be also the earliest export trade port in the history of Changsha.<ref name=\"Hunandaily\">[http://hnrb.voc.com.cn/hnrb_epaper/html/2014-05/07/content_820950.htm?div=-1 Hunan Daily (2014-05-07)]</ref>  A [[Belitung shipwreck|Tang Belitung wreck]] was discovered by fishermen in 1988 At [[Belitung|Belitung island]], [[Indonesia]] ([[Gaspar Strait]]). Radiocarbon dating of the ship's timber produced a relatively wide range date of 710 - 890 A.D for the wreck. the cultural relics was so-called \"Tang treasure\" in the salvage of the wreck, the majority of that are wares from Changsha produced in kilns in Tongguan, and the text transcript on relics used the calendar era of [[Tang dynasty|Tang period]] (618 - 907 AC).

The unearthed earthenwares at [[Mawangdui]] proved that  at latest Tongguan started to produce potteries in the [[Han Dynasty|western Han Periods]]  (206 BC\u20139 AD). The archaeological excavation at [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site|Tongguan Kiln Site]] showed that, the technology of [[Underglaze|underglazed color figure]] was originated there in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618\u2013907 AC) and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties periods]] (907\u2013960 AC).

Nerve signals are frequency modulated; i.e. the number of action potentials that occur in a unit of time is proportional to the intensity of the transmitted signal. Typical action potential frequency is between 4 and 12&nbsp;Hz. An electrical stimulation can artificially elicit this action potential by changing the electric potential across a nerve cell membrane (this also includes the nerve axon) by inducing electrical charge in the immediate vicinity of the outer membrane of the cell.<ref>M.R. Popovic and T.A. Thrasher, \"Neuroprostheses\", in ''Encyclopedia of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering'', G.E. Wnek and G.L.

This may be due to thermal damage, electroporation of the cell membrane, toxic products from electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface, or over-excitation of the targeted neurons or muscles. Typically FES is concerned with stimulation of neurons and [[nerve]]s. In some applications, FES can be used to directly stimulate [[muscle]]s, if their [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] have been severed or damaged (i.e., denervated muscles).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reichel M, Breyer T, Mayr W, Rattay F | year = 2002 | title = Simulation of the three-dimensional electrical field in the course of functional electrical stimulation | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 252\u2013255 }}</ref> However, the majority of the FES systems used today stimulate the nerves or the points where the junction occurs between the nerve and the muscle. The stimulated nerve bundle includes motor nerves (efferent nerves\u2014descending nerves from the [[central nervous system]] to muscles) and sensory nerves (afferent nerves\u2014ascending nerves from sensory organs to the central nervous system).\n\nThe electrical charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation is aimed at generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex [[reflex]]es. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or more muscles in response to the sensory nerve stimulation.\n\nWhen a nerve is stimulated, i.e., when sufficient electrical charge is provided to a nerve cell, a localized depolarization of the cell wall occurs resulting in an action potential that propagates toward both ends of the [[axon]]. Typically, one \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate along the axon towards the muscle (orthodromic propagation) and concurrently, the other \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate towards the cell body in the central nervous system (antidromic propagation). While the direction of propagation in case of the antidromic stimulation and the sensory nerve stimulation is the same, i.e., towards the central nervous system, their end effects are very different. The antidromic stimulus has been considered an irrelevant side effect of FES. However, in recent years a hypothesis has been presented suggesting the potential role of the antidromic stimulation in neurorehabilitation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rushton D | year = 2003 | title = Functional electrical stimulation and rehabilitation\u2014an hypothesis | url = | journal = Med Eng Phys | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 75\u201378 }}</ref> Typically, FES is concerned with orthodromic stimulation and uses it to generate coordinated muscle contractions.\n\nIn the case where sensory nerves are stimulated, the reflex arcs are triggered by the stimulation on sensory nerve axons at specific peripheral sites. One example of such a reflex is the flexor [[withdrawal reflex]]. The flexor withdrawal reflex occurs naturally when a sudden, painful sensation is applied to the sole of the foot. It results in flexion of the hip, knee and ankle of the affected leg, and extension of the contralateral leg in order to get the foot away from the painful stimulus as quickly as possible. The sensory nerve stimulation can be used to generate desired motor tasks, such as evoking flexor [[withdrawal reflex]] to facilitate walking in individuals following [[stroke]], or they can be used to alter reflexes or the function of the central nervous system. In the later case, the electrical stimulation is commonly described by the term ''[[neuromodulation]]''.\n\nNerves can be stimulated using either surface (transcutaneous) or subcutaneous (percutaneous or implanted) electrodes. The surface electrodes are placed on the [[skin]] surface above the nerve or muscle that needs to be \"activated\". They are noninvasive, easy to apply, and generally inexpensive. Until recently the common belief in the FES field has been that due to the electrode-skin contact impedance, skin and tissue impedance, and current dispersion during stimulation, much higher-intensity pulses are required to stimulate nerves using surface stimulation electrodes as compared to the subcutaneous electrodes.\n\n(This statement is correct for all commercially available stimulators except MyndMove stimulator, which has implemented a new stimulation pulse that allows the stimulator to generate muscle contractions without causing discomfort during stimulation, which is a common problem with commercially available transcutaneous electrical stimulation systems.){{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA major limitation of the transcutaneous electrical stimulation is that some nerves, for example those innervating the hip flexors, are too profound to be stimulated using surface electrodes. This limitation can be partly addressed by using arrays of electrodes, which can use several electrical contacts to increase selectivity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn A, Keller T, Micera S, Morari  | year = 2009 | title = a simulation study | url = | journal = Medical Engineering & Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 945\u2013951 | doi=10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.05.006| pmid = 19540788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Micera S, Keller T, Lawrence M, Morari M, Popovi\u0107 DB| year = 2010 | title = Wearable neural prostheses.

The percutaneous electrodes consist of thin wires inserted through the skin and into muscular tissue close to the targeted nerve. These electrodes typically remain in place for a short period of time and are only considered for short-term FES interventions. However, it is worth mentioning that some groups, such as [[Cleveland FES Center]], have been able to safely use percutaneous electrodes with individual patients for months and years at a time. One of the drawbacks of using the percutaneous electrodes is that they are prone to infection and special care has to be taken to prevent such events.\n\nThe other class of subcutaneous electrodes is implanted electrodes. These are permanently implanted in the consumer's body and remain in the body for the remainder of the consumer's life. Compared to surface stimulation electrodes, implanted and percutaneous electrodes potentially have higher stimulation selectivity, which is a desired characteristics of FES systems. To achieve higher selectivity while applying lower stimulation amplitudes, it is recommended that both cathode and anode are in the vicinity of the nerve that is stimulated. The drawbacks of the implanted electrodes are they require an invasive surgical procedure to install, and, as is the case with every surgical intervention, there exists a possibility of infection following implantation.\n\nTypical stimulation protocols used in clinical FES involves trains of electric pulses. Biphasic, charged balanced pulses are employed as they improve the safety of electrical stimulation and minimize some of the adverse effects. Pulse duration, pulse amplitude and pulse frequency are the key parameters that are regulated by the FES devices. The FES devices can be current or voltage regulated. Current regulated FES systems always deliver the same charge to the tissue regardless of the skin/tissue resistance. Because of that, the current regulated FES systems do not require frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity. The voltage regulated devices may require more frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity as the charge that they deliver changes as the skin/tissue resistance changes. The properties of the stimulation pulse trains and how many channels are used during stimulation define how complex and sophisticated FES-induced function is. The system can be as simple such as FES systems for muscle strengthening or they can be complex such as FES systems used to deliver simultaneous reaching and grasping,<ref>Popovic MR, Thrasher TA, Zivanovic P, Takaki M, and Hajek P. 2005 Neuroprosthesis for Retraining Reaching and Grasping Functions in Severe Hemiplegic Patients.

In order to increase strength of wrist extensors, there must be a degree of motor function at the wrist spared following the stroke and have significant [[hemiplegia]].

Functional electrical stimulation has been found to be effective for the management of pain and reduction of shoulder subluxation, as well as accelerating the degree and rate of motor recovery.

This improvement disappears as soon as the person switches off their FES device. In contrast, a \"training\" or \"therapeutic effect\" is used to describe a long term improvement or restoration of function following a period of using the device which is still present even when the device is switched off.  A further complication to measuring an orthotic effect and any long term training or therapeutic effects is the presence of a so-called \"temporary carry over effect\". Liberson et al., 1961<ref name=\"Liberson1961\" /> was the first to observe that some stroke patients appeared to benefit from a temporary improvement in function and were able to dorsiflex their foot for up to an hour after the electrical stimulation had been turned off.

Liberson et al., (1961) were the first to pioneer FES in stroke patients.<ref name=\"Liberson1961\" />  More recently, there have been a number of studies that have been conducted in this area. A systematic review conducted in 2012 on the use of FES in chronic stroke included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 231 participants.  The review found a small treatment effect for using FES for the 6 minute walking test.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=Shelialah|last2=Mehta|first2=Swati|last3=McIntyre|first3=Amanda|last4=Lobo|first4=Liane|last5=Teasell|first5=Robert W.|date=2012-12-01|title=Functional electrical stimulation for improving gait in persons with chronic stroke|journal=Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation|volume=19|issue=6|pages=491\u2013498|doi=10.1310/tsr1906-491|issn=1074-9357|pmid=23192714}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple sclerosis ===\nFES has also been found to be useful for treating foot drop in people with [[multiple sclerosis]].

More specifically, FES can be used to generate [[muscle]] contraction in otherwise paralyzed limbs to produce functions such as grasping, walking, bladder voiding and standing. This technology was originally used to develop neuroprostheses that were implemented to permanently substitute impaired functions in individuals with [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI), [[head injury]], [[stroke]] and other [[neurological disorder]]s. In other words, a person would use the device each time he or she wanted to generate a desired function.<ref name=\":0\">M.R. Popovic, K. Masani and S.

In this embodiment, FES is used as a short-term therapy, the objective of which is restoration of voluntary function and not lifelong dependence on the FES device, hence the name '''functional electrical stimulation therapy''', '''FES therapy''' ('''FET''' or '''FEST'''). In other words, the FEST is used as a short-term intervention to help the central nervous system of the person to re-learn how to execute impaired functions, instead of making the person dependent on neuroprostheses for the rest of her or his life.<ref>M.K.

Nerve signals are frequency modulated; i.e. the number of action potentials that occur in a unit of time is proportional to the intensity of the transmitted signal. Typical action potential frequency is between 4 and 12&nbsp;Hz. An electrical stimulation can artificially elicit this action potential by changing the electric potential across a nerve cell membrane (this also includes the nerve axon) by inducing electrical charge in the immediate vicinity of the outer membrane of the cell.<ref>M.R. Popovic and T.A. Thrasher, \"Neuroprostheses\", in ''Encyclopedia of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering'', G.E. Wnek and G.L. Bowlin, Eds.: Marcel Dekker, Inc., vol. 2, pp. 1056\u20131065, 2004.</ref>\n\nFES devices take advantage of this property to electrically activate nerve cells, which then may go on to activate muscles or other nerves.<ref>Control of Movement for the Physically Disabled: Control for Rehabilitation Technology, Dejan Popovic and Thomas Sinkjaer, Springer Science & Business Media, December 6, 2012.</ref> However, special care must be taken in designing safe FES devices, as electric current through tissue can lead to adverse effects such as decrease in excitability or cell death. This may be due to thermal damage, electroporation of the cell membrane, toxic products from electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface, or over-excitation of the targeted neurons or muscles. Typically FES is concerned with stimulation of neurons and [[nerve]]s. In some applications, FES can be used to directly stimulate [[muscle]]s, if their [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] have been severed or damaged (i.e., denervated muscles).<ref>Reichel M, Breyer T, Mayr W, and Rattay F. Simulation of the three-dimensional electrical field in the course of functional electrical stimulation. Artificial Organs 26: 252\u2013255, 2002.</ref> However, the majority of the FES systems used today stimulate the nerves or the points where the junction occurs between the nerve and the muscle. The stimulated nerve bundle includes motor nerves (efferent nerves\u2014descending nerves from the [[central nervous system]] to muscles) and sensory nerves (afferent nerves\u2014ascending nerves from sensory organs to the central nervous system).\n\nThe electrical charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation is aimed at generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex [[reflex]]es. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or more muscles in response to the sensory nerve stimulation.\n\nWhen a nerve is stimulated, i.e., when sufficient electrical charge is provided to a nerve cell, a localized depolarization of the cell wall occurs resulting in an action potential that propagates toward both ends of the [[axon]]. Typically, one \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate along the axon towards the muscle (orthodromic propagation) and concurrently, the other \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate towards the cell body in the central nervous system (antidromic propagation). While the direction of propagation in case of the antidromic stimulation and the sensory nerve stimulation is the same, i.e., towards the central nervous system, their end effects are very different. The antidromic stimulus has been considered an irrelevant side effect of FES. However, in recent years a hypothesis has been presented suggesting the potential role of the antidromic stimulation in neurorehabilitation.<ref>Rushton D. Functional electrical stimulation and rehabilitation\u2014an hypothesis. Med Eng Phys 25: 75\u201378, 2003.</ref> Typically, FES is concerned with orthodromic stimulation and uses it to generate coordinated muscle contractions.\n\nIn the case where sensory nerves are stimulated, the reflex arcs are triggered by the stimulation on sensory nerve axons at specific peripheral sites. One example of such a reflex is the flexor [[withdrawal reflex]]. The flexor withdrawal reflex occurs naturally when a sudden, painful sensation is applied to the sole of the foot. It results in flexion of the hip, knee and ankle of the affected leg, and extension of the contralateral leg in order to get the foot away from the painful stimulus as quickly as possible. The sensory nerve stimulation can be used to generate desired motor tasks, such as evoking flexor [[withdrawal reflex]] to facilitate walking in individuals following [[stroke]], or they can be used to alter reflexes or the function of the central nervous system. In the later case, the electrical stimulation is commonly described by the term ''[[neuromodulation]]''.\n\nNerves can be stimulated using either surface (transcutaneous) or subcutaneous (percutaneous or implanted) electrodes. The surface electrodes are placed on the [[skin]] surface above the nerve or muscle that needs to be \"activated\". They are noninvasive, easy to apply, and generally inexpensive. Until recently the common belief in the FES field has been that due to the electrode-skin contact impedance, skin and tissue impedance, and current dispersion during stimulation, much higher-intensity pulses are required to stimulate nerves using surface stimulation electrodes as compared to the subcutaneous electrodes.\n\n(This statement is correct for all commercially available stimulators except MyndMove stimulator, which has implemented a new stimulation pulse that allows the stimulator to generate muscle contractions without causing discomfort during stimulation, which is a common problem with commercially available transcutaneous electrical stimulation systems.){{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA major limitation of the transcutaneous electrical stimulation is that some nerves, for example those innervating the hip flexors, are too profound to be stimulated using surface electrodes. This limitation can be partly addressed by using arrays of electrodes, which can use several electrical contacts to increase selectivity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn A, Keller T, Micera S, Morari  | year = 2009 | title = a simulation study | url = | journal = Medical Engineering & Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 945\u2013951 | doi=10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.05.006| pmid = 19540788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Micera S, Keller T, Lawrence M, Morari M, Popovi\u0107 DB| year = 2010 | title = Wearable neural prostheses.

The percutaneous electrodes consist of thin wires inserted through the skin and into muscular tissue close to the targeted nerve. These electrodes typically remain in place for a short period of time and are only considered for short-term FES interventions. However, it is worth mentioning that some groups, such as [[Cleveland FES Center]], have been able to safely use percutaneous electrodes with individual patients for months and years at a time. One of the drawbacks of using the percutaneous electrodes is that they are prone to infection and special care has to be taken to prevent such events.\n\nThe other class of subcutaneous electrodes is implanted electrodes. These are permanently implanted in the consumer's body and remain in the body for the remainder of the consumer's life. Compared to surface stimulation electrodes, implanted and percutaneous electrodes potentially have higher stimulation selectivity, which is a desired characteristics of FES systems. To achieve higher selectivity while applying lower stimulation amplitudes, it is recommended that both cathode and anode are in the vicinity of the nerve that is stimulated. The drawbacks of the implanted electrodes are they require an invasive surgical procedure to install, and, as is the case with every surgical intervention, there exists a possibility of infection following implantation.\n\nTypical stimulation protocols used in clinical FES involves trains of electric pulses. Biphasic, charged balanced pulses are employed as they improve the safety of electrical stimulation and minimize some of the adverse effects. Pulse duration, pulse amplitude and pulse frequency are the key parameters that are regulated by the FES devices. The FES devices can be current or voltage regulated. Current regulated FES systems always deliver the same charge to the tissue regardless of the skin/tissue resistance. Because of that, the current regulated FES systems do not require frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity. The voltage regulated devices may require more frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity as the charge that they deliver changes as the skin/tissue resistance changes. The properties of the stimulation pulse trains and how many channels are used during stimulation define how complex and sophisticated FES-induced function is. The system can be as simple such as FES systems for muscle strengthening or they can be complex such as FES systems used to deliver simultaneous reaching and grasping,<ref>Popovic MR, Thrasher TA, Zivanovic P, Takaki M, and Hajek P.

Restoration of limb function as well as regulation of organ function are the main application of FES, although FES is also used for treatment of pain, pressure, sore prevention, etc. Some examples of FES applications involve the use of [[neuroprostheses]] that allow the people with [[paraplegia]] to walk, stand, restore hand grasp function in people with [[quadriplegia]], or restore bowel and bladder function.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pow\u2013ell|first=Joanna|author2=David Pandyan |author3=Malcolm Granat |author4=Margart Cameron |author5=David Stott |title=Electrical Stimulation of Wrist Extensors in Poststroke Hemiplegia|journal=Stroke|year=1999|volume=30|pages=1384\u20131389|issue=7|doi=10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1384|pmid=10390311}}</ref> High intensity FES of the quadriceps muscles allows patients with complete lower motor neuron lesion to increase their muscle mass, muscle fiber diameter, improve ultrastructural organization of contractile material, increase of force output during electrical stimulation and perform FES assisted stand-up exercises.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Kern H, Carraro U, Adami N, Biral D, Hofer C, Forstner C, M\u00f6dlin M, Vogelauer M, Pond A, Boncompagni S, Paolini C, Mayr W, Protasi F, Zampieri S|year=2010|title=Home-based functional electrical stimulation rescues permanently denervated muscles in paraplegic patients with complete lower motor neuron lesion.|journal=Neurorehabil Neural Repair|volume=24|issue=8|pages=709\u2013721|doi=10.1177/1545968310366129|pmid=20460493}}<!--|access-date=26 July 2013--></ref>\n\n==== Walking in spinal cord injury ====\nKralj and his colleagues described a technique for paraplegic gait using surface stimulation, which remains the most popular method in use today.<ref>Kralj A, Bajd T, and Turk R. \"Enhancement of gait restoration in spinal injured patients by functional electrical stimulation.

The braces were introduced to provide additional stability during standing and walking. A major limitation of neuroprostheses for walking that are based on surface stimulation is that the hip flexors cannot be stimulated directly. Therefore, hip flexion during walking must come from voluntary effort, which is often absent in paraplegia, or from the flexor withdrawal reflex. Implanted systems have the advantage of being able to stimulate the hip flexors, and therefore, to provide better muscle selectivity and potentially better gait patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Triolo RJ, Bieri C, Uhlir J, Kobetic R, Scheiner A, Marsolais EB| year = 1996 | title = Implanted Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation systems for individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries: clinical case reports | url = | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 77 | issue = 11| pages = 1119\u20131128 | doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(96)90133-1| pmid = 8931521 }}</ref> Hybrid systems with exoskeleton have been also proposed to solve this problem.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kobetic R, To CS, Schnellenberger JR, Audu ML, Bulea TC, Gaudio R, Pinault G, Tashman S, Triolo RJ| year = 2009 | title = Development of hybrid orthosis for standing, walking, and stair climbing after spinal cord injury | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/19ed7a8426590f0efdadfa652fb4b99463650c64| journal = Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 447\u2013462 | doi = 10.1682/JRRD.2008.07.0087 }}</ref> These technologies have been found to be successful and promising, but at the present time these FES systems are mostly used for exercise purposes and seldom as an alternative to wheelchair mobility.\n\n=== Stroke and upper limb recovery ===\nIn the acute stage of [[stroke]] recovery, the use of cyclic electrical stimulation has been seen to increase the isometric strength of wrist extensors.  In order to increase strength of wrist extensors, there must be a degree of motor function at the wrist spared following the stroke and have significant [[hemiplegia]].  Patients who will elicit benefits of cyclic electrical stimulation of the wrist extensors must be highly motivated to follow through with [[therapy|treatment]], After 8 weeks of electrical stimulation, an increase in grip strength can be apparent.  Many scales, which assess the level of  [[disability]] of the upper extremities following a stroke, use grip strength as a common item.  Therefore, increasing strength of wrist extensors will decrease the level of upper extremity disability.\n\nPatients with [[hemiplegia]] following a stroke commonly experience shoulder pain and subluxation; both of which will interfere with the rehabilitation process.  Functional electrical stimulation has been found to be effective for the management of pain and reduction of shoulder subluxation, as well as accelerating the degree and rate of motor recovery.  Furthermore, the benefits of FES are maintained over time; research has demonstrated that the benefits are maintained for at least 24 months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chantraine|first=Alex|author2=Baribeault, Alain|author3= Uebelhart, Daniel|author4= Gremion, Gerald|title=Shoulder Pain and Dysfunction in Hemiplegia: Effects of Functional Electrical Stimulation|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=1999|volume=80|issue=3|pages=328\u2013331|doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90146-6|pmid=10084443}}</ref>\n\n=== Drop foot ===\n[[Foot drop|Drop foot]] is a common symptom in [[Hemiparesis|hemiplegia]], characterized by a lack of dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait, resulting in short, shuffling strides. It has been shown that FES can be used to effectively compensate for the drop foot during the swing phase of the gait. At the moment just before the heel off phase of gait occurs, the stimulator delivers a stimulus to the common peroneal nerve, which results in contraction of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion. There are currently a number of drop foot stimulators that use surface and implanted FES technologies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor PN, Burridge JH, Dunkerley AL, Wood DE, Norton JA, Singleton C, Swain ID| year = 1999 | title = Clinical use of the Odstock dropped foot stimulator: its effect on the speed and effort of walking | url = | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 80 | issue = 12| pages = 1577\u20131583 | doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90333-7| pmid = 10597809 }}</ref><ref>Stein RB, Everaert DG, Thompson AK, Chong SL, Whittaker M, Robertson J, Kuether G (2010) Long-term therapeutic and orthotic effects of a foot drop stimulator on walking performance in progressive and nonprogressive neurological disorders.

Artificial Organs 26 (3):267-270</ref> Drop foot stimulators have been used successfully with various patient populations, such as [[stroke]], [[spinal cord injury]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].\n\nThe term \"orthotic effect\" can be used to describe the immediate improvement in function observed when the individual switches on their FES device compared to unassisted walking. This improvement disappears as soon as the person switches off their FES device. In contrast, a \"training\" or \"therapeutic effect\" is used to describe a long term improvement or restoration of function following a period of using the device which is still present even when the device is switched off.  A further complication to measuring an orthotic effect and any long term training or therapeutic effects is the presence of a so-called \"temporary carry over effect\". Liberson et al., 1961<ref name=\"Liberson1961\" /> was the first to observe that some stroke patients appeared to benefit from a temporary improvement in function and were able to dorsiflex their foot for up to an hour after the electrical stimulation had been turned off.  It has been hypothesised that this temporary improvement in function may be linked to a long term training or therapeutic effect.
