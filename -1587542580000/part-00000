Young Hrdli\u010dka attended evening courses to improve his English, and at the age of 18, he decided to study medicine since he had suffered from tuberculosis and experienced the treatment difficulties of those times. In 1889, Hrdli\u010dka began studies at Eclectic Medical College and then continued at [[Homeopatic College in New York]]. To finish his medical studies, Hrdli\u010dka sat for exams in [[Baltimore]] in 1894. At first, he worked in the [[Middletown asylum]] for mentally affected where he learnt of [[anthropometry]]. In 1896, Hrdli\u010dka left for [[Paris]], where he started to work as an anthropologist with other experts of then establishing field of science.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1903, during his scientific travel across America, Hrdli\u010dka became the first scientist to spot and document the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|theory of human colonization of the American continent]] from east Asia, which he claimed was only some 3,000 years ago. He argued that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] migrated across the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia, supporting this theory with detailed field research of skeletal remains as well as studies of the people in [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], [[Siberia]], [[Alaska]], and [[Aleutian Islands]]. The findings backed up the argument which later contributed to the theory of global origin of human species that was awarded by the [[Thomas Henry Huxley Award]] in 1927.\n\nAle\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka founded and became the first [[curator]] of physical anthropology of the U.S. National Museum, now the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of Natural History]] in 1903.

The traffic movement on the existing [[Inner Ring Road, Hyderabad|inner ring road]] proved that the existing 4-lane road was inadequate. Due to the anticipated growth in the region and the development of proposed satellite townships around the ring road and beyond, an 8-lane [[carriageway]] was planned with a design life of 20 years.\n\nThe conclusion was to develop a highway with access control provides highway grade separations or interchanges for all intersecting highways. Once it had been decided to develop the route as an expressway, all intersecting highways should be terminated, rerouted or provided with a grade separation. The proposed corridor was access-controlled and limited access was to be provided at National Highway/SHI Major road crossings. A 2-lane service roads designed to carry two-way traffic, were proposed on both sides of the corridor. Low level underpasses were to be provided for connecting both the service roads at every 1\u20132&nbsp;km, where the terrain permits.\n\n==Opening timeline==\n* '''14 November 2008:''' Gachibowli \u2013 Narsingi \u2013 Shamshabad (for [[Hyderabad International Airport]]) (22&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=First phase of Hyderabad Outer Ring Road thrown open|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/first-phase-of-hyderabad-outer-ring-road-thrown-open_100119211.html|website=Thaindian News}}</ref>\n* '''7 July 2010:''' Shamshabad \u2013 Pedda Amberpet (38&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=For smooth traffic flow|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-logistics/article997944.ece|website=The Hindu Business Line|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n* '''14 August 2011:''' Narsingi \u2013 Patancheru (23.7&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=Narsingi-Patancheru ORR stretch opened|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/narsingi-patancheru-orr-stretch-opened-392094.html|website=IBNLive|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n* '''3 December 2012:''' (part completed in '''27 April 2018''') Patancheru \u2013 Gowdavalli, and Kandlakoya \u2013 Shamirpet (38&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=Another Outer Ring Road stretch to be opened today|work=The Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Another-Outer-Ring-Road-stretch-to-be-opened-today/articleshow/17458309.cms|date=2 December 2012}}</ref>\n* '''4 March 2015:''' Pedda Amberpet \u2013 Ghatkesar (14&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=ORR: Pedda Amberpet-Ghatkesar stretch opens|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/orr-pedda-amberpetghatkesar-stretch-opens/article6961303.ece|website=The Hindu|accessdate=5 January 2016|language=en-IN|date=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n* '''15 July 2016:'''  Ghatkesar \u2013 Shameerpet (23&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=ORR: Ghatkesar \u2013 Shameerpet stretch opens|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/two-packages-of-hyderabad-orr-inaugurated-116071500760_1.html|website=TOI|accessdate=5 July 2016|language=en-IN|date=15 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Work to be Resumed on ORR Kandlakoya Interchange|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/Work-to-be-Resumed-on-ORR-Kandlakoya-Interchange/2015/10/24/article3094407.ece|website=The New Indian Express|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Land Acquisition==\nThe First Phase land required was {{convert|750|acre|km2}}, out of which the private land acquired was {{convert|500|acre|km2}}.

The traffic movement on the existing [[Inner Ring Road, Hyderabad|inner ring road]] proved that the existing 4-lane road was inadequate. Due to the anticipated growth in the region and the development of proposed satellite townships around the ring road and beyond, an 8-lane [[carriageway]] was planned with a design life of 20 years.\n\nThe conclusion was to develop a highway with access control provides highway grade separations or interchanges for all intersecting highways. Once it had been decided to develop the route as an expressway, all intersecting highways should be terminated, rerouted or provided with a grade separation. The proposed corridor was access-controlled and limited access was to be provided at National Highway/SHI Major road crossings. A 2-lane service roads designed to carry two-way traffic, were proposed on both sides of the corridor. Low level underpasses were to be provided for connecting both the service roads at every 1\u20132&nbsp;km, where the terrain permits.\n\n==Opening timeline==\n* '''14 November 2008:''' Gachibowli \u2013 Narsingi \u2013 Shamshabad (for [[Hyderabad International Airport]]) (22&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=First phase of Hyderabad Outer Ring Road thrown open|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/first-phase-of-hyderabad-outer-ring-road-thrown-open_100119211.html|website=Thaindian News}}</ref>\n* '''7 July 2010:''' Shamshabad \u2013 Pedda Amberpet (38&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=For smooth traffic flow|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-logistics/article997944.ece|website=The Hindu Business Line|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n* '''14 August 2011:''' Narsingi \u2013 Patancheru (23.7&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=Narsingi-Patancheru ORR stretch opened|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/narsingi-patancheru-orr-stretch-opened-392094.html|website=IBNLive|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n* '''3 December 2012:''' (part completed in '''27 April 2018''') Patancheru \u2013 Gowdavalli, and Kandlakoya \u2013 Shamirpet (38&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=Another Outer Ring Road stretch to be opened today|work=The Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Another-Outer-Ring-Road-stretch-to-be-opened-today/articleshow/17458309.cms|date=2 December 2012}}</ref>\n* '''4 March 2015:''' Pedda Amberpet \u2013 Ghatkesar (14&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=ORR: Pedda Amberpet-Ghatkesar stretch opens|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/orr-pedda-amberpetghatkesar-stretch-opens/article6961303.ece|website=The Hindu|accessdate=5 January 2016|language=en-IN|date=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n* '''15 July 2016:'''  Ghatkesar \u2013 Shameerpet (23&nbsp;km)<ref>{{cite web|title=ORR: Ghatkesar \u2013 Shameerpet stretch opens|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/two-packages-of-hyderabad-orr-inaugurated-116071500760_1.html|website=TOI|accessdate=5 July 2016|language=en-IN|date=15 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Work to be Resumed on ORR Kandlakoya Interchange|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/Work-to-be-Resumed-on-ORR-Kandlakoya-Interchange/2015/10/24/article3094407.ece|website=The New Indian Express|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Land Acquisition==\nThe First Phase land required was {{convert|750|acre|km2}}, out of which the private land acquired was {{convert|500|acre|km2}}.
