Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.\n\n==Etymology and basic philosophy==\n[[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px|\"Aikid\u014d\" written with \"[[Qi|ki]]\" in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]]\n\nThe word \"aikido\" is formed of three [[kanji]]:\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ai''&nbsp;\u2013 joining, unifying, combining, fitting\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ki''&nbsp;\u2013 spirit, energy, mood, morale\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d''&nbsp;\u2013 way, path\n\nThe term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\" or \"Way of unifying energy\", in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last         = Pranin\n |first        = Stanley\n |title        = Aiki\n |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n |year         = 2007\n |url          = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |accessdate   = 21 August 2007\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |archivedate  = 26 September 2007\n |url-status      = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]]\nAikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 14 December 1883&nbsp;\u2013 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=O-Sensei \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |archivedate=26 August 2014 \n |df= \n}}</ref> The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century.<ref>Draeger, Donn F.

At that time Ueshiba referred to his martial art as '''\"Aiki Bud\u014d\"'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name=\"Aikido\"/>\n\n===Religious influences===\n[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Onisaburo Deguchi]]\nAfter Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Oomoto Foundation\n| title = The Teachings\n| work = Teachings and Scriptures\n| publisher = Netinformational Commission\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| accessdate = 14 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| archivedate= 13 August 2007 \n| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

Designated the \"Official Delegate for Europe and Africa\" by Morihei Ueshiba, [[Masamichi Noro]] arrived in France in September 1961. [[Seiichi Sugano]] was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.\n\n===Proliferation of independent organizations===\n{{further|Aikido styles}}\n{{see also|List of aikidoka|l1=List of aikid\u014dka}}\n\nThe largest aikido organization is the [[Aikikai Foundation]], which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family.

Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n==Ki==\n[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido. The term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}. It was written as {{lang|ja|\u6c23}} until the [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|writing reforms after World War II]], and this older form still is seen on occasion.\n\nThe character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|\"health\"|\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"shyness\"|\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This concept was known as [[Takemusu]] Aiki, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'', with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development ranked separately.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training.

In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] or [[pilates]]. For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|\u6e96\u5099\u4f53\u64cd|''junbi tais\u014d''}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |last=Pranin  |first=Stanley  |title=Jumbi Taiso  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido  |year=2006  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190245/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340  |archivedate=16 October 2007  |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Roles of ''uke'' and ''tori''===\nAikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique\u2014the {{lang|ja|\u53d6\u308a}} ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|\u4ed5\u624b}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|\u6295\u3052}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name=\"afl2\"/>\n\nBoth halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''tori'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name=\"afl2\"/> Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed.

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend the movement of ''tori'' with the movement of ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px\"\n|-\n! rank !! belt !! color !! type\n|-\n| ''ky\u016b'' || [[File:Judo white belt.svg|65px]] || white || ''mudansha'' / ''y\u016bky\u016bsha''\n|-\n| ''dan'' || [[File:Judo black belt.svg|65px]] || black || ''y\u016bdansha''\n|}\n\nThe uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.

In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training. The attacks initiated by ''uke'' (and which ''tori'' must defend against) have been criticized as being \"weak\", \"sloppy\", and \"little more than caricatures of an attack\".<ref name=\"Pranin-aikido today\">{{cite journal| last = Pranin| first = Stanley| title = Aikido Practice Today| journal = Aiki News| volume = 86| publisher = Aiki News| date = Fall 1990| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| accessdate = 2 November 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231252/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| archivedate = 21 November 2007| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Ledyard| first = George S.| title = Non-Traditional Attacks| work = aikiweb.com|date=June 2002| url = http://www.aikiweb.com/training/ledyard3.html| accessdate = 29 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080725060329/http://www.aikiweb.com/training/ledyard3.html| archivedate= 25 July 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Weak attacks from ''uke'' allow for a conditioned response from ''tori'', and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.<ref name=\"Pranin-aikido today\"/> To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners.

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.

Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.\n\n==Etymology and basic philosophy==\n[[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px|\"Aikid\u014d\" written with \"[[Qi|ki]]\" in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]]\n\nThe word \"aikido\" is formed of three [[kanji]]:\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ai''&nbsp;\u2013 joining, unifying, combining, fitting\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ki''&nbsp;\u2013 spirit, energy, mood, morale\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d''&nbsp;\u2013 way, path\n\nThe term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\" or \"Way of unifying energy\", in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last         = Pranin\n |first        = Stanley\n |title        = Aiki\n |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n |year         = 2007\n |url          = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |accessdate   = 21 August 2007\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |archivedate  = 26 September 2007\n |url-status      = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]]\nAikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 14 December 1883&nbsp;\u2013 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=O-Sensei \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |archivedate=26 August 2014 \n |df= \n}}</ref> The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century.<ref>Draeger, Donn F.

Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the [[spear]] ({{transl|ja|''[[yari]]''}}), short [[Stick fighting|staff]] ({{transl|ja|''[[j\u014d]]''}}), and possibly the {{Nihongo|[[bayonet]]|\u9283\u5263|j\u016bken}}.

At that time Ueshiba referred to his martial art as '''\"Aiki Bud\u014d\"'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name=\"Aikido\"/>\n\n===Religious influences===\n[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Onisaburo Deguchi]]\nAfter Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Oomoto Foundation\n| title = The Teachings\n| work = Teachings and Scriptures\n| publisher = Netinformational Commission\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| accessdate = 14 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| archivedate= 13 August 2007 \n| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

This trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by [[Hiroshi Tada]]; and Germany in 1965 by [[Katsuaki Asai]]. Designated the \"Official Delegate for Europe and Africa\" by Morihei Ueshiba, [[Masamichi Noro]] arrived in France in September 1961. [[Seiichi Sugano]] was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.\n\n===Proliferation of independent organizations===\n{{further|Aikido styles}}\n{{see also|List of aikidoka|l1=List of aikid\u014dka}}\n\nThe largest aikido organization is the [[Aikikai Foundation]], which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has developed into many styles, most of which were formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nThe earliest independent styles to emerge were [[Yoseikan Aikido]], begun by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] in 1931,<ref name=\"Mochizuki\"/> [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido, founded by [[Gozo Shioda]] in 1955,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Yoshinkan Aikido \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225749/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |archivedate=26 September 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> and [[Shodokan Aikido]], founded by [[Kenji Tomiki]] in 1967.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite book\n| last = Shishido\n| first = Fumiaki\n| authorlink = Fumiaki Shishida\n|last2=Nariyama\n|first2=Tetsuro\n|authorlink2= Tetsuro Nariyama\n| title = Aikido: Tradition and the Competitive Edge\n| publisher = Shodokan Publishing USA\n| year = 2002\n| isbn = 978-0-9647083-2-7\n}}</ref> The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n==Ki==\n[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido. The term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}. It was written as {{lang|ja|\u6c23}} until the [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|writing reforms after World War II]], and this older form still is seen on occasion.\n\nThe character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|\"health\"|\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"shyness\"|\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This concept was known as [[Takemusu]] Aiki, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'', with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development ranked separately.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and [[Physical exercise|conditioning]], as well as specific techniques.<ref name=\"AFL\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma\n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/aikidoforlife0000homm/page/20 20]\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://archive.org/details/aikidoforlife0000homm/page/20\n}}</ref> Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of [[throw (grappling)|throws]], beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.<ref name=\"AFL\"/> The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and [[Pinning hold|pins]]. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.\n\n===Fitness===\n[[File:A\u00efkido-shihoo nage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Uke (martial arts)|Ukemi]] ({{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u8eab}}) is very important for safe practice]]\nPhysical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[endurance]], with less emphasis on [[strength training]]. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] or [[pilates]]. For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|\u6e96\u5099\u4f53\u64cd|''junbi tais\u014d''}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |last=Pranin  |first=Stanley  |title=Jumbi Taiso  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido  |year=2006  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190245/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340  |archivedate=16 October 2007  |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Roles of ''uke'' and ''tori''===\nAikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique\u2014the {{lang|ja|\u53d6\u308a}} ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|\u4ed5\u624b}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|\u6295\u3052}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name=\"afl2\"/>\n\nBoth halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''tori'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name=\"afl2\"/> Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed. It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab face strike'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a\u9762\u6253\u3061|kata-dori men-uchi}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest grab'''|\u80f8\u53d6\u308a|mune-dori or muna-dori}}, when the lapel is grabbed; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"collar grab\"|\u895f\u53d6\u308a|eri-dori}}.\n\n===Basic techniques===\n{{main|Aikido techniques}}\n[[File:Aikido ikkyo.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of ''ikky\u014d'', or \"first technique\".

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend the movement of ''tori'' with the movement of ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px\"\n|-\n! rank !! belt !! color !! type\n|-\n| ''ky\u016b'' || [[File:Judo white belt.svg|65px]] || white || ''mudansha'' / ''y\u016bky\u016bsha''\n|-\n| ''dan'' || [[File:Judo black belt.svg|65px]] || black || ''y\u016bdansha''\n|}\n\nThe uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.

In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.

Discoveries of physics find applications throughout the [[natural science]]s and in [[technology]], since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world. Some other domains of study\u2014more limited in their scope\u2014may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right. Physics today may be divided loosely into [[classical physics]] and [[modern physics]].\n== Ancient history ==\n{{further|History of astronomy}}\n\nElements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[mechanics]], which were methodologically united through the study of [[geometry]]. These mathematical disciplines began in [[Ancient history|antiquity]] with the [[Babylonia]]ns and with [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] writers such as [[Archimedes]] and [[Ptolemy]]. [[Ancient philosophy]], meanwhile&nbsp;\u2013 including what was called \"[[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 focused on explaining nature through ideas such as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotle#Causality, the four causes|four types of \"cause\"]].\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nThe move towards a rational understanding of nature began at least since the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in Greece (650\u2013480 [[BCE]]) with the [[Presocratics|Pre-Socratic philosophers]].  The philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed \"the Father of Science\" for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural [[phenomenon|phenomena]], proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.<ref>\"This shift from ecclesiastical reasoning to scientific reasoning marked the beginning of scientific methodology.\" Singer, C., ''A Short History of Science to the 19th Century'',  Streeter Press, 2008, p. 35.</ref> Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is [[Arche|the basic element]], experimenting with the attraction between [[magnet]]s and rubbed [[amber]] and formulating the first recorded [[Cosmology|cosmologies]]. [[Anaximander]], famous for his proto-[[evolution]]ary theory, disputed Thales' ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' was the building block of all matter. Around 500 BCE, [[Heraclitus]] proposed that the only basic law governing the [[Universe]] was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. This observation made him one of the first scholars in ancient physics to address the role of [[time]] in the universe, a key and sometimes contentious concept in modern and present-day physics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The early physicist [[Leucippus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] first half of the 5th century BCE) adamantly opposed the idea of direct [[Divine providence|divine intervention]] in the universe, proposing instead that natural phenomena had a natural cause. Leucippus and his student [[Democritus]] were the first to develop the theory of [[atomism]], the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called [[atom]]s.\n\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Aristotle]]<br/>(384\u2013322 [[BCE]])]]\n\nDuring the [[Classical Greece|classical period]] in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]], [[natural philosophy]] slowly developed into an exciting and contentious field of study. [[Aristotle]] ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2}}, ''Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s'') (384 \u2013 322 BCE), a student of [[Plato]], promoted the concept that observation of physical phenomena could ultimately lead to the discovery of the natural laws governing them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Aristotle's writings cover physics, [[metaphysics]], [[poetry]], [[theater]], [[music]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], [[politics]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[ethics]], [[biology]] and [[zoology]]. He wrote the first work which refers to that line of study as \"Physics\"&nbsp;\u2013 in the 4th century BCE, Aristotle founded the system known as [[Aristotelian physics]]. He attempted to explain ideas such as [[motion (physics)|motion]] (and [[gravity]]) with the theory of [[classical elements|four elements]]. Aristotle believed that all matter was made up of aether, or some combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. According to Aristotle, these four terrestrial elements are capable of inter-transformation and move toward their natural place, so a stone falls downward toward the center of the cosmos, but flames rise upward toward the [[circumference]]. Eventually, [[Aristotelian physics]] became enormously popular for many centuries in Europe, informing the scientific and scholastic developments of the [[Middle Ages]]. It remained the mainstream scientific paradigm in Europe until the time of [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]].\n\nEarly in Classical Greece, knowledge that the Earth is [[Sphere|spherical]] (\"round\") was common. Around 240 BCE, as the result of [[Eratosthenes#Measurement of the Earth's circumference|a seminal experiment]], [[Eratosthenes]] (276\u2013194 BCE) accurately estimated its circumference. In contrast to Aristotle's geocentric views, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2}}; c.310&nbsp;\u2013 c.230 BCE) presented an explicit argument for a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[Solar system]], i.e. for placing the [[Sun]], not the [[Earth]], at its centre. [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a follower of Aristarchus' heliocentric theory, stated that [[Axial tilt|the Earth rotated around its own axis]], which, in turn, [[Orbit|revolved around]] the Sun. Though the arguments he used were lost, [[Plutarch]] stated that Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning.\n\n[[File:Domenico-Fetti Archimedes 1620.jpg|thumb|180x|The ancient Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]], famous for his ideas regarding [[fluid mechanics]] and [[buoyancy]].]]\n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]] ({{lang-el|[[wikt:\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2|\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2]]}} (287\u2013212 BCE)&nbsp;\u2013 generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time&nbsp;\u2013 laid the foundations of [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[statics]] and calculated the underlying mathematics of the [[lever]]. A leading scientist of classical antiquity, Archimedes also developed elaborate systems of pulleys to move large objects with a minimum of effort. The [[Archimedes' screw]] underpins modern hydroengineering, and his machines of war helped to hold back the armies of Rome in the [[First Punic War]]. Archimedes even tore apart the arguments of Aristotle and his metaphysics, pointing out that it was impossible to separate mathematics and nature and proved it by converting mathematical theories into practical inventions. Furthermore, in his work ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'', around 250 BCE, Archimedes developed the law of [[buoyancy]], also known as [[Archimedes' principle]]. In mathematics, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[pi]]. He also defined the [[Archimedean spiral|spiral bearing his name]], formulae for the [[volume]]s of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers. He also developed the principles of equilibrium states and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]], ideas that would influence the well known scholars, Galileo, and Newton.\n\n[[Hipparchus]] (190\u2013120 BCE), focusing on astronomy and mathematics, used sophisticated geometrical techniques to map the motion of the stars and [[planet]]s, even predicting the times that [[Solar eclipse]]s would happen. In addition, he added calculations of the distance of the Sun and Moon from the Earth, based upon his improvements to the observational instruments used at that time. Another of the most famous of the early physicists was [[Ptolemy]] (90\u2013168 CE), one of the leading minds during the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Ptolemy was the author of several scientific treatises, at least three of which were of continuing importance to later Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'' (in Greek, \u1f29 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"The Great Treatise\", originally \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"Mathematical Treatise\"). The second is the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the [[Greco-Roman world]].\n\nMuch of the accumulated knowledge of the ancient world was lost. Even of the works of the better known thinkers, few fragments survived. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, almost nothing of [[Hipparchus]]' direct work survived.

The last minuscule particle of matter that could not be subdivided further was termed [[Atom|Parmanu]]. These philosophers considered the atom to be indestructible and hence eternal. The Buddhists thought atoms to be minute objects unable to be seen to the naked eye that come into being and vanish in an instant. The [[Vaisheshika]] school of philosophers believed that an atom was a mere point in [[space]]. It was also first to depict relations between motion and force applied. Indian theories about the atom are greatly abstract and enmeshed in philosophy as they were based on logic and not on personal experience or experimentation.

In heliocentric models of the Solar system, the Earth orbits the Sun along with other bodies in [[Milky Way|Earth's]] [[galaxy]], a contradiction according to the Greek-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy (2nd century CE; see above), [[Ptolemaic system|whose system]] placed the Earth at the center of the Universe and had been accepted for over 1,400 years. The Greek astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] (c.310&nbsp;\u2013 c.230 BCE) had suggested that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but Copernicus' reasoning led to lasting general acceptance of this \"revolutionary\" idea. Copernicus' book presenting the theory (''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', \"On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres\") was published just before his death in 1543 and, as it is now generally considered to mark the beginning of modern astronomy, is also considered to mark the beginning of the Scientific revolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Copernicus' new perspective, along with the accurate observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]], enabled German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571\u20131630) to formulate [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|his laws regarding planetary motion]] that remain in use today.\n\n===Galileo Galilei===\n{{main|Galileo Galilei}}\n[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], early proponent of the modern scientific worldview and method <br/>(1564\u20131642)]]\nThe Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642) was the central figure in the Scientific revolution and famous for his support for Copernicanism, his astronomical discoveries, empirical experiments and his improvement of the telescope. As a mathematician, Galileo's role in the [[History of European research universities|university]] culture of his era was subordinated to the three major topics of study: [[law]], [[medicine]], and [[theology]] (which was closely allied to philosophy).  Galileo, however, felt that the descriptive content of the technical disciplines warranted philosophical interest, particularly because mathematical analysis of astronomical observations&nbsp;\u2013 notably, Copernicus' analysis of the [[relative motion]]s of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets&nbsp;\u2013 indicated that philosophers' statements about the nature of the universe could be shown to be in error.  Galileo also performed mechanical experiments, insisting that motion itself&nbsp;\u2013 regardless of whether it was produced \"naturally\" or \"artificially\" (i.e. deliberately)&nbsp;\u2013 had universally consistent characteristics that could be described mathematically.\n\nGalileo's early studies at the [[University of Pisa]] were in medicine, but he was soon drawn to mathematics and physics. At 19, he discovered (and, [[Galileo Galilei#Career as a scientist|subsequently, verified]]) the [[:wikt:isochronal|isochronal]] nature of the [[pendulum]] when, using his pulse, he timed the oscillations of a swinging lamp in [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Pisa's cathedral]] and found that it remained the same for each swing regardless of the swing's [[amplitude]]. He soon became known through his invention of a [[hydrostatic balance]] and for his treatise on the [[Center of mass#Center of gravity|center of gravity]] of solid bodies. While teaching at the University of Pisa (1589\u201392), he initiated his experiments concerning the laws of bodies in motion that brought results so contradictory to the accepted teachings of Aristotle that strong antagonism was aroused. He found that bodies do not fall with velocities [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to their weights. The famous story in which Galileo is said to have [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped weights from]] the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] is apocryphal, but he did find that the [[Ballistic trajectory|path of a projectile]] is a [[parabola]] and is credited with conclusions that anticipated [[Newton's laws of motion]] (e.g. the notion of [[inertia]]).

This tradition, combining with the non-mathematical emphasis on the collection of \"experimental histories\" by philosophical reformists such as [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] and [[Francis Bacon]], drew a significant following in the years leading up to and following Galileo's death, including [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and the participants in the [[Accademia del Cimento]] in Italy; [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] in France; [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the Netherlands; and [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]] in England.\n\n===Ren\u00e9 Descartes===\n{{main|Ren\u00e9 Descartes}}\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]<br/>(1596\u20131650)]]\nThe French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) was well-connected to, and influential within, the experimental philosophy networks of the day. Descartes had a more ambitious agenda, however, which was geared toward replacing the Scholastic philosophical tradition altogether. Questioning the reality interpreted through the senses, Descartes sought to re-establish philosophical explanatory schemes by reducing all perceived phenomena to being attributable to the motion of an invisible sea of \"corpuscles\". (Notably, he reserved human thought and [[God]] from his scheme, holding these to be separate from the physical universe). In proposing this philosophical framework, Descartes supposed that different kinds of motion, such as that of planets versus that of terrestrial objects, were not fundamentally different, but were merely different manifestations of an endless chain of corpuscular motions obeying universal principles. Particularly influential were his explanations for circular astronomical motions in terms of the vortex motion of corpuscles in space (Descartes argued, in accord with the beliefs, if not the methods, of the Scholastics, that a [[vacuum]] could not exist), and his explanation of [[gravity]] in terms of corpuscles pushing objects downward.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Shea|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1992}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Gaukroger|2002}}</ref>\n\nDescartes, like Galileo, was convinced of the importance of mathematical explanation, and he and his followers were key figures in the development of mathematics and geometry in the 17th century. Cartesian mathematical descriptions of motion held that all mathematical formulations had to be justifiable in terms of direct physical action, a position held by [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] and the German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who, while following in the Cartesian tradition, developed his own philosophical alternative to Scholasticism, which he outlined in his 1714 work, ''[[The Monadology]]''. Descartes has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy', and much subsequent [[Western philosophy]] is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. In particular, his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] \u2014 allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two-dimensional coordinate system \u2014 was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[analytical geometry]], the bridge between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], important to the discovery of [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].\n\n===Isaac Newton===\n{{main|Isaac Newton|History of classical mechanics}}\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir [[Isaac Newton]]<br/>(1642\u20131727)]]\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries saw the achievements of the greatest figure of the Scientific revolution: [[Cambridge University]] physicist and mathematician [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642-1727), considered by many to be the greatest and most influential scientist who ever lived. Newton, a fellow of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of England]], combined his own discoveries in mechanics and astronomy to earlier ones to create a single system for describing the workings of the universe. Newton formulated [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]] which formulated the relationship between motion and objects and also the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], the latter of which could be used to explain the behavior not only of falling bodies on the earth but also planets and other celestial bodies. To arrive at his results, Newton invented one form of an entirely new branch of mathematics: [[calculus]] (also invented independently by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]), which was to become an essential tool in much of the later development in most branches of physics. Newton's findings were set forth in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), the publication of which in 1687 marked the beginning of the modern period of mechanics and astronomy.\n\nNewton was able to refute the Cartesian mechanical tradition that all motions should be explained with respect to the immediate force exerted by corpuscles. Using his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation, Newton removed the idea that objects followed paths determined by natural shapes and instead demonstrated that not only regularly observed paths, but all the future motions of any body could be deduced mathematically based on knowledge of their existing motion, their [[mass]], and the [[force]]s acting upon them.  However, observed celestial motions did not precisely conform to a Newtonian treatment, and Newton, who was also deeply interested in [[theology]], imagined that God intervened to ensure the continued stability of the solar system.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]<br/>(1646\u20131716)]]\n\nNewton's principles (but not his mathematical treatments) proved controversial with Continental philosophers, who found his lack of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanation for movement and gravitation philosophically unacceptable. Beginning around 1700, a bitter rift opened between the Continental and British philosophical traditions, which were stoked by heated, ongoing, and viciously personal disputes between the followers of Newton and Leibniz concerning priority over the analytical techniques of [[calculus]], which each had developed independently. Initially, the Cartesian and Leibnizian traditions prevailed on the Continent (leading to the dominance of the Leibnizian calculus notation everywhere except Britain).  Newton himself remained privately disturbed at the lack of a philosophical understanding of gravitation while insisting in his writings that none was necessary to infer its reality.  As the 18th century progressed, Continental natural philosophers increasingly accepted the Newtonians' willingness to forgo [[Ontology|ontological]] metaphysical explanations for mathematically described motions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hall|1980}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Bertolini Meli|1993}}</ref><ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\">{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1999}}</ref>\n\nNewton built the first functioning [[reflecting telescope]]<ref name=\"Wilson2013\">{{cite book |author=Raymond N.

While Newton explained light as being composed of tiny particles, a rival theory of light which explained its behavior in terms of waves was presented in 1690 by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. However, the belief in the mechanistic philosophy coupled with Newton's reputation meant that the wave theory saw relatively little support until the 19th century. Newton also formulated [[Newton's law of cooling|an empirical law of cooling]], studied the [[speed of sound]], investigated [[power series]], demonstrated the [[Binomial theorem|generalised binomial theorem]] and developed [[Newton's method|a method]] for approximating the [[Root of a function|roots of a function]]. His work on infinite series was inspired by [[Simon Stevin]]'s decimals.<ref>{{citation |last1=B\u0142aszczyk |first1=Piotr |author1-link= |last2=Katz |first2=Mikhail |author2-link=Mikhail Katz |last3=Sherry |first3=David |author3-link= |arxiv=1202.4153 |doi=10.1007/s10699-012-9285-8 |issue= |journal=[[Foundations of Science]] |pages= 43\u201374|title=Ten misconceptions from the history of analysis and their debunking |volume= 18|year=2012|bibcode=2012arXiv1202.4153B }}</ref> Most importantly, Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, which were neither capricious nor malevolent. By demonstrating the consistency between [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] and his own theory of gravitation, Newton also removed the last doubts about heliocentrism. By bringing together all the ideas set forth during the Scientific revolution, Newton effectively established the foundation for modern society in mathematics and science.\n\n===Other achievements===\nOther branches of physics also received attention during the period of the Scientific revolution. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]], court physician to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627\u201391) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the [[Boyle's law|gas law named for him]]; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the [[Royal Society of England]] (1660) and the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences in France]] (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as [[John Wallis]], [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|William Brouncker]], [[Thomas Sydenham]], [[John Mayow]], and [[Christopher Wren]] (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, [[James Bernoulli]] showed that the [[cycloid]] is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, [[Johann Bernoulli]] showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a [[catenary]], the curve with the lowest possible [[center of gravity]] available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the [[brachistochrone]] problem.\n\n====Early thermodynamics====\nA precursor of the engine was designed by the German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] who, in 1650, designed and built the world's first [[vacuum pump]] and created the world's first ever [[vacuum]] known as the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment.  He was driven to make a vacuum to disprove [[Aristotle]]'s long-held supposition that [[Horror vacui (physics)|'Nature abhors a vacuum']]. Shortly thereafter, Irish physicist and chemist Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation for a gas: ''PV'' = ''k'', where ''P'' is [[pressure]], ''V'' is [[volume]] and ''k'' is a constant: this relationship is known as [[Boyle's Law]]. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later.  Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.<ref>New Experiments physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects (1660). [http://www.imss.fi.it/vuoto/eboyle.html]</ref> Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave [[Gay-Lussac]] the opportunity to derive [[Gay-Lussac's law|his law]], which led shortly later to the [[ideal gas law]].  But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine.  He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. Hence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the [[steam engine|Savery Engine]], horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen Engine]], and later the [[Watt steam engine|Watt Engine]]. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses.  Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input [[fuel]] into useful work.  In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output.  Hence the need for a new science of engine [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] was born.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 18th-century developments ==\n[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Alessandro Volta]]<br/>(1745\u20131827)]]\nDuring the 18th century, the mechanics founded by Newton was developed by several scientists as more mathematicians learned calculus and elaborated upon its initial formulation. The application of mathematical analysis to problems of motion was known as rational mechanics, or mixed mathematics (and was later termed [[classical mechanics]]).\n\n===Mechanics===\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Bernoulli, Daniel (1700-1782)-Portrait-Portr 10971.tif (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]<br/>(1700\u20131782)]]\nIn 1714, [[Brook Taylor]] derived the [[fundamental frequency]] of a stretched vibrating string in terms of its tension and mass per unit length by solving a [[differential equation]]. The Swiss mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700\u20131782) made important mathematical studies of the behavior of gases, anticipating the kinetic theory of gases developed more than a century later, and has been referred to as the first mathematical physicist.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Darrigol|2005}}</ref> In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli derived the fundamental frequency and [[harmonic]]s of a hanging chain by solving a differential equation. In 1734, Bernoulli solved the differential equation for the vibrations of an elastic bar clamped at one end. Bernoulli's treatment of [[fluid dynamics]] and his examination of [[fluid]] flow was introduced in his 1738 work ''[[Hydrodynamica]]''.\n\nRational mechanics dealt primarily with the development of elaborate mathematical treatments of observed motions, using Newtonian principles as a basis, and emphasized improving the tractability of complex calculations and developing of legitimate means of analytical approximation. A representative contemporary textbook was published by [[Johann Baptiste Horvath]]. By the end of the century analytical treatments were rigorous enough to verify the stability of the [[solar system]] solely on the basis of Newton's laws without reference to divine intervention\u2014even as deterministic treatments of systems as simple as the [[n-body problem|three body problem]] in gravitation remained intractable.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bos|1980}}</ref> In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] predicted the periodicity of [[Halley's Comet]], [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] in 1781, and [[Henry Cavendish]] measured the [[gravitational constant]] and determined the mass of the Earth in 1798. In 1783, [[John Michell]] suggested that some objects might be so massive that not even light could escape from them.\n\nIn 1739, [[Leonhard Euler]] solved the ordinary differential equation for a forced harmonic oscillator and noticed the resonance phenomenon. In 1742, [[Colin Maclaurin]] discovered his [[Maclaurin spheroid|uniformly rotating self-gravitating spheroids]]. In 1742, Benjamin Robins published his ''New Principles in Gunnery'', establishing the science of aerodynamics. British work, carried on by mathematicians such as Taylor and Maclaurin, fell behind Continental developments as the century progressed. Meanwhile, work flourished at scientific academies on the Continent, led by such mathematicians as Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]]. In 1743, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] published his ''Traite de Dynamique'', in which he introduced the concept of generalized forces for accelerating systems and systems with constraints, and applied the new idea of [[virtual work]] to solve dynamical problem, now known as [[D'Alembert's principle]], as a rival to Newton's second law of motion. In 1747, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] applied minimum principles to mechanics. In 1759, Euler solved the partial differential equation for the vibration of a rectangular drum. In 1764, Euler examined the partial differential equation for the vibration of a circular drum and found one of the Bessel function solutions. In 1776, [[John Smeaton]] published a paper on experiments relating power, [[work (physics)|work]], [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]], and supporting the [[conservation of energy]]. In 1788, Joseph Louis Lagrange presented [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations of motion]] in ''M\u00e9canique Analytique'', in which the whole of mechanics was organized around the principle of virtual work. In 1789, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] states the law of [[conservation of mass]]. The rational mechanics developed in the 18th century received a brilliant exposition in both Lagrange's 1788 work and the ''Celestial Mechanics'' (1799\u20131825) of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nDuring the 18th century, thermodynamics was developed through the theories of weightless [[imponderable fluid|\"imponderable fluids\"]], such as heat (\"caloric\"), [[electricity]], and [[phlogiston theory|phlogiston]] (which was rapidly overthrown as a concept following [[Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] identification of [[oxygen]] gas late in the century).  Assuming that these concepts were real fluids, their flow could be traced through a mechanical apparatus or chemical reactions.  This tradition of experimentation led to the development of new kinds of experimental apparatus, such as the [[Leyden Jar]]; and new kinds of measuring instruments, such as the [[calorimeter]], and improved versions of old ones, such as the [[thermometer]].  Experiments also produced new concepts, such as the [[University of Glasgow]] experimenter [[Joseph Black]]'s notion of [[latent heat]] and Philadelphia intellectual [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s characterization of electrical fluid as flowing between places of excess and deficit (a concept later reinterpreted in terms of positive and negative [[electric charge|charges]]). Franklin also showed that lightning is electricity in 1752.\n\nThe accepted theory of heat in the 18th century viewed it as a kind of fluid, called [[caloric theory|caloric]]; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including [[Joseph Black]] (1728\u201399) and [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat is due to the motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]), who found a direct relationship between heat and mechanical energy.\n\nWhile it was recognized early in the 18th century that finding absolute theories of electrostatic and magnetic force akin to Newton's principles of motion would be an important achievement, none were forthcoming.  This impossibility only slowly disappeared as experimental practice became more widespread and more refined in the early years of the 19th century in places such as the newly established [[Royal Institution]] in London. Meanwhile, the analytical methods of rational mechanics began to be applied to experimental phenomena, most influentially with the French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]]'s analytical treatment of the flow of heat, as published in 1822.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Heilbron|1979}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Golinski|1999}}</ref> [[Joseph Priestley]] proposed an electrical inverse-square law in 1767, and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] introduced the inverse-square law of [[electrostatics]] in 1798.\n\nAt the end of the century, the members of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] had attained clear dominance in the field.<ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\" /><ref>{{Harvtxt|Greenberg|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1999}}</ref> At the same time, the experimental tradition established by Galileo and his followers persisted.  The [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] were major centers for the performance and reporting of experimental work. Experiments in mechanics, optics, [[magnetism]], [[static electricity]], [[history of chemistry|chemistry]], and [[physiology]] were not clearly distinguished from each other during the 18th century, but significant differences in explanatory schemes and, thus, experiment design were emerging.  Chemical experimenters, for instance, defied attempts to enforce a scheme of abstract Newtonian forces onto chemical affiliations, and instead focused on the isolation and classification of chemical substances and reactions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ben-Chaim|2004}}</ref>\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 19th century ==\n[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Michael Faraday]]<br/>(1791\u20131867)]]\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the electric battery (known of the [[voltaic pile]]) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be studied. A year later, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] demonstrated the wave nature of light\u2014which received strong experimental support from the work of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]\u2014and the principle of interference. In 1813, [[Peter Ewart]] supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper ''On the measure of moving force''. In 1820, [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] found that a current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after \u00d8rsted's discovery reached France, [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1821, [[Michael Faraday]] built an electricity-powered motor, while [[Georg Ohm]] stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. A year later, botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] discovered [[Brownian motion]]: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid.  In 1829, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] introduced the terms of [[Work (physics)|work]] (force times distance) and [[kinetic energy]] with the meanings they have today.\n\nIn 1831, Faraday (and independently [[Joseph Henry]]) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric potential or current through magnetism&nbsp;\u2013 known as [[Faraday's law of induction|electromagnetic induction]]; these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric generator, respectively. In 1834, [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids (the [[Jacobi ellipsoid]]). In 1834, [[John Scott Russell|John Russell]] observed a nondecaying solitary water wave ([[soliton]]) in the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] near [[Edinburgh]] and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, William Hamilton stated [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's canonical equations of motion]]. In the same year, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the [[Coriolis effect]]. In 1841, [[Julius Robert von Mayer]], an [[amateur]] scientist, wrote a paper on the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1842, [[Christian Doppler]] proposed the [[Doppler effect]]. In 1847, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] formally stated the law of conservation of energy. In 1851, [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] showed the Earth's rotation with a huge [[pendulum]] ([[Foucault pendulum]]).\n\nThere were important advances in [[continuum mechanics]] in the first half of the century, namely formulation of [[elastic modulus|laws of elasticity]] for solids and discovery of [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for fluids.\n\n===Laws of thermodynamics===\n{{further|History of thermodynamics}}\n\n[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|right|{{nowrap|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]]<br/>(1824\u20131907)}}]]\n\nIn the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] and [[James Prescott Joule]], who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the [[first law of thermodynamics]]\u2014a restatement of the [[law of conservation of energy]]\u2014which was stated around 1850 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later known as Lord Kelvin, and [[Rudolf Clausius]]. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of [[Lazare Carnot]], Sadi Carnot, and [[\u00c9mile Clapeyron]]\u2013as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work\u2014to formulate the first law.\n\nKelvin and Clausius also stated the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]'s influential work ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy'') and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law was the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] measured the [[speed of light]] in water and find that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the [[Joule\u2013Thomson effect]] or Joule\u2013Kelvin effect. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] puts forward the idea of the [[heat death of the universe]] in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of ''dQ/T'' ([[Clausius's theorem]]) (though he did not yet name the quantity).\n\n===Statistical mechanics (a fundamentally new approach to science)===\n{{further|History of statistical mechanics}}\n\n[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumb|180px|left|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]<br/>(1831\u20131879)]]\n\nIn 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|distribution law of molecular velocities]]. Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields are propagated outward from their source at a speed equal to that of light and that light is one of several kinds of electromagnetic radiation, differing only in frequency and wavelength from the others. In 1859, Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas. The wave theory of light was widely accepted by the time of Maxwell's work on the electromagnetic field, and afterward the study of light and that of electricity and magnetism were closely related. In 1864 James Maxwell published his papers on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, and stated that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon in the 1873 publication of Maxwell's ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''. This work drew upon theoretical work by German theoreticians such as [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]]. The encapsulation of heat in particulate motion, and the addition of electromagnetic forces to Newtonian dynamics established an enormously robust theoretical underpinning to physical observations.\n\nThe prediction that light represented a transmission of energy in wave form through a \"[[Luminiferous aether|luminiferous ether]]\", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s 1888 detection of [[electromagnetic radiation]], was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field could soon be developed.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1985}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|JungnickelMcCormmach|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Hunt|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1994}}</ref> Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, at the same time foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices.

Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the dissipation of energy to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term \"[[entropy]]\" to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as \"[[Maxwell's demon]]\"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|Wise|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1998}}</ref> In 1902, [[James Jeans]] found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 20th century: birth of modern physics ==\n<!-- [[Template:Modern physics]] links here -->\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]]<br/>(1867\u20131934)]]\n{{see also|Modern physics}}\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, physics had evolved to the point at which [[classical mechanics]] could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories\u2014the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear\u2014and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in [[blackbody radiation]] and the [[photoelectric effect]], while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Emil Cohn]], [[Ernst Wiechert]] and [[Wilhelm Wien]] believed that some modification of [[Maxwell's equations]] might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of [[classical physics]] were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as [[modern physics]].<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Agar|2012\">{{Harvtxt|Agar|2012}}</ref>\n\n===Radiation experiments===\n[[File:J.J Thomson.jpg|thumb|200px|[[J. J. Thomson]] (1856\u20131940) discovered the [[electron]] and [[Isotope|isotopy]] and also invented the [[mass spectrometer]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1906.]]\nIn the 19th century, experimenters began to detect unexpected forms of radiation: [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]] caused a sensation with his discovery of [[X-ray]]s in 1895; in 1896 [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that certain kinds of matter emit radiation on their own accord. In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]], and new radioactive elements found by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] raised questions about the supposedly indestructible atom and the nature of matter. Marie and Pierre coined the term \"[[radioactive decay|radioactivity]]\" to describe this property of matter, and isolated the radioactive elements [[radium]] and [[polonium]]. [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] identified two of Becquerel's forms of radiation with electrons and the element [[helium]]. Rutherford identified and named two types of radioactivity and in 1911 interpreted experimental evidence as showing that the atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Classical theory, however, predicted that this structure should be unstable. Classical theory had also failed to explain successfully two other experimental results that appeared in the late 19th century. One of these was the demonstration by [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley]]\u2014known as the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]]\u2014which showed there did not seem to be a preferred frame of reference, at rest with respect to the hypothetical [[luminiferous ether]], for describing electromagnetic phenomena. Studies of radiation and radioactive decay continued to be a preeminent focus for physical and chemical research through the 1930s, when the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] opened the way to the practical exploitation of what came to be called [[Nuclear power|\"atomic\" energy]].\n\n===Albert Einstein's theory of relativity===\nIn 1905 a young, 26-year-old German physicist (then a Bern patent clerk) named [[Albert Einstein]] (1879\u20131955), showed how measurements of time and space are affected by motion between an observer and what is being observed. To say that Einstein's radical theory of relativity revolutionized science is no exaggeration. Although Einstein made many other important contributions to science, the [[theory of relativity]] alone represents one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. Although the concept of relativity was not introduced by Einstein, his major contribution was the recognition that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is constant, i.e. the same for all observers,  and an absolute physical boundary for motion. This does not impact a person's day-to-day life since most objects travel at speeds much slower than light speed. For objects travelling near light speed, however, the theory of relativity shows that clocks associated with those objects will run more slowly and that the objects shorten in length according to measurements of an observer on Earth. Einstein also derived the famous equation, ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>, which expresses the [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].\n\n====Special relativity====\n{{further|History of special relativity}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|<!--Refining/rephrasing?:-->[[Albert Einstein]] (1879\u20131955) proposed that [[gravitation]] was a result of [[mass]]es (or their [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|equivalent energies]]) [[Curvature of spacetime|curving (\"bending\")]] the [[spacetime]] in which they exist, altering the paths they follow within it.]]\n\nEinstein argued that the speed of light was a constant in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frames]] and that electromagnetic laws should remain valid independent of reference frame\u2014assertions which rendered the ether \"superfluous\" to physical theory, and that held that observations of time and length varied relative to how the observer was moving with respect to the object being measured (what came to be called the \"[[special relativity|special theory of relativity]]\").  It also followed that mass and energy were interchangeable quantities according to the equation [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>]].  In another paper published the same year, Einstein asserted that electromagnetic radiation was transmitted in discrete quantities (\"[[Quantum|quanta]]\"), according to a constant that the theoretical physicist [[Max Planck]] had posited in 1900 to arrive at an accurate theory for the distribution of [[blackbody radiation]]\u2014an assumption that explained the strange properties of the [[photoelectric effect]].\n\nThe special theory of relativity is a formulation of the relationship between physical observations and the concepts of space and time. The theory arose out of contradictions between electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics and had great impact on both those areas. The original historical issue was whether it was meaningful to discuss the electromagnetic wave-carrying \"ether\" and motion relative to it and also whether one could detect such motion, as was unsuccessfully attempted in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment. Einstein demolished these questions and the ether concept in his special theory of relativity. However, his basic formulation does not involve detailed electromagnetic theory. It arises out of the question: \"What is time?\" Newton, in the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (1686), had given an unambiguous answer: \"Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external, and by another name is called duration.\" This definition is basic to all classical physics.\n\nEinstein had the genius to question it, and found that it was incomplete. Instead, each \"observer\" necessarily makes use of his or her own scale of time, and for two observers in relative motion, their time-scales will differ. This induces a related effect on position measurements. Space and time become intertwined concepts, fundamentally dependent on the observer. Each observer presides over his or her own space-time framework or coordinate system. There being no absolute frame of reference, all observers of given events make different but equally valid (and reconcilable) measurements.  What remains absolute is stated in Einstein's relativity postulate: \"The basic laws of physics are identical for two observers who have a constant relative velocity with respect to each other.\"\n\nSpecial Relativity had a profound effect on physics: started as a rethinking of the theory of electromagnetism, it found a new [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry law]] of nature, now called ''[[Poincar\u00e9 symmetry]]'', that replaced the old Galilean (see [[#Galileo Galilei|above]]) symmetry.\n\nSpecial Relativity exerted another long-lasting effect on [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]]. Although initially it was credited with the \"unification of mass and energy\", it became evident that [[relativistic dynamics]] established a firm ''distinction'' between [[rest mass]], which is an invariant (observer independent) property of a [[particle]] or system of particles, and the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of a system.  The latter two are separately [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]] in all situations but not invariant with respect to different observers. The term ''[[mass]]'' in [[particle physics]] underwent a [[semantic change]], and since the late 20th century it almost exclusively denotes the [[invariant mass|rest (or ''invariant'') mass]]. See [[mass in special relativity]] for additional discussion.\n\n====General relativity====\n{{further|History of general relativity}}\nBy 1916, Einstein was able to generalize this further, to deal with all states of motion including non-uniform acceleration, which became the general theory of relativity. In this theory Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. In fact, the curvature of space-time completely replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is a kind of illusion caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects must follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity - all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] \u2014 a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.\n\nThe gradual acceptance of Einstein's theories of relativity and the quantized nature of light transmission, and of [[Niels Bohr's model of the atom]] created as many problems as they solved, leading to a full-scale effort to reestablish physics on new fundamental principles.  Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the \"[[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]\") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the inertial force of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading to the conclusion that space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as [[gravitational lens]]ing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields.\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n{{further|History of quantum mechanics}}\n[[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|180px|right|[[Max Planck]]<br/>(1858\u20131947)]]\nAlthough relativity resolved the electromagnetic phenomena conflict demonstrated by Michelson and Morley, a second theoretical problem was the explanation of the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]]; experiment showed that at shorter wavelengths, toward the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, the energy approached zero, but classical theory predicted it should become infinite. This glaring discrepancy, known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], was solved by the new theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. Quantum mechanics is the theory of [[atom]]s and subatomic systems. Approximately the first 30 years of the 20th century represent the time of the conception and evolution of the theory. The basic ideas of quantum theory were introduced in 1900 by [[Max Planck]] (1858\u20131947), who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1918 for his discovery of the quantified nature of energy. The quantum theory (which previously relied in the \"correspondence\" at large scales between the quantized world of the atom and the continuities of the \"[[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical]]\" world) was accepted when the [[Compton Effect]] established that light carries momentum and can scatter off particles, and when [[Louis de Broglie]] asserted that matter can be seen as behaving as a wave in much the same way as electromagnetic waves behave like particles ([[wave\u2013particle duality]]).\n\n[[File:Heisenberg 10.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Werner Heisenberg]]<br/>(1901\u20131976)]]\n\nIn 1905, Einstein used the quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect, and in 1913 the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] used the same constant to explain the stability of [[Rutherford model|Rutherford's atom]] as well as the frequencies of light emitted by hydrogen gas. The quantized theory of the atom gave way to a full-scale quantum mechanics in the 1920s. New principles of a \"quantum\" rather than a \"classical\" mechanics, formulated in [[Matrix mechanics|matrix-form]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and [[Pascual Jordan]] in 1925, were based on the probabilistic relationship between discrete \"states\" and denied the possibility of [[causality]]. Quantum mechanics was extensively developed by Heisenberg, [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Paul Dirac]], and [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], who established an equivalent theory based on waves in 1926; but Heisenberg's 1927 \"[[uncertainty principle]]\" (indicating the impossibility of precisely and simultaneously measuring position and [[momentum]]) and the \"[[Copenhagen interpretation]]\" of quantum mechanics (named after Bohr's home city) continued to deny the possibility of fundamental causality, though opponents such as Einstein would metaphorically assert that \"God does not play dice with the universe\".<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\">{{Harvtxt|Kragh|1999}}</ref> The new quantum mechanics became an indispensable tool in the investigation and explanation of phenomena at the atomic level. Also in the 1920s, the Indian scientist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]]'s work on [[photon]]s and quantum mechanics provided the foundation for [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]], the theory of the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]].\n\n{{anchor|spin\u2013statistics}} The [[spin\u2013statistics theorem]] established that any particle in quantum mechanics may be either a [[boson]] (statistically Bose\u2013Einstein) or a [[fermion]] (statistically [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics|Fermi\u2013Dirac]]). It was later found that all [[Elementary particle|fundamental]] bosons transmit forces, such as the photon that transmits electromagnetism.\n\nFermions are particles \"like electrons and nucleons\" and are the usual constituents of [[matter]]. Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics later found numerous other uses, from astrophysics (see [[Degenerate matter]]) to [[semiconductor]] design.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== Contemporary and particle physics ==\n{{further|History of subatomic physics|List of unsolved problems in physics}}\n\n===Quantum field theory===\n[[File:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|thumb|287px|right|A [[Feynman diagram]] representing (left to right) the production of a photon (blue [[sine wave]]) from the [[annihilation]] of an electron and its complementary [[antiparticle]], the [[positron]].

However, attempts to quantize electromagnetic theory entirely were stymied throughout the 1930s by theoretical formulations yielding infinite energies. This situation was not considered adequately resolved until after [[World War&nbsp;II]] ended, when [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] independently posited the technique of [[renormalization]], which allowed for an establishment of a robust [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schweber|1994}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, new theories of [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]] proliferated with the rise of the idea of the [[Quantum field theory|quantization of fields]] through \"[[Exchange interaction|exchange forces]]\" regulated by an exchange of short-lived [[Virtual particle|\"virtual\" particle]]s, which were allowed to exist according to the laws governing the uncertainties inherent in the quantum world. Notably, [[Hideki Yukawa]] proposed that the positive charges of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] were kept together courtesy of a powerful but short-range force mediated by a particle with a mass between that of the [[electron]] and [[proton]]. This particle, the \"[[pion]]\", was identified in 1947 as part of what became a slew of particles discovered after World War II. Initially, such particles were found as [[Ionization|ionizing radiation]] left by [[cosmic ray]]s, but increasingly came to be produced in newer and more powerful [[particle accelerator]]s.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Galison|1997}}</ref>\n\nOutside particle physics, significant advances of the time were:\n* the invention of the [[laser]] (1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]);\n* the theoretical and experimental research of [[superconductivity]], especially the invention of a [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory|quantum theory of superconductivity]] by [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] and [[Lev Landau]] (1962 Nobel Prize in Physics) and, later, its explanation via [[Cooper pair]]s (1972 Nobel Prize in Physics). The Cooper pair was an early example of [[quasiparticle]]s.\n\n===Unified field theories===\n{{main|Unified field theory}}\nEinstein deemed that all [[fundamental interaction]]s in nature can be explained in a single theory. Unified field theories were numerous attempts to \"merge\" several interactions. One of formulations of such theories (as well as field theories in general) is a ''[[gauge theory]]'', a generalization of the idea of symmetry. Eventually the [[Standard Model]] (see below) succeeded in unification of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. All attempts to unify [[gravitation]] with something else failed.\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Standard Model===\n{{main|Standard Model}}\n[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Standard Model]].]]\nThe interaction of these particles by [[scattering]] and [[Particle decay|decay]] provided a key to new fundamental quantum theories. [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Yuval Ne'eman]] brought some order to these new particles by classifying them according to certain qualities, beginning with what Gell-Mann referred to as the \"[[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]\". While its further development, the [[quark model]], at first seemed inadequate to describe [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]], allowing the temporary rise of competing theories such as the [[S-Matrix]], the establishment of [[quantum chromodynamics]] in the 1970s finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a \"[[Standard Model|standard model]]\" based on the mathematics of [[Gauge theory|gauge invariance]], which successfully described all forces except for [[gravitation]], and which remains generally accepted within its domain of application.<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\"/>\n\nThe Standard Model groups the [[electroweak interaction]] theory and [[quantum chromodynamics]] into a structure denoted by the [[gauge group]] SU(3)&times;SU(2)&times;U(1).

Later work was by [[George Smoot|Smoot]] et al.

Discoveries of physics find applications throughout the [[natural science]]s and in [[technology]], since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world. Some other domains of study\u2014more limited in their scope\u2014may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right. Physics today may be divided loosely into [[classical physics]] and [[modern physics]].\n== Ancient history ==\n{{further|History of astronomy}}\n\nElements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[mechanics]], which were methodologically united through the study of [[geometry]]. These mathematical disciplines began in [[Ancient history|antiquity]] with the [[Babylonia]]ns and with [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] writers such as [[Archimedes]] and [[Ptolemy]]. [[Ancient philosophy]], meanwhile&nbsp;\u2013 including what was called \"[[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 focused on explaining nature through ideas such as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotle#Causality, the four causes|four types of \"cause\"]].\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nThe move towards a rational understanding of nature began at least since the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in Greece (650\u2013480 [[BCE]]) with the [[Presocratics|Pre-Socratic philosophers]].  The philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed \"the Father of Science\" for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural [[phenomenon|phenomena]], proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.<ref>\"This shift from ecclesiastical reasoning to scientific reasoning marked the beginning of scientific methodology.\" Singer, C., ''A Short History of Science to the 19th Century'',  Streeter Press, 2008, p. 35.</ref> Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is [[Arche|the basic element]], experimenting with the attraction between [[magnet]]s and rubbed [[amber]] and formulating the first recorded [[Cosmology|cosmologies]]. [[Anaximander]], famous for his proto-[[evolution]]ary theory, disputed the Thales' ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' was the building block of all matter. Around 500 BCE, [[Heraclitus]] proposed that the only basic law governing the [[Universe]] was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. This observation made him one of the first scholars in ancient physics to address the role of [[time]] in the universe, a key and sometimes contentious concept in modern and present-day physics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The early physicist [[Leucippus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] first half of the 5th century BCE) adamantly opposed the idea of direct [[Divine providence|divine intervention]] in the universe, proposing instead that natural phenomena had a natural cause. Leucippus and his student [[Democritus]] were the first to develop the theory of [[atomism]], the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called [[atom]]s.\n\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Aristotle]]<br/>(384\u2013322 [[BCE]])]]\n\nDuring the [[Classical Greece|classical period]] in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]], [[natural philosophy]] slowly developed into an exciting and contentious field of study. [[Aristotle]] ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2}}, ''Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s'') (384 \u2013 322 BCE), a student of [[Plato]], promoted the concept that observation of physical phenomena could ultimately lead to the discovery of the natural laws governing them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Aristotle's writings cover physics, [[metaphysics]], [[poetry]], [[theater]], [[music]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], [[politics]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[ethics]], [[biology]] and [[zoology]]. He wrote the first work which refers to that line of study as \"Physics\"&nbsp;\u2013 in the 4th century BCE, Aristotle founded the system known as [[Aristotelian physics]]. He attempted to explain ideas such as [[motion (physics)|motion]] (and [[gravity]]) with the theory of [[classical elements|four elements]]. Aristotle believed that all matter was made up of aether, or some combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. According to Aristotle, these four terrestrial elements are capable of inter-transformation and move toward their natural place, so a stone falls downward toward the center of the cosmos, but flames rise upward toward the [[circumference]]. Eventually, [[Aristotelian physics]] became enormously popular for many centuries in Europe, informing the scientific and scholastic developments of the [[Middle Ages]]. It remained the mainstream scientific paradigm in Europe until the time of [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]].\n\nEarly in Classical Greece, knowledge that the Earth is [[Sphere|spherical]] (\"round\") was common. Around 240 BCE, as the result of [[Eratosthenes#Measurement of the Earth's circumference|a seminal experiment]], [[Eratosthenes]] (276\u2013194 BCE) accurately estimated its circumference. In contrast to Aristotle's geocentric views, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2}}; c.310&nbsp;\u2013 c.230 BCE) presented an explicit argument for a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[Solar system]], i.e. for placing the [[Sun]], not the [[Earth]], at its centre. [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a follower of Aristarchus' heliocentric theory, stated that [[Axial tilt|the Earth rotated around its own axis]], which, in turn, [[Orbit|revolved around]] the Sun. Though the arguments he used were lost, [[Plutarch]] stated that Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning.\n\n[[File:Domenico-Fetti Archimedes 1620.jpg|thumb|180x|The ancient Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]], famous for his ideas regarding [[fluid mechanics]] and [[buoyancy]].]]\n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]] ({{lang-el|[[wikt:\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2|\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2]]}} (287\u2013212 BCE)&nbsp;\u2013 generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time&nbsp;\u2013 laid the foundations of [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[statics]] and calculated the underlying mathematics of the [[lever]]. A leading scientist of classical antiquity, Archimedes also developed elaborate systems of pulleys to move large objects with a minimum of effort. The [[Archimedes' screw]] underpins modern hydroengineering, and his machines of war helped to hold back the armies of Rome in the [[First Punic War]]. Archimedes even tore apart the arguments of Aristotle and his metaphysics, pointing out that it was impossible to separate mathematics and nature and proved it by converting mathematical theories into practical inventions. Furthermore, in his work ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'', around 250 BCE, Archimedes developed the law of [[buoyancy]], also known as [[Archimedes' principle]]. In mathematics, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[pi]]. He also defined the [[Archimedean spiral|spiral bearing his name]], formulae for the [[volume]]s of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers. He also developed the principles of equilibrium states and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]], ideas that would influence the well known scholars, Galileo, and Newton.\n\n[[Hipparchus]] (190\u2013120 BCE), focusing on astronomy and mathematics, used sophisticated geometrical techniques to map the motion of the stars and [[planet]]s, even predicting the times that [[Solar eclipse]]s would happen. In addition, he added calculations of the distance of the Sun and Moon from the Earth, based upon his improvements to the observational instruments used at that time. Another of the most famous of the early physicists was [[Ptolemy]] (90\u2013168 CE), one of the leading minds during the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Ptolemy was the author of several scientific treatises, at least three of which were of continuing importance to later Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'' (in Greek, \u1f29 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"The Great Treatise\", originally \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"Mathematical Treatise\"). The second is the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the [[Greco-Roman world]].\n\nMuch of the accumulated knowledge of the ancient world was lost. Even of the works of the better known thinkers, few fragments survived. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, almost nothing of [[Hipparchus]]' direct work survived.

More idealized motion in the \"sublunary\" realm could only be achieved through [[Mechanics (Aristotle)|artifice]], and prior to the 17th century, many did not view artificial experiments as a valid means of learning about the natural world.

Dissatisfaction with older philosophical approaches had begun earlier and had produced other changes in society, such as the [[Protestant Reformation]], but the revolution in science began when [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] began to mount a sustained attack on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophical programme and supposed that mathematical descriptive schemes adopted from such fields as mechanics and astronomy could actually yield universally valid characterizations of motion and other concepts.\n\n===Nicolaus Copernicus===\n{{main|Nicolaus Copernicus|Tycho Brahe|Johannes Kepler}}\n[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|The Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473\u20131543) is remembered for his development of a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the [[Solar system]].]]\nA breakthrough in [[astronomy]] was made by Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473\u20131543) when, in 1543, he gave strong arguments for the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[Solar system]], ostensibly as a means to render tables charting planetary motion more accurate and to simplify their production. In heliocentric models of the Solar system, the Earth orbits the Sun along with other bodies in [[Milky Way|Earth's]] [[galaxy]], a contradiction according to the Greek-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy (2nd century CE; see above), [[Ptolemaic system|whose system]] placed the Earth at the center of the Universe and had been accepted for over 1,400 years. The Greek astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] (c.310&nbsp;\u2013 c.230 BCE) had suggested that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but Copernicus' reasoning led to lasting general acceptance of this \"revolutionary\" idea. Copernicus' book presenting the theory (''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', \"On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres\") was published just before his death in 1543 and, as it is now generally considered to mark the beginning of modern astronomy, is also considered to mark the beginning of the Scientific revolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Copernicus' new perspective, along with the accurate observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]], enabled German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571\u20131630) to formulate [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|his laws regarding planetary motion]] that remain in use today.\n\n===Galileo Galilei===\n{{main|Galileo Galilei}}\n[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], early proponent of the modern scientific worldview and method <br/>(1564\u20131642)]]\nThe Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642) was the central figure in the Scientific revolution and famous for his support for Copernicanism, his astronomical discoveries, empirical experiments and his improvement of the telescope. As a mathematician, Galileo's role in the [[History of European research universities|university]] culture of his era was subordinated to the three major topics of study: [[law]], [[medicine]], and [[theology]] (which was closely allied to philosophy).  Galileo, however, felt that the descriptive content of the technical disciplines warranted philosophical interest, particularly because mathematical analysis of astronomical observations&nbsp;\u2013 notably, Copernicus' analysis of the [[relative motion]]s of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets&nbsp;\u2013 indicated that philosophers' statements about the nature of the universe could be shown to be in error.  Galileo also performed mechanical experiments, insisting that motion itself&nbsp;\u2013 regardless of whether it was produced \"naturally\" or \"artificially\" (i.e. deliberately)&nbsp;\u2013 had universally consistent characteristics that could be described mathematically.\n\nGalileo's early studies at the [[University of Pisa]] were in medicine, but he was soon drawn to mathematics and physics. At 19, he discovered (and, [[Galileo Galilei#Career as a scientist|subsequently, verified]]) the [[:wikt:isochronal|isochronal]] nature of the [[pendulum]] when, using his pulse, he timed the oscillations of a swinging lamp in [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Pisa's cathedral]] and found that it remained the same for each swing regardless of the swing's [[amplitude]]. He soon became known through his invention of a [[hydrostatic balance]] and for his treatise on the [[Center of mass#Center of gravity|center of gravity]] of solid bodies. While teaching at the University of Pisa (1589\u201392), he initiated his experiments concerning the laws of bodies in motion that brought results so contradictory to the accepted teachings of Aristotle that strong antagonism was aroused. He found that bodies do not fall with velocities [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to their weights. The famous story in which Galileo is said to have [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped weights from]] the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] is apocryphal, but he did find that the [[Ballistic trajectory|path of a projectile]] is a [[parabola]] and is credited with conclusions that anticipated [[Newton's laws of motion]] (e.g. the notion of [[inertia]]).

Descartes had a more ambitious agenda, however, which was geared toward replacing the Scholastic philosophical tradition altogether. Questioning the reality interpreted through the senses, Descartes sought to re-establish philosophical explanatory schemes by reducing all perceived phenomena to being attributable to the motion of an invisible sea of \"corpuscles\". (Notably, he reserved human thought and [[God]] from his scheme, holding these to be separate from the physical universe). In proposing this philosophical framework, Descartes supposed that different kinds of motion, such as that of planets versus that of terrestrial objects, were not fundamentally different, but were merely different manifestations of an endless chain of corpuscular motions obeying universal principles. Particularly influential were his explanations for circular astronomical motions in terms of the vortex motion of corpuscles in space (Descartes argued, in accord with the beliefs, if not the methods, of the Scholastics, that a [[vacuum]] could not exist), and his explanation of [[gravity]] in terms of corpuscles pushing objects downward.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Shea|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1992}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Gaukroger|2002}}</ref>\n\nDescartes, like Galileo, was convinced of the importance of mathematical explanation, and he and his followers were key figures in the development of mathematics and geometry in the 17th century. Cartesian mathematical descriptions of motion held that all mathematical formulations had to be justifiable in terms of direct physical action, a position held by [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] and the German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who, while following in the Cartesian tradition, developed his own philosophical alternative to Scholasticism, which he outlined in his 1714 work, ''[[The Monadology]]''. Descartes has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy', and much subsequent [[Western philosophy]] is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. In particular, his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] \u2014 allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two-dimensional coordinate system \u2014 was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[analytical geometry]], the bridge between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], important to the discovery of [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].\n\n===Isaac Newton===\n{{main|Isaac Newton|History of classical mechanics}}\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir [[Isaac Newton]]<br/>(1642\u20131727)]]\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries saw the achievements of the greatest figure of the Scientific revolution: [[Cambridge University]] physicist and mathematician [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642-1727), considered by many to be the greatest and most influential scientist who ever lived. Newton, a fellow of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of England]], combined his own discoveries in mechanics and astronomy to earlier ones to create a single system for describing the workings of the universe. Newton formulated [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]] which formulated the relationship between motion and objects and also the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], the latter of which could be used to explain the behavior not only of falling bodies on the earth but also planets and other celestial bodies. To arrive at his results, Newton invented one form of an entirely new branch of mathematics: [[calculus]] (also invented independently by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]), which was to become an essential tool in much of the later development in most branches of physics. Newton's findings were set forth in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), the publication of which in 1687 marked the beginning of the modern period of mechanics and astronomy.\n\nNewton was able to refute the Cartesian mechanical tradition that all motions should be explained with respect to the immediate force exerted by corpuscles. Using his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation, Newton removed the idea that objects followed paths determined by natural shapes and instead demonstrated that not only regularly observed paths, but all the future motions of any body could be deduced mathematically based on knowledge of their existing motion, their [[mass]], and the [[force]]s acting upon them.  However, observed celestial motions did not precisely conform to a Newtonian treatment, and Newton, who was also deeply interested in [[theology]], imagined that God intervened to ensure the continued stability of the solar system.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]<br/>(1646\u20131716)]]\n\nNewton's principles (but not his mathematical treatments) proved controversial with Continental philosophers, who found his lack of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanation for movement and gravitation philosophically unacceptable. Beginning around 1700, a bitter rift opened between the Continental and British philosophical traditions, which were stoked by heated, ongoing, and viciously personal disputes between the followers of Newton and Leibniz concerning priority over the analytical techniques of [[calculus]], which each had developed independently. Initially, the Cartesian and Leibnizian traditions prevailed on the Continent (leading to the dominance of the Leibnizian calculus notation everywhere except Britain).  Newton himself remained privately disturbed at the lack of a philosophical understanding of gravitation while insisting in his writings that none was necessary to infer its reality.  As the 18th century progressed, Continental natural philosophers increasingly accepted the Newtonians' willingness to forgo [[Ontology|ontological]] metaphysical explanations for mathematically described motions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hall|1980}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Bertolini Meli|1993}}</ref><ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\">{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1999}}</ref>\n\nNewton built the first functioning [[reflecting telescope]]<ref name=\"Wilson2013\">{{cite book |author=Raymond N.

While Newton explained light as being composed of tiny particles, a rival theory of light which explained its behavior in terms of waves was presented in 1690 by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. However, the belief in the mechanistic philosophy coupled with Newton's reputation meant that the wave theory saw relatively little support until the 19th century. Newton also formulated [[Newton's law of cooling|an empirical law of cooling]], studied the [[speed of sound]], investigated [[power series]], demonstrated the [[Binomial theorem|generalised binomial theorem]] and developed [[Newton's method|a method]] for approximating the [[Root of a function|roots of a function]]. His work on infinite series was inspired by [[Simon Stevin]]'s decimals.<ref>{{citation |last1=B\u0142aszczyk |first1=Piotr |author1-link= |last2=Katz |first2=Mikhail |author2-link=Mikhail Katz |last3=Sherry |first3=David |author3-link= |arxiv=1202.4153 |doi=10.1007/s10699-012-9285-8 |issue= |journal=[[Foundations of Science]] |pages= 43\u201374|title=Ten misconceptions from the history of analysis and their debunking |volume= 18|year=2012|bibcode=2012arXiv1202.4153B }}</ref> Most importantly, Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, which were neither capricious nor malevolent. By demonstrating the consistency between [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] and his own theory of gravitation, Newton also removed the last doubts about heliocentrism. By bringing together all the ideas set forth during the Scientific revolution, Newton effectively established the foundation for modern society in mathematics and science.\n\n===Other achievements===\nOther branches of physics also received attention during the period of the Scientific revolution. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]], court physician to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627\u201391) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the [[Boyle's law|gas law named for him]]; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the [[Royal Society of England]] (1660) and the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences in France]] (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as [[John Wallis]], [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|William Brouncker]], [[Thomas Sydenham]], [[John Mayow]], and [[Christopher Wren]] (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, [[James Bernoulli]] showed that the [[cycloid]] is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, [[Johann Bernoulli]] showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a [[catenary]], the curve with the lowest possible [[center of gravity]] available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the [[brachistochrone]] problem.\n\n====Early thermodynamics====\nA precursor of the engine was designed by the German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] who, in 1650, designed and built the world's first [[vacuum pump]] and created the world's first ever [[vacuum]] known as the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment.  He was driven to make a vacuum to disprove [[Aristotle]]'s long-held supposition that [[Horror vacui (physics)|'Nature abhors a vacuum']]. Shortly thereafter, Irish physicist and chemist Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation for a gas: ''PV'' = ''k'', where ''P'' is [[pressure]], ''V'' is [[volume]] and ''k'' is a constant: this relationship is known as [[Boyle's Law]]. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later.  Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.<ref>New Experiments physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects (1660). [http://www.imss.fi.it/vuoto/eboyle.html]</ref> Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave [[Gay-Lussac]] the opportunity to derive [[Gay-Lussac's law|his law]], which led shortly later to the [[ideal gas law]].  But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine.  He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. Hence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the [[steam engine|Savery Engine]], horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen Engine]], and later the [[Watt steam engine|Watt Engine]]. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses.  Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input [[fuel]] into useful work.  In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output.  Hence the need for a new science of engine [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] was born.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 18th-century developments ==\n[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Alessandro Volta]]<br/>(1745\u20131827)]]\nDuring the 18th century, the mechanics founded by Newton was developed by several scientists as more mathematicians learned calculus and elaborated upon its initial formulation. The application of mathematical analysis to problems of motion was known as rational mechanics, or mixed mathematics (and was later termed [[classical mechanics]]).\n\n===Mechanics===\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Bernoulli, Daniel (1700-1782)-Portrait-Portr 10971.tif (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]<br/>(1700\u20131782)]]\nIn 1714, [[Brook Taylor]] derived the [[fundamental frequency]] of a stretched vibrating string in terms of its tension and mass per unit length by solving a [[differential equation]]. The Swiss mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700\u20131782) made important mathematical studies of the behavior of gases, anticipating the kinetic theory of gases developed more than a century later, and has been referred to as the first mathematical physicist.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Darrigol|2005}}</ref> In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli derived the fundamental frequency and [[harmonic]]s of a hanging chain by solving a differential equation. In 1734, Bernoulli solved the differential equation for the vibrations of an elastic bar clamped at one end. Bernoulli's treatment of [[fluid dynamics]] and his examination of [[fluid]] flow was introduced in his 1738 work ''[[Hydrodynamica]]''.\n\nRational mechanics dealt primarily with the development of elaborate mathematical treatments of observed motions, using Newtonian principles as a basis, and emphasized improving the tractability of complex calculations and developing of legitimate means of analytical approximation. A representative contemporary textbook was published by [[Johann Baptiste Horvath]]. By the end of the century analytical treatments were rigorous enough to verify the stability of the [[solar system]] solely on the basis of Newton's laws without reference to divine intervention\u2014even as deterministic treatments of systems as simple as the [[n-body problem|three body problem]] in gravitation remained intractable.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bos|1980}}</ref> In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] predicted the periodicity of [[Halley's Comet]], [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] in 1781, and [[Henry Cavendish]] measured the [[gravitational constant]] and determined the mass of the Earth in 1798. In 1783, [[John Michell]] suggested that some objects might be so massive that not even light could escape from them.\n\nIn 1739, [[Leonhard Euler]] solved the ordinary differential equation for a forced harmonic oscillator and noticed the resonance phenomenon. In 1742, [[Colin Maclaurin]] discovered his [[Maclaurin spheroid|uniformly rotating self-gravitating spheroids]]. In 1742, Benjamin Robins published his ''New Principles in Gunnery'', establishing the science of aerodynamics. British work, carried on by mathematicians such as Taylor and Maclaurin, fell behind Continental developments as the century progressed. Meanwhile, work flourished at scientific academies on the Continent, led by such mathematicians as Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]]. In 1743, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] published his ''Traite de Dynamique'', in which he introduced the concept of generalized forces for accelerating systems and systems with constraints, and applied the new idea of [[virtual work]] to solve dynamical problem, now known as [[D'Alembert's principle]], as a rival to Newton's second law of motion. In 1747, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] applied minimum principles to mechanics. In 1759, Euler solved the partial differential equation for the vibration of a rectangular drum. In 1764, Euler examined the partial differential equation for the vibration of a circular drum and found one of the Bessel function solutions. In 1776, [[John Smeaton]] published a paper on experiments relating power, [[work (physics)|work]], [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]], and supporting the [[conservation of energy]]. In 1788, Joseph Louis Lagrange presented [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations of motion]] in ''M\u00e9canique Analytique'', in which the whole of mechanics was organized around the principle of virtual work. In 1789, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] states the law of [[conservation of mass]]. The rational mechanics developed in the 18th century received a brilliant exposition in both Lagrange's 1788 work and the ''Celestial Mechanics'' (1799\u20131825) of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nDuring the 18th century, thermodynamics was developed through the theories of weightless [[imponderable fluid|\"imponderable fluids\"]], such as heat (\"caloric\"), [[electricity]], and [[phlogiston theory|phlogiston]] (which was rapidly overthrown as a concept following [[Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] identification of [[oxygen]] gas late in the century).  Assuming that these concepts were real fluids, their flow could be traced through a mechanical apparatus or chemical reactions.  This tradition of experimentation led to the development of new kinds of experimental apparatus, such as the [[Leyden Jar]]; and new kinds of measuring instruments, such as the [[calorimeter]], and improved versions of old ones, such as the [[thermometer]].  Experiments also produced new concepts, such as the [[University of Glasgow]] experimenter [[Joseph Black]]'s notion of [[latent heat]] and Philadelphia intellectual [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s characterization of electrical fluid as flowing between places of excess and deficit (a concept later reinterpreted in terms of positive and negative [[electric charge|charges]]). Franklin also showed that lightning is electricity in 1752.\n\nThe accepted theory of heat in the 18th century viewed it as a kind of fluid, called [[caloric theory|caloric]]; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including [[Joseph Black]] (1728\u201399) and [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat is due to the motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]), who found a direct relationship between heat and mechanical energy.\n\nWhile it was recognized early in the 18th century that finding absolute theories of electrostatic and magnetic force akin to Newton's principles of motion would be an important achievement, none were forthcoming.  This impossibility only slowly disappeared as experimental practice became more widespread and more refined in the early years of the 19th century in places such as the newly established [[Royal Institution]] in London. Meanwhile, the analytical methods of rational mechanics began to be applied to experimental phenomena, most influentially with the French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]]'s analytical treatment of the flow of heat, as published in 1822.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Heilbron|1979}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Golinski|1999}}</ref> [[Joseph Priestley]] proposed an electrical inverse-square law in 1767, and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] introduced the inverse-square law of [[electrostatics]] in 1798.\n\nAt the end of the century, the members of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] had attained clear dominance in the field.<ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\" /><ref>{{Harvtxt|Greenberg|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1999}}</ref> At the same time, the experimental tradition established by Galileo and his followers persisted.  The [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] were major centers for the performance and reporting of experimental work. Experiments in mechanics, optics, [[magnetism]], [[static electricity]], [[history of chemistry|chemistry]], and [[physiology]] were not clearly distinguished from each other during the 18th century, but significant differences in explanatory schemes and, thus, experiment design were emerging.  Chemical experimenters, for instance, defied attempts to enforce a scheme of abstract Newtonian forces onto chemical affiliations, and instead focused on the isolation and classification of chemical substances and reactions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ben-Chaim|2004}}</ref>\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 19th century ==\n[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Michael Faraday]]<br/>(1791\u20131867)]]\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the electric battery (known of the [[voltaic pile]]) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be studied. A year later, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] demonstrated the wave nature of light\u2014which received strong experimental support from the work of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]\u2014and the principle of interference. In 1813, [[Peter Ewart]] supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper ''On the measure of moving force''. In 1820, [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] found that a current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after \u00d8rsted's discovery reached France, [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1821, [[Michael Faraday]] built an electricity-powered motor, while [[Georg Ohm]] stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. A year later, botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] discovered [[Brownian motion]]: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid.  In 1829, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] introduced the terms of [[Work (physics)|work]] (force times distance) and [[kinetic energy]] with the meanings they have today.\n\nIn 1831, Faraday (and independently [[Joseph Henry]]) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric potential or current through magnetism&nbsp;\u2013 known as [[Faraday's law of induction|electromagnetic induction]]; these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric generator, respectively. In 1834, [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids (the [[Jacobi ellipsoid]]). In 1834, [[John Scott Russell|John Russell]] observed a nondecaying solitary water wave ([[soliton]]) in the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] near [[Edinburgh]] and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, William Hamilton stated [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's canonical equations of motion]]. In the same year, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the [[Coriolis effect]]. In 1841, [[Julius Robert von Mayer]], an [[amateur]] scientist, wrote a paper on the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1842, [[Christian Doppler]] proposed the [[Doppler effect]]. In 1847, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] formally stated the law of conservation of energy. In 1851, [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] showed the Earth's rotation with a huge [[pendulum]] ([[Foucault pendulum]]).\n\nThere were important advances in [[continuum mechanics]] in the first half of the century, namely formulation of [[elastic modulus|laws of elasticity]] for solids and discovery of [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for fluids.\n\n===Laws of thermodynamics===\n{{further|History of thermodynamics}}\n\n[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|right|{{nowrap|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]]<br/>(1824\u20131907)}}]]\n\nIn the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] and [[James Prescott Joule]], who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the [[first law of thermodynamics]]\u2014a restatement of the [[law of conservation of energy]]\u2014which was stated around 1850 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later known as Lord Kelvin, and [[Rudolf Clausius]]. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of [[Lazare Carnot]], Sadi Carnot, and [[\u00c9mile Clapeyron]]\u2013as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work\u2014to formulate the first law.\n\nKelvin and Clausius also stated the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]'s influential work ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy'') and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law was the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] measured the [[speed of light]] in water and find that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the [[Joule\u2013Thomson effect]] or Joule\u2013Kelvin effect. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] puts forward the idea of the [[heat death of the universe]] in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of ''dQ/T'' ([[Clausius's theorem]]) (though he did not yet name the quantity).\n\n===Statistical mechanics (a fundamentally new approach to science)===\n{{further|History of statistical mechanics}}\n\n[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumb|180px|left|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]<br/>(1831\u20131879)]]\n\nIn 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|distribution law of molecular velocities]]. Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields are propagated outward from their source at a speed equal to that of light and that light is one of several kinds of electromagnetic radiation, differing only in frequency and wavelength from the others. In 1859, Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas. The wave theory of light was widely accepted by the time of Maxwell's work on the electromagnetic field, and afterward the study of light and that of electricity and magnetism were closely related. In 1864 James Maxwell published his papers on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, and stated that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon in the 1873 publication of Maxwell's ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''. This work drew upon theoretical work by German theoreticians such as [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]]. The encapsulation of heat in particulate motion, and the addition of electromagnetic forces to Newtonian dynamics established an enormously robust theoretical underpinning to physical observations.\n\nThe prediction that light represented a transmission of energy in wave form through a \"[[Luminiferous aether|luminiferous ether]]\", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s 1888 detection of [[electromagnetic radiation]], was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field could soon be developed.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1985}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|JungnickelMcCormmach|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Hunt|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1994}}</ref> Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, at the same time foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the [[photoelectric effect]]. Research on the electromagnetic waves began soon after, with many scientists and inventors conducting experiments on their properties. In the mid to late 1890s [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed a [[radio wave]] based [[wireless telegraphy]] system<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hX1jPbJVSu4C&pg=PA193&dq=invention+of+radio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UmpZUsObFa_K4APjp4DgDQ&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=invention%20of%20radio&f=false Michael Windelspecht, Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 19th Century, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 page 195]</ref> (see [[invention of radio]]).\n\nThe atomic theory of matter had been proposed again in the early 19th century by the chemist [[John Dalton]] and became one of the hypotheses of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases developed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell to explain the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n[[File:Boltzmann2.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Ludwig Boltzmann]]<br/>(1844-1906)]]\n\nThe kinetic theory in turn led to a revolutionary approach to science, the [[statistical mechanics]] of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] (1844\u20131906) and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] (1839\u20131903), which studies the statistics of microstates of a system and uses statistics to determine the state of a physical system.  Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the dissipation of energy to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term \"[[entropy]]\" to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as \"[[Maxwell's demon]]\"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|Wise|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1998}}</ref> In 1902, [[James Jeans]] found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 20th century: birth of modern physics ==\n<!-- [[Template:Modern physics]] links here -->\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]]<br/>(1867\u20131934)]]\n{{see also|Modern physics}}\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, physics had evolved to the point at which [[classical mechanics]] could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories\u2014the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear\u2014and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in [[blackbody radiation]] and the [[photoelectric effect]], while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Emil Cohn]], [[Ernst Wiechert]] and [[Wilhelm Wien]] believed that some modification of [[Maxwell's equations]] might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of [[classical physics]] were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as [[modern physics]].<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Agar|2012\">{{Harvtxt|Agar|2012}}</ref>\n\n===Radiation experiments===\n[[File:J.J Thomson.jpg|thumb|200px|[[J. J. Thomson]] (1856\u20131940) discovered the [[electron]] and [[Isotope|isotopy]] and also invented the [[mass spectrometer]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1906.]]\nIn the 19th century, experimenters began to detect unexpected forms of radiation: [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]] caused a sensation with his discovery of [[X-ray]]s in 1895; in 1896 [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that certain kinds of matter emit radiation on their own accord. In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]], and new radioactive elements found by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] raised questions about the supposedly indestructible atom and the nature of matter. Marie and Pierre coined the term \"[[radioactive decay|radioactivity]]\" to describe this property of matter, and isolated the radioactive elements [[radium]] and [[polonium]]. [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] identified two of Becquerel's forms of radiation with electrons and the element [[helium]]. Rutherford identified and named two types of radioactivity and in 1911 interpreted experimental evidence as showing that the atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Classical theory, however, predicted that this structure should be unstable. Classical theory had also failed to explain successfully two other experimental results that appeared in the late 19th century. One of these was the demonstration by [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley]]\u2014known as the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]]\u2014which showed there did not seem to be a preferred frame of reference, at rest with respect to the hypothetical [[luminiferous ether]], for describing electromagnetic phenomena. Studies of radiation and radioactive decay continued to be a preeminent focus for physical and chemical research through the 1930s, when the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] opened the way to the practical exploitation of what came to be called [[Nuclear power|\"atomic\" energy]].\n\n===Albert Einstein's theory of relativity===\nIn 1905 a young, 26-year-old German physicist (then a Bern patent clerk) named [[Albert Einstein]] (1879\u20131955), showed how measurements of time and space are affected by motion between an observer and what is being observed. To say that Einstein's radical theory of relativity revolutionized science is no exaggeration. Although Einstein made many other important contributions to science, the [[theory of relativity]] alone represents one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. Although the concept of relativity was not introduced by Einstein, his major contribution was the recognition that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is constant, i.e. the same for all observers,  and an absolute physical boundary for motion. This does not impact a person's day-to-day life since most objects travel at speeds much slower than light speed. For objects travelling near light speed, however, the theory of relativity shows that clocks associated with those objects will run more slowly and that the objects shorten in length according to measurements of an observer on Earth. Einstein also derived the famous equation, ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>, which expresses the [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].\n\n====Special relativity====\n{{further|History of special relativity}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|<!--Refining/rephrasing?:-->[[Albert Einstein]] (1879\u20131955) proposed that [[gravitation]] was a result of [[mass]]es (or their [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|equivalent energies]]) [[Curvature of spacetime|curving (\"bending\")]] the [[spacetime]] in which they exist, altering the paths they follow within it.]]\n\nEinstein argued that the speed of light was a constant in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frames]] and that electromagnetic laws should remain valid independent of reference frame\u2014assertions which rendered the ether \"superfluous\" to physical theory, and that held that observations of time and length varied relative to how the observer was moving with respect to the object being measured (what came to be called the \"[[special relativity|special theory of relativity]]\").  It also followed that mass and energy were interchangeable quantities according to the equation [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>]].  In another paper published the same year, Einstein asserted that electromagnetic radiation was transmitted in discrete quantities (\"[[Quantum|quanta]]\"), according to a constant that the theoretical physicist [[Max Planck]] had posited in 1900 to arrive at an accurate theory for the distribution of [[blackbody radiation]]\u2014an assumption that explained the strange properties of the [[photoelectric effect]].\n\nThe special theory of relativity is a formulation of the relationship between physical observations and the concepts of space and time. The theory arose out of contradictions between electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics and had great impact on both those areas. The original historical issue was whether it was meaningful to discuss the electromagnetic wave-carrying \"ether\" and motion relative to it and also whether one could detect such motion, as was unsuccessfully attempted in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment. Einstein demolished these questions and the ether concept in his special theory of relativity. However, his basic formulation does not involve detailed electromagnetic theory. It arises out of the question: \"What is time?\" Newton, in the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (1686), had given an unambiguous answer: \"Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external, and by another name is called duration.\" This definition is basic to all classical physics.\n\nEinstein had the genius to question it, and found that it was incomplete. Instead, each \"observer\" necessarily makes use of his or her own scale of time, and for two observers in relative motion, their time-scales will differ. This induces a related effect on position measurements. Space and time become intertwined concepts, fundamentally dependent on the observer. Each observer presides over his or her own space-time framework or coordinate system. There being no absolute frame of reference, all observers of given events make different but equally valid (and reconcilable) measurements.  What remains absolute is stated in Einstein's relativity postulate: \"The basic laws of physics are identical for two observers who have a constant relative velocity with respect to each other.\"\n\nSpecial Relativity had a profound effect on physics: started as a rethinking of the theory of electromagnetism, it found a new [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry law]] of nature, now called ''[[Poincar\u00e9 symmetry]]'', that replaced the old Galilean (see [[#Galileo Galilei|above]]) symmetry.\n\nSpecial Relativity exerted another long-lasting effect on [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]]. Although initially it was credited with the \"unification of mass and energy\", it became evident that [[relativistic dynamics]] established a firm ''distinction'' between [[rest mass]], which is an invariant (observer independent) property of a [[particle]] or system of particles, and the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of a system.  The latter two are separately [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]] in all situations but not invariant with respect to different observers. The term ''[[mass]]'' in [[particle physics]] underwent a [[semantic change]], and since the late 20th century it almost exclusively denotes the [[invariant mass|rest (or ''invariant'') mass]]. See [[mass in special relativity]] for additional discussion.\n\n====General relativity====\n{{further|History of general relativity}}\nBy 1916, Einstein was able to generalize this further, to deal with all states of motion including non-uniform acceleration, which became the general theory of relativity. In this theory Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. In fact, the curvature of space-time completely replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is a kind of illusion caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects must follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity - all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] \u2014 a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.\n\nThe gradual acceptance of Einstein's theories of relativity and the quantized nature of light transmission, and of [[Niels Bohr's model of the atom]] created as many problems as they solved, leading to a full-scale effort to reestablish physics on new fundamental principles.  Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the \"[[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]\") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the inertial force of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading to the conclusion that space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as [[gravitational lens]]ing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields.\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n{{further|History of quantum mechanics}}\n[[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|180px|right|[[Max Planck]]<br/>(1858\u20131947)]]\nAlthough relativity resolved the electromagnetic phenomena conflict demonstrated by Michelson and Morley, a second theoretical problem was the explanation of the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]]; experiment showed that at shorter wavelengths, toward the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, the energy approached zero, but classical theory predicted it should become infinite. This glaring discrepancy, known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], was solved by the new theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. Quantum mechanics is the theory of [[atom]]s and subatomic systems. Approximately the first 30 years of the 20th century represent the time of the conception and evolution of the theory. The basic ideas of quantum theory were introduced in 1900 by [[Max Planck]] (1858\u20131947), who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1918 for his discovery of the quantified nature of energy. The quantum theory (which previously relied in the \"correspondence\" at large scales between the quantized world of the atom and the continuities of the \"[[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical]]\" world) was accepted when the [[Compton Effect]] established that light carries momentum and can scatter off particles, and when [[Louis de Broglie]] asserted that matter can be seen as behaving as a wave in much the same way as electromagnetic waves behave like particles ([[wave\u2013particle duality]]).\n\n[[File:Heisenberg 10.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Werner Heisenberg]]<br/>(1901\u20131976)]]\n\nIn 1905, Einstein used the quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect, and in 1913 the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] used the same constant to explain the stability of [[Rutherford model|Rutherford's atom]] as well as the frequencies of light emitted by hydrogen gas. The quantized theory of the atom gave way to a full-scale quantum mechanics in the 1920s. New principles of a \"quantum\" rather than a \"classical\" mechanics, formulated in [[Matrix mechanics|matrix-form]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and [[Pascual Jordan]] in 1925, were based on the probabilistic relationship between discrete \"states\" and denied the possibility of [[causality]]. Quantum mechanics was extensively developed by Heisenberg, [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Paul Dirac]], and [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], who established an equivalent theory based on waves in 1926; but Heisenberg's 1927 \"[[uncertainty principle]]\" (indicating the impossibility of precisely and simultaneously measuring position and [[momentum]]) and the \"[[Copenhagen interpretation]]\" of quantum mechanics (named after Bohr's home city) continued to deny the possibility of fundamental causality, though opponents such as Einstein would metaphorically assert that \"God does not play dice with the universe\".<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\">{{Harvtxt|Kragh|1999}}</ref> The new quantum mechanics became an indispensable tool in the investigation and explanation of phenomena at the atomic level. Also in the 1920s, the Indian scientist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]]'s work on [[photon]]s and quantum mechanics provided the foundation for [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]], the theory of the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]].\n\n{{anchor|spin\u2013statistics}} The [[spin\u2013statistics theorem]] established that any particle in quantum mechanics may be either a [[boson]] (statistically Bose\u2013Einstein) or a [[fermion]] (statistically [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics|Fermi\u2013Dirac]]). It was later found that all [[Elementary particle|fundamental]] bosons transmit forces, such as the photon that transmits electromagnetism.\n\nFermions are particles \"like electrons and nucleons\" and are the usual constituents of [[matter]]. Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics later found numerous other uses, from astrophysics (see [[Degenerate matter]]) to [[semiconductor]] design.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== Contemporary and particle physics ==\n{{further|History of subatomic physics|List of unsolved problems in physics}}\n\n===Quantum field theory===\n[[File:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|thumb|287px|right|A [[Feynman diagram]] representing (left to right) the production of a photon (blue [[sine wave]]) from the [[annihilation]] of an electron and its complementary [[antiparticle]], the [[positron]].

However, attempts to quantize electromagnetic theory entirely were stymied throughout the 1930s by theoretical formulations yielding infinite energies. This situation was not considered adequately resolved until after [[World War&nbsp;II]] ended, when [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] independently posited the technique of [[renormalization]], which allowed for an establishment of a robust [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schweber|1994}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, new theories of [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]] proliferated with the rise of the idea of the [[Quantum field theory|quantization of fields]] through \"[[Exchange interaction|exchange forces]]\" regulated by an exchange of short-lived [[Virtual particle|\"virtual\" particle]]s, which were allowed to exist according to the laws governing the uncertainties inherent in the quantum world. Notably, [[Hideki Yukawa]] proposed that the positive charges of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] were kept together courtesy of a powerful but short-range force mediated by a particle with a mass between that of the [[electron]] and [[proton]]. This particle, the \"[[pion]]\", was identified in 1947 as part of what became a slew of particles discovered after World War II. Initially, such particles were found as [[Ionization|ionizing radiation]] left by [[cosmic ray]]s, but increasingly came to be produced in newer and more powerful [[particle accelerator]]s.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Galison|1997}}</ref>\n\nOutside particle physics, significant advances of the time were:\n* the invention of the [[laser]] (1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]);\n* the theoretical and experimental research of [[superconductivity]], especially the invention of a [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory|quantum theory of superconductivity]] by [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] and [[Lev Landau]] (1962 Nobel Prize in Physics) and, later, its explanation via [[Cooper pair]]s (1972 Nobel Prize in Physics). The Cooper pair was an early example of [[quasiparticle]]s.\n\n===Unified field theories===\n{{main|Unified field theory}}\nEinstein deemed that all [[fundamental interaction]]s in nature can be explained in a single theory. Unified field theories were numerous attempts to \"merge\" several interactions. One of formulations of such theories (as well as field theories in general) is a ''[[gauge theory]]'', a generalization of the idea of symmetry. Eventually the [[Standard Model]] (see below) succeeded in unification of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. All attempts to unify [[gravitation]] with something else failed.\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Standard Model===\n{{main|Standard Model}}\n[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Standard Model]].]]\nThe interaction of these particles by [[scattering]] and [[Particle decay|decay]] provided a key to new fundamental quantum theories. [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Yuval Ne'eman]] brought some order to these new particles by classifying them according to certain qualities, beginning with what Gell-Mann referred to as the \"[[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]\". While its further development, the [[quark model]], at first seemed inadequate to describe [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]], allowing the temporary rise of competing theories such as the [[S-Matrix]], the establishment of [[quantum chromodynamics]] in the 1970s finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a \"[[Standard Model|standard model]]\" based on the mathematics of [[Gauge theory|gauge invariance]], which successfully described all forces except for [[gravitation]], and which remains generally accepted within its domain of application.<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\"/>\n\nThe Standard Model groups the [[electroweak interaction]] theory and [[quantum chromodynamics]] into a structure denoted by the [[gauge group]] SU(3)&times;SU(2)&times;U(1). The formulation of the unification of the electromagnetic and [[weak interaction]]s in the standard model is due to [[Abdus Salam]], [[Steven Weinberg]] and, subsequently, [[Sheldon Glashow]].

Using Einstein's general relativity, [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre]] and [[George Gamow|Gamow]] formulated what would become known as the [[big bang theory]]. A rival, called the [[steady state theory]] was devised by [[Fred Hoyle|Hoyle]], [[Thomas Gold|Gold]], [[Jayant Narlikar|Narlikar]] and [[Hermann Bondi|Bondi]].\n\n[[Cosmic background radiation]] was verified in the 1960s by [[Arno Allan Penzias|Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]], and this discovery favoured the big bang at the expense of the steady state scenario. Later work was by [[George Smoot|Smoot]] et al. (1989), among other contributors, using data from the [[Cosmic Background explorer]] (CoBE) and the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) satellites that refined these observations. The 1980s (the same decade of the COBE measurements) also saw the proposal of [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation theory]] by [[Alan Guth|Guth]].\n\nRecently the problems of dark matter and dark energy have risen to the top of the cosmology agenda.\n\n===Higgs boson===\n[[File:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|250px|One possible signature of a Higgs boson from a simulated [[proton]]\u2013proton collision.

Almost all methods are composed of [[steroid hormones]], although in [[India]] one [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] is marketed as a contraceptive. The original hormonal method\u2014the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]\u2014was first marketed as a contraceptive in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Susan Scott Ricci |author2=Terri Kyle |year=2009 |chapter=Common Reproductive Issues|title=Contraception |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| page=119}}</ref> In the ensuing decades many other delivery methods have been developed, although the oral and injectable methods are by far the most popular. Altogether, 18% of the world's contraceptive users rely on hormonal methods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones, Rachel K. |year=2011 |title= Beyond Birth Control: The Overlooked Benefits Of Oral Contraceptive Pills|journal=Guttmacher Institute |volume=November|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Beyond-Birth-Control.pdf}}</ref> Hormonal contraception is highly effective: when taken on the prescribed schedule, users of steroid hormone methods experience pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year. Perfect-use pregnancy rates for most hormonal contraceptives are usually around the 0.3% rate or less.<ref name=\"npsnews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_news/current/hormonal_contraception_tailoring_for_the_individual |title=NPS News 54: Hormonal contraceptives \u2013 tailoring for the individual |author=National Prescribing Service |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2009}}</ref> Currently available methods can only be used by women; the development of a [[male hormonal contraceptive]] is an active research area.\n\nThere are two main types of hormonal contraceptive formulations: ''combined methods'' which contain both an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] and a [[progestin]], and ''progestogen-only methods'' which contain only [[progesterone]] or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins). Combined methods work by suppressing [[ovulation]] and thickening [[cervical mucus]]; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus. The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, [[breakthrough bleeding]] is much more common with progestogen-only methods. Certain serious complications occasionally caused by estrogen-containing contraceptives are not believed to be caused by progestogen-only formulations: [[deep vein thrombosis]] is one example of this.\n\n==Medical uses==\nHormonal contraception is primarily used for the prevention of [[pregnancy]], but is also prescribed for the treatment of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], menstrual disorders such as [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[menorrhagia]], and [[hirsutism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hormonal Contraceptives Offer Benefits Beyond Pregnancy Prevention|url=http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2009/Hormonal_Contraceptives_Offer_Benefits_Beyond_Pregnancy_Prevention|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Polycystic ovary syndrome===\nHormonal treatments, such as hormonal contraceptives, are frequently successful at alleviating symptoms associated with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]. [[Birth control pills]] are often prescribed to reverse the effects of excessive [[androgen]] levels, and decrease ovarian hormone production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Dysmenorrhea===\nHormonal birth control methods such as [[birth control pills]], the [[contraceptive patch]], [[vaginal ring]], [[contraceptive implant]], and [[hormonal IUD]] are used to treat cramping and pain associated with primary [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Noncontraceptive Benefits of Birth Control Pills|url=http://www.reproductivefacts.org/Noncontraceptive_Benefits_of_Birth_Control_Pills_factsheet/|work=Reproductivefacts.org|publisher=The American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dysmenorrhea|url=http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq046.pdf?dmc=1&ts=20130509T0012463128|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Menorrhagia===\n[[Oral contraceptives]] are prescribed in the treatment of [[menorrhagia]] to help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent prolonged menstrual bleeding. The [[hormonal IUD]] ([[Mirena]]) releases [[levonorgestrel]] which thins the uterine lining, preventing excessive bleeding and loss of iron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Menorrhagia (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/menorrhagia/DS00394/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs|work=The Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Hirsutism===\nBirth control pills are the most commonly prescribed hormonal treatment for [[hirsutism]], as they prevent [[ovulation]] and decrease [[androgen]] production by the [[ovaries]]. Additionally, [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] in the pills stimulates the liver to produce more of a protein that binds to androgens and reduces their activity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Effectiveness===\nModern contraceptives using steroid hormones have ''perfect-use'' or ''method'' failure rates of less than 1% per year.

''Progestogen-only contraceptives'' contain only [[progesterone]] or a synthetic analogue (progestin). Also, marketed is [[ormeloxifene]]; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy.\n\n===Combined===\nThe most popular form of hormonal contraception, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is known colloquially as ''the pill''. It is taken once a day, most commonly for 21 days followed by a seven-day break, although other regimens are also used. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, COCPs may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]: this is known as the [[Yuzpe regimen]]. COCPs are available in [[oral contraceptive formulations|a variety of formulations]].\n\nThe [[contraceptive patch]] is applied to the skin and worn continuously. A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. [[NuvaRing]] is worn inside the vagina. A ring is worn for three weeks. After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or NuvaRing to provide [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraception]].\n\nSome [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s can be administered as one injection per month.\n\n===Progestogen-only===\nThe [[progestogen only pill]] (POP) is taken once per day within the same three-hour window. [[Oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen only pills|Several different formulations]] of POP are marketed. A low-dose formulation is known as ''the minipill''. Unlike COCPs, progestogen-only pills are taken every day with no breaks or placebos. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, progestogen-only pills may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]. There are a number of [[Emergency contraceptive availability by country|dedicated products]] sold for this purpose.\n\nHormonal intrauterine contraceptives are known as [[intrauterine system]]s (IUS) or Intrauterine Devices (IUD). An IUS/IUD must be inserted by a health professional. The copper IUD does not contain hormones. While a copper-containing IUD may be used as emergency contraception, the IUS has not been studied for this purpose.\n\n[[Depo Provera]] is an injection that provides three months of contraceptive protection. Noristerat is another injection; it is given every two months.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |title=Noristerat Injection |work=About.com |date=2009-07-28 |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/g/Noristerat.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Contraceptive implants]] are inserted under the skin of the upper arm, and contain progesterone only. [[Jadelle]] (Norplant 2) consists of two rods that release a low dose of hormones. It is effective for five years. Nexplanon has replaced the former [[Implanon]] and is also a single rod that releases etonogestrel (similar to the body's natural progesterone). The only difference between Implanon and Nexplanon is Nexplanon is radio opaque and can be detected by x-ray. This is needed for cases of implant migration. It is effective for three years and is usually done in office. It is over 99% effective. It works in 3 ways: \n1. Prevents ovulation- usually an egg does not mature\n2. thickens cervical mucus so to prevent sperm from reaching the egg\n3. If those 2 fail, the last is the progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to be too thin for implantation.\n\n===Ormeloxifene===\n[[Ormeloxifene]] is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM). Marketed as Centchroman, Centron, or Saheli, it is pill that is taken once per week. Ormeloxifene is legally available only in [[India]].<ref name=\"centron\"/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nThe effect of hormonal agents on the reproductive system is complex. It is believed that combined hormonal contraceptives work primarily by preventing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus. Progestogen-only contraceptives can also prevent ovulation, but rely more significantly on the thickening of cervical mucus. Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation, and its mechanism of action is not well understood.\n\n===Combined===\nCombined hormonal contraceptives were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. They inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.|title=Contraceptive technology|edition=20th revised|location=New York|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=249\u2013341|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0|issn=0091-9721|oclc=781956734}} pp. 257\u2013258:<blockquote>Mechanism of action<br/>COCs prevent fertilization and, therefore, qualify as contraceptives. There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.<br/>Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.</blockquote></ref><ref name=\"Speroff 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Oral contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=19\u2013152|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}}</ref><ref name=\"Levin 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Levin|first=Ellis R.|last2=Hammes|first2=Stephen R.|year=2011|chapter=Estrogens and progestins|editor1-last=Brunton|editor1-first=Laurence L.|editor2-last=Chabner|editor2-first=Bruce A.|editor3-last=Knollmann|editor3-first=Bj\u00f6rn C.|title=Goodman & Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics|edition=12th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|pages=1163\u20131194|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Glasier 2010\">{{cite book|last=Glasier|first=Anna|year=2010|chapter=Contraception|editor1-last=Jameson|editor1-first=J.

Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/><ref name=\"Speroff 2011\"/><ref name=\"Levin 2011\"/>\n\nEstrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/><ref name=\"Speroff 2011\"/><ref name=\"Levin 2011\"/>\n\nAnother primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/>\n\nThe estrogen and progestogen in combined hormonal contraceptives have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/>\n* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].\n* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].\n* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.\n\nInsufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/>\n\n===Progestogen-only===\nThe mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose.<ref name=\"Glasier 2010\"/>\n\nLow dose progestogen-only contraceptives include traditional progestogen-only pills, the subdermal implant [[Jadelle]] and the [[intrauterine system]] Mirena. These contraceptives inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the [[cervical mucus]] and thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration.\n\nIntermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant [[Implanon]]), allow some follicular development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97\u201399% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with low dose progestogens.\n\nHigh dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens.\n\nIn [[anovulation|anovulatory cycles]] using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).\n\n===Ormeloxifene===\nOrmeloxifene does not affect ovulation. It has been shown to increase the rate of [[blastocyst]] development and to increase the speed at which the blastocyst is moved from the [[fallopian tube]]s into the uterus. Ormeloxifene also suppresses proliferation and [[decidualization]] of the [[endometrium]] (the transformation of the endometrium in preparation for possible implantation of an embryo).<ref

Combined methods work by suppressing [[ovulation]] and thickening [[cervical mucus]]; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus. The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, [[breakthrough bleeding]] is much more common with progestogen-only methods.

''Progestogen-only contraceptives'' contain only [[progesterone]] or a synthetic analogue (progestin). Also, marketed is [[ormeloxifene]]; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy.\n\n===Combined===\nThe most popular form of hormonal contraception, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is known colloquially as ''the pill''. It is taken once a day, most commonly for 21 days followed by a seven-day break, although other regimens are also used. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, COCPs may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]: this is known as the [[Yuzpe regimen]]. COCPs are available in [[oral contraceptive formulations|a variety of formulations]].\n\nThe [[contraceptive patch]] is applied to the skin and worn continuously. A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. [[NuvaRing]] is worn inside the vagina. A ring is worn for three weeks. After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or NuvaRing to provide [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraception]].\n\nSome [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s can be administered as one injection per month.\n\n===Progestogen-only===\nThe [[progestogen only pill]] (POP) is taken once per day within the same three-hour window. [[Oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen only pills|Several different formulations]] of POP are marketed. A low-dose formulation is known as ''the minipill''. Unlike COCPs, progestogen-only pills are taken every day with no breaks or placebos. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, progestogen-only pills may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]. There are a number of [[Emergency contraceptive availability by country|dedicated products]] sold for this purpose.\n\nHormonal intrauterine contraceptives are known as [[intrauterine system]]s (IUS) or Intrauterine Devices (IUD). An IUS/IUD must be inserted by a health professional. The copper IUD does not contain hormones. While a copper-containing IUD may be used as emergency contraception, the IUS has not been studied for this purpose.\n\n[[Depo Provera]] is an injection that provides three months of contraceptive protection. Noristerat is another injection; it is given every two months.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |title=Noristerat Injection |work=About.com |date=2009-07-28 |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/g/Noristerat.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Contraceptive implants]] are inserted under the skin of the upper arm, and contain progesterone only. [[Jadelle]] (Norplant 2) consists of two rods that release a low dose of hormones. It is effective for five years. Nexplanon has replaced the former [[Implanon]] and is also a single rod that releases etonogestrel (similar to the body's natural progesterone). The only difference between Implanon and Nexplanon is Nexplanon is radio opaque and can be detected by x-ray. This is needed for cases of implant migration. It is effective for three years and is usually done in office. It is over 99% effective. It works in 3 ways: \n1. Prevents ovulation- usually an egg does not mature\n2. thickens cervical mucus so to prevent sperm from reaching the egg\n3. If those 2 fail, the last is the progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to be too thin for implantation.\n\n===Ormeloxifene===\n[[Ormeloxifene]] is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM). Marketed as Centchroman, Centron, or Saheli, it is pill that is taken once per week. Ormeloxifene is legally available only in [[India]].<ref name=\"centron\"/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nThe effect of hormonal agents on the reproductive system is complex. It is believed that combined hormonal contraceptives work primarily by preventing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus. Progestogen-only contraceptives can also prevent ovulation, but rely more significantly on the thickening of cervical mucus. Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation, and its mechanism of action is not well understood.\n\n===Combined===\nCombined hormonal contraceptives were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. They inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.|title=Contraceptive technology|edition=20th revised|location=New York|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=249\u2013341|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0|issn=0091-9721|oclc=781956734}} pp. 257\u2013258:<blockquote>Mechanism of action<br/>COCs prevent fertilization and, therefore, qualify as contraceptives. There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.<br/>Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.</blockquote></ref><ref name=\"Speroff 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Oral contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=19\u2013152|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}}</ref><ref name=\"Levin 2011\">{{cite book|last1=Levin|first=Ellis R.|last2=Hammes|first2=Stephen R.|year=2011|chapter=Estrogens and progestins|editor1-last=Brunton|editor1-first=Laurence L.|editor2-last=Chabner|editor2-first=Bruce A.|editor3-last=Knollmann|editor3-first=Bj\u00f6rn C.|title=Goodman & Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics|edition=12th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|pages=1163\u20131194|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Glasier 2010\">{{cite book|last=Glasier|first=Anna|year=2010|chapter=Contraception|editor1-last=Jameson|editor1-first=J.

Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/><ref name=\"Speroff 2011\"/><ref name=\"Levin 2011\"/>\n\nEstrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/><ref name=\"Speroff 2011\"/><ref name=\"Levin 2011\"/>\n\nAnother primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/>\n\nThe estrogen and progestogen in combined hormonal contraceptives have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/>\n* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].\n* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].\n* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.\n\nInsufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.<ref name=\"Nelson 2011\"/>\n\n===Progestogen-only===\nThe mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose.<ref name=\"Glasier 2010\"/>\n\nLow dose progestogen-only contraceptives include traditional progestogen-only pills, the subdermal implant [[Jadelle]] and the [[intrauterine system]] Mirena. These contraceptives inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the [[cervical mucus]] and thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration.\n\nIntermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant [[Implanon]]), allow some follicular development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97\u201399% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with low dose progestogens.\n\nHigh dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens.\n\nIn [[anovulation|anovulatory cycles]] using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).\n\n===Ormeloxifene===\nOrmeloxifene does not affect ovulation. It has been shown to increase the rate of [[blastocyst]] development and to increase the speed at which the blastocyst is moved from the [[fallopian tube]]s into the uterus. Ormeloxifene also suppresses proliferation and [[decidualization]] of the [[endometrium]] (the transformation of the endometrium in preparation for possible implantation of an embryo).<ref
