Johnson, a World War II veteran, had kept his collection of more than 3,400 sharpeners in a small shed, outside his home in [[Carbon Hill, Ohio|Carbon Hill]] in southeast Ohio. He had started collecting after his wife gave him a few pencil sharpeners as a gift in the late 1980s, and kept them organized into categories, including cats, Christmas, and [[Disneyland]].<ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/05/16/3629979/new-home-for-ohio-mans-pencil.html#ixzz1NNMvf1Wr \u201cNew home for Ohio man's pencil sharpener 'museum\u2019\u201d at sacbee.com]</ref>\n\n==Manual sharpeners==\n\n=== Prism sharpeners ===\n[[File:KUM Sharpener.jpg|thumb|left|[[Magnesium alloy]] prism sharpener]]\nSo-called \"prism\" sharpeners, also called \"manual\" or \"pocket\" sharpeners in the United States, have no separate moving parts and are typically the smallest and cheapest commonly used pencil sharpener on the market. The simplest common variety is a small rectangular [[prism (geometry)|prism]] or block, only about 1 \u00d7 5/8 \u00d7 7/16&nbsp;inch (2.5 \u00d7 1.7 \u00d7 1.1&nbsp;cm) in size. The block-shaped sharpener consists of a combined point-shaping cone that is aligned to the cylindrical pencil alignment guide hole, into which the pencil is inserted.  A sharp blade is mounted so that its sharp edge just enters the shaping cone [[tangent|tangentially]].  The pencil is inserted into the sharpener and rotated while the sharpener is held motionless.  The body of the sharpener is often contoured, ridged or grooved to make the small block easier to firmly grip, and is typically made of [[aluminum alloy]], [[magnesium alloy]] or hard [[plastic]].\n\n[[File:Taille crayon m\u00e9canique-h.jpg|thumb|upright|An unusual hand-cranked prism sharpener, with a shavings cover]]\nThe blade inside the sharpener shaves the wood and graphite tip of the pencil, while the shavings emerge through a slot along the blade edge. It is important that the cylindrical alignment hole closely fit the diameter of the pencil, to keep the pencil from wobbling, which would cause stepped or lurching cut-depths and point breakage. Another important feature is a larger clearance hole at the end of the cone allowing sections of the pencil lead which break away to be removed with only minor inconvenience. Prism sharpeners can be bare or enclosed in a container to collect the shavings, while some enclosed sharpeners may be harder to clear in the event of a blockage. \n\nA few prism sharpeners are hand-cranked, rotating the cutting blade instead of rotating the pencil.  Moderate care is needed to not break the tip of the pencil being sharpened, requiring the pencil to be sharpened again. However, because pencils may have different standard diameters in different nations, imported sharpeners may have non-standard-sized alignment guide-holes, making sharpening attempts difficult. If the alignment hole is too small, the pencil cannot be inserted, while if it is too large, the tip of the pencil repeatedly will break off. Prism sharpeners may be right- or left-handed, requiring clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the pencil being sharpened. \n\n=== Linear blade sharpeners ===\n[[File:Temperowka.na.zyletke.jpg|thumb|A linear sharpener that uses a [[razor|razor blade]]]]\nUnlike prism sharpeners, linear blade sharpeners do not rotate relative to the pencil being sharpened, and may be viewed as just a special form of knife, with a mechanical guide for increased safety and convenience. Some models use replaceable shaving [[razor blade]]s, while others have permanently-fitted blades.  Linear blade sharpeners may require more skill, but they allow one to sharpen the tip of the pencil into any desired shape and angle of taper, whereas prism sharpeners have a fixed sharpening angle and produce circular symmetry.\n\nWhile most linear blade sharpeners are simple and directly hand operated, some devices in the past were crank operated, using mechanisms to convert crank rotation into linear motion.<ref name=\"officemuseum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.officemuseum.com/pencil_sharpeners.htm |title=Pencil Sharpeners|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cylindrical (planetary) sharpeners ===\n[[File:Pencil sharpener mechanism.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.4|A wall-mounted planetary sharpener (casing removed to reveal the mechanism)]]\nThese mechanisms are also called '''planetary sharpeners''',<ref name=\"officemuseum\" /> in reference to their use of [[planetary gear]]s. A larger, stationary planetary sharpener can be mounted on a desk or wall and powered by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]]. Typically, the pencil is inserted into the sharpener with one hand, and the crank is turned with the other. This rotates a set of [[helix|helical]] cylindrical cutters in the mechanism, set at an acute angle to each other. The multiple cutting edges quickly sharpen the pencil, with a more precise finish than a single-blade device{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Some cylindrical sharpeners have only one helical cutter cylinder{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}, but most have two cylinders or more. \n\nMost planetary sharpeners have a large opening, with a rotatable guide disk in front of it that has multiple holes of different sizes, to accommodate pencils of many different diameters. Advanced models have a spring-driven holder for the pencil, so that the pencil automatically is pushed into the mechanism while being sharpened. Some versions also offer a regulator of the desired sharpness, since it is not always desired to make the graphite core needle-sharp.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} On March 32nd, 2078 the pencil sharpener won the prize for greatest invention ever.\n\n=== Other systems ===\n[[File:Bleistiftsch\u00e4rfMaschineJupiter1.JPG|thumb|Jupiter 1 with rotary disk cutters]]\nSome older models like the 1897 German Jupiter 1 used reversible rotary cutter-disks with cutting edges radiating from the center on each side. These were high-end models, quite large and expensive. Others simply used abrasives like [[sandpaper]]. In some cases an abrasive was used to shape the graphite core, while the wood was cut some other way.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Electric sharpeners==\nThe oldest surviving electric pencil sharpener is the Boston Polar Club pencil sharpener, introduced around 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antikeychop.com/bostonpolarclubpencilsharpener|title=The Antikey Chop|website=Boston Polar Club Pencil Sharpener|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> Electric pencil sharpeners work on the same principle as manual ones, but one or more flat-bladed or cylindrical cutters are rotated by an [[electric motor]].<ref name=\"officemuseumelectric\">{{cite web|url=http://www.officemuseum.com/electric_sharpener_gallery.htm|title=Electric Pencil Sharpeners|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> Some electric pencil sharpeners are powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] rather than being plugged into a building's electrical system, making them more portable.\n\nAuto-stop electric pencil sharpeners are able to sense when the tip of the pencil is long enough, so they stop automatically. In basic automatic pencil sharpeners, the lead may become too long and break, and so users must be careful to supervise the operation.\n\n== Razor knife ==\nArtists and craftsmen may use a very sharp knife to sharpen pencils and other media freehand, without the use of any mechanical guides. For example, the tip may be cut into a triangle shape, and then the edges of the triangle are trimmed down. This technique requires a total of 6 cuts, and takes practice to master without breaking the lead.<ref name=\"artist's knife\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GEn7OrYcuc|title=razor knife}}</ref>\n\n== Specialized pencil sharpeners ==\n[[File:Sharpener.jpg|thumb|left|Prism sharpener with two holes for different sizes of pencils]]\n[[File:Faber-Castell TK lead sharpener and 2 mm pencil lead.jpg|thumb|lead sharpener/lead pointer and 2 mm pencil lead in a [[leadholder]]]]\n[[File:Flat pencil sharpener.jpg|thumb|Specialized sharpener for carpenter's flat pencils]]\n\nSpecialized sharpeners are available that operate on non-standard sizes of pencil-shaped markers, such as wax crayons used in primary schools. Sharpeners that have two openings, one for normal pencils and one for larger crayons, are fairly common. Sharpeners with a single blade for use on wax crayons are available, and sometimes included in boxes of crayons. These often have plastic blades, which are adequate for the soft wax.\n\nAn artist's or draftsman's pencil sharpener leaves the graphite untouched and sharpens only the wood (some models can switch from standard to wood-only by an adjustment). The graphite lead is then honed to a sharp point with a [[lead pointer]], which sharpens only the lead without wood. Lead pointers are also used with mechanical [[leadholder]]s, with thicker diameter leads like 2 mm which have removable/refillable leads. Some sharpeners which function as a long point sharpener, have a second hole in which the blade sharpens the untouched graphite to a long, more precise point than would be otherwise possible using a single hole long point sharpener.\n\nCarpenters may use [[carpenter pencil]]s, the flattened shape of which stops them from rolling away, while still providing a constant line width. These pencils were traditionally sharpened with tools conveniently to hand, such as a [[plane (tool)|plane]] or sandpaper. Rotating pencil sharpeners are now available for these, in which a rotating plastic collar holds the pencil in position, although they then sharpen them to the usual conical point as for a round pencil, abandoning some distinctive aspects of the carpenter's pencil.\n\n[[Mechanical pencil]]s with thin diameter leads dispense the graphite lead progressively during use and thus do not require sharpening; such pencils are sometimes called \"self-sharpening\". A type of mechanical pencil has a rotating gear mechanism which rotates the lead slightly every time the lead is lifted off the paper, helping to maintain a consistent, sharp point.  If a finer or broader line is needed, a separate mechanical pencil using a lead with a different diameter is required.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:CrankPencilShapener.jpg|Hand-cranked planetary sharpener, with cover in place\nFile:Apsco Vacuhold pencil sharpener 13.jpg|Hand-cranked planetary sharpener from 1950\u201360, with cover removed\nFile:HighEndSharpener.png|Hand-cranked planetary sharpener with spring-driven pencil holder.

He had started collecting after his wife gave him a few pencil sharpeners as a gift in the late 1980s, and kept them organized into categories, including cats, Christmas, and [[Disneyland]].<ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/05/16/3629979/new-home-for-ohio-mans-pencil.html#ixzz1NNMvf1Wr \u201cNew home for Ohio man's pencil sharpener 'museum\u2019\u201d at sacbee.com]</ref>\n\n==Manual sharpeners==\n\n=== Prism sharpeners ===\n[[File:KUM Sharpener.jpg|thumb|left|[[Magnesium alloy]] prism sharpener]]\nSo-called \"prism\" sharpeners, also called \"manual\" or \"pocket\" sharpeners in the United States, have no separate moving parts and are typically the smallest and cheapest commonly used pencil sharpener on the market. The simplest common variety is a small rectangular [[prism (geometry)|prism]] or block, only about 1 \u00d7 5/8 \u00d7 7/16&nbsp;inch (2.5 \u00d7 1.7 \u00d7 1.1&nbsp;cm) in size. The block-shaped sharpener consists of a combined point-shaping cone that is aligned to the cylindrical pencil alignment guide hole, into which the pencil is inserted.  A sharp blade is mounted so that its sharp edge just enters the shaping cone [[tangent|tangentially]].  The pencil is inserted into the sharpener and rotated while the sharpener is held motionless.  The body of the sharpener is often contoured, ridged or grooved to make the small block easier to firmly grip, and is typically made of [[aluminum alloy]], [[magnesium alloy]] or hard [[plastic]].\n\n[[File:Taille crayon m\u00e9canique-h.jpg|thumb|upright|An unusual hand-cranked prism sharpener, with a shavings cover]]\nThe blade inside the sharpener shaves the wood and graphite tip of the pencil, while the shavings emerge through a slot along the blade edge. It is important that the cylindrical alignment hole closely fit the diameter of the pencil, to keep the pencil from wobbling, which would cause stepped or lurching cut-depths and point breakage. Another important feature is a larger clearance hole at the end of the cone allowing sections of the pencil lead which break away to be removed with only minor inconvenience. Prism sharpeners can be bare or enclosed in a container to collect the shavings, while some enclosed sharpeners may be harder to clear in the event of a blockage. \n\nA few prism sharpeners are hand-cranked, rotating the cutting blade instead of rotating the pencil.  Moderate care is needed to not break the tip of the pencil being sharpened, requiring the pencil to be sharpened again. However, because pencils may have different standard diameters in different nations, imported sharpeners may have non-standard-sized alignment guide-holes, making sharpening attempts difficult. If the alignment hole is too small, the pencil cannot be inserted, while if it is too large, the tip of the pencil repeatedly will break off. Prism sharpeners may be right- or left-handed, requiring clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the pencil being sharpened. \n\n=== Linear blade sharpeners ===\n[[File:Temperowka.na.zyletke.jpg|thumb|A linear sharpener that uses a [[razor|razor blade]]]]\nUnlike prism sharpeners, linear blade sharpeners do not rotate relative to the pencil being sharpened, and may be viewed as just a special form of knife, with a mechanical guide for increased safety and convenience. Some models use replaceable shaving [[razor blade]]s, while others have permanently-fitted blades.  Linear blade sharpeners may require more skill, but they allow one to sharpen the tip of the pencil into any desired shape and angle of taper, whereas prism sharpeners have a fixed sharpening angle and produce circular symmetry.\n\nWhile most linear blade sharpeners are simple and directly hand operated, some devices in the past were crank operated, using mechanisms to convert crank rotation into linear motion.<ref name=\"officemuseum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.officemuseum.com/pencil_sharpeners.htm |title=Pencil Sharpeners|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cylindrical (planetary) sharpeners ===\n[[File:Pencil sharpener mechanism.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.4|A wall-mounted planetary sharpener (casing removed to reveal the mechanism)]]\nThese mechanisms are also called '''planetary sharpeners''',<ref name=\"officemuseum\" /> in reference to their use of [[planetary gear]]s. A larger, stationary planetary sharpener can be mounted on a desk or wall and powered by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]]. Typically, the pencil is inserted into the sharpener with one hand, and the crank is turned with the other. This rotates a set of [[helix|helical]] cylindrical cutters in the mechanism, set at an acute angle to each other. The multiple cutting edges quickly sharpen the pencil, with a more precise finish than a single-blade device{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Some cylindrical sharpeners have only one helical cutter cylinder{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}, but most have two cylinders or more. \n\nMost planetary sharpeners have a large opening, with a rotatable guide disk in front of it that has multiple holes of different sizes, to accommodate pencils of many different diameters. Advanced models have a spring-driven holder for the pencil, so that the pencil automatically is pushed into the mechanism while being sharpened. Some versions also offer a regulator of the desired sharpness, since it is not always desired to make the graphite core needle-sharp.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} On March 32nd, 2078 the pencil sharpener won the prize for greatest invention ever.\n\n=== Other systems ===\n[[File:Bleistiftsch\u00e4rfMaschineJupiter1.JPG|thumb|Jupiter 1 with rotary disk cutters]]\nSome older models like the 1897 German Jupiter 1 used reversible rotary cutter-disks with cutting edges radiating from the center on each side. These were high-end models, quite large and expensive. Others simply used abrasives like [[sandpaper]]. In some cases an abrasive was used to shape the graphite core, while the wood was cut some other way.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Electric sharpeners==\nThe oldest surviving electric pencil sharpener is the Boston Polar Club pencil sharpener, introduced around 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antikeychop.com/bostonpolarclubpencilsharpener|title=The Antikey Chop|website=Boston Polar Club Pencil Sharpener|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> Electric pencil sharpeners work on the same principle as manual ones, but one or more flat-bladed or cylindrical cutters are rotated by an [[electric motor]].<ref name=\"officemuseumelectric\">{{cite web|url=http://www.officemuseum.com/electric_sharpener_gallery.htm|title=Electric Pencil Sharpeners|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> Some electric pencil sharpeners are powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] rather than being plugged into a building's electrical system, making them more portable.\n\nAuto-stop electric pencil sharpeners are able to sense when the tip of the pencil is long enough, so they stop automatically. In basic automatic pencil sharpeners, the lead may become too long and break, and so users must be careful to supervise the operation.\n\n== Razor knife ==\nArtists and craftsmen may use a very sharp knife to sharpen pencils and other media freehand, without the use of any mechanical guides. For example, the tip may be cut into a triangle shape, and then the edges of the triangle are trimmed down. This technique requires a total of 6 cuts, and takes practice to master without breaking the lead.<ref name=\"artist's knife\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GEn7OrYcuc|title=razor knife}}</ref>\n\n== Specialized pencil sharpeners ==\n[[File:Sharpener.jpg|thumb|left|Prism sharpener with two holes for different sizes of pencils]]\n[[File:Faber-Castell TK lead sharpener and 2 mm pencil lead.jpg|thumb|lead sharpener/lead pointer and 2 mm pencil lead in a [[leadholder]]]]\n[[File:Flat pencil sharpener.jpg|thumb|Specialized sharpener for carpenter's flat pencils]]\n\nSpecialized sharpeners are available that operate on non-standard sizes of pencil-shaped markers, such as wax crayons used in primary schools. Sharpeners that have two openings, one for normal pencils and one for larger crayons, are fairly common. Sharpeners with a single blade for use on wax crayons are available, and sometimes included in boxes of crayons. These often have plastic blades, which are adequate for the soft wax.\n\nAn artist's or draftsman's pencil sharpener leaves the graphite untouched and sharpens only the wood (some models can switch from standard to wood-only by an adjustment). The graphite lead is then honed to a sharp point with a [[lead pointer]], which sharpens only the lead without wood. Lead pointers are also used with mechanical [[leadholder]]s, with thicker diameter leads like 2 mm which have removable/refillable leads. Some sharpeners which function as a long point sharpener, have a second hole in which the blade sharpens the untouched graphite to a long, more precise point than would be otherwise possible using a single hole long point sharpener.\n\nCarpenters may use [[carpenter pencil]]s, the flattened shape of which stops them from rolling away, while still providing a constant line width. These pencils were traditionally sharpened with tools conveniently to hand, such as a [[plane (tool)|plane]] or sandpaper. Rotating pencil sharpeners are now available for these, in which a rotating plastic collar holds the pencil in position, although they then sharpen them to the usual conical point as for a round pencil, abandoning some distinctive aspects of the carpenter's pencil.\n\n[[Mechanical pencil]]s with thin diameter leads dispense the graphite lead progressively during use and thus do not require sharpening; such pencils are sometimes called \"self-sharpening\". A type of mechanical pencil has a rotating gear mechanism which rotates the lead slightly every time the lead is lifted off the paper, helping to maintain a consistent, sharp point.  If a finer or broader line is needed, a separate mechanical pencil using a lead with a different diameter is required.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:CrankPencilShapener.jpg|Hand-cranked planetary sharpener, with cover in place\nFile:Apsco Vacuhold pencil sharpener 13.jpg|Hand-cranked planetary sharpener from 1950\u201360, with cover removed\nFile:HighEndSharpener.png|Hand-cranked planetary sharpener with spring-driven pencil holder.

The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in [[Formula One]] with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]]. In retirement, Rosberg moved into [[Coach (sport)|driver management]], television [[pundit]]ry, and became an [[Ecopreneurship|eco-entrepreneur]]. He was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year]] and was inducted into the [[FIA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal background and

racing driver who won the [[2016 Formula One World Championship]] driving for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport]]. The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in [[Formula One]] with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]]. In retirement, Rosberg moved into [[Coach (sport)|driver management]], television [[pundit]]ry, and became an [[Ecopreneurship|eco-entrepreneur]]. He was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year]] and was inducted into the [[FIA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal background and

{"title_page": "Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base", "text_new": "{{Taxation}}\n\nThe '''Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base''' ('''CCCTB''') is a proposal for a common tax scheme for the [[European Union]] developed by the [[European Commission]] and first proposed in March 2011 that provides a single set of rules for how EU corporations calculate EU taxes, and provide the ability to consolidate EU taxes.<ref name=\"summary\">{{citation|title=EU common consolidated corporate tax base - citizens' summary|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/company_tax/common_tax_base/ccctb_citizen_en.pdf|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}</ref> Corporate tax rates in the EU would not be changed by the CCCTB, as EU countries would continue to have their own corporate tax rates.<ref name=summary/>\n\nThe original proposal stalled, largely due to objections from countries such as Ireland and the UK.<ref>{{cite news|title=EU in new push for common corporate tax base|work=[[EUobserver]]|first=Honor|last=Mahony|date=17 June 2015|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/129156}}</ref> In June 2015, the Commission announced they will submit a relaunched CCCTB proposal in 2016, featuring two key changes compared to the initial proposal: First it would become mandatory (not voluntary) for corporations to apply the CCCTB regime, and second the \"consolidation part\" will be postponed for a later follow-up proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5174_en.htm|title=European Commission - Fact Sheet: Questions and Answers on the CCCTB re-launch|last=|first=|date=17 June 2015|website=|publisher=[[European Commission]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Concept==\n\nThe concept of CCCTB requires all EU Member States or just a group of them to develop a set of common rules for determining the tax base of companies with operations in several EU Member States. In every participating Member State corporations could subsequently opt for the adoption of this common European tax base to be used regarding all their activities within the EU. As framework for defining such a common European tax base the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) have been suggested. Furthermore, the group's tax base is intended not to include intra-group profits.\n\n=== Administration===\n\nDepending on the location where the parent of the EU group resides, the corresponding Member State is responsible for assessing the group's tax base. However, the corporate income tax rate will be determined by each individual Member State. Correlated, the overall profit of the group needs to be allocated to the individual Member States to be taxed there. This allocation has to be regulated by the terms of a formula the participating Member States have previously agreed upon. The so-called formula apportionment (FA) usually employs factors like capital, sales and labour on which the allocation is based. Prior to the allocation, these factors need to be weighted. Finally, every allocated share of profit is taxed in the respective Member State with the relevant corporate tax rate.\n\n=== Mechanism===\n\n# Each member of an EU-group, i.e., the parent and related subsidiaries residing in the EU which constitute the group, computes its profits separately according to the same harmonized tax rules.\n# The profits of each member are added and consolidated at the level of the group's parent.\n# Group income is allocated according to a specific formula to the Member States where companies of the group are located.\n# Allocated profits are taxed according to the national tax rates.\n\n== Scope of the CCCTB group==\n\n=== Consolidated group===\nIn [[financial accounting]], subsidiaries are included into consolidated statements, if they are controlled by their parent. This is usually assumed when the shareholding exceeds 50%. Strictly legal criteria make it easy to decide for tax purposes whether a company is part of the group or not. However, the participation threshold should be higher in order to avoid excessive tax planning. A high participation threshold (e.g., 75% or 90%) takes into account that consolidation implies a high degree of economic integration of the members of the group. Moreover, in this case the subsidiary's profit accrues mainly to the parent. The European Commission proposes that a company is included into the CCCTB group if the shareholding exceeds 50% and more than 75% of the capital is owned by the parent (''all-in-all-out'').\n\n=== Formula apportionment===\n\nThe CCCTB replaces separate accounting by formula apportionment. In general, the following factors could be applied for the allocation of corporate income:\n\n* Microeconomic factors:\n** Capital, labour and/or sales;\n** Value added of the group in each Member State.\n* Macroeconomic factors:\n** E.g. [[Gross National Product|gross national product]].\n\nThe allocation system should aim at simplicity and legal certainty. The formula apportionment should include allocation factors to be fair (inter-nation-equity) by reflecting the economic activity in the Member States.\n\n=== Three-factor formula===\n\nThe European Commission proposes a formula for corporate income tax apportionment based on three factors: capital (assets), labour (payroll and number of employees), and sales.<ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB)|url=https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/com_2016_683_en.pdf|volume=|page=28|pages=|chapter=VIII, APPORTIONMENT OF THE COMMON CONSOLIDATED CORPORATE TAX BASE, Article 28, General rules|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}</ref>\n\n:<math>Share A = \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{Sales^A}{Sales^{Group}} + \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Payroll^A}{Payroll^{Group}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{No\\ of\\ employees^A}{No\\ of\\ employees^{Group}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{Assets^A}{Assets^{Group}}\\right] \\cdot Con'd\\ Tax\\ Base</math>\n\n==== Example ====\n\nAssume that company Z [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]], resident in [[Germany]], has a 100% subsidiary Y [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung|GmbH]], resident in  [[Slovakia]]. Z has a payroll of \u20ac3 million, capital of \u20ac150 million, and sales of \u20ac135 million. Y has a payroll of \u20ac5 million, capital of \u20ac50 million, and sales of  \u20ac65 million. The total group income is \u20ac1 million. Suppose further that according to the arm's length standard Z earns \u20ac700,000 and Y \u20ac300,000. In the event of separate taxation, the total tax liability would amount to \u20ac267,000 = 0.3 &times; \u20ac700,000 + 0.19 &times; \u20ac300.000. The average tax rate of the group would thus amount to 26.7%.\n\nAssume now that the group applies for the CCCTB. The group computes the tax base of both Z and Y according to the CCCTB rules and subsequently both Z's and Y's tax computations are submitted to the German tax authorities. When the tax calculations are agreed upon, the tax base has to be apportioned between Germany and Slovakia. The group pays tax on the share of profit apportioned to Slovakia at the Slovak tax rate (19%), while tax on the German share of profit is paid at the German tax rate (30%). In this example, as it is proposed by the European Commission, capital, labour and sales are equally-weighted.\n\nThe tax liability for both countries is hence the following:\n\n<math>Germany: 30\\% \\cdot \\euro 1,000,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 150,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 3,000,000}{\\euro 8,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 135,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} \\right] = \\euro 180,000.</math>\n\n<math>Slovakia: 19\\% \\cdot \\euro 1,000,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 50,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 5,000,000}{\\euro 8,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 65,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} \\right] = \\euro 76,000.</math>\n\nThe total tax bill of the group amounts to \u20ac256,000, therefore the group's average tax rate equals 25.6%.\n\n=== Advantages and disadvantages===\n\nEach eligible group would only have to deal with one tax administration and would be subject to a single set of tax rules. All Member States which wish to adopt the new tax code would be able to do so without amending their existing tax code since CCCTB would only be another tax code in addition to the already existing 28 national tax codes. Furthermore, each Member State would have the right to set its own tax rate, thereby keeping up fiscal sovereignty and maintaining the possibility of tax competition. Also, tax planning opportunities within the EU would be eliminated to a great extent. However, the formula apportionment creates new incentives for tax planning. Last, enterprises are likely to benefit from intra-group consolidation and compensation of profits and losses.\n\n=== Compliance costs===\n\nThe European Commission's proposal is likely to lead to a significant reduction in compliance costs, in particular for companies. It will also reduce the number of different tax codes companies have to apply. Cross-border transactions within the EU would cease to give rise to specific tax compliance costs for companies. On the other hand, tax administrations have to operate an additional tax system if the current tax code is maintained (parallel tax base, CCCTB). It might be the case that some tax administrations find their workload increased by the new tax rules. Last, design and operation of the allocation process will determine administrative and compliance costs.\n\n== International investment==\n\n=== Loss compensation and group relief===\n\nA group relief is available independently of the seat of a company within the EU. Therefore, the CCCTB implies a consolidation of losses and profits within the group. The allocation of the overall profit would not be determined by separate accounting but by the formula. Because of EU-wide consolidation of profits and losses, each Member State bears a subsidiary's loss in proportion to its share of the overall profit. Acceptance of foreign losses by Member States is thus easier to attain. Because of the consolidation of the EU-wide operations of the firm, it is sensible to assume that there are sufficient profits to absorb losses of group members. Hence, an immediate cross-border loss compensation is available, making interest and liquidity disadvantages disappear. In the case of an overall loss, a loss carry forward and a loss carry back must exist in ''each'' Member State. The European Commission proposes an unlimited loss carry forward. However, whether group relief for third countries, i.e., non-EU countries, is available, depends on national legislation.\n\n=== Dividend taxation===\n\nAll intra-group [[dividend]]s are treated as tax-free domestic dividends. Thus, profits of subsidiaries and [[permanent establishment]]s (PE) are equally taxed and all profits are taxed only once. For dividends from third countries, the European Commission proposes tax exemption and an anti-abuse rule (which is to switch over to credit in case of low taxation).\n\n=== Neutrality of legal form===\n\nMore in general, subsidiaries are treated as PEs under CCCTB regulation. Hence, there is no tax incentive for one of these forms of establishments. This is especially true for the following features of corporate taxation: loss compensation, taxation of hidden reserves, financing and transfer pricing. However, some tax rules, particularly the taxation of hidden reserves have not been dealt with in detail in the proposals.\n\n==International profit shifting==\n\n=== Interest expenses===\n\nInterest expenses are part of the group's total income. Thus, it is ensured that the actual costs are deducted (net principle). Tax arbitrage is not possible because business expenses do reduce the income of ''all'' companies proportionately to their respective share of the overall profit. Companies cannot claim expenses in a high-tax jurisdiction, while profits are taxed in low-tax jurisdictions. However, tax arbitrage is possible in the case of subsidiaries located in third countries. Consequently, the European Commission proposes to introduce an anti-abuse rule which limits the interest deductibility.\n\n=== Tax deferral===\n\nBecause of the equal tax treatment of PEs and subsidiaries, [[tax deferral]] is not possible any longer. Profits and losses of subsidiaries are included into the tax base irrespective of the actual profit distribution. According to the formula, profit in a low-tax country is also burdened with the tax level of other EU Member States. However, the problem remains in the case of subsidiaries located in third countries. To address this issue, the European Commission proposes CFC rules for subsidiaries in third states.\n\n=== Transfer pricing===\n\nThe group's total profit is calculated at the level of the parent, hence [[transfer pricing]] is no longer necessary for EU transactions. The current complexities of interpretation and application of the OECD guidelines on transfer pricing cease to exist for EU activities. [[Double taxation]] due to conflicting qualifications can no longer arise for EU transactions as well. Additionally, companies do not have to record transfer prices for the EU tax authorities any longer. Thus, cross-border transactions within the EU would cease to give rise to specific tax costs due to conflicting qualifications. However, transfer pricing problems are replaced by allocation problems. Furthermore, the problems of transfer pricing do not vanish regarding transactions with third countries.\n\n== New tax planning opportunities==\n\n=== Economic consequences of formula apportionment===\n\nIn principle, the profit tax becomes a tax on the factors included into the formula, i.e., capital, sales and labour. This means that the tax bill increases in the country where one of the factors rises. Thus, tax planning is still possible as companies have an incentive to shift the tax base to low-tax jurisdictions by means of transferring the formula factors, e.g., capital (i.e., assets) could be transferred from Germany to Slovakia. However, tax planning under separate accounting focuses on tax base shifting whereas tax planning under formula apportionment focuses on the location of investments.\n\nAll proposals eliminate profit shifting by means of [[transfer pricing]] or financing. Basically, formula apportionment works like a tax on each factor included in the formula. Since the Commission does not want to question the Member States' right to set the tax rate, there is still room for tax competition via the tax rates. Due to the common tax base  across the EU, it is no longer possible for Member States to compensate high-tax rates with a narrow tax base or vice versa. The Member States compete rather for real investments than for tax bases. The Commission's proposal of a CCCTB could be a solution to the problem of international corporate tax planning within the EU. In particular, the CCCTB eliminates the incentive to shift profits to low-tax countries via transfer pricing or financing. However, there is still room for tax competition between Member States as long as the tax rates are not harmonised within the EU. Moreover, the existing problems of the arm's length principle continue to exist with respect to third countries. Effectively, the CCCTB introduces a new system of formula apportionment in addition to the system of arm's length. Thus, at present, the introduction of the CCCTB does not seem realistic on a political level, because the harmonisation requirements are high: a common tax base, a European profit allocation formula and common consolidation and anti-abuse rules would have to be introduced.\n\nThe economic consequences of formula apportionment can be examined in further detail with regard to the individual factors:\n\n==== Capital====\n\nGiven the overall profit \u03c0 and the total capital K, the tax is effectively a tax on capital invested in state i: <math> t_i \\cdot \\pi \\cdot  \\frac{K_{i}}{K}</math>\n\nGenerally, investments in a Member State increase the capital and, therefore, trigger higher taxes in this country. Regarding immobile factors, formula apportionment works like a property tax. Consequently, the group experiences an incentive to locate capital in low tax countries. However, the net benefit is relevant as the group will take into account the taxes and the public goods provided by a Member State.\n\n==== Labour====\n\nIf the number of employees increases in a Member State, the tax burden increases in this Member State as well, given that the group's profit remains the same. Thus, the production in a high tax jurisdiction might increase the total tax burden of the group compared to the production in a low-tax jurisdiction. The tax bill hence increases in a country where labour costs rise. Thereby, labour is burdened with corporate tax, potentially forcing wages and salaries down, especially in high-tax jurisdictions.\n\n==== Sales====\n\nIf the amount of sales increases in a Member State, the tax burden increases in this Member State, given that the group's profit remains the same. Thus, selling goods in a high-tax jurisdiction might increase the total tax burden of the group compared to the sale of goods in a low-tax jurisdiction. Sales are calculated on a destination basis with a fall-back clause. Tax planning incentives on the sales distribution.\n\n==== Example====\n\nBased on the background and numbers given in the context of the example provided in 2.3.1. further above, the following example is meant to illustrate the possibility of tax planning under formula apportionment:\n\nIf the group transfers assets - i.e. capital - of \u20ac100,000,000 to the Slovak subsidiary, the capital ratio is reversed, becoming \u20ac50,000,000/\u20ac200,000,000 in Germany and \u20ac150,000,000/\u20ac200,000,000 in Slovakia. With regard to the tax payments the group has to pay, this shift has the following consequence:\n\n<math>Germany: 30\\% \\cdot \\euro 1,000,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 50,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 3,000,000}{\\euro 8,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 135,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} \\right] = \\euro 130,000.</math>\n\n<math>Slovakia: 19\\% \\cdot \\euro 1,000,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 150,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 5,000,000}{\\euro 8,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 65,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} \\right] = \\euro 107,667.</math>\n\nNow, the total tax bill of the group amounts only to \u20ac237,667, with the group's average tax rate equalling 23.77%. Thus, the group's tax burden has significantly decreased (from 25.60% to 23.77%) and the allocation of tax revenues has changed as well.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading==\n\n* Advisory Board to the Federal Ministry of Finance (2007): ''Uniform Assessment Base for Corporation Tax in the European Union'', Berlin.\n* Devereux, M.

In every participating Member State corporations could subsequently opt for the adoption of this common European tax base to be used regarding all their activities within the EU. As framework for defining such a common European tax base the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) have been suggested. Furthermore, the group's tax base is intended not to include intra-group profits.\n\n=== Administration===\n\nDepending on the location where the parent of the EU group resides, the corresponding Member State is responsible for assessing the group's tax base. However, the corporate income tax rate will be determined by each individual Member State. Correlated, the overall profit of the group needs to be allocated to the individual Member States to be taxed there. This allocation has to be regulated by the terms of a formula the participating Member States have previously agreed upon. The so-called formula apportionment (FA) usually employs factors like capital, sales and labour on which the allocation is based. Prior to the allocation, these factors need to be weighted. Finally, every allocated share of profit is taxed in the respective Member State with the relevant corporate tax rate.\n\n=== Mechanism===\n\n# Each member of an EU-group, i.e., the parent and related subsidiaries residing in the EU which constitute the group, computes its profits separately according to the same harmonized tax rules.\n# The profits of each member are added and consolidated at the level of the group's parent.\n# Group income is allocated according to a specific formula to the Member States where companies of the group are located.\n# Allocated profits are taxed according to the national tax rates.\n\n== Scope of the CCCTB group==\n\n=== Consolidated group===\nIn [[financial accounting]], subsidiaries are included into consolidated statements, if they are controlled by their parent. This is usually assumed when the shareholding exceeds 50%. Strictly legal criteria make it easy to decide for tax purposes whether a company is part of the group or not. However, the participation threshold should be higher in order to avoid excessive tax planning. A high participation threshold (e.g., 75% or 90%) takes into account that consolidation implies a high degree of economic integration of the members of the group. Moreover, in this case the subsidiary's profit accrues mainly to the parent. The European Commission proposes that a company is included into the CCCTB group if the shareholding exceeds 50% and more than 75% of the capital is owned by the parent (''all-in-all-out'').\n\n=== Formula apportionment===\n\nThe CCCTB replaces separate accounting by formula apportionment. In general, the following factors could be applied for the allocation of corporate income:\n\n* Microeconomic factors:\n** Capital, labour and/or sales;\n** Value added of the group in each Member State.\n* Macroeconomic factors:\n** E.g. [[Gross National Product|gross national product]].\n\nThe allocation system should aim at simplicity and legal certainty. The formula apportionment should include allocation factors to be fair (inter-nation-equity) by reflecting the economic activity in the Member States.\n\n=== Three-factor formula===\n\nThe European Commission proposes a formula for corporate income tax apportionment based on three factors: capital (assets), labour (payroll and number of employees), and sales.<ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB)|url=https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/com_2016_683_en.pdf|volume=|page=28|pages=|chapter=VIII, APPORTIONMENT OF THE COMMON CONSOLIDATED CORPORATE TAX BASE, Article 28, General rules|publisher=European Commission}}</ref>\n\n:<math>Share A = \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{Sales^A}{Sales^{Group}} + \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Payroll^A}{Payroll^{Group}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{No\\ of\\ employees^A}{No\\ of\\ employees^{Group}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{Assets^A}{Assets^{Group}}\\right] \\cdot Con'd\\ Tax\\ Base</math>\n\n==== Example ====\n\nAssume that company Z [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]], resident in [[Germany]], has a 100% subsidiary Y [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung|GmbH]], resident in  [[Slovakia]]. Z has a payroll of \u20ac3 million, capital of \u20ac150 million, and sales of \u20ac135 million. Y has a payroll of \u20ac5 million, capital of \u20ac50 million, and sales of  \u20ac65 million. The total group income is \u20ac1 million. Suppose further that according to the arm's length standard Z earns \u20ac700,000 and Y \u20ac300,000. In the event of separate taxation, the total tax liability would amount to \u20ac267,000 = 0.3 &times; \u20ac700,000 + 0.19 &times; \u20ac300.000. The average tax rate of the group would thus amount to 26.7%.\n\nAssume now that the group applies for the CCCTB. The group computes the tax base of both Z and Y according to the CCCTB rules and subsequently both Z's and Y's tax computations are submitted to the German tax authorities. When the tax calculations are agreed upon, the tax base has to be apportioned between Germany and Slovakia. The group pays tax on the share of profit apportioned to Slovakia at the Slovak tax rate (19%), while tax on the German share of profit is paid at the German tax rate (30%). In this example, as it is proposed by the European Commission, capital, labour and sales are equally-weighted.\n\nThe tax liability for both countries is hence the following:\n\n<math>Germany: 30\\% \\cdot \\euro 1,000,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 150,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 3,000,000}{\\euro 8,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 135,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} \\right] = \\euro 180,000.</math>\n\n<math>Slovakia: 19\\% \\cdot \\euro 1,000,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 50,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 5,000,000}{\\euro 8,000,000} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\euro 65,000,000}{\\euro 200,000,000} \\right] = \\euro 76,000.</math>\n\nThe total tax bill of the group amounts to \u20ac256,000, therefore the group's average tax rate equals 25.6%.\n\n=== Advantages and disadvantages===\n\nEach eligible group would only have to deal with one tax administration and would be subject to a single set of tax rules. All Member States which wish to adopt the new tax code would be able to do so without amending their existing tax code since CCCTB would only be another tax code in addition to the already existing 28 national tax codes. Furthermore, each Member State would have the right to set its own tax rate, thereby keeping up fiscal sovereignty and maintaining the possibility of tax competition. Also, tax planning opportunities within the EU would be eliminated to a great extent. However, the formula apportionment creates new incentives for tax planning. Last, enterprises are likely to benefit from intra-group consolidation and compensation of profits and losses.\n\n=== Compliance costs===\n\nThe European Commission's proposal is likely to lead to a significant reduction in compliance costs, in particular for companies. It will also reduce the number of different tax codes companies have to apply. Cross-border transactions within the EU would cease to give rise to specific tax compliance costs for companies. On the other hand, tax administrations have to operate an additional tax system if the current tax code is maintained (parallel tax base, CCCTB). It might be the case that some tax administrations find their workload increased by the new tax rules. Last, design and operation of the allocation process will determine administrative and compliance costs.\n\n== International investment==\n\n=== Loss compensation and group relief===\n\nA group relief is available independently of the seat of a company within the EU. Therefore, the CCCTB implies a consolidation of losses and profits within the group. The allocation of the overall profit would not be determined by separate accounting but by the formula. Because of EU-wide consolidation of profits and losses, each Member State bears a subsidiary's loss in proportion to its share of the overall profit. Acceptance of foreign losses by Member States is thus easier to attain. Because of the consolidation of the EU-wide operations of the firm, it is sensible to assume that there are sufficient profits to absorb losses of group members. Hence, an immediate cross-border loss compensation is available, making interest and liquidity disadvantages disappear. In the case of an overall loss, a loss carry forward and a loss carry back must exist in ''each'' Member State. The European Commission proposes an unlimited loss carry forward. However, whether group relief for third countries, i.e., non-EU countries, is available, depends on national legislation.\n\n=== Dividend taxation===\n\nAll intra-group [[dividend]]s are treated as tax-free domestic dividends. Thus, profits of subsidiaries and [[permanent establishment]]s (PE) are equally taxed and all profits are taxed only once. For dividends from third countries, the European Commission proposes tax exemption and an anti-abuse rule (which is to switch over to credit in case of low taxation).\n\n=== Neutrality of legal form===\n\nMore in general, subsidiaries are treated as PEs under CCCTB regulation. Hence, there is no tax incentive for one of these forms of establishments. This is especially true for the following features of corporate taxation: loss compensation, taxation of hidden reserves, financing and transfer pricing. However, some tax rules, particularly the taxation of hidden reserves have not been dealt with in detail in the proposals.\n\n==International profit shifting==\n\n=== Interest expenses===\n\nInterest expenses are part of the group's total income. Thus, it is ensured that the actual costs are deducted (net principle). Tax arbitrage is not possible because business expenses do reduce the income of ''all'' companies proportionately to their respective share of the overall profit. Companies cannot claim expenses in a high-tax jurisdiction, while profits are taxed in low-tax jurisdictions. However, tax arbitrage is possible in the case of subsidiaries located in third countries. Consequently, the European Commission proposes to introduce an anti-abuse rule which limits the interest deductibility.\n\n=== Tax deferral===\n\nBecause of the equal tax treatment of PEs and subsidiaries, [[tax deferral]] is not possible any longer. Profits and losses of subsidiaries are included into the tax base irrespective of the actual profit distribution. According to the formula, profit in a low-tax country is also burdened with the tax level of other EU Member States. However, the problem remains in the case of subsidiaries located in third countries. To address this issue, the European Commission proposes CFC rules for subsidiaries in third states.\n\n=== Transfer pricing===\n\nThe group's total profit is calculated at the level of the parent, hence [[transfer pricing]] is no longer necessary for EU transactions. The current complexities of interpretation and application of the OECD guidelines on transfer pricing cease to exist for EU activities. [[Double taxation]] due to conflicting qualifications can no longer arise for EU transactions as well. Additionally, companies do not have to record transfer prices for the EU tax authorities any longer. Thus, cross-border transactions within the EU would cease to give rise to specific tax costs due to conflicting qualifications. However, transfer pricing problems are replaced by allocation problems. Furthermore, the problems of transfer pricing do not vanish regarding transactions with third countries.\n\n== New tax planning opportunities==\n\n=== Economic consequences of formula apportionment===\n\nIn principle, the profit tax becomes a tax on the factors included into the formula, i.e., capital, sales and labour. This means that the tax bill increases in the country where one of the factors rises. Thus, tax planning is still possible as companies have an incentive to shift the tax base to low-tax jurisdictions by means of transferring the formula factors, e.g., capital (i.e., assets) could be transferred from Germany to Slovakia. However, tax planning under separate accounting focuses on tax base shifting whereas tax planning under formula apportionment focuses on the location of investments.\n\nAll proposals eliminate profit shifting by means of [[transfer pricing]] or financing. Basically, formula apportionment works like a tax on each factor included in the formula.

A week earlier, William Fleming (Office of Space Flight Programs, NASA Headquarters) chaired an ad hoc committee to conduct a six-week study of the requirements for a lunar landing.

The most extensive studies focused on the Saturn C-3B variants before the end of 1962, when lunar orbit rendezvous was selected and Saturn C-5 development approved. The common theme of these variants is the first stage with at least 3,044,000 lbf (13,540 kN) of sea-level thrust (SL). These designs used two or three Rocketdyne [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engine]]s in a [[S-IB]]-2 or [[S-IC]] stage and diameters ranging from 8 to 10 meters (27 to 33 feet) that could lift up to {{convert|110000|lb}} to Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\n\nThe lack of a Saturn C-3 launch vehicle in 1965 created a large payload gap (LEO) between the [[Saturn IB]]'s 21,000 kg (46,000 lb) capacity and the two-stage Saturn V's 75,000 kg (165,000 lb) capability.  In the mid-1960s NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) initiated several studies for a launch vehicle to fill this payload capacity gap and to extend the capabilities of the Saturn family. Three companies provided proposals to MSFC for this requirement: Martin Marietta (builder of Atlas, Titan vehicles), Boeing (builder of S-1B and S-1C first stages), and North American (builder of the S-II second stage).\n\n===Saturn C-3B===\nThe '''Saturn C-3B''' revision (1961) increased the total thrust of the three stages to 17,200&nbsp;kN. The diameter of the first stage (S-IB-2) was increased to 33 feet (10 meters). The eventual first stage for the Saturn V (S-IC) would use this same diameter, but add 8 meters to its length. A further consideration added a third F-1 engine to the first stage.\n\nThe S-II, second stage diameter would be 8.3 meters (326 inches) and 21.3 meters (70 feet) in length. The S-IV, third stage diameter would be 5.5 meters and 12.2 meters in length.\n\n===Saturn C-3BN===\n{{main|NERVA}}\nThe '''Saturn C-3BN''' revision (1961) would use the [[NERVA]] for the third stage in this launch vehicle. The NERVA technology has been studied and proposed since mid-1950s for future space exploration.\n\n[[File:INT20C.svg|thumbnail|Saturn INT-20C, Boeing proposal (1966)]]\n\n===Saturn INT-20===\n{{main|Saturn INT-20}}\nOn 7 October 1966, Boeing submitted a Final Report to the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, \"Studies of Improved Saturn V Vehicles and Intermediate Payload Vehicles\". That report outlined the '''Saturn INT-20''', an intermediate two-stage launch vehicle with an S-1C first stage using three or four F-1 engines, and an S-IVB as the second stage with one J-2 engine. The vehicle's payload capacity for LEO would be 45,000 to 60,000&nbsp;kg, comparable to the earlier Saturn C-3 design (1961). Boeing projected delivery and first flight in 1970, based on a decision by 1967.\n\n==Post-Apollo development==\nThe need for a launch vehicle of Saturn C-3 capacity (45 tonnes to LEO) continued beyond the Apollo program. [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37]], initially designed to serve the Saturn I and I-B, was planned for eventual Saturn C-3 usage, but it was deactivated in 1972. In 2001, Boeing refurbished the complex for its [[Delta IV]] EELV launch vehicle. The Delta IV Heavy variant can only launch 22.5 tonnes to LEO.\n \nThe 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] and 2010 [[Space Launch System]] program resulted in renewed proposals for Saturn C-3 derivatives using the Rocketdyne F-1A engines with existing booster cores and tooling (10m - Saturn [[S-IC]] stage; 8.4m - [[Space Shuttle external tank]]; 5.1m - [[Common Booster Core|Delta IV Common Booster Core]]).\n\n===Jarvis===\n{{main|Jarvis (rocket)}}\nAfter the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], the United States Air Force (USAF) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) conducted a joint [[Advanced Launch System]] study (1987-1990). Hughes Aircraft and Boeing dusted off the earlier Saturn C-3 design and submitted their proposal for the [[Jarvis (rocket)|Jarvis]] launch vehicle.  \n\nThe Jarvis would be a three-stage rocket, 58&nbsp;m (190&nbsp;ft) in height and 8.38&nbsp;m (27.5&nbsp;ft) in diameter. Designed to lift 38 tons to LEO, it would utilize F-1 and J-2 rocket engines and tooling in storage from the Saturn V rocket program along with more recent Shuttle-era technologies to provide lower launch costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/jarvis.htm|title=Jarvis launch vehicle|publisher=Astronautix.com|date=|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Pyrios===\nPyrios is an advanced booster concept proposed in 2012 by [[Dynetics]] for use on NASA's [[Space Launch System]] heavy-lift launch vehicle. Pyrios was intended to use the [[RP-1]]/[[LOX]] [[Rocketdyne F-1#F-1B booster|F-1B]], a modernized version of the F-1A engine built by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Developed during the later stages of the Apollo program, the F-1A was test-fired but never flew. Several were created and stored by Rocketdyne. The company has also maintained an F-1/F-1A knowledge retention program for its engineers for the entire period the engine has been mothballed.

Designed to lift 38 tons to LEO, it would utilize F-1 and J-2 rocket engines and tooling in storage from the Saturn V rocket program along with more recent Shuttle-era technologies to provide lower launch costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/jarvis.htm|title=Jarvis launch vehicle|publisher=Astronautix.com|date=|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Pyrios===\nPyrios is an advanced booster concept proposed in 2012 by [[Dynetics]] for use on NASA's [[Space Launch System]] heavy-lift launch vehicle. Pyrios was intended to use the [[RP-1]]/[[LOX]] [[Rocketdyne F-1#F-1B booster|F-1B]], a modernized version of the F-1A engine built by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Developed during the later stages of the Apollo program, the F-1A was test-fired but never flew. Several were created and stored by Rocketdyne. The company has also maintained an F-1/F-1A knowledge retention program for its engineers for the entire period the engine has been mothballed. Dynetics is now performing tests on engine components pulled from storage. Pyrios was intended to use the same attachment points as the five-segment SRBs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1204/18dynetics/|title=Rocket companies hope to repurpose Saturn 5 engines|publisher=Spaceflight Now|author=Stephen Clark|date=18 April 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe Dynetics booster would attach at these points and apply thrust to an upper thrust beam in the SLS core, rather than at the bottom. Like Saturn C-3 first stage, the proposed Dynetics booster would employ two F-1(A) heritage engines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/11/dynetics-pwr-liquidize-sls-booster-competition-f-1-power/|title=Dynetics and PWR aiming to liquidize SLS booster competition with F-1 power|publisher=Spaceflight.com|author=Chris Bergin|date=9 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/new-f-1b-rocket-engine-upgrades-apollo-era-deisgn-with-1-8m-lbs-of-thrust/|title=New F-1B rocket engine upgrades Apollo-era design with 1.8M lbs of thrust|publisher=ars technica|author=Lee Hutchinson|date=14 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe manager of NASA's SLS advanced development office indicated that Pyrios proposal was viable.<ref name=spacereview_SLS_BII>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2217/1 |title=SLS Block II drives hydrocarbon engine research |work= thespacereview.com |date= January 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe planned 2015 competition in support of SLS Block 1A, was cancelled after studies and testing determined that the advanced booster would have resulted in unsuitably high acceleration and poor abort scenarios (manned crew).<ref name=\"NSFWindTunnel1B072012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/wind-tunnel-testing-sls-configurations-block-1b/|title=Wind Tunnel testing conducted on SLS configurations, including Block 1B |date= |website=NASASpaceFlight.com}}</ref>.
