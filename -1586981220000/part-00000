The human brain develops many skills at an early age including [[social skills]], behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in your thirties. Children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five.<ref name=\"Lee, Francis S. 2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Lee|first1=Francis S. |last2=Heimer|first2=Hakon |last3=Giedd|first3=Jay N. |last4=Lein|first4=Edward S. |last5=\u0160estan|first5=Nenad |last6=Weinberger|first6=Daniel R. |last7=Casey|first7=B.J. |title=Adolescent Mental Health\u2014Opportunity and Obligation |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6209 |pages=547\u2013549 |date=31 October 2014 |pmid=25359951 |doi=10.1126/science.1260497 |pmc=5069680|bibcode=2014Sci...346..547L }}</ref>  When a mental illness is thrown into the mix, it becomes significantly harder for a child to acquire the necessary skills and habits that people use throughout the day.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today's society.\n\n[[Social stigma|Stigma]] is also a well-known factor in mental illness. Stigma is defined as \u201ca mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.\u201d Stigma is used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled.

The study consisted of 850 internet users; the data was obtained by carrying out a questionnaire amongst the participants. This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had a negative effect on suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies.

In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith\u2019s research on the prevance of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families. The question would be how are these people being helped.

In another article by Stephen W. Hwang and Rochelle E Garner, they talk about the ways that the homeless are getting actually getting help. It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped. As the source explained, case management provided by services was helpful in improving psychiatric symptoms. It also caused a decrease in substance use than usual media care. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379705002953|title=Interventions to Improve the Health of the Homeless: A Systematic Review|last=Hwang|first=Stephen|date=November 2005|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=27 March 2020|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2005.06.017|volume=29|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|pages=311\u2013311}}</ref>\n\n===Prevention===\n{{See also | Mental disorder#Prevention }}\nMental health is conventionally defined as a hybrid of absence of a [[Mental disorders|mental disorder]] and presence of well-being.

According to a study on well-being by Richards, Campania and Muse-Burke, \"[[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] is considered to be a purposeful state, it may be that those who practice it believe in its importance and value being mindful, so that valuing of self-care activities may influence the intentional component of mindfulness.\"<ref name=\"Richards 2010 247\"/>\n\n===Care navigation===\n{{main|Mental health care navigator}} \nMental health care navigation helps to guide patients and families through the fragmented, often confusing mental health industries. Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald C. |last2=Demler|first2=Olga |last3=Frank|first3=Richard G. |last4=Olfson|first4=Mark |last5=Pincus|first5=Harold Alan |last6=Walters|first6=Ellen E. |last7=Wang|first7=Philip |last8=Wells|first8=Kenneth B. |last9=Zaslavsky|first9=Alan M. |title=Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Disorders, 1990 to 2003 |date=16 June 2005 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=24 |pages=2515\u20132523 |doi= 10.1056/nejmsa043266|pmid=15958807 |pmc=2847367 }}</ref>\n\n==Emotional issues==\n[[File:The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more unequal rich countries.jpg|thumb|The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more [[economic inequality|unequal]] rich countries|alt=|left]]Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern [[leucotomy]] meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, [[Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz|Antonio Egas Moniz]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms.

Native North Americans understood mental trouble as an indication of an individual who had lost their equilibrium with the sense of place and belonging in general, and with the rest of the group in particular. In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventive health care. Indigenous peoples in Canada have faced cultural oppression and social marginalization through the actions of European colonizers and their institutions since the earliest periods of contact. Culture contact brought with it many forms of depredation. Economic, political, and religious institutions of the European settlers all contributed to the displacement and [[oppression]] of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kirmayer |editor1-first=Laurence J. |editor2-last=Valaskakis |editor2-first=Gail Guthrie |date=2009 |title=Healing Traditions: The Mental Health of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-1523-9 |url=http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2008/HealingTraditions.pdf |access-date=2016-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406112447/http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2008/HealingTraditions.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-06 |url-status=dead }}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first officially recorded treatment practices were in 1714, when [[Quebec]] opened wards for the mentally ill.

In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye.

Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world.

As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months.

There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness.

The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1\u201322 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \"chronic mental illness.\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care.

The human brain develops many skills at an early age including [[social skills]], behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in your thirties.

As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped. As the source explained, case management provided by services was helpful in improving psychiatric symptoms.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression.

He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century.

Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are \u201conly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> studies have shown.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems. Such disorders were almost as important a cause of years lost to disability as were infectious and parasitic diseases, which accounted for 18.5 million years lost to disability,\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mental health and physical health care, while they may seem separate, are very much connected, as these two factors determine life or death for humans. As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months.

There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness. Women were found to have high rate of mental health disorders, and Men had higher propensity of risk for substance abuse.

The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1\u201322 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \"chronic mental illness.\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

The castle was constructed by [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester|Gilbert de Clare]] in the 13th century as part of his campaign to conquer [[Glamorgan]], and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert, his descendants, and the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes \u2013 considered by historian Allen Brown to be \"the most elaborate water defences in all Britain\" \u2013 it occupies around {{convert|30|acre}} and is the second largest castle in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Brown 2004 81\">{{harvnb|Brown|2004|p=81}}</ref> It is famous for having introduced [[concentric castle|concentric]] castle defences to Britain and for its large [[gatehouse]]s. Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], leading to the site being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at [[Kenilworth Castle|Kenilworth]]. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd|castles in North Wales]], and proved what historian Norman Pounds has termed \"a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain\".<ref>{{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=165}}</ref>\n\nThe castle was attacked during the [[Madog ap Llywelyn]] revolt of 1294, the [[Llywelyn Bren]] uprising in 1316 and during the overthrow of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1326\u201327. In the late 15th century, however, it fell into decline and by the 16th century the lakes had drained away and the walls were robbed of their stone. The [[Marquess of Bute|Marquesses of Bute]] acquired the property in 1776 and under the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|third]] and [[John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute|fourth Marquesses]] extensive restoration took place. In 1950 the castle and grounds were given to the state and the water defences were re-flooded. In the 21st century, the Welsh heritage agency [[Cadw]] manages the site as a tourist attraction.\n\n==History==\n\n===13th century===\nCaerphilly Castle was built in the second half of the 13th century, as part of the Anglo-Norman expansion into [[South Wales]].

Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes \u2013 considered by historian Allen Brown to be \"the most elaborate water defences in all Britain\" \u2013 it occupies around {{convert|30|acre}} and is the second largest castle in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Brown 2004 81\">{{harvnb|Brown|2004|p=81}}</ref> It is famous for having introduced [[concentric castle|concentric]] castle defences to Britain and for its large [[gatehouse]]s.{{for|the [[Castle class locomotive]] of this name|GWR 4073 Class 4073 Caerphilly Castle}}Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], leading to the site being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at [[Kenilworth Castle|Kenilworth]]. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd|castles in North Wales]], and proved what historian Norman Pounds has termed \"a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain\".<ref>{{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=165}}</ref>\n\nThe castle was attacked during the [[Madog ap Llywelyn]] revolt of 1294, the [[Llywelyn Bren]] uprising in 1316 and during the overthrow of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1326\u201327. In the late 15th century, however, it fell into decline and by the 16th century the lakes had drained away and the walls were robbed of their stone. The [[Marquess of Bute|Marquesses of Bute]] acquired the property in 1776 and under the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|third]] and [[John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute|fourth Marquesses]] extensive restoration took place. In 1950 the castle and grounds were given to the state and the water defences were re-flooded. In the 21st century, the Welsh heritage agency [[Cadw]] manages the site as a tourist attraction.\n\n==History==\n\n===13th century===\nCaerphilly Castle was built in the second half of the 13th century, as part of the Anglo-Norman expansion into [[South Wales]].

On that occasion, producers used the residential quarters of the East Gatehouse, Constable's Hall and Braose Gallery for the filming of a dungeon in the fictional Broadfell Prison.<ref>\n{{cite web| url        =http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/doctor-who-wales/alllocations/caerphilly-castle| title      = Caerphilly Castle| last       =| first      =| date       = 27 April 2009| website    = [[BBC]]: [[Doctor Who]] in [[Wales]]| publisher  = BBC\n| accessdate = 26 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland]]\n* [[List of castles in Wales]]\n* [[Castell Coch]], also restored by the Marquesses of Bute\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n| last = Brown\n| first = R.
