Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the [[Middle Ages]] it referred to the right to ''pull up'' fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\n\nThe municipality had a total population of {{Swiss populations|CH-ZG|1711}} in {{Swiss populations date|CH-ZG}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-ZG}} The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stumpf-Chronik-Zug.png|thumb|View of Zug before 1547]]\n[[File:Zug - Unterstadt - Zugersee IMG 2606.JPG|thumb|''Unterstadt'' (lower town) as seen from [[Lake Zug]] harbour]]\n[[File:Zug - Oberstadt IMG 2611.jpg|thumb|''Oberstadt'' (upper town) in the [[Altstadt]]]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.<ref>[http://www.zug-tourismus.ch/en/welcome.cfm Zug Tourism]</ref>\n\nThe [[IG Culture Zug society]] currently has some 200 members.\n\n===Heritage sites===\nThere are a number of Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]] in Zug. These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the [[parish church]] of St. Michael. One archeological site, the ''Sumpf'' a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the ''Burg'' (Castle museum), ''Kunsthaus'' (Art museum) and ''Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; ''B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug'' (Citizen's archive of Zug), ''Staatsarchiv Zug'' (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the ''Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG'' (Landis & Gyr AG company archives).

Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake.

These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the [[parish church]] of St. Michael. One archeological site, the ''Sumpf'' a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the ''Burg'' (Castle museum), ''Kunsthaus'' (Art museum) and ''Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; ''B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug'' (Citizen's archive of Zug), ''Staatsarchiv Zug'' (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the ''Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG'' (Landis & Gyr AG company archives). The rest of the sites are the Catholic Church of St. Oswald with [[Charnel house]], the [[Seminary]] of St. Michael, the town walls and several buildings in the old town of Zug.<ref>[http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501142322/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html |date=1 May 2009 }} 21.11.2008 version, {{in lang|de}} accessed 22-Sep-2009</ref>\n\nThe prehistoric settlements at Oterswil/Insel Eielen, Riedmatt and Sumpf are part of the [[Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]] a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]].<ref name=UNESCO>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1363/ UNESCO World Heritage Site - Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Zug education system is based on equal abilities and includes compulsory primary and secondary school, with optional secondary education and vocational training. Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

The band was formed in 1987 in [[Bellingham, Washington]], United States, by primary songwriters [[Jon Auer]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]]. They are best known for their radio hits \"[[Golden Blunders]]\" (from ''[[Dear 23]]''), as well as \"[[Dream All Day]]\", \"[[Solar Sister]]\" and \"[[Flavor of the Month]]\" (from ''[[Frosting on the Beater]]'').\n\nTheir powerful melodic music has its origins in [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] and [[the Hollies]]. They are influenced by [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[XTC]], [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]].<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=965}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1986\u201388)===\nCore members [[Jon Auer]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]] began writing songs together in late 1986 while Ken was in school at the [[University of Washington]]. Auer later recalled in an interview that \"we first met at a [[Dan Reed Network]] show; we were united in feeling we could do that stuff much better ourselves, the two of us\". Their first public performance came as an acoustic duo that next summer while Ken was home in Bellingham. During the last part of 1987 and the first two months of 1988, Ken drove home on weekends to join Jon as they recorded twelve songs in Jon's family's home studio. Though intended as demos to attract other members and form a full band, the recordings turned out so well that they became the Posies' first self-released album, ''[[Failure (The Posies album)|Failure]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Interest in the Posies rose out of the numerous home-copied cassettes that began to spread around Seattle and Bellingham.\n\nMike Musburger and Arthur \"Rick\" Roberts joined soon after, allowing the band to play its first live shows in Seattle and Bellingham. The four members moved into a house in the [[University District, Seattle, Washington|University District]] of Seattle, where they developed many of the songs that would appear on later albums. ''Failure'' was released on vinyl near the end of 1988 on local indie label [[PopLlama Records|PopLlama]] with one song dropped.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Major label years (1989\u201397)===\nSeveral major labels noticed the band early on and in late 1989 they signed to new [[Geffen Records]] imprint [[DGC Records]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> They chose [[John Leckie]] to produce their first album for the label and ''[[Dear 23]]'' was released in August 1990.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"[[Golden Blunders]]\" reached No.&nbsp;17 on the US Modern Rock charts. [[Ringo Starr]] covered the song for his 1992 album ''[[Time Takes Time]]''.\n\nUpon returning from an extensive U.S. tour, the Posies thought they were ready to record their third album. They headed to Robert Lang Studio in [[Shoreline, Washington]], in late 1991 and recorded many of the songs they had been working on over the past two years. Among the recordings were three songs written (and two of them sung) by bassist Arthur Roberts. Jon and Ken later decided that Roberts' songs did not fit with the band and asked him to leave. The entire recording session was later scrapped and is referred to by fans as \"the Lost Sessions\". Roberts went on to front the bands Peach (on [[Caroline Records]]) and Sushirobo (on Pattern 25 Records).\n\nThe remaining members spent the next few months developing new songs, then in early 1992 began recording their third album with [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After completing what they thought was their new album with the title ''Eclipse'', Geffen sent them back to the studio in the latter part of the year to record a few \"hits\". Dave Fox joined to play bass for the last of the \"Hit Sessions\" and the name then changed to ''[[Frosting On The Beater]]'' and was released in April 1993.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Leadoff track \"[[Dream All Day]]\" enjoyed some success on U.S. [[MTV]] and alternative radio, becoming their biggest hit (#4 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart), leading the band to an extensive tour of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Due in part to rumors of a break-up Dave left the band in 1994 to join the Seattle band [[Flop (band)|Flop]].\n\nDuring a later European tour, a fight between Ken and Mike prompted Mike to leave the band. Mike then joined long-running Seattle punk band [[The Fastbacks]], and was later a member of both [[Love Battery]] and [[Supersuckers]].\n\nIn late 1994, Brian Young took over on drums and Joe Howard (AKA Joe Skyward, Joe Bass) played bass. Joe had earlier filled in on bass for a few shows after Roberts left in 1992. It wasn't long before the band again entered the studio to begin work on a fourth album. Originally using the working title ''What Color Is A Red Light?'', the bulk of ''[[Amazing Disgrace]]'' was finished in the first few months of 1995. Once again, the label wanted more hit material so they sent the band back to the studio near the end of the year where they recorded \"Ontario\". ''Amazing Disgrace'' was eventually released in May 1996.\n\nFaced with a changing radio climate and fans who longed for the smoother sounds of ''Frosting On The Beater'', the Posies found less success with ''Amazing Disgrace'' in the U.S. than with their previous album. The album fared better in Europe though, and led to it selling better worldwide than any of their previous efforts.\n\nAfter spending most of 1996 and the early part of 1997 on tour in the U.S. and Europe, and making an appearance in association with their former record company Popllama to perform \"Voyage of The Aquanauts\" in the Ocean Exploration episode of [[Bill Nye the Science Guy]], the band returned home and shifted focus to other projects outside the Posies. Ken played a new batch of solo songs around the U.S. and released his self-recorded first solo album, ''This Sounds Like Goodbye''. Jon joined Seattle band Lucky Me as lead guitarist, Brian began drumming with [[Fountains of Wayne]], while Joe began work on an album under the name Skyward. All of this solo work caused many to wonder if the Posies were finished as a band.\n\nThe Posies also performed with [[Burt Bacharach]] on a recording of his song \"[[What the World Needs Now Is Love]],\" which was featured in the 1997 movie, ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery#Soundtrack|Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]''.\n\n===Return to indie label, compilation albums and solo projects (1997\u20132001)===\nIn late 1997, they came back together to play a small number of live shows, many accompanied by rumors of being the \"final show\". Instead, the band returned to the studio with the intent of writing their last chapter by rerecording a dozen unused older songs. ''[[Success (The Posies album)|Success]]'' was released in February 1998, again on the local PopLlama label. A tour followed, including a return to Europe. It was on this tour that the live album ''[[Alive Before the Iceberg]]'' was recorded. Upon returning, they played their real \"final\" shows in September, one in Seattle at the yearly [[Bumbershoot]] Festival and another in San Francisco.\n\n[[File:The-Posies-Barcelona-(October-2008).jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Posies performing at the Apolo in Barcelona in October 2008.]]\n\nIn 1999 the Posies played a low-profile benefit show in honor of their longtime roadie and friend Joe Norcio. Jon and Ken spent the rest of the year focusing on their solo work. Ken formed a band called Saltine with Blake Wescott, where Ken's quiet solo songs were transformed into loud and powerful rock. The band recorded an album together late that year, but Ken later decided to break up the band and re-recorded the album with the help of studio musicians. ''Touched'' was given the unfortunate release date of [[September 11, 2001]]. Meanwhile, Jon formed a band of his own, known as the Jon Auer Band or the Jon Auer Experience. He released a pair of EPs and began work on a full-length album, which would be released in 2006 as ''[[Songs from the Year of Our Demise]]''.\n\nJon and Ken came back together in early 2000 for a one-off acoustic show in Seattle, which was recorded and released as ''[[In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In]]''. The show went so well that they decided later that year to put together a large tour of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Upon returning from the tour, they filled 2001 with a mix of solo work and a handful of live Posies shows played in support of the ''Nice Cheekbones and a Ph.D.'' EP, which was recorded the previous year.\n\nAlso released in 2000 was a four-CD box set composed almost entirely of unreleased demos, outtakes, and live tracks from throughout the Posies' career. Created mostly to satisfy fans, ''[[At Least, At Last]]'' showed many previously unseen facets of the band. The same year, [[DGC Records]] release [[Dream All Day: The Best of the Posies]], a compilation with songs from the band's major label years and some b-sides and covers.\n\n===Comeback and ''Every Kind of Light'' (2001\u201309)===\nAfter playing drums in Jon's band, Darius Minwalla took over on drums for the Posies in early 2001. That summer, Matt Harris of [[Oranger]] replaced Joe on bass. The new rhythm section quickly learned the band's back catalog in time for a US tour that summer. The band played together sporadically over the next two years. Though comments in interviews suggested a desire to write new songs with the new lineup, new material didn't show up in live performances until 2004. They wrote and recorded a new batch of songs relatively quickly and ''[[Every Kind of Light]]'' was released in June 2005; its songs \"Love Comes\" and \"I Guess You're Right\" are included as sample music tracks in the release of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Vista]] [[operating system]]. A tour of the US and Europe lasted through the end of the year. A brief Japanese tour was scheduled for the summer of 2006. In 2008 Ken and Jon undertook a Posies 20th anniversary tour, playing several shows as a duo in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nKen remarried and now lives in France with his wife and child, though he travels often to play with the Posies, [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], as well as playing in support of his solo albums. He was, as of 2008, vocalist in the band [[The Disciplines]], the rest of whose line-up are previous members of the Norwegian band [[Briskeby]]. The Disciplines joined R.E.M. on their European tour in 2008 as a warm-up, and their song \"Yours For Taking\" was included on a CD with songs selected by R.E.M. for the March 2008 issue of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=R.E.M. digger The Disciplines |work=NRK Lykverdet |location=Norway |first=Marius |last=Asp |date=January 22, 2008 |url=http://arkiv.nrk.no/lydverket/rem-digger-the-disciplines/index.html }}</ref>\n\n===''Blood/Candy'' and ''Solid States'' (2010\u2013present)===\nThe band released their seventh studio album ''[[Blood/Candy]]'' on September 28, 2010.

The band was formed in 1987 in [[Bellingham, Washington]], United States, by primary songwriters [[Jon Auer]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]]. They are best known for their radio hits \"[[Golden Blunders]]\" (from ''[[Dear 23]]''), as well as \"[[Dream All Day]]\", \"[[Solar Sister]]\" and \"[[Flavor of the Month]]\" (from ''[[Frosting on the Beater]]'').\n\nTheir powerful melodic music has its origins in [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] and [[the Hollies]]. They are influenced by [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[XTC]], [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]].<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=965}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1986\u201388)===\nCore members [[Jon Auer]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]] began writing songs together in late 1986 while Ken was in school at the [[University of Washington]]. Auer later recalled in an interview that \"we first met at a [[Dan Reed Network]] show; we were united in feeling we could do that stuff much better ourselves, the two of us\". Their first public performance came as an acoustic duo that next summer while Ken was home in Bellingham. During the last part of 1987 and the first two months of 1988, Ken drove home on weekends to join Jon as they recorded twelve songs in Jon's family's home studio. Though intended as demos to attract other members and form a full band, the recordings turned out so well that they became the Posies' first self-released album, ''[[Failure (The Posies album)|Failure]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Interest in the Posies rose out of the numerous home-copied cassettes that began to spread around Seattle and Bellingham.\n\nMike Musburger and Arthur \"Rick\" Roberts joined soon after, allowing the band to play its first live shows in Seattle and Bellingham. The four members moved into a house in the [[University District, Seattle, Washington|University District]] of Seattle, where they developed many of the songs that would appear on later albums. ''Failure'' was released on vinyl near the end of 1988 on local indie label [[PopLlama Records|PopLlama]] with one song dropped.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Major label years (1989\u201397)===\nSeveral major labels noticed the band early on and in late 1989 they signed to new [[Geffen Records]] imprint [[DGC Records]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> They chose [[John Leckie]] to produce their first album for the label and ''[[Dear 23]]'' was released in August 1990.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"[[Golden Blunders]]\" reached No.&nbsp;17 on the US Modern Rock charts. [[Ringo Starr]] covered the song for his 1992 album ''[[Time Takes Time]]''.\n\nUpon returning from an extensive U.S. tour, the Posies thought they were ready to record their third album. They headed to Robert Lang Studio in [[Shoreline, Washington]], in late 1991 and recorded many of the songs they had been working on over the past two years. Among the recordings were three songs written (and two of them sung) by bassist Arthur Roberts. Jon and Ken later decided that Roberts' songs did not fit with the band and asked him to leave. The entire recording session was later scrapped and is referred to by fans as \"the Lost Sessions\". Roberts went on to front the bands Peach (on [[Caroline Records]]) and Sushirobo (on Pattern 25 Records).\n\nThe remaining members spent the next few months developing new songs, then in early 1992 began recording their third album with [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After completing what they thought was their new album with the title ''Eclipse'', Geffen sent them back to the studio in the latter part of the year to record a few \"hits\". Dave Fox joined to play bass for the last of the \"Hit Sessions\" and the name then changed to ''[[Frosting On The Beater]]'' and was released in April 1993.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Leadoff track \"[[Dream All Day]]\" enjoyed some success on U.S. [[MTV]] and alternative radio, becoming their biggest hit (#4 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart), leading the band to an extensive tour of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Due in part to rumors of a break-up Dave left the band in 1994 to join the Seattle band [[Flop (band)|Flop]].\n\nDuring a later European tour, a fight between Ken and Mike prompted Mike to leave the band. Mike then joined long-running Seattle punk band [[The Fastbacks]], and was later a member of both [[Love Battery]] and [[Supersuckers]].\n\nIn late 1994, Brian Young took over on drums and Joe Howard (AKA Joe Skyward, Joe Bass) played bass. Joe had earlier filled in on bass for a few shows after Roberts left in 1992. It wasn't long before the band again entered the studio to begin work on a fourth album. Originally using the working title ''What Color Is A Red Light?'', the bulk of ''[[Amazing Disgrace]]'' was finished in the first few months of 1995. Once again, the label wanted more hit material so they sent the band back to the studio near the end of the year where they recorded \"Ontario\". ''Amazing Disgrace'' was eventually released in May 1996.\n\nFaced with a changing radio climate and fans who longed for the smoother sounds of ''Frosting On The Beater'', the Posies found less success with ''Amazing Disgrace'' in the U.S. than with their previous album. The album fared better in Europe though, and led to it selling better worldwide than any of their previous efforts.\n\nAfter spending most of 1996 and the early part of 1997 on tour in the U.S. and Europe, and making an appearance in association with their former record company Popllama to perform \"Voyage of The Aquanauts\" in the Ocean Exploration episode of [[Bill Nye the Science Guy]], the band returned home and shifted focus to other projects outside the Posies. Ken played a new batch of solo songs around the U.S. and released his self-recorded first solo album, ''This Sounds Like Goodbye''. Jon joined Seattle band Lucky Me as lead guitarist, Brian began drumming with [[Fountains of Wayne]], while Joe began work on an album under the name Skyward. All of this solo work caused many to wonder if the Posies were finished as a band.\n\nThe Posies also performed with [[Burt Bacharach]] on a recording of his song \"[[What the World Needs Now Is Love]],\" which was featured in the 1997 movie, ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery#Soundtrack|Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]''.\n\n===Return to indie label, compilation albums and solo projects (1997\u20132001)===\nIn late 1997, they came back together to play a small number of live shows, many accompanied by rumors of being the \"final show\". Instead, the band returned to the studio with the intent of writing their last chapter by rerecording a dozen unused older songs. ''[[Success (The Posies album)|Success]]'' was released in February 1998, again on the local PopLlama label. A tour followed, including a return to Europe. It was on this tour that the live album ''[[Alive Before the Iceberg]]'' was recorded. Upon returning, they played their real \"final\" shows in September, one in Seattle at the yearly [[Bumbershoot]] Festival and another in San Francisco.\n\n[[File:The-Posies-Barcelona-(October-2008).jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Posies performing at the Apolo in Barcelona in October 2008.]]\n\nIn 1999 the Posies played a low-profile benefit show in honor of their longtime roadie and friend Joe Norcio. Jon and Ken spent the rest of the year focusing on their solo work. Ken formed a band called Saltine with Blake Wescott, where Ken's quiet solo songs were transformed into loud and powerful rock. The band recorded an album together late that year, but Ken later decided to break up the band and re-recorded the album with the help of studio musicians. ''Touched'' was given the unfortunate release date of [[September 11, 2001]]. Meanwhile, Jon formed a band of his own, known as the Jon Auer Band or the Jon Auer Experience. He released a pair of EPs and began work on a full-length album, which would be released in 2006 as ''[[Songs from the Year of Our Demise]]''.\n\nJon and Ken came back together in early 2000 for a one-off acoustic show in Seattle, which was recorded and released as ''[[In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In]]''. The show went so well that they decided later that year to put together a large tour of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Upon returning from the tour, they filled 2001 with a mix of solo work and a handful of live Posies shows played in support of the ''Nice Cheekbones and a Ph.D.'' EP, which was recorded the previous year.\n\nAlso released in 2000 was a four-CD box set composed almost entirely of unreleased demos, outtakes, and live tracks from throughout the Posies' career. Created mostly to satisfy fans, ''[[At Least, At Last]]'' showed many previously unseen facets of the band. The same year, [[DGC Records]] release [[Dream All Day: The Best of the Posies]], a compilation with songs from the band's major label years and some b-sides and covers.\n\n===Comeback and ''Every Kind of Light'' (2001\u201309)===\nAfter playing drums in Jon's band, Darius Minwalla took over on drums for the Posies in early 2001. That summer, Matt Harris of [[Oranger]] replaced Joe on bass. The new rhythm section quickly learned the band's back catalog in time for a US tour that summer. The band played together sporadically over the next two years. Though comments in interviews suggested a desire to write new songs with the new lineup, new material didn't show up in live performances until 2004. They wrote and recorded a new batch of songs relatively quickly and ''[[Every Kind of Light]]'' was released in June 2005; its songs \"Love Comes\" and \"I Guess You're Right\" are included as sample music tracks in the release of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Vista]] [[operating system]]. A tour of the US and Europe lasted through the end of the year. A brief Japanese tour was scheduled for the summer of 2006. In 2008 Ken and Jon undertook a Posies 20th anniversary tour, playing several shows as a duo in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nKen remarried and now lives in France with his wife and child, though he travels often to play with the Posies, [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], as well as playing in support of his solo albums. He was, as of 2008, vocalist in the band [[The Disciplines]], the rest of whose line-up are previous members of the Norwegian band [[Briskeby]]. The Disciplines joined R.E.M. on their European tour in 2008 as a warm-up, and their song \"Yours For Taking\" was included on a CD with songs selected by R.E.M. for the March 2008 issue of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=R.E.M. digger The Disciplines |work=NRK Lykverdet |location=Norway |first=Marius |last=Asp |date=January 22, 2008 |url=http://arkiv.nrk.no/lydverket/rem-digger-the-disciplines/index.html }}</ref>\n\n===''Blood/Candy'' and ''Solid States'' (2010\u2013present)===\nThe band released their seventh studio album ''[[Blood/Candy]]'' on September 28, 2010.

Minwalla passed away unexpectedly at his home in Vancouver on May 21, 2015; and on March 26, 2016, Joe Skyward died after a two-year battle with cancer.\n\nOn March 3, 2016, the song \"Squirrel vs. Snake\" was released as a teaser for their forthcoming eighth album, and the band embarked on an extensive month-long European tour on March 29.<ref name=lojinx/> The album ''[[Solid States]]'' was released on April 29 by [[United Kingdom|British]] indie label [[Lojinx]] in Europe;<ref name=lojinx>{{cite web |title=The Posies announce 8th album Solid States |date=March 3, 2016 |work=Lojinx \n|url=https://www.lojinx.com/news/2016/03/03/the-posies-announce-solid-states |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318191836/https://www.lojinx.com/news/2016/03/03/the-posies-announce-solid-states |archivedate=2016-03-18 }}</ref><ref name=lojinx-release>{{cite web |title=The Posies: ''Solid States'' |date=March 18, 2016 |work=Lojinx \n|url=https://www.lojinx.com/releases/the-posies/solid-states |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318192523/https://www.lojinx.com/releases/the-posies/solid-states |archivedate=2016-03-18 }}</ref> the American release on My Music Empire followed on May 20.

She was named after a beloved uncle, who died young.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} She had an elder brother, Howard Sherwood \"Butch\" Tierney, Jr., and a younger sister, Patricia \"Pat\" Tierney. Their father was a successful insurance broker of Irish descent, their mother a former physical education instructor.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nTierney was raised in Westport, Connecticut. She attended [[Chase Collegiate School|St. Margaret's School]] in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], and the [[Unquowa School]] in [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]. She published her first poem, entitled \"Night\", in the school magazine and wrote [[Verse (poetry)|poetry]] occasionally throughout her life. Tierney played Jo in a student production of ''[[Little Women]]'', based on the novel by [[Louisa May Alcott]].\n\nTierney spent two years in Europe, attending [[Brillantmont International School]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], where she learned to speak fluent French. She returned to the U.S. in 1938 and attended [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]]. On a family trip to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], she visited [[Warner Bros.]] studios, where a cousin worked as a producer of historical short films. Director [[Anatole Litvak]], taken by the 17-year-old's beauty, told Tierney that she should become an actress. Warner Bros. wanted to sign her to a contract, but her parents advised against it because of the relatively low salary; they also wanted her to take her position in society.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nTierney's [[debutante|society debut]] occurred on September 24, 1938, when she was 17 years old.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} Soon bored with society life, she decided to pursue an acting career. Her father said, \"If Gene is to be an actress, it should be in the [[legitimate theatre]].\"<ref name=\"life\"/> Tierney studied acting at a small [[Greenwich Village]] acting studio in New York with Yiddish and Broadway actor/director Benno Schneider. <ref>Malcolm Goldstein, ''The Political Stage'' (Oxford University Press, 1974), 45; Claude Amey, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'agit-prop de 1917 \u00e0 1932'' (Lausanne: L'\u00e2ge d'Homme, 1977), 160; and Edna Nahshon, ed., ''New York\u2019s Yiddish Theater: From the Bowery to Broadway'' (NY: Columbia University Press, 2016), 179-86.</ref> She became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Broadway producer-director [[George Abbott]].<ref name=\"life\">\"Debutante Gene Tierney Makes Her Entrance In A Broadway Success\", ''[[Life Magazine]]'', February 19, 1940.

(1938). A ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine critic declared, \"Miss Tierney is certainly the most beautiful water carrier I've ever seen!\" She also worked as an understudy in ''The Primrose Path'' (1938).\n\nThe following year, she appeared in the role of [[Molly O'Day]] in the Broadway production ''Mrs. O'Brien Entertains'' (1939).<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote, \"As an Irish maiden fresh from the old country, Gene Tierney in her first stage performance is very pretty and refreshingly modest.\"<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} That same year, Tierney appeared as Peggy Carr in ''Ring Two'' (1939) to favorable reviews. Theater critic [[Richard Watts, Jr.]]  of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' wrote, \"I see no reason why Miss Tierney should not have an interesting theatrical career \u2013 that is, if cinema does not kidnap her away.\"<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nTierney's father set up a corporation, Belle-Tier, to fund and promote her acting career. [[Columbia Pictures]] signed her to a six-month contract in 1939. She met [[Howard Hughes]], who tried unsuccessfully to seduce her. From a well-to-do family herself, she was not impressed by his wealth.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} Hughes eventually became a lifelong friend.\n\nAfter a cameraman advised Tierney to lose a little weight, she wrote to ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' magazine for a diet, which she followed for the next 25 years. Tierney was initially offered the lead role in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]],'' but production was delayed.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} When Columbia Pictures failed to find Tierney a project, she returned to Broadway and starred as Patricia Stanley to critical and commercial success in ''[[The Male Animal]]'' (1940). In ''The New York Times'', Brooks Atkinson wrote, \"Tierney blazes with animation in the best performance she has yet given\".<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} She was the toast of Broadway before her 20th birthday. ''The Male Animal'' was a hit, and Tierney was featured in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. She was also photographed by ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', and ''[[Collier's Weekly]]''.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nTwo weeks after ''The Male Animal'' opened, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], the head of [[20th Century Fox]], was  rumored to have been in the audience. During the performance, he told an assistant to note Tierney's name. Later that night, Zanuck dropped by the [[Stork Club]], where he saw a young lady on the dance floor. He told his assistant, \"Forget the girl from the play. See if you can sign that one.\" It was Tierney. At first, Zanuck did not think she was the actress he had seen. Tierney was quoted (after the fact), saying: \"I always had several different 'looks', a quality that proved useful in my career.\"<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}<ref name=\"patriciatierney\">''Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait'', The Biography Channel, March 26, 1999 interview with Gene Tierney's sister Patricia.</ref>\n\n===Film career===\n[[File:Gene Tierney in Laura trailer.jpg|thumb|Gene Tierney in the film trailer for ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' (1944)]]\nTierney signed with [[20th Century-Fox]]<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} and her motion picture debut was in a supporting role as Eleanor Stone in [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] ''[[The Return of Frank James]]'' (1940), opposite [[Henry Fonda]].\n\nA small role as Barbara Hall followed in ''Hudson's Bay'' (1941) with [[Paul Muni]] and she co-starred as Ellie Mae Lester in [[John Ford]]'s comedy ''[[Tobacco Road (film)|Tobacco Road]]'' (also 1941), and played the title role in ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]'' alongside co-star [[Randolph Scott]], Zia in ''Sundown'', and Victoria Charteris (Poppy Smith) in ''[[The Shanghai Gesture]]''.

Tierney recalled during the production of ''Heaven Can Wait'':\n\n<blockquote>Lubitsch was a tyrant on the set, the most demanding of directors. After one scene, which took from noon until five to get, I was almost in tears from listening to Lubitsch shout at me. The next day I sought him out, looked him in the eye, and said, 'Mr. Lubitsch, I'm willing to do my best but I just can't go on working on this picture if you're going to keep shouting at me.' 'I'm paid to shout at you', he bellowed. 'Yes', I said, 'and I'm paid to take it \u2013  but not enough.' After a tense pause, Lubitsch broke out laughing. From then on we got along famously.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</blockquote>\n\nTierney starred in what became her best-remembered role: the title role in [[Otto Preminger]]'s [[film noir]] ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' (1944), opposite [[Dana Andrews]]. After playing Tina Tomasino in ''[[A Bell for Adano]]'' (1945), she played the jealous, narcissistic ''[[femme fatale]]'' Ellen Berent Harland in ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945), adapted from a best selling novel by [[Ben Ames Williams]]. Appearing with [[Cornel Wilde]], Tierney won an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. This was 20th Century-Fox' most successful film of the 1940s. It was cited by director [[Martin Scorsese]] as one of his favorite films of all time, and he assessed Tierney as one of the most underrated actresses of the Golden Era.<ref>{{YouTube|ATfhKmkM-rE|Martin Scorsese discusses ''Leave Her to Heaven'' at the 45th New York Film Festival}}</ref>\n\nTierney then starred as Miranda Wells in ''[[Dragonwyck (film)|Dragonwyck]]'' (1946), along with [[Walter Huston]] and [[Vincent Price]].

She returned to the U.S. in 1938 and attended [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]]. On a family trip to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], she visited [[Warner Bros.]] studios, where a cousin worked as a producer of historical short films. Director [[Anatole Litvak]], taken by the 17-year-old's beauty, told Tierney that she should become an actress.

From a well-to-do family herself, she was not impressed by his wealth.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} Hughes eventually became a lifelong friend.\n\nAfter a cameraman advised Tierney to lose a little weight, she wrote to ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' magazine for a diet, which she followed for the next 25 years. Tierney was initially offered the lead role in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]],'' but production was delayed.<ref name=\"selfportrait\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} When Columbia Pictures failed to find Tierney a project, she returned to Broadway and starred as Patricia Stanley to critical and commercial success in ''[[The Male Animal]]'' (1940).

Later that night, Zanuck dropped by the [[Stork Club]], where he saw a young lady on the dance floor. He told his assistant, \"Forget the girl from the play. See if you can sign that one.\" It was Tierney. At first, Zanuck did not think she was the actress he had seen.

Tierney recalled during the production of ''Heaven Can Wait'':\n\n<blockquote>Lubitsch was a tyrant on the set, the most demanding of directors. After one scene, which took from noon until five to get, I was almost in tears from listening to Lubitsch shout at me. The next day I sought him out, looked him in the eye, and said, 'Mr. Lubitsch, I'm willing to do my best but I just can't go on working on this picture if you're going to keep shouting at me.' 'I'm paid to shout at you', he bellowed. 'Yes', I said, 'and I'm paid to take it \u2013  but not enough.' After a tense pause, Lubitsch broke out laughing.

It is the second largest [[single-payer healthcare]] system in the world after the Brazilian [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from [[National Insurance]] contributions), and overseen by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], the NHS provides [[healthcare]] to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, are free for everyone, including visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68 |title=Am I entitled to NHS treatment when I visit England? |work=www.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by [[National Insurance]] payments<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10542622/The-awkward-truth-about-funding-the-NHS.html</ref> and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the [[Immigration Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-health-surcharge-information-for-migrants |title=Immigration health surcharge: information for migrants |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]].

Starting in April 2013, [[Primary Care Trust]]s (PCTs) began to be replaced by General Practitioner (GP)-led organisations called [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s (CCGs).

In reality, the provision of NHS services by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are concerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to increased use of private sector competition, balancing care options between private companies, charities, and NHS organisations.<ref name=\"The changing NHS\" /> NHS Trusts responded to the [[Nicholson challenge]]\u2014which involved making \u00a320 billion in savings across the service by 2015.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the National Health Service (England)}}\n[[File:Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jenny Lee in Corwen (15368872658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aneurin Bevan]].

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain. However, in July 2000, a full-scale modernisation programme was launched and new principles added.}}\n\nThe main aims of the additional principles are that the NHS will:\n* Provide a comprehensive range of services\n* Shape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers\n* Respond to the different needs of different populations\n* Work continuously to improve the quality of services and to minimise errors\n* Support and value its staff\n* Use public funds for healthcare devoted solely to NHS patients\n* Work with others to ensure a seamless service for patients\n* Help to keep people healthy and work to reduce health inequalities\n* Respect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance\n\n=== Structure ===\n{{Main|Health and Social Care Act 2012}}\nThe English NHS is controlled by the UK government through the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] (DHSC), which takes political responsibility for the service.

PCTs disbursed funds to them on an agreed tariff or contract basis, on guidelines set out by the Department of Health. The PCTs budget from the Department of Health was calculated on a formula basis relating to population and specific local needs. They were supposed to \"break even\" - that is, not show a deficit on their budgets at the end of the financial year. Failure to meet financial objectives could result in the dismissal and replacement of a Trust's Board of Directors, although such dismissals are enormously expensive for the NHS.<ref>{{cite web | title=Anger over C difficile payoff | publisher=Health Service Journal | url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/anger-over-c-difficile-pay-off/538529.article | date=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2013 a new system was established as a result of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].  The NHS budget is largely in the hands of a new body, NHS England.  NHS England commission specialist services and primary care.  Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., [[Herceptin]]) should be prescribed by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Herceptin judgement|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm|accessdate=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== NHS dentistry ====\n{{Main|NHS dentistry}}\n\nWhere available, NHS dentistry charges {{As of|2017|April|lc=on}} were: \u00a320.60 for an examination; \u00a356.30 for a filling or extraction; and \u00a3244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help with dental charges - Health Costs | publisher = NHS Choices | url = http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Dentalcosts.aspx | accessdate = 8 April 2015 }}</ref> As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota &#124; BBC| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=19 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>  Some people needing NHS dental care are unable to get it.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41113507 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n==== NHS Optical Services ====\n{{main|Eye care in the United Kingdom}}\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was \u00a319.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses.  There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers. This scheme did not however fully cover the costs of treatment in serious cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSince January 2007, the NHS has a duty to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>  In the last year of the scheme immediately preceding 2007, over \u00a3128 million was reclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Totals for England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=137500&Rendition=Web |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2019 \u00a3725 is payable for outpatient treatment, \u00a3891 per day for inpatient treatment and \u00a3219 per ambulance journey.<ref>{{cite news |title=NHS Charges: Increase for accidents from 1 April 2019 |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=79087cd9-7147-4188-9cf4-dc2a871321b9 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |publisher=Lexology |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Car park charges ====\nCar parking charges are a minor source of revenue for the NHS,<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\">{{cite news |title=NHS car park charges \u2013 a necessary evil? |author=Nick Triggle |date=3 March 2008 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7274968.stm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref> with most hospitals deriving about 0.25% of their budget from them.<ref name=\"t_20060718\" />  The level of fees is controlled individually by each trust.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  In 2006 car park fees contributed \u00a378 million towards hospital budgets.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" /><ref name=\"t_20060718\">{{cite news |title=Hospitals making \u00a378m a year from car park charges |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article689109.ece |accessdate=10 March 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}</ref>  Patient groups are opposed to such charges.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  (This contrasts with Scotland where car park charges were mostly scrapped from the beginning of 2009<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7593400.stm NHS car parking charges abolished] BBC News, 2 September 2008</ref> and with Wales where car park charges were scrapped at the end of 2011.)<ref name=\"t_20080303\">{{cite news |title=Welsh NHS scraps car park charges |author=David Rose |date=3 March 2008|publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3474721.ece |accessdate=10 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Charitable funds ====\nThere are over 300 official NHS charities in England and Wales.

This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.<!--\n  --><ref>{{cite book | author=Manfred Davidmann| title=Reorganising the National Health Service: An Evaluation of the Griffiths Report | edition=Second | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-85192-046-7 | url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/nhs.html | publisher=Social Organisation | location=Stanmore}}</ref>\nThis recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Opposition to what was claimed to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] intention to [[privatise]] the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding.  However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services such as ISTCs<ref>{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=3 December 2002 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 15 September 2006}}</ref> and non-medical services such as catering provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. A study by a consultancy company for the Department of Health shows that every \u00a3200 million spent on privately financed hospitals will result in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The first PFI hospitals contain some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced.<ref>{{cite web | author=George Monbiot | title=Private Affluence, Public Rip-Off |date=10 March 2002 | url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/03/10/private-affluence-public-rip-off/ | accessdate = 7 September 2006 | publisher = [[The Spectator]]| author-link=George Monbiot }}</ref>\n\nThe NHS was also required to take on pro-active socially \"directive\" policies, for example, in respect of [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[obesity]].\n\n=== Information technology ===\nIn the 1980s and 90s, NHS IT spent money on several failed IT projects. The Wessex project, in the 1980s, attempted to standardise IT systems across a regional health authority. The [[London Ambulance Service]] was to be a computer-aided dispatch system. [[Read code]] was an attempt to develop a new electronic language of health,<ref name=\"gamble\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/apr/25/epublic.technology|title=Blair's \u00a340bn gamble on IT|date=25 April 2002|accessdate=19 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Staff|first1=Guardian}}</ref> later scheduled to be replaced by [[SNOMED CT]].\n\nThe [[NHS Information Authority]] (NHSIA) was established by an Act of Parliament in 1999 with the goal to bring together four NHS IT and Information bodies (NHS Telecoms, Family Health Service (FHS), NHS Centre for Coding and Classification (CCC) and NHS Information Management Group (IMG)) to work together to deliver IT infrastructure and information solutions to the NHS in England. A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large [[NHS Direct]] tele-nurse and healthcare website program.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health.  It was widely seen as a failure, and blamed for delaying the implementation of IT in the service.  Even in 2020 it appeared most of the 1.38 million NHS computers were still using [[Windows 7]], which was released in 2009, and additional support had to be arranged by [[Microsoft]] until 14 January 2021 before the migration to Windows 10 could be completed.

[[Public Health England]] (PHE) wants all hospitals to help smokers quit.  One in thirteen smoking patients was referred to a hospital or community based cessation programme.  Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.  Frank Ryan, psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.  And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39094713|title=NHS 'tobacco free' campaign launched by Public Health England|date=26 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>  The numbers of smokers getting help to quit has fallen due to cuts in funding for smoking cessation care though the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends such help.

It is the second largest [[single-payer healthcare]] system in the world after the Brazilian [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from [[National Insurance]] contributions), and overseen by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], the NHS provides [[healthcare]] to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, are free for everyone, including visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68 |title=Am I entitled to NHS treatment when I visit England? |work=www.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by [[National Insurance]] payments<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10542622/The-awkward-truth-about-funding-the-NHS.html</ref> and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the [[Immigration Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-health-surcharge-information-for-migrants |title=Immigration health surcharge: information for migrants |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]].

Starting in April 2013, [[Primary Care Trust]]s (PCTs) began to be replaced by General Practitioner (GP)-led organisations called [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s (CCGs).

In reality, the provision of NHS services by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are concerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to increased use of private sector competition, balancing care options between private companies, charities, and NHS organisations.<ref name=\"The changing NHS\" /> NHS Trusts responded to the [[Nicholson challenge]]\u2014which involved making \u00a320 billion in savings across the service by 2015.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the National Health Service (England)}}\n[[File:Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jenny Lee in Corwen (15368872658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aneurin Bevan]].

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain. However, in July 2000, a full-scale modernisation programme was launched and new principles added.}}\n\nThe main aims of the additional principles are that the NHS will:\n* Provide a comprehensive range of services\n* Shape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers\n* Respond to the different needs of different populations\n* Work continuously to improve the quality of services and to minimise errors\n* Support and value its staff\n* Use public funds for healthcare devoted solely to NHS patients\n* Work with others to ensure a seamless service for patients\n* Help to keep people healthy and work to reduce health inequalities\n* Respect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance\n\n=== Structure ===\n{{Main|Health and Social Care Act 2012}}\nThe English NHS is controlled by the UK government through the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] (DHSC), which takes political responsibility for the service.

PCTs disbursed funds to them on an agreed tariff or contract basis, on guidelines set out by the Department of Health. The PCTs budget from the Department of Health was calculated on a formula basis relating to population and specific local needs. They were supposed to \"break even\" - that is, not show a deficit on their budgets at the end of the financial year. Failure to meet financial objectives could result in the dismissal and replacement of a Trust's Board of Directors, although such dismissals are enormously expensive for the NHS.<ref>{{cite web | title=Anger over C difficile payoff | publisher=Health Service Journal | url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/anger-over-c-difficile-pay-off/538529.article | date=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2013 a new system was established as a result of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].  The NHS budget is largely in the hands of a new body, NHS England.  NHS England commission specialist services and primary care.  Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., [[Herceptin]]) should be prescribed by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Herceptin judgement|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm|accessdate=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== NHS dentistry ====\n{{Main|NHS dentistry}}\n\nWhere available, NHS dentistry charges {{As of|2017|April|lc=on}} were: \u00a320.60 for an examination; \u00a356.30 for a filling or extraction; and \u00a3244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help with dental charges - Health Costs | publisher = NHS Choices | url = http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Dentalcosts.aspx | accessdate = 8 April 2015 }}</ref> As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota &#124; BBC| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=19 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>  Some people needing NHS dental care are unable to get it.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41113507 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n==== NHS Optical Services ====\n{{main|Eye care in the United Kingdom}}\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was \u00a319.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses.  There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers. This scheme did not however fully cover the costs of treatment in serious cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSince January 2007, the NHS has a duty to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>  In the last year of the scheme immediately preceding 2007, over \u00a3128 million was reclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Totals for England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=137500&Rendition=Web |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2019 \u00a3725 is payable for outpatient treatment, \u00a3891 per day for inpatient treatment and \u00a3219 per ambulance journey.<ref>{{cite news |title=NHS Charges: Increase for accidents from 1 April 2019 |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=79087cd9-7147-4188-9cf4-dc2a871321b9 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |publisher=Lexology |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Car park charges ====\nCar parking charges are a minor source of revenue for the NHS,<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\">{{cite news |title=NHS car park charges \u2013 a necessary evil? |author=Nick Triggle |date=3 March 2008 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7274968.stm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref> with most hospitals deriving about 0.25% of their budget from them.<ref name=\"t_20060718\" />  The level of fees is controlled individually by each trust.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  In 2006 car park fees contributed \u00a378 million towards hospital budgets.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" /><ref name=\"t_20060718\">{{cite news |title=Hospitals making \u00a378m a year from car park charges |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article689109.ece |accessdate=10 March 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}</ref>  Patient groups are opposed to such charges.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  (This contrasts with Scotland where car park charges were mostly scrapped from the beginning of 2009<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7593400.stm NHS car parking charges abolished] BBC News, 2 September 2008</ref> and with Wales where car park charges were scrapped at the end of 2011.)<ref name=\"t_20080303\">{{cite news |title=Welsh NHS scraps car park charges |author=David Rose |date=3 March 2008|publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3474721.ece |accessdate=10 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Charitable funds ====\nThere are over 300 official NHS charities in England and Wales.

The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector.

A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large [[NHS Direct]] tele-nurse and healthcare website program.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health.  It was widely seen as a failure, and blamed for delaying the implementation of IT in the service.  Even in 2020 it appeared most of the 1.38 million NHS computers were still using [[Windows 7]], which was released in 2009, and additional support had to be arranged by [[Microsoft]] until 14 January 2021 before the migration to Windows 10 could be completed.

[[Public Health England]] (PHE) wants all hospitals to help smokers quit.  One in thirteen smoking patients was referred to a hospital or community based cessation programme.  Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.  Frank Ryan, psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.  And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39094713|title=NHS 'tobacco free' campaign launched by Public Health England|date=26 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>  The numbers of smokers getting help to quit has fallen due to cuts in funding for smoking cessation care though the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends such help.
