In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that occurred shortly after the third season's release, the series' creators Matt and Ross Duffer revealed the series' creative team had already met on several occasions to discuss the show's future.<ref name=\"EW2\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/07/09/stranger-things-4-the-duffer-brothers-tease/ |title=Stranger Things 4 would 'feel very different,' according to the Duffer Brothers |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Tim |last=Stack |date=July 9, 2019 |accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref> On September 30, 2019, Netflix announced it had signed the Duffer Brothers for a new multi-year television and film deal that was reportedly worth nine figures.<ref name=\"EW1\"/><ref name=\"Netflix\"/><ref name=\"Variety\"/><ref name=\"Vulture\"/> To coincide with the production deal announcement, Netflix also announced the renewal of ''Stranger Things'' for a fourth season by releasing a brief, minute-long teaser on [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"EW1\"/><ref name=\"Variety\"/><ref name=\"Vulture\"/><ref name=\"Teaser1YT\">{{cite AV media |date=September 30, 2019 |title=Stranger Things 4 - Official Announcement |medium=Motion Picture |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIiDY4WA0oo |access-date=November 7, 2019 |format=Teaser Trailer |publisher=[[Netflix]]}}</ref> The teaser, which shows a ticking [[grandfather clock]] in the Upside Down, ends with the tagline \"We're not in Hawkins anymore,\" leading many news outlets to speculate the show's setting will relocate to Russia.<ref name=\"EW1\"/><ref name=\"Variety\"/><ref name=\"Vulture\"/><ref name=\"Teaser1YT\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nCommenting on the previous season's cliffhanger ending, Ross Duffer divulged the process of connecting story arcs between seasons:\n{{Quote|text=We don\u2019t want to write ourselves in a corner so we try to have these early discussions with the writers just to make sure that we\u2019re setting ourselves up to go in the right direction.

We didn\u2019t know the mall and stuff, but again, we know these big broad strokes. That\u2019s sort of where we are in season four. We have the big broad strokes. It\u2019s just now about filling in those lines in the details. We\u2019re pretty excited about where it\u2019s potentially going to go.
