{"title_page": "List of Girl Meets World characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{italic title|string=Girl Meets World}}\n''[[Girl Meets World]]'' is an American [[comedy]] television series created by [[Michael Jacobs (producer)|Michael Jacobs]] and [[April Kelly]] that aired on [[Disney Channel]] from June 27, 2014 to January 20, 2017. The series is a spinoff of ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' and stars [[Rowan Blanchard]], [[Ben Savage]], [[Sabrina Carpenter]], [[Peyton Meyer]], August Maturo, [[Danielle Fishel]], and Corey Fogelmanis.\n\nThe series centers around the life of Riley and her friends and family, particularly their school life, in which her father [[Cory Matthews#Girl Meets World|Cory Matthews]] is their history teacher. Riley shares a strong relationship with her best friend Maya Hart, who assists her in learning to cope with the social and personal issues of adolescence. Several ''Boy Meets World'' cast members reprise their roles in the series.\n\n== Main ==\n[[File:Girl Meets World main characters.jpg|thumb|right|The main characters. From left to right: Lucas, Auggie, Topanga, Riley, Cory, Maya, and Farkle.]]\n\n=== Riley Matthews ===\n{{visible anchor|Riley Matthews}} ([[Rowan Blanchard]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2013/02/04/new-show-girl-meets-world-gets-closer-to-becoming-a-reality|title=New Show \"Girl Meets World\" Gets Closer to Becoming a Reality|last=Merrimac|first=Megan|date=February 4, 2013|website=Tucson Weekly|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> is the daughter of Cory and Topanga Matthews, and has a younger brother named Auggie. \n\nAt the start of the series, Riley is 12 years old and in seventh grade.  She and her best friend, Maya Hart, explore school and life together while making new friends along the way.  She and Maya are in middle school for the first two seasons and then high school for the third season.  Riley is usually very optimistic and cheerful about life, and generally has faith in almost everyone.  She also has a very silly and quirky personality, much like her father and to an extent, her mother.  She is often portrayed as being very ditzy and innocent of the world around her.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Riley develops a crush on Lucas Friar, whom she met on the subway on the way to school; he later becomes her classmate in Cory's history class. They go out on a date for the first time in \"Girl Meets First Date\". During season two, Riley and Maya discover that they both like Lucas and he also likes the two of them, but Riley is Lucas' choice in season three's two-part episode \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\" and she and Lucas become a couple and still are one when the series ends. \n\nShe is periodically portrayed by Lindsey Lamer in flashbacks to Riley and Maya's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by [[Mariah Buzolin]].\n\n=== Cory Matthews ===\n{{main article|Cory Matthews}}\n{{visible anchor|Cory Matthews}} ([[Ben Savage]]) is Riley and Auggie's father and Topanga's husband. He has taken a job as a history teacher at [[John Quincy Adams]] Middle School for the first two seasons and then [[Abigail Adams]] High School in the third season. In both settings, his class consists of his daughter and her friends, and his history lessons relate to their lives, becoming life lessons for them. In addition to being Riley's father, he often acts as a father figure to Maya. He also acts as a mentor to his students, much like [[Mr. Feeny]] was to Cory, Topanga, and Shawn in ''[[Boy Meets World]]''.\n\n=== Maya Hart ===\n{{visible anchor|Maya Hart}} ([[Sabrina Carpenter]]) is Riley's best friend.  Maya was raised in a single-parent household by her mother Katy; she is tomboyish, social and street smart, but has a troubled past rooted in the fact that her father Kermit abandoned her and Katy before Maya turned five.  Consequently, Maya is wild and rebellious as evidenced by her actions, such as protesting homework and almost lighting a class assignment on fire, but her friendship with Riley and the Matthews family keeps her grounded most of the time.  \n\nIn the second season three-part episode \"Girl Meets Texas\", Maya is shown to have deeper feelings for Lucas than she normally lets on. Riley notices Maya's feelings and decides to step back from Lucas and let Maya start a relationship with him, which turns out to be awkward.  In season 3, Maya goes through an identity crisis stemming from the fact that she loves Riley so much that Maya was influenced by her, which turned out to be an underlying reason why she liked Lucas.  After Riley helped bring Maya back to her true self, she realized that she does not like Lucas the same way Riley does, and that she became like Riley to protect her and to find out if Lucas was right for her.  After this she put her full support behind Riley and Lucas as a couple.\n\nBeginning in the first season, Maya develops a crush on Cory's younger brother Joshua.  He downplays it as a schoolgirl crush until season 3 when, in the two-parter \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\", Maya tells him she genuinely likes him, and he finally admits he has feelings for her as well; he tells her that there is a chance for them and that he is willing to play the long game and see what happens.  In the third season, after her mother Katy marries [[Shawn Hunter]], Shawn presents Maya with adoption papers, and Maya accepts, proclaiming herself as Maya Hunter.<ref name=\"adoption\"/>\n\nMaya is periodically portrayed by Ivy George in flashbacks to Maya and Riley's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by [[Ruby Lewis]].\n\n=== Lucas Friar ===\n{{visible anchor|Lucas Friar}} ([[Peyton Meyer]]) is another member of the group and at first was both Riley and Maya's love interest until Maya decided Riley and Lucas were good for one another. He is Riley's boyfriend.\n\nOriginally from [[Austin, Texas]], Lucas has gentlemanly manners and common sense, and has shown to be the protector of the group as he is fearless and unstoppable when defending his friends.  Because of his Texas upbringing, Maya often addresses Lucas stereotypically calling him derisive but good-natured names like \"Huckleberry\", \"Ranger Rick\" and \"Bucky McBoingboing\"; in \"Girl Meets 1961\" Lucas finds out that he is from a family of cowboys and had a great grandfather who had a brief career as a musician. In \"Girl Meets the Secret of Life\", it is revealed that Lucas is a year older than his classmates, and his father was transferred to New York giving Lucas a fresh start.  He had been expelled from his former school in Austin. The reason for his expulsion involved sticking up for his friend Zay Babineaux after he got into trouble with some students. During season two, Riley and Maya discover that they both like Lucas and he also likes the two of them, but Riley is Lucas' choice in season three's two-part episode \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge.\" He and Riley become a couple and still are one when the series ends.\n\n=== Auggie Matthews ===\n{{visible anchor|Auggie Matthews}} (August Maturo)<!-- actor has no Wikipedia article at this time - please do not link unless/until there is one --> is Riley's precocious young brother and Cory and Topanga's son. Auggie is very attached to his parents and sister, and wants to be like his father when he grows up. His neighbor, Ava Morgenstern, becomes Auggie's girlfriend.\n\n=== Topanga Matthews ===\n{{main article|Topanga Matthews}}\n{{visible anchor|Topanga Matthews}} ([[Danielle Fishel]]) is Riley and Auggie's mother and Cory's wife. Topanga is Cory's high school girlfriend and they have been friends since they were babies. Topanga has become a successful lawyer and is a loving and protective mother as shown in \"Girl Meets Sneak Attack\". She later inherits Svorski's from the late Mrs. Svorski, later changing the bakery's name to Topanga's.\n\n=== Farkle Minkus ===\n{{visible anchor|Farkle Minkus}} [[Corey Fogelmanis]]<!-- actor has no Wikipedia article at this time - please do not link unless/until there is one --> is close friends with Riley and Maya, but is also infatuated with both of them. In \"Girl Meets Sneak Attack\", it is shown that he cares for the two and will do anything for them to be happy. He is smart, eccentric, and a big flirt. He is shown to be the teacher's pet in many episodes. He is the son of Cory and Topanga's former classmates, [[List of Boy Meets World characters#Stuart Minkus|Stuart Minkus]] and Jennifer Bassett; of the two, Farkle bears great similarities to his father. \n\nFarkle cares a great deal about his education and always keeps his grades up in class. In the season two episode \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\", his IQ score is found to be exceptionally high, so his guidance counselor has him take a series of tests to find out whether or not he has [[Asperger's Syndrome]], which he and his friends are relieved to find that he does not. In this same episode he begins a relationship with his former arch-nemesis, Isadora Smackle, who reveals she was diagnosed with Asperger's at age five.\n\n== Recurring ==\n\n=== Evelyn Rand ===\nEvelyn Rand ([[Jack\u00e9e Harry]]) meets Riley and Maya on the subway in the pilot; they later call her Crazy Hat because of the obscure hats they see her wearing at the subway station. She is revealed to be a successful businesswoman.\n\n=== Ava Morgenstern ===\nAva Morgenstern ([[Ava Kolker]]) is Auggie's girlfriend.  Being slightly older, she manipulates Auggie into doing whatever she wants, remaining oblivious to how this affects him.  Ava's personality appears to be a product of her mom's way of raising her.  Early on, Topanga makes it clear that she does not like Ava, but in the season 2 episode \"Girl Meets STEM\", she takes Ava's side: Ava is furious when she and Auggie get exactly the same trophy after Ava singlehandedly defeats Auggie's soccer team 29-0.  In the season 3 premiere \"Girl Meets High School: Part One\", Ava comes to Cory, Topanga, and Auggie when her parents are splitting up.\n\n=== Smackle ===\n<!-- Credited as \"Smackle\", so please leave the section heading as that, but adding the first name below should be fine. -->\nIsadora Smackle (Cecilia Balagot) is Farkle's arch-rival. In \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\", it is revealed that she was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]] when she was five years old. By the start of \"Girl Meets High School, Part 1\", she has joined the others at Abigail Adams High School, having become Farkle's girlfriend and becoming closer with Riley, Maya, Lucas and Zay.\n\n=== Katy Hart ===\nKaty Hart (Cheryl Texiera) is Maya's mom. For Career Day at school, Katy reveals to Maya's class that though she works as a waitress she aspires to be an actress. Katy frequently fails to show up to any event of importance to Maya, believing herself to be a hindrance to her daughter's future. Her relationship with Maya is strained at first,  reminiscent to that of Shawn and Chet Hunter from ''Boy Meets World'', but they become much closer after Shawn reveals to Maya in \"Girl Meets Master Plan\" that Maya's father deserting her family was not Katy's fault; Katy maintained the story that she drove him away believing that a girl should think well of her father.  As the series progresses, Katy becomes a manager for Topanga's bakery. After meeting Shawn, she develops feelings for him. The two get engaged in \"Girl Meets Upstate\" and subsequently wed in \"Girl Meets I Do\".\n\n=== Ms. Kossal ===\nGabriella Kossal (Aisha Kabia) is the art teacher at John Quincy Adams Middle School who is impressed with Maya's art.\n\n=== Dewey/Doy ===\nDewey/Doy{{efn|Credited as Dewey in \"Girl Meets the New World\", and Doy in subsequent episodes.}} (Cooper Friedman) is a friend of Auggie who pronounces his name \"Doy\" much to the annoyance of Topanga. He does not like his name and cries each time somebody corrects his pronunciation.\n\n=== Zay Babineaux ===\nIsaiah \"Zay\" Babineaux (Amir Mitchell-Townes) is Lucas' old friend from Texas who later moves to New York and enrolls at John Quincy Adams Middle School, who gradually befriends Riley, Maya and Farkle as he gets to know them better.  He fancies himself a smooth talker, but his words and actions more often get him into trouble rather than out of it.  When Zay and Lucas were classmates at their old school in Texas, Lucas was usually the one who bailed him out. Eventually, one of these situations caused Lucas to be expelled from his old school.\n\n=== Charlie Gardner ===\nCharlie Gardner ([[Tanner Buchanan]]) is a student at John Quincy Adams Middle School who admires Riley. In \"Girl Meets Semi-Formal\", he asked Riley to the semi-formal, right before Lucas was going to.\n\n=== Sarah ===\nSarah (Sarah Carpenter<!-- please DO NOT wikilink, as doing so would link to someone else; she does not have her own standalone article -->) is a classmate of Riley and Maya at both John Quincy Adams Middle School and Abigail Adams High School. She mostly serves as a background character in many episodes, but achieves prominence in \"Girl Meets Hollyworld\" as a screenplay writer for a movie her father, the director DW Preminger, is casting. The episode \"Girl Meets Commonism\" shows her on the honor board panel and reveals her last name to be Carpenter.\n\n== ''Boy Meets World'' alumni ==\n{{further|List of Boy Meets World characters}}\nThe following characters from ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' make appearances in the series in the form of recurring roles, guest appearances, or cameo appearances.

Throughout these years, Feeny was the Matthews' next-door neighbor and a close friend to the Matthews family as well as Shawn Hunter. In \"Girl Meets Gravity\", Cory calls Feeny to check up on him after the death of Mrs. Svorski. In \"Girl Meets Pluto\", Cory, Shawn, and Topanga, along with Riley and Maya, return to Philadelphia to dig up a time capsule from Feeny's backyard where they are caught by Feeny. He asks Riley and Maya how Cory has been to them as he receives some positive answers. He returns in the season three episode \"Girl Meets I Do\" where he comes to New York to wed Shawn and Katy.

Making his return in \"Girl Meets Maya's Mother\", it is revealed that he is Farkle's father. He appears at Career Day at school, whereupon he instantly renews his rivalry with both Cory and Topanga, and is proud to mention his position as the CEO of Minkus International.

He mentions in \"Girl Meets Flaws\" that Cory helped him get the job. Reminiscent of the original series, Harley likes to address Cory by the nickname Johnny Baboon. Harley is regretful for his past behavior and looks to steer kids from going down the wrong path. However, it is mildly implied that Harley's aggressive side isn't entirely gone as he mentions that without music, he is prone to do things. He returned in the series finale.<ref name=\"S3finale\"/>\n\n=== Alan Matthews ===\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Alan Matthews|Alan Matthews]] ([[William Russ]]) is Cory, Eric, Joshua, and Morgan's father, Topanga's father-in-law, and Riley and Auggie's grandfather.

She returned in the series finale.<ref name=\"S3finale\"/>\n\n=== Joshua Matthews ===\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Joshua Matthews|Joshua Matthews]] ([[Uriah Shelton]]) is Cory, Eric, and Morgan's teenage brother, and Riley and Auggie's uncle. He was born premature, underweight, and almost died just hours after his birth. He first appears with his parents in \"Girl Meets Home for the Holidays\", where he is 17 years old and is still living with them in Philadelphia. Maya has a major crush on him, although Joshua tries to make their three-year age difference clear to her. He visits his brother's home throughout the series, and enrolled at [[New York University]] prior to the end of season one. In the season three, two-part episode \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\", he helps Cory chaperone his class's field trip. During the trip, he tells Maya that there could be a possibility for them in the future. He also appeared in \"Girl Meets Bear\" before returning in the series finale.<ref name=\"S3finale\"/>\n\nJoshua was the only member of the immediate Matthews family never to have a prominent role in ''Boy Meets World''; he was originally portrayed by creator [[Michael Jacobs (producer)|Michael Jacobs]]'s son Daniel in ''Boy Meets World''.\n\n=== Shawn Hunter ===\n{{Main article|Shawn Hunter}}\n\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Shawn Hunter|Shawn Hunter]] ([[Rider Strong]]) is Cory's best friend since childhood, Topanga's close childhood friend, and uncle figure to Riley and Auggie.

At the end of the episode, he gets engaged to Katy. In \"Girl Meets I Do\", Shawn gets married to Katy.

He first appears in \"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels\". Like in the original series, Eric is a goofball and lovable, but is quite dimwitted sometimes. Now a full-grown adult, he appears to have matured a little, but is still considered to be the fun uncle in the Matthews family. As evidenced in the original series, Eric has good people skills. Since leaving Philadelphia, Eric has gone on to become the Mayor of St. Upid Town, New York, a fictional community near the borders of New York State and the Canadian Province of [[Quebec]], after all those who would have supported his mayoral opponent died in a landslide, according to Eric.\n\nTo blend in with the locals, he wears a [[hermit]] costume, an homage to his faux alter ego, Plays with Squirrels, from the ''Boy Meets World'' episode \"Seven the Hard Way\". Running gags include calling Riley his \"niche\", referring to Auggie as his cousin, and frequently mispronouncing Maya's name. He is eventually elected [[United States Senate|senator]] and is later faced with a decision involving his friend, Jack Hunter. He returned in the series finale.<ref name=\"S3finale\"/>\n\n=== Angela Moore ===\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Angela Moore|Angela Moore]] ([[Trina McGee]]) is Shawn Hunter's former high school girlfriend.

Moore ([[Julius Carry]]) died in a fishing accident, but also that she has gotten married to a man in the service. Her reason for meeting up with Shawn is to get some advice and counseling about her fears of becoming a mother, because she is worried that she may end up like her own mother. Shawn encourages Angela to start a family with her husband and experience the joy of being a parent. After this, Angela encourages Shawn to pursue a relationship with Katy and leaves to go back home.\n\n=== Chet Hunter ===\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Chet Hunter|Chet Hunter]] ([[Blake Clark]]) is Shawn and Jack's late father who died of a heart attack in the sixth season of ''Boy Meets World''.

Eric, touched by the boy's request, decided to volunteer as Tommy's big brother. The two spent a great deal of time together, leading Eric to consider adopting him, but he later changed his mind so Tommy could go live with a family who could provide better support for him.\n\nMany years later, he resurfaces in \"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels Goes to Washington\" as a political activist and founder of a website called ''Thorn in Your Side'' that reports on political scandals, with the latest one being about Senator Jefferson Davis Graham. He volunteers to help when Eric is nominated to run for senator of New York, though the others are unaware of his identity.

He is called in to oversee the class of Harper Burgess to see if she is worth keeping around after Principal Yancy threatened to fire her and Cory; like Mr. Turner in ''Boy Meets World'', Harper uses comic books in her lessons and rides a motorcycle to work. Riley sees Mr. Turner as an uncle figure as he has formed an even closer affinity with the Matthews family than before, visiting their home often. Although thankful to him for being a good educator, Topanga holds a grudge against Turner because he gave her an A- in high school. He returned in the series finale.<ref name=\"S3finale\"/>\n\n=== Jack Hunter ===\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Jack Hunter|Jack Hunter]] ([[Matthew Lawrence]]) is Shawn's paternal half-brother and was Eric's best friend in college.

The two have since lost touch, while Eric and Rachel still talk often.\n\nReappearing in \"Girl Meets Semi-Formal\", Jack now works for a corporation that is not environmentally friendly and has been assigned to persuade Senator Eric Matthews to allow his company to build a pipeline somewhere. Eric takes it upon himself to try and show Jack a simpler time to change his ways by taking him to the semi-formal dance where he meets Riley.\n\n=== Jennifer Bassett Minkus ===\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Jennifer Bassett|Jennifer Bassett Minkus]] ([[Kristanna Loken]]) was once Shawn Hunter's girlfriend back in high school.

She is often portrayed as being very ditzy and innocent of the world around her.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Riley develops a crush on Lucas Friar, whom she met on the subway on the way to school; he later becomes her classmate in Cory's history class. They go out on a date for the first time in \"Girl Meets First Date\". During season two, Riley and Maya discover that they both like Lucas and he also likes the two of them, but Riley is Lucas' choice in season three's two-part episode \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\" and she and Lucas become a couple and still are one when the series ends. \n\nShe is periodically portrayed by Lindsey Lamer in flashbacks to Riley and Maya's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by [[Mariah Buzolin]].\n\n=== Cory Matthews ===\n{{main article|Cory Matthews}}\n{{visible anchor|Cory Matthews}} ([[Ben Savage]]) is Riley and Auggie's father and Topanga's husband. He has taken a job as a history teacher at [[John Quincy Adams]] Middle School for the first two seasons and then [[Abigail Adams]] High School in the third season. In both settings, his class consists of his daughter and her friends, and his history lessons relate to their lives, becoming life lessons for them. In addition to being Riley's father, he often acts as a father figure to Maya. He also acts as a mentor to his students, much like [[Mr. Feeny]] was to Cory, Topanga, and Shawn in ''[[Boy Meets World]]''.\n\n=== Maya Hart ===\n{{visible anchor|Maya Hart}} ([[Sabrina Carpenter]]) is Riley's best friend.  Maya was raised in a single-parent household by her mother Katy; she is tomboyish, social and street smart, but has a troubled past rooted in the fact that her father Kermit abandoned her and Katy before Maya turned five.  Consequently, Maya is wild and rebellious as evidenced by her actions, such as protesting homework and almost lighting a class assignment on fire, but her friendship with Riley and the Matthews family keeps her grounded most of the time.  \n\nIn the second season three-part episode \"Girl Meets Texas\", Maya is shown to have deeper feelings for Lucas than she normally lets on. Riley notices Maya's feelings and decides to step back from Lucas and let Maya start a relationship with him, which turns out to be awkward.  In season 3, Maya goes through an identity crisis stemming from the fact that she loves Riley so much that Maya was influenced by her, which turned out to be an underlying reason why she liked Lucas.  After Riley helped bring Maya back to her true self, she realized that she does not like Lucas the same way Riley does, and that she became like Riley to protect her and to find out if Lucas was right for her.  After this she put her full support behind Riley and Lucas as a couple.\n\nBeginning in the first season, Maya develops a crush on Cory's younger brother Joshua.  He downplays it as a schoolgirl crush until season 3 when, in the two-parter \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\", Maya tells him she genuinely likes him, and he finally admits he has feelings for her as well; he tells her that there is a chance for them and that he is willing to play the long game and see what happens.  In the third season, after her mother Katy marries [[Shawn Hunter]], Shawn presents Maya with adoption papers, and Maya accepts, proclaiming herself as Maya Hunter.<ref name=\"adoption\"/>\n\nMaya is periodically portrayed by Ivy George in flashbacks to Maya and Riley's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by [[Ruby Lewis]].\n\n=== Lucas Friar ===\n{{visible anchor|Lucas Friar}} ([[Peyton Meyer]]) is another member of the group and at first was both Riley and Maya's love interest until Maya decided Riley and Lucas were good for one another. He is Riley's boyfriend.\n\nOriginally from [[Austin, Texas]], Lucas has gentlemanly manners and common sense, and has shown to be the protector of the group as he is fearless and unstoppable when defending his friends.  Because of his Texas upbringing, Maya often addresses Lucas stereotypically calling him derisive but good-natured names like \"Huckleberry\", \"Ranger Rick\" and \"Bucky McBoingboing\"; in \"Girl Meets 1961\" Lucas finds out that he is from a family of cowboys and had a great grandfather who had a brief career as a musician. In \"Girl Meets the Secret of Life\", it is revealed that Lucas is a year older than his classmates, and his father was transferred to New York giving Lucas a fresh start.  He had been expelled from his former school in Austin. The reason for his expulsion involved sticking up for his friend Zay Babineaux after he got into trouble with some students. During season two, Riley and Maya discover that they both like Lucas and he also likes the two of them, but Riley is Lucas' choice in season three's two-part episode \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge.\" He and Riley become a couple and still are one when the series ends.\n\n=== Auggie Matthews ===\n{{visible anchor|Auggie Matthews}} (August Maturo)<!-- actor has no Wikipedia article at this time - please do not link unless/until there is one --> is Riley's precocious young brother and Cory and Topanga's son. Auggie is very attached to his parents and sister, and wants to be like his father when he grows up.

Topanga is Cory's high school girlfriend and they have been friends since they were babies. Topanga has become a successful lawyer and is a loving and protective mother as shown in \"Girl Meets Sneak Attack\". She later inherits Svorski's from the late Mrs. Svorski, later changing the bakery's name to Topanga's.\n\n=== Farkle Minkus ===\n{{visible anchor|Farkle Minkus}} (Corey Fogelmanis)<!-- actor has no Wikipedia article at this time - please do not link unless/until there is one --> is close friends with Riley and Maya, but is also infatuated with both of them. In \"Girl Meets Sneak Attack\", it is shown that he cares for the two and will do anything for them to be happy. He is smart, eccentric, and a big flirt. He is shown to be the teacher's pet in many episodes. He is the son of Cory and Topanga's former classmates, [[List of Boy Meets World characters#Stuart Minkus|Stuart Minkus]] and Jennifer Bassett; of the two, Farkle bears great similarities to his father. \n\nFarkle cares a great deal about his education and always keeps his grades up in class. In the season two episode \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\", his IQ score is found to be exceptionally high, so his guidance counselor has him take a series of tests to find out whether or not he has [[Asperger's Syndrome]], which he and his friends are relieved to find that he does not. In this same episode he begins a relationship with his former arch-nemesis, Isadora Smackle, who reveals she was diagnosed with Asperger's at age five.\n\n== Recurring ==\n\n=== Evelyn Rand ===\nEvelyn Rand ([[Jack\u00e9e Harry]]) meets Riley and Maya on the subway in the pilot; they later call her Crazy Hat because of the obscure hats they see her wearing at the subway station. She is revealed to be a successful businesswoman.\n\n=== Ava Morgenstern ===\nAva Morgenstern ([[Ava Kolker]]) is Auggie's girlfriend.  Being slightly older, she manipulates Auggie into doing whatever she wants, remaining oblivious to how this affects him.  Ava's personality appears to be a product of her mom's way of raising her.  Early on, Topanga makes it clear that she does not like Ava, but in the season 2 episode \"Girl Meets STEM\", she takes Ava's side: Ava is furious when she and Auggie get exactly the same trophy after Ava singlehandedly defeats Auggie's soccer team 29-0.  In the season 3 premiere \"Girl Meets High School: Part One\", Ava comes to Cory, Topanga, and Auggie when her parents are splitting up.\n\n=== Smackle ===\n<!-- Credited as \"Smackle\", so please leave the section heading as that, but adding the first name below should be fine. -->\nIsadora Smackle (Cecilia Balagot) is Farkle's arch-rival. In \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\", it is revealed that she was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]] when she was five years old. By the start of \"Girl Meets High School, Part 1\", she has joined the others at Abigail Adams High School, having become Farkle's girlfriend and becoming closer with Riley, Maya, Lucas and Zay.\n\n=== Katy Hart ===\nKaty Hart (Cheryl Texiera) is Maya's mom. For Career Day at school, Katy reveals to Maya's class that though she works as a waitress she aspires to be an actress. Katy frequently fails to show up to any event of importance to Maya, believing herself to be a hindrance to her daughter's future. Her relationship with Maya is strained at first,  reminiscent to that of Shawn and Chet Hunter from ''Boy Meets World'', but they become much closer after Shawn reveals to Maya in \"Girl Meets Master Plan\" that Maya's father deserting her family was not Katy's fault; Katy maintained the story that she drove him away believing that a girl should think well of her father.  As the series progresses, Katy becomes a manager for Topanga's bakery. After meeting Shawn, she develops feelings for him. The two get engaged in \"Girl Meets Upstate\" and subsequently wed in \"Girl Meets I Do\".\n\n=== Ms. Kossal ===\nGabriella Kossal (Aisha Kabia) is the art teacher at John Quincy Adams Middle School who is impressed with Maya's art.\n\n=== Dewey/Doy ===\nDewey/Doy{{efn|Credited as Dewey in \"Girl Meets the New World\", and Doy in subsequent episodes.}} (Cooper Friedman) is a friend of Auggie who pronounces his name \"Doy\" much to the annoyance of Topanga. He does not like his name and cries each time somebody corrects his pronunciation.\n\n=== Zay Babineaux ===\nIsaiah \"Zay\" Babineaux (Amir Mitchell-Townes) is Lucas' old friend from Texas who later moves to New York and enrolls at John Quincy Adams Middle School, who gradually befriends Riley, Maya and Farkle as he gets to know them better.  He fancies himself a smooth talker, but his words and actions more often get him into trouble rather than out of it.  When Zay and Lucas were classmates at their old school in Texas, Lucas was usually the one who bailed him out. Eventually, one of these situations caused Lucas to be expelled from his old school.\n\n=== Charlie Gardner ===\nCharlie Gardner ([[Tanner Buchanan]]) is a student at John Quincy Adams Middle School who admires Riley. In \"Girl Meets Semi-Formal\", he asked Riley to the semi-formal, right before Lucas was going to.\n\n=== Sarah ===\nSarah (Sarah Carpenter<!-- please DO NOT wikilink, as doing so would link to someone else; she does not have her own standalone article -->) is a classmate of Riley and Maya at both John Quincy Adams Middle School and Abigail Adams High School. She mostly serves as a background character in many episodes, but achieves prominence in \"Girl Meets Hollyworld\" as a screenplay writer for a movie her father, the director DW Preminger, is casting. The episode \"Girl Meets Commonism\" shows her on the honor board panel and reveals her last name to be Carpenter.\n\n== ''Boy Meets World'' alumni ==\n{{further|List of Boy Meets World characters}}\nThe following characters from ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' make appearances in the series in the form of recurring roles, guest appearances, or cameo appearances.

Throughout these years, Feeny was the Matthews' next-door neighbor and a close friend to the Matthews family as well as Shawn Hunter. In \"Girl Meets Gravity\", Cory calls Feeny to check up on him after the death of Mrs. Svorski. In \"Girl Meets Pluto\", Cory, Shawn, and Topanga, along with Riley and Maya, return to Philadelphia to dig up a time capsule from Feeny's backyard where they are caught by Feeny. He asks Riley and Maya how Cory has been to them as he receives some positive answers. He returns in the season three episode \"Girl Meets I Do\" where he comes to New York to wed Shawn and Katy.

Making his return in \"Girl Meets Maya's Mother\", it is revealed that he is Farkle's father. He appears at Career Day at school, whereupon he instantly renews his rivalry with both Cory and Topanga, and is proud to mention his position as the CEO of Minkus International.

He mentions in \"Girl Meets Flaws\" that Cory helped him get the job. Reminiscent of the original series, Harley likes to address Cory by the nickname Johnny Baboon. Harley is regretful for his past behavior and looks to steer kids from going down the wrong path. However, it is mildly implied that Harley's aggressive side isn't entirely gone as he mentions that without music, he is prone to do things. He returned in the series finale.<ref name=\"S3finale\"/>\n\n=== Alan Matthews ===\n[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Alan Matthews|Alan Matthews]] ([[William Russ]]) is Cory, Eric, Joshua, and Morgan's father, Topanga's father-in-law, and Riley and Auggie's grandfather.

He first appears in \"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels\". Like in the original series, Eric is a goofball and lovable, but is quite dimwitted sometimes.

Since leaving Philadelphia, Eric has gone on to become the Mayor of St. Upid Town, New York, a fictional community near the borders of New York State and the Canadian Province of [[Quebec]], after all those who would have supported his mayoral opponent died in a landslide, according to Eric.\n\nTo blend in with the locals, he wears a [[hermit]] costume, an homage to his faux alter ego, Plays with Squirrels, from the ''Boy Meets World'' episode \"Seven the Hard Way\".

Riley sees Mr. Turner as an uncle figure as he has formed an even closer affinity with the Matthews family than before, visiting their home often.

In the case of Captains, no peer voting takes place but rather a pupil is elected by the Head of the respective department. This way it is not uncommon for some people to be re-elected as Captain for multiple terms depending on whether or not anybody else of suitable stance is available. Captains of Sport such as the Football or Rugby Captain are chosen by the Head of that sport and will help the Head organise teams for practice and preparation off the field of play as well as on it. Similarly Captains of Service will aid the Head of Service organise training sessions and be a point of contact for the rest of the members.<ref name=Gres/>\n\nCaptains of House are slightly different though in that they play a more personal role for pupils who want to voice problems with conditions within the house and this often means that House Captains have a lot more pupils to be responsible for. This difference is more evident in their original title of 'Helper'.<ref>Arnold-Brown 1962. p30</ref> They tend to be in close contact with the housemaster so that any issues requiring immediate attention can be sorted out as well as being able to relay any general ideas or concerns in the House Captains' Council which meet once every two weeks. At the meeting a teacher is present and minutes are taken so that they can be passed onto the Colour Bearers (CBs).\n\nColour Bearers get their name from a band of purple they wear as insignia on their uniform, purple being one of the school colours. They are elected by the pupils and the staff, similar to [[Eton College|Eton]]'s Pop,<ref>Brereton 1950. p 18.</ref> and have non-important roles in the school community as a whole.<ref>Brereton 1950. p17.</ref> Unlike captains they keep their positions for a whole year unless they are demoted as a punishment for untoward behaviour. They meet every week with the Headmaster to attend to a wide range of school matters. As well as this they are responsible for minor roles which would otherwise be taken up by teaching staff such as (hence the nickname teachers pet given to CB's), maintaining the refectory and the library and for serving drinks behind the bar at the weekly socials in addition to organising major school wide events that take place throughout the year.<ref name=Gres/>\n\nFrom the CBs a boy and a girl are chosen to be Guardians for the academic term. These are the Head Pupils for the entire school and only normally 6 people a year are allowed to have this position. The term Guardian comes from the name of the supportive rulers of [[Plato]]'s ideal state.<ref>Arnold-Brown 1962. p.35</ref> Like the staff they are closely involved in the management and well-being of the school.\n\n==Boarding houses==\nThere are seven boarding houses ranging from year 9-13, one sixth-form house, nine including the one no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework{{Cref|c}} to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain will be for the term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related activities.

In the case of Captains, no peer voting takes place but rather a pupil is elected by the Head of the respective department. This way it is not uncommon for some people to be re-elected as Captain for multiple terms depending on whether or not anybody else of suitable stance is available. Captains of Sport such as the Football or Rugby Captain are chosen by the Head of that sport and will help the Head organise teams for practice and preparation off the field of play as well as on it. Similarly Captains of Service will aid the Head of Service organise training sessions and be a point of contact for the rest of the members.<ref name=Gres/>\n\nCaptains of House are slightly different though in that they play a more personal role for pupils who want to voice problems with conditions within the house and this often means that House Captains have a lot more pupils to be responsible for. This difference is more evident in their original title of 'Helper'.<ref>Arnold-Brown 1962. p30</ref> They tend to be in close contact with the housemaster so that any issues requiring immediate attention can be sorted out as well as being able to relay any general ideas or concerns in the House Captains' Council which meet once every two weeks. At the meeting a teacher is present and minutes are taken so that they can be passed onto the Colour Bearers (CBs).\n\nColour Bearers get their name from a band of purple they wear as insignia on their uniform, purple being one of the school colours. They are elected by the pupils and the staff, similar to [[Eton College|Eton]]'s Pop,<ref>Brereton 1950. p 18.</ref> and have non-important roles in the school community as a whole.<ref>Brereton 1950. p17.</ref> Unlike captains they keep their positions for a whole year unless they are demoted as a punishment for untoward behaviour. They meet every week with the Headmaster to attend to a wide range of school matters. As well as this they are responsible for minor roles which would otherwise be taken up by teaching staff such as (hence the nickname teachers pet given to CB's), maintaining the refectory and the library and for serving drinks behind the bar at the weekly socials in addition to organising major school wide events that take place throughout the year.<ref name=Gres/>\n\nFrom the CBs a boy and a girl are chosen to be Guardians for the academic term. These are the Head Pupils for the entire school and only normally 6 people a year are allowed to have this position. The term Guardian comes from the name of the supportive rulers of [[Plato]]'s ideal state.<ref>Arnold-Brown 1962. p.35</ref> Like the staff they are closely involved in the management and well-being of the school.\n\n==Boarding houses==\nThere are seven boarding houses ranging from year 9-13, one sixth-form house, nine including the one no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework{{Cref|c}} to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain will be for the term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related activities. The HM is also the person who most pupils would talk to if they had a problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so are very much part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a [[tutor]] to help the pupils in their studies.<ref>{{cite web| year = 2009 | publisher = Gordonstoun | url = http://www.gordonstoun.org.uk/inside.aspx?pageID=38#team | title = Gordonstoun School: Pastoral Team | accessdate =4 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> The year a pupil is in, and the amount of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms.

The clarifications Haight provided in 2000 were judged unsatisfactory by the CDF and in January 2001 it initiated a formal investigation which led to his 2004 removal from Catholic universities and 2009 complete silencing.\n\nIn 2005 [[John L. Allen Jr. |John Allen]], after a long review of diverse responses to Haight's ''Jesus'' ''Symbol of God,'' described it as \"a work of vast erudition\", and concluded:\n\n<blockquote>The theological community appears divided over the Vatican's recent censure of Jesuit Fr. Roger Haight.

As examples\u2014in the episode \"[[American Dad (season 4)|Dope & Faith]]\" when Stan found out one of his friends was an [[atheism|atheist]], he tried getting him to pray by blowing up his home, spreading the [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] at his restaurant, brainwashing his wife into thinking she was a lesbian, and taking his kids away; in the episode \"[[American Dad (season 3)|I Can't Stan You]]\", Stan evicted his entire neighborhood and his own family just for overhearing some of his neighbors gossiping about him behind his back; in the episode \"[[American Dad (season 3)|Four Little Words]]\", Stan framed his wife as a murderer all so as not to hear her say the words \"I told you so\"; etc.\n\n===Troublesome sides and extreme-measure taking===\nInsanely drastic and [[wikt: rash|rashly]] so, Stan at times acts on his first [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]]s which  typically result in extreme measures.<ref name=\"awn.com\">{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown |title=American Dad Touchdown &#124; AWN &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=AWN |date= |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> Often, his extreme measures are of a conspicuously destructive, disastrous, offensive, or life-threatening nature to others.<ref name=\"awn.com\"/> Very selfish and inconsiderate, Stan never stops to think about the feelings, needs, or welfare of others, even in circumstances where others obviously could be or have been negatively impacted. Moreover, Stan often proves to be insensitive, completely unfazed when fully conscious of the distresses, displeasure and sufferings brought upon and felt by others including his very own family.\n\n===Masculinity===\nStan is also shown to be very [[virility|virile]] and [[masculinity|masculine]]. He often bears out his chest, stands up rigidly straight, and possesses a deep, thick voice quality. Moreover, he has expressed macho beliefs. For example, he has expressed opposition to showing emotion, associating it with being a woman. He once told Steve, \"Son, feelings are what women have. They come from their [[Ovary|ovaries]].\"\n\n===Troublesome/redeeming qualities===\nThough Stan typically tries to effect a masculine image and repress his feelings, his emotions, sensitivity, and endearing side still manifest themselves from time to time. For example, on several occasions, it has been revealed that even as an adult Stan has desperately desired the fatherly love and attention that he never got as a child, such as in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|American Stepdad]]\" when Roger became his stepfather.\n\nAt the same time, however, his incredibly drastic, dog-eat-dog, and inconsiderate qualities tend to show through in combination with his sensitive and redeeming qualities. For example, Hayley once told Stan, \"Dad, I've never seen this side of you. It's so sweet.\" Stan playfully replied, \"Well, if you tell anybody I'll kill you.\" The two laughed together for a moment before Stan suddenly took a serious, browbeating manner and added, \"I'm serious, I will kill you. I will reach into your chest, pull out your beating heart and eat it. All of it, every last bit!\" He concluded by affectionately stating, \"Well, sweet dreams, angel.\" As another example, in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 3)|Oedipal Panties]]\", Stan went to extremes to keep his mother, Betty, from finding a romantic partner for fear he would lose her. In the episode, Stan was revealed to have captured and detained all of Betty's former lovers to an uncharted island.\n\n===Original persona===\nIn the beginning of the series, it was heavily emphasized that Stan was a highly Conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], bordering on [[right-wing authoritarianism]]. He idolized then [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[George W.

Stan's stance on homosexuality further softened in the episode \"[[Surro-Gate]]\" when Francine acted as a [[surrogacy|surrogate mother]] for gay couple Greg and Terry's baby. At the end of this episode, Stan realized what a loving family Greg and Terry were.\n\nAfter the first few seasons and as the series progressed, Stan was portrayed as growing out of these particular traits and they were largely dropped from his character. Branching out, he later began displaying his wrongheadedness and penchant for taking to extremes in numerous other ways beyond ultra [[right-wing politics]].<ref name=\"avclub5\">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-missing-kink,95977/ |title=\"The Missing Kink\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref> He has also exhibited instances of gullibility (like his son Steve) such as when he believed he was taking cold medicine when in fact he was smoking \"[[crack cocaine|crack]]\" as Roger nonchalantly points out. Hayley has also tricked him into buying mirrored sunglasses that wound up getting him kidnapped by a group of radicals. In another episode, Roger states to Stan that he has to give his champion racehorse \"[[sexual stimulation|a full release]]\", which Stan ultimately does so. Stan has also once drunk Roger's urine due to the alien telling him it was a fancy beer. The episode \"[[Irregarding Steve]]\" reveals that Stan believes that popcorn doesn't pop above sea level. In \"[[Love, AD Style]]\" when Francine points out if they added another \"C\" before the \"K\" in the acronym of the new car Stan wants to buy he says he doesn't know what she's talking about, clearly not realizing what the new acronym would spell out. In \"[[Stanny Tendergrass]]\" Stan thought he was able to afford a membership at Mr. Vanderhill's (Roger's) country club after working there thirty years at the cost of seven grand, completely unaware of the vast price inflation cost (two hundred grand) due to natural compound interests and stock marketing incomings.\n\n==Occupation==\nStan's history can be traced back to 1987 when he was 25, he joined the army and quickly rose to become an Airborne Ranger, and eventually being selected to join the army's elite anti-terrorist group, Delta Force. After leaving the army he was again elected to undergo extensive special forces training to join the CIA's ultra secretive Special Activities division, specifically the Special Operations Group. When he was wounded on a top secret mission inside North Korea, Stan returned home to a desk job.  Stan is now an official officer of the CIA. Stan has shown expertise and knowledge in hand-to-hand combat, small arms, covert surveillance methods, torture, the ability to fly aircraft and the handling of assault weapons. Even though he has been arrested several times on several felony charges, such as animal cruelty, child pornography (though this was a wrongful accusation), attempted murder, drug trafficking, possession and use of crack cocaine (he almost flees to South America), transporting infected cattle to be slaughtered for food, impersonating a U.S. Marshal, and identity theft, he retains his official position.\n\nThough it is well known he works for the CIA very little is actually known about what exactly he does, and as a result of this ambiguity Stan's job in any given episode tends to be conducive of whatever CIA skill set is convenient for a given episode's plot. At various times in the series he has been shown to work as a [[Intelligence analysis|CIA analyst]], an agency [[bureaucrat]], a [[field agent]], and a [[Special Mission Unit|special forces operative]]; additionally, he has held a number of different titles during his time with the CIA, including (but not limited to) \"Deputy-Deputy Director of the CIA (Bullocks to Stan)\" and \"Deputy Under-Director of Missing Foreign Agents (Red October Sky)\". Usually he is seen working in a small cork-walled cubicle with a few of his buddies: Jackson, Sanders, Dick Reynolds, and others. Smith's assumption of these different roles may indicate that he works as a sort of troubleshooter; taking on different responsibilities as required. However, since assuming the role of Deputy Deputy Director, his duties do not appear to have changed.\n\nIn the episode \"Chimdale\", it is revealed that Stan Smith has been bald since college and wears a [[wig]] (however, this episode contradicts several past episodes, including \"[[American Dad! (season 3)|Frannie 911]]\", in which Roger scalped Stan while role playing as an American Indian and \"Choosy Wives Choose Smith\", in which Stan's hair grew after spending months on a deserted island). He drives a black [[Ford Explorer]] but has also been seen driving a black [[Chrysler 300C]] and owns a [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]] despite not having seen or even knowing about the movie ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Later in the series he buys a red C6 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] to deal with the fact that he could possibly be a grandfather which he continues to drive when not in the Explorer. Stan is also known to have an unexplained fear of seagulls, first mentioned by Francine in \"[[American Dad! (season 2)|American Dream Factory]]\", although he got over it in \"Choosy Wives Choose Smith\".\n\nDespite his traditional values, he has been married to two other women. In Saudi Arabia, Stan married an Arab woman and named her \"Thundercat\" because he could not pronounce her name, though Stan married her mainly as a servant. At one point, Francine divorced Stan so that he could have pointless sex, and he met and married a woman named Joanna, but went back to Francine, though Stan reports that he did [[Consummation|consummate]] the marriage. Both Stan and Francine admit that each married the other for what Stan describes as selfish reasons. That is, that Stan admits that he married Francine because she was attractive. Francine, for her part, says that she wants someone to take care of her financially and both go so far as to admit this during their vow renewal ceremony to a room full of people. In the episode \"[[Stan's Food Restaurant]]\", it is revealed that Stan is originally from [[Philadelphia]].\n\n==Hobbies==\nStan also enjoys a number of hobbies. Chief among these is collecting Franklin Mint Plates as well as a number of creative outlets such as designing and making themed stuffed bears, fly-tying, gun cleaning, wood burning, figure skating, and writing right-wing children's literature. He also enjoys reading books about the things he is doing at that very moment (i.e. he was reading a book called \"Reading While Waiting\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} as he waited for someone). Other examples include \"How to Do a Spit Take\", \"How to Furrow Your Brow\", \"How to Look Chastened\", \"How to Read With One Hand\", and \"Anticipating Doorbells\".\n\n==Alternate versions==\nIn \"May the Best Stan Win\" Stan is revealed to have signed up for the CIA's cybernetics program and intends for his body to be cryogenically frozen until the CIA develops the technology needed to turn him into an cyborg. Eventually, Stan's cybornetically enhanced self finds a way to travel back 1,000 years to the present because he missed Francine and wishes to spend time with her, however this eventually sparks friction between the present Stan and the cyborg Stan, leading to a fight in which the current Stan successfully defeats his future self.\n\nIn \"The Longest Distance Relationship\" one possible version of the future is shown when Jeff and Ghost Sinbad emerge from a wormhole some sixty years in the future. In this version of the future Stan is shown to have migrated into a Gorilla body due to his belief that an ape uprising will occur. As the episode draws to a close Stan's prediction proves true, but when Stan moves to side with the apes he is unexpectedly killed by them.\n\nIn \"Dreaming of a White Porsche Christmas\" it is revealed that the reason that Stan's family is so dysfunctional is due to his Stan's failure to appreciate what he has, which resulted in his marriage to Francine, his geeky son, his liberal daughter, and his adoption of a liberal version of Roger. Initially this was supposed to be a temporary setup, but the Angel assigned to Stan's case died, and it took his Christmas wish for the situation to resolve itself. Stan is then returned to what what suppose to be his ideal family: a conservative wife named Mary, an athletic son, a conservative and mild manner daughter named Ruth, and a version of Roger who does not partake in disguises, drinking, or drug use and holds a single legitimate job as an optometrist named Gerald. Despite being described as Stan's \"ideal\" family Stan rejects this version of his wife, his children, and Roger, and goes to great lengths to get back to his original, dysfunctional family, which he succeeds in doing.\n\nIn \"A Star is Reborn\" it is established that Stan is the reincarnation of a deceased movie star named Lenard. At the time Lenard was having an affair with Gloria Delmar, an alternate version of Francine. After the affair came to light both were killed by June Rosewood, Lenard's wife at the time. After rediscovering Lenard's reincarnation in Stan in the present, June welcomed Stan to her house and showed him the old movies he'd made in his past life. When Stan rejects her for Francine, June once again attempts to kill them both, only to end up dying when Stan and Francine turn the tables on her.\n\n==Cameo appearances==\n* In the season 17 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (called \"[[The Italian Bob]]\"), Stan, along with [[Peter Griffin]] from ''[[Family Guy]]'', can be glimpsed in an Italian sheriff's police book of criminal offenders. Peter Griffin is dubbed \"Plagiarismo\" (faux [[Italian language|Italian]] for Plagiarism) and Stan is dubbed \"Plagiarismo di Plagiarismo\" (Plagiarism of Plagiarism).\n* Stan appears alongside [[Avery Bullock]] in the ''Family Guy'' episode \"[[Stewie Kills Lois and Lois Kills Stewie|Lois Kills Stewie]]\" and [[Stewie Griffin]] mistakes Stan for [[Joe Swanson]] due to their large chins.\n* Stan later appears again in ''Family Guy'', this time in the episode \"[[Bigfat]]\" and Peter Griffin also mistakes him for Joe for the same reason.\n* Stan makes a brief cameo in the ''Family Guy'' episode \"[[Excellence in Broadcasting]]\", commending [[Brian Griffin]] for becoming a [[Conservatism|conservative]].\n* A bobblehead of Stan can be seen in the ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' episode \"Garfield of Dreams\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Television|Comedy|United States}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131209004654/http://www.fox.com/americandad/bios/stan-smith/ Stan Smith] at Fox.com\n\n{{American Dad!}}\n{{Seth MacFarlane}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Stan}}\n[[Category:American Dad! characters]]\n[[Category:Animated human characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional Central Intelligence Agency personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Fictional torturers and interrogators]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Fictional child abusers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Character of the animated sitcom American Dad!}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Stan Smith (''American Dad!'')}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #000080\n| name               = Stan Smith\n| series             = [[American Dad!]]\n| image              = Stan Smith.png\n| image_size         = 250px\n| full_name           = Stanford Leonard Smith\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (American Dad!)|Pilot]]\" (2005)\n| creator            = [[Seth MacFarlane]]<br>[[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]]<br>[[Matt Weitzman]]\n| voice              = Seth MacFarlane\n| occupation         = [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent\n| family             = [[List of American Dad! characters#Stan's relatives|Jack Smith]] (father)<br />[[List of American Dad! characters#Stan's relatives|Betty Smith]] (mother)<br />[[List of American Dad! characters#Stan's relatives|Hercules]] (deceased stepfather)<br />[[List of American Dad! characters#Stan's relatives|Tom Yabo]] (deceased stepfather)<br />[[List of American Dad! characters#Stan's relatives|Rusty Smith]] (half-brother)\n| children           = [[Hayley Smith (American Dad!)|Hayley Smith]] <br /> [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve Smith]]\n| spouse             = [[Francine Smith]]\n| relatives          = [[List of American Dad! characters#Stan's relatives|Glen Smith]] (nephew)<br>Ida (aunt)\n| religion           = [[Episcopalian]]\n| nationality        = [[United States|American]]\n| franchise          = \n| alt                = \n| caption            = \n| first_major        = \n| first_minor        = \n| first_issue        = \n| first_date         = \n| last_major         = \n| last_minor         = \n| last_issue         = \n| last_date          = \n| firstgame          = \n| last               = \n| based_on           = \n| adapted_by         = \n| portrayer          = \n| origin             = \n| home               = \n| aliases             = Staniel, Stanford, Stanley (by Roger Smith) Dad (by Steve and Hayley Smith) Top dog (by the Smith family) Bro (By Klaus)\n}}\n'''Stanford Leonard''' \"'''Stan'''\" '''Smith'' is the main protagonist of the [[adult animation|adult animated]] [[animated sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[American Dad!]]'' He is voiced by the series' co-creator and executive producer, [[Seth MacFarlane]].\n\nStan is the patriarch of the Smith family.

As examples\u2014in the episode \"[[American Dad (season 4)|Dope & Faith]]\" when Stan found out one of his friends was an [[atheism|atheist]], he tried getting him to pray by blowing up his home, spreading the [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] at his restaurant, brainwashing his wife into thinking she was a lesbian, and taking his kids away; in the episode \"[[American Dad (season 3)|I Can't Stan You]]\", Stan evicted his entire neighborhood and his own family just for overhearing some of his neighbors gossiping about him behind his back; in the episode \"[[American Dad (season 3)|Four Little Words]]\", Stan framed his wife as a murderer all so as not to hear her say the words \"I told you so\"; etc.\n\n===Troublesome sides and extreme-measure taking===\nInsanely drastic and [[wikt: rash|rashly]] so, Stan at times acts on his first [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]]s which  typically result in extreme measures.<ref name=\"awn.com\">{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown |title=American Dad Touchdown &#124; AWN &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=AWN |date= |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> Often, his extreme measures are of a conspicuously destructive, disastrous, offensive, or life-threatening nature to others.<ref name=\"awn.com\"/> Very selfish and inconsiderate, Stan never stops to think about the feelings, needs, or welfare of others, even in circumstances where others obviously could be or have been negatively impacted. Moreover, Stan often proves to be insensitive, completely unfazed when fully conscious of the distresses, displeasure and sufferings brought upon and felt by others including his very own family.\n\n===Masculinity===\nStan is also shown to be very [[virility|virile]] and [[masculinity|masculine]]. He often bears out his chest, stands up rigidly straight, and possesses a deep, thick voice quality. Moreover, he has expressed macho beliefs. For example, he has expressed opposition to showing emotion, associating it with being a woman. He once told Steve, \"Son, feelings are what women have. They come from their [[Ovary|ovaries]].\"\n\n===Troublesome/redeeming qualities===\nThough Stan typically tries to effect a masculine image and repress his feelings, his emotions, sensitivity, and endearing side still manifest themselves from time to time. For example, on several occasions, it has been revealed that even as an adult Stan has desperately desired the fatherly love and attention that he never got as a child, such as in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|American Stepdad]]\" when Roger became his stepfather.\n\nAt the same time, however, his incredibly drastic, dog-eat-dog, and inconsiderate qualities tend to show through in combination with his sensitive and redeeming qualities. For example, Hayley once told Stan, \"Dad, I've never seen this side of you. It's so sweet.\" Stan playfully replied, \"Well, if you tell anybody I'll kill you.\" The two laughed together for a moment before Stan suddenly took a serious, browbeating manner and added, \"I'm serious, I will kill you. I will reach into your chest, pull out your beating heart and eat it. All of it, every last bit!\" He concluded by affectionately stating, \"Well, sweet dreams, angel.\" As another example, in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 3)|Oedipal Panties]]\", Stan went to extremes to keep his mother, Betty, from finding a romantic partner for fear he would lose her. In the episode, Stan was revealed to have captured and detained all of Betty's former lovers to an uncharted island.\n\n===Original persona===\nIn the beginning of the series, it was heavily emphasized that Stan was a highly Conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], bordering on [[right-wing authoritarianism]]. He idolized then [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[George W. Bush]] and former President [[Ronald Reagan]].\nCombined with these traits, he was also portrayed as [[patriotism|patriotic]] and [[Christians|Christian]]. Stan regularly caused havoc and disorder with his [[bigotry]], [[Conservatism]], [[patriotism]], [[chauvinism]], [[xenophobia]], and [[paranoia]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&pg=PT220&dq=American+Dad!+series&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ox6BUeDbHNLo2gXcu4CwBA&ved=0CDcQ6AEwADgK |title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 Through 2010 - Vincent Terrace |publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref> MacFarlane has likened Stan's original character to [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All in the Family]]''.<ref name=\"norton\">Norton James.[http://www.flakmag.com/features/macfarlane.html \"Seth MacFarlane's Third Act\"].

Even though he has been arrested several times on several felony charges, such as animal cruelty, child pornography (though this was a wrongful accusation), attempted murder, drug trafficking, possession and use of crack cocaine (he almost flees to South America), transporting infected cattle to be slaughtered for food, impersonating a U.S. Marshal, and identity theft, he retains his official position.\n\nThough it is well known he works for the CIA very little is actually known about what exactly he does, and as a result of this ambiguity Stan's job in any given episode tends to be conducive of whatever CIA skill set is convenient for a given episode's plot. At various times in the series he has been shown to work as a [[Intelligence analysis|CIA analyst]], an agency [[bureaucrat]], a [[field agent]], and a [[Special Mission Unit|special forces operative]]; additionally, he has held a number of different titles during his time with the CIA, including (but not limited to) \"Deputy-Deputy Director of the CIA (Bullocks to Stan)\" and \"Deputy Under-Director of Missing Foreign Agents (Red October Sky)\". Usually he is seen working in a small cork-walled cubicle with a few of his buddies: Jackson, Sanders, Dick Reynolds, and others. Smith's assumption of these different roles may indicate that he works as a sort of troubleshooter; taking on different responsibilities as required. However, since assuming the role of Deputy Deputy Director, his duties do not appear to have changed.\n\nIn the episode \"Chimdale\", it is revealed that Stan Smith has been bald since college and wears a [[wig]] (however, this episode contradicts several past episodes, including \"[[American Dad! (season 3)|Frannie 911]]\", in which Roger scalped Stan while role playing as an American Indian and \"Choosy Wives Choose Smith\", in which Stan's hair grew after spending months on a deserted island). He drives a black [[Ford Explorer]] but has also been seen driving a black [[Chrysler 300C]] and owns a [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]] despite not having seen or even knowing about the movie ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Later in the series he buys a red C6 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] to deal with the fact that he could possibly be a grandfather which he continues to drive when not in the Explorer. Stan is also known to have an unexplained fear of seagulls, first mentioned by Francine in \"[[American Dad! (season 2)|American Dream Factory]]\", although he got over it in \"Choosy Wives Choose Smith\".\n\nDespite his traditional values, he has been married to two other women. In Saudi Arabia, Stan married an Arab woman and named her \"Thundercat\" because he could not pronounce her name, though Stan married her mainly as a servant. At one point, Francine divorced Stan so that he could have pointless sex, and he met and married a woman named Joanna, but went back to Francine, though Stan reports that he did [[Consummation|consummate]] the marriage. Both Stan and Francine admit that each married the other for what Stan describes as selfish reasons. That is, that Stan admits that he married Francine because she was attractive. Francine, for her part, says that she wants someone to take care of her financially and both go so far as to admit this during their vow renewal ceremony to a room full of people. In the episode \"[[Stan's Food Restaurant]]\", it is revealed that Stan is originally from [[Philadelphia]].\n\n==Hobbies==\nStan also enjoys a number of hobbies. Chief among these is collecting Franklin Mint Plates as well as a number of creative outlets such as designing and making themed stuffed bears, fly-tying, gun cleaning, wood burning, figure skating, and writing right-wing children's literature. He also enjoys reading books about the things he is doing at that very moment (i.e. he was reading a book called \"Reading While Waiting\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} as he waited for someone). Other examples include \"How to Do a Spit Take\", \"How to Furrow Your Brow\", \"How to Look Chastened\", \"How to Read With One Hand\", and \"Anticipating Doorbells\".\n\n==Alternate versions==\nIn \"May the Best Stan Win\" Stan is revealed to have signed up for the CIA's cybernetics program and intends for his body to be cryogenically frozen until the CIA develops the technology needed to turn him into an cyborg. Eventually, Stan's cybornetically enhanced self finds a way to travel back 1,000 years to the present because he missed Francine and wishes to spend time with her, however this eventually sparks friction between the present Stan and the cyborg Stan, leading to a fight in which the current Stan successfully defeats his future self.\n\nIn \"The Longest Distance Relationship\" one possible version of the future is shown when Jeff and Ghost Sinbad emerge from a wormhole some sixty years in the future. In this version of the future Stan is shown to have migrated into a Gorilla body due to his belief that an ape uprising will occur. As the episode draws to a close Stan's prediction proves true, but when Stan moves to side with the apes he is unexpectedly killed by them.\n\nIn \"Dreaming of a White Porsche Christmas\" it is revealed that the reason that Stan's family is so dysfunctional is due to his Stan's failure to appreciate what he has, which resulted in his marriage to Francine, his geeky son, his liberal daughter, and his adoption of a liberal version of Roger. Initially this was supposed to be a temporary setup, but the Angel assigned to Stan's case died, and it took his Christmas wish for the situation to resolve itself. Stan is then returned to what what suppose to be his ideal family: a conservative wife named Mary, an athletic son, a conservative and mild manner daughter named Ruth, and a version of Roger who does not partake in disguises, drinking, or drug use and holds a single legitimate job as an optometrist named Gerald. Despite being described as Stan's \"ideal\" family Stan rejects this version of his wife, his children, and Roger, and goes to great lengths to get back to his original, dysfunctional family, which he succeeds in doing.\n\nIn \"A Star is Reborn\" it is established that Stan is the reincarnation of a deceased movie star named Lenard. At the time Lenard was having an affair with Gloria Delmar, an alternate version of Francine. After the affair came to light both were killed by June Rosewood, Lenard's wife at the time. After rediscovering Lenard's reincarnation in Stan in the present, June welcomed Stan to her house and showed him the old movies he'd made in his past life. When Stan rejects her for Francine, June once again attempts to kill them both, only to end up dying when Stan and Francine turn the tables on her.\n\n==Cameo appearances==\n* In the season 17 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (called \"[[The Italian Bob]]\"), Stan, along with [[Peter Griffin]] from ''[[Family Guy]]'', can be glimpsed in an Italian sheriff's police book of criminal offenders. Peter Griffin is dubbed \"Plagiarismo\" (faux [[Italian language|Italian]] for Plagiarism) and Stan is dubbed \"Plagiarismo di Plagiarismo\" (Plagiarism of Plagiarism).\n* Stan appears alongside [[Avery Bullock]] in the ''Family Guy'' episode \"[[Stewie Kills Lois and Lois Kills Stewie|Lois Kills Stewie]]\" and [[Stewie Griffin]] mistakes Stan for [[Joe Swanson]] due to their large chins.\n* Stan later appears again in ''Family Guy'', this time in the episode \"[[Bigfat]]\" and Peter Griffin also mistakes him for Joe for the same reason.\n* Stan makes a brief cameo in the ''Family Guy'' episode \"[[Excellence in Broadcasting]]\", commending [[Brian Griffin]] for becoming a [[Conservatism|conservative]].\n* A bobblehead of Stan can be seen in the ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' episode \"Garfield of Dreams\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Television|Comedy|United States}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131209004654/http://www.fox.com/americandad/bios/stan-smith/ Stan Smith] at Fox.com\n\n{{American Dad!}}\n{{Seth MacFarlane}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Stan}}\n[[Category:American Dad! characters]]\n[[Category:Animated human characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional Central Intelligence Agency personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Fictional torturers and interrogators]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Fictional child abusers]]\n", "name_user": "Baane247", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed title bold formatting.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Smith_(American_Dad!)"}
