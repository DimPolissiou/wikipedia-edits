His parents married on 5 September 1898. His artist mother had works exhibited at an event in [[Venice]] that saw [[King Victor Emmanuel III]] purchase some of her works. His paternal grandparents were Pietro Frassati and Giuseppina Coda Canati.<ref name=FS/>\n\nFrassati's inclinations to help others had manifested in his childhood. There was one occasion as a child where he answered the door to find a mother begging with her son who was shoeless. His response was to take off his own shoes and give them to the child.<ref name=PGF/> In 1909 his father refused to help a man who came to their door because he was drunk. The sobbing Frassati told his mother of this and she instructed him to find the man and bring him to the home for something to eat.<ref name=CV/> He made his [[First Communion]] on 19 June 1911 and his first confession was heard at the church of Corpus Christi on 20 June 1910; he received his Confirmation in his parish church on 10 June 1915.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=FS/> Frassati was known as the \"Terror\" due to his fondness for practical jokes though they were in good taste.\n\nHe was an average student in school, though Frassati was known among his peers for his intelligence and more so for his devotion. He failed his exams in 1913 so was sent for private studies at a school run by the [[Jesuits]]. Frassati was dedicated to works of social action that would unite people together in fellowship as a means of combating inequalities. He was an ardent opponent of [[fascism]] and did not support the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]]. There was an instance in [[Rome]] where he was arrested while protesting alongside the Young Catholic Workers Congress.<ref name=SQPN/> He was involved with student groups as well as the [[Apostleship of Prayer|Apostolato di preghiera]] and [[Catholic Action]] (joined in 1919) to which he dedicated himself.<ref name=F2/> Frassati also became a professed member of the [[Third Order of Saint Dominic]] on 28 May 1922 to imitate the example of [[Dominic of Osma]], in which he assumed the religious name of \"Girolamo\" in honor of [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. He was also devoted to the teachings of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Catherine of Siena]]. The teachings of [[Paul the Apostle]] also inspired him and that saint is mentioned in a range of Frassati's letters.\n\nHe often said: \"Charity is not enough; we need social reform\".<ref name=F2/>  He helped establish a newspaper entitled ''Momento'' whose principles were based on [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope Leo XIII's]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]''. He joined the [[St. Vincent de Paul Society|Saint Vincent de Paul group]] in 1918 and spent much of his time helping the poor and less fortunate. In 1918 he began his studies in engineering so he could become a mining engineer since he wanted to do this in order \"to serve Christ better among the miners\".<ref name=PGF/> Upon his graduation his father offered him either a car or a sizable fund though he chose the latter so he could give it to the poor rather than use it for himself. He also provided a bed for a [[tuberculosis]] sufferer on one occasion as well as supporting the three children of an ill widow and finding a place for an evicted woman. During the course of his studies he found himself attracted to a girl due to her candor and goodness which impressed him. He never dated her since he was apprehensive of whether or not his parents would approve of her. This prompted him to renounce such an undertaking for a relationship as he confided to his sister.<ref name=CV/>\n\nHis talents seemed to be limitless for he was an avid [[mountaineer]] and athlete who could swim well and could even recite [[Dante Aligheri|Dante]] passages with relative ease. Frassati was a member of the [[Club Alpino Italiano]] and climbed mountains such as the [[Grand Tournalin]] and [[Monte Viso]].<ref name=FS/> He also frequented theatres and museums with friends whenever he had the chance. But, he only saw films at the cinema after learning of that film's moral qualities, since he disliked those things of a vulgar and impure nature.<ref name=CV/> He did learn how to dance, though never liked it so much as he often noted. He also knew German as well as [[Latin]] and French.\n\nOn 30 June 1925 he was boating with two friends on the [[Po River]] but complained of sharp pains in his back muscles. He returned home with a severe headache and had a fever on 1 July; that very day his maternal grandmother died. On 2 July a doctor was summoned and asked the prone Frassati to get up from lying down. Frassati could not move and said: \"I can't!\"<ref name=CV/> Soon a diagnosis was made that he had [[poliomyelitis]] which exacerbated his fatigue. This fatigue prompted him to ask for a [[morphine]] shot so he could sleep easier though the doctor and his mother believed it to be imprudent to which Frassati relented.\n\nHe gave his final instructions to his sister as his condition worsened and it became apparent that he would soon die.<ref name=PGF/> His condition grew to the breaking point at 3:00&nbsp;am on 4 July in which a priest was summoned to give him the [[Last Rites]]. He was near death at 4:00&nbsp;pm with his mother holding him in her arms. His final words were: \"May I breathe forth my soul in peace with you\". Frassati died on 4 July 1925 due to poliomyelitis at 7:00&nbsp;pm.<ref name=CV/> His parents expected Turin's elite and political figures to come to offer their condolences and attend the funeral and expected to find many of his friends there as well. All were surprised to find the streets lined with thousands of mourners as the [[cortege]] passed out of the reverence felt for him among the people he had helped. He was buried in the Frassati plot at the Pollone Cimitero. His remains were later transferred to the [[Turin Cathedral]] in 1981 and were found to be incorrupt upon inspection.<ref name=PGF/><ref name=FS/>\n\n==Beatification==\n[[File:3295TorinoDuomoInside.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Frassati's resting place in the Turin Cathedral]]\nThe poor of Turin began to petition the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Turin|Archbishop of Turin]] to begin the cause for Frassati's [[canonization]]. The cause commenced on 2 July 1932 for a thorough examination of Frassati's life in an informative process that later concluded on 23 October 1935 after collecting a range of documentation and witness testimonies (Cardinal [[Maurilio Fossati]] oversaw this process in his role as archbishop). Frassati's writings were also collected for examination ensure no doctrinal breaches were present since that would impede the cause to a significant degree; theologians cleared them on 21 December 1938.\n\nA grave setback to the cause came in 1941 after [[Pope Pius XII]] suspended the cause upon the airing of allegations questioning Frassati's morals and claiming that Frassati went to the mountains in mixed and questionable company. His sister - sometime after this - went to Rome to discuss this with Vatican officials to rehabilitate her brother's good name rather than to resume the cause. The allegations were proven to be false and Vatican officials declared that the cause would resume.<ref name=FS/> The formal introduction of the cause came under [[Pope Paul VI]] on 12 June 1978 and he became titled as a [[Servant of God]]. An apostolic process was later held following this and it concluded later in 1981. The [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued a decree of validation on 12 June 1987 for the previous processes and received the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation later in 1987. Theologians approved its contents on 14 July 1987 as did the members of the C.C.S. later on 28 September 1987. Frassati was proclaimed to be [[Venerable]] on 23 October 1987 after [[Pope John Paul II]] authorized a decree confirming that Frassati had lived a model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]].\n\nA single miracle - often a healing medicine and science cannot explain - was needed for his beatification. The miracle investigated was the cure of Domenico Sellan (1893 - c. 1968) in late 1933 who suffered from grave tuberculosis. A priest visited him on 28 December 1933 to bring him a relic and picture of Frassati for his intercession. Sellan was healed of the disease and lived for over three more decades in perfect health.<ref name=FS/> The closure of the miracle's investigation allowed for the C.C.S. to validate the process in a 20 February 1989 decree prior to the approval of medical experts on 26 April 1989. Theologians also confirmed the healing was a miracle on 30 June 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 3 October 1989. John Paul II granted final approval to the miracle on 21 December 1989 which also confirmed that Frassati would soon be beatified. John Paul II beatified Frassati in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 20 May 1990.\n\nThe current [[postulator]] for this cause is the Jesuit priest Pascual Cebollada Silvestre.\n\n==Posthumous recognition==\nFrassati is the eponym and patron of the Frassati Catholic Academy in [[Wauconda, Illinois|Wauconda]] which is a middle school founded in the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] in 2010<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.frassaticatholicacademy.org/|title=Frassati Catholic Academy > Home|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> and also the [[Frassati Catholic High School]] which opened in August 2013 in [[Houston]].

But, he only saw films at the cinema after learning of that film's moral qualities, since he disliked those things of a vulgar and impure nature.<ref name=CV/> He did learn how to dance, though never liked it so much as he often noted. He also knew German as well as [[Latin]] and French.\n\nOn 30 June 1925 he was boating with two friends on the [[Po River]] but complained of sharp pains in his back muscles. He returned home with a severe headache and had a fever on 1 July; that very day his maternal grandmother died. On 2 July a doctor was summoned and asked the prone Frassati to get up from lying down. Frassati could not move and said: \"I can't!\"<ref name=CV/> Soon a diagnosis was made that he had [[poliomyelitis]] which exacerbated his fatigue. This fatigue prompted him to ask for a [[morphine]] shot so he could sleep easier though the doctor and his mother believed it to be imprudent to which Frassati relented.\n\nHe gave his final instructions to his sister as his condition worsened and it became apparent that he would soon die.<ref name=PGF/> His condition grew to the breaking point at 3:00&nbsp;am on 4 July in which a priest was summoned to give him the [[Last Rites]]. He was near death at 4:00&nbsp;pm with his mother holding him in her arms. His final words were: \"May I breathe forth my soul in peace with you\". Frassati died on 4 July 1925 due to poliomyelitis at 7:00&nbsp;pm.<ref name=CV/> His parents expected Turin's elite and political figures to come to offer their condolences and attend the funeral and expected to find many of his friends there as well. All were surprised to find the streets lined with thousands of mourners as the [[cortege]] passed out of the reverence felt for him among the people he had helped. He was buried in the Frassati plot at the Pollone Cimitero. His remains were later transferred to the [[Turin Cathedral]] in 1981 and were found to be incorrupt upon inspection.<ref name=PGF/><ref name=FS/>\n\n==Beatification==\n[[File:3295TorinoDuomoInside.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Frassati's resting place in the Turin Cathedral]]\nThe poor of Turin began to petition the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Turin|Archbishop of Turin]] to begin the cause for Frassati's [[canonization]]. The cause commenced on 2 July 1932 for a thorough examination of Frassati's life in an informative process that later concluded on 23 October 1935 after collecting a range of documentation and witness testimonies (Cardinal [[Maurilio Fossati]] oversaw this process in his role as archbishop). Frassati's writings were also collected for examination ensure no doctrinal breaches were present since that would impede the cause to a significant degree; theologians cleared them on 21 December 1938.\n\nA grave setback to the cause came in 1941 after [[Pope Pius XII]] suspended the cause upon the airing of allegations questioning Frassati's morals and claiming that Frassati went to the mountains in mixed and questionable company. His sister - sometime after this - went to Rome to discuss this with Vatican officials to rehabilitate her brother's good name rather than to resume the cause. The allegations were proven to be false and Vatican officials declared that the cause would resume.<ref name=FS/> The formal introduction of the cause came under [[Pope Paul VI]] on 12 June 1978 and he became titled as a [[Servant of God]]. An apostolic process was later held following this and it concluded later in 1981. The [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued a decree of validation on 12 June 1987 for the previous processes and received the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation later in 1987. Theologians approved its contents on 14 July 1987 as did the members of the C.C.S. later on 28 September 1987. Frassati was proclaimed to be [[Venerable]] on 23 October 1987 after [[Pope John Paul II]] authorized a decree confirming that Frassati had lived a model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]].\n\nA single miracle - often a healing medicine and science cannot explain - was needed for his beatification. The miracle investigated was the cure of Domenico Sellan (1893 - c. 1968) in late 1933 who suffered from grave tuberculosis. A priest visited him on 28 December 1933 to bring him a relic and picture of Frassati for his intercession. Sellan was healed of the disease and lived for over three more decades in perfect health.<ref name=FS/> The closure of the miracle's investigation allowed for the C.C.S. to validate the process in a 20 February 1989 decree prior to the approval of medical experts on 26 April 1989. Theologians also confirmed the healing was a miracle on 30 June 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 3 October 1989. John Paul II granted final approval to the miracle on 21 December 1989 which also confirmed that Frassati would soon be beatified. John Paul II beatified Frassati in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 20 May 1990.\n\nThe current [[postulator]] for this cause is the Jesuit priest Pascual Cebollada Silvestre.\n\n==Posthumous recognition==\nFrassati is the eponym and patron of the Frassati Catholic Academy in [[Wauconda, Illinois|Wauconda]] which is a middle school founded in the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] in 2010<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.frassaticatholicacademy.org/|title=Frassati Catholic Academy > Home|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> and also the [[Frassati Catholic High School]] which opened in August 2013 in [[Houston]].

It originally referred to a specific hill in Jerusalem ([[Mount Zion]]), located to the south of [[Mount Moriah]] (the Temple Mount). According to the narrative of 2 Samuel 5, Mount Zion held the [[Jebusite]] fortress of the same name that was conquered by [[David]] and was renamed the [[City of David]]. \nThat specific hill (\"mount\") is one of the many squat hills that form Jerusalem, which also includes Mount Moriah (the Temple Mount), the [[Mount of Olives]], etc. Over many centuries, until as recently as the Ottoman era, the city walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt many times in new locations, so that the particular hill known as Mount Zion is no longer inside the city wall, but its location is now just outside the portion of the Old City wall forming the southern boundary of  the Jewish Quarter of the current Old City. Most of the original City of David itself is thus also outside the current city wall.\n\nThe term ''Tzion'' came to designate the area of Davidic Jerusalem where the fortress stood, and was used as well as [[synecdoche]] for the entire city of Jerusalem; and later, when [[Solomon's Temple]] was built on the adjacent Mount Moriah (which, as a result, came to be known as the Temple Mount) the meanings of the term ''Tzion'' were further extended by [[synecdoche]] to the additional meanings of the Temple itself, the hill upon which the Temple stood, the entire city of Jerusalem, the entire biblical Land of Israel, and \"[[Jewish eschatology##.22The world to come.22|the World to Come]]\", the Jewish understanding of the [[afterlife]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of the word ''Zion'' (''\u1e63iy\u00f4n'') is uncertain.<ref name=Longmanp936>{{cite book|last1=Longman|first1=Tremper|authorlink1=Tremper Longman|last2=Enns|first2=Peter|authorlink2=Peter Enns|title=Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry & Writings: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&pg=PA936|year=2008|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1783-2|page=936}}</ref><ref name=Brileyp49>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Arnold Albert|title=The book of Psalms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq5gFlzMxQgC|year=1981|publisher=Eerdmans|isbn=978-0-551-00846-5}}</ref><ref name=Bromileyp1006>{{cite book|last=Bromiley|first=Geoffrey W.|authorlink=Geoffrey W.

[3] For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.\" In verse 8, the phrase \"Daughter of Babylon\"\nappears as a personification of Babylon or its population: \"[8] O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.\"\n\n[[Psalm 147]] uses \"Jerusalem\"  and \"Zion\" interchangeably to address the faithful: \"[2] The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcast of Israel. [...] [12] Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.\"\n\n==Judaism==\nThe location of the Temple, and in particular its [[Holy of Holies]] (innermost sanctum), is the most holy place in the world for the Jewish people, seen as the connection between [[God in Judaism|God]] and humanity. Observant Jews recite the [[Amidah]] three times a day facing the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, praying for the rebuilding of the Holy Temple, the restoration of the Temple service, the redemption of the world, and for the coming of the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]].\n\nIn [[Kabbalah]], the more esoteric reference is made to Tzion being the spiritual point from which reality emerges, located in the [[Holy of Holies]] of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]], [[Second Temple|Second]] and [[Third Temple]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/parsha/dimension/archives/devarim.htm|title=Parshas HaShavua|work=shemayisrael.co.il}}</ref>\n\n===Zionism===\n{{Main|Zionism|Types of Zionism|Labor Zionism|Religious Zionism|Post-Zionism|Neo-Zionism}}\n[[File:Bat Zion I want your Old New Land join Jewish regiment.jpg|thumb|upright| Zion I want your Old New Land join Jewish regiment.jpg|thumb|A [[World War I]] recruitment poster.

It originally referred to a specific hill in Jerusalem ([[Mount Zion]]), located to the south of [[Mount Moriah]] (the Temple Mount). According to the narrative of 2 Samuel 5, Mount Zion held the [[Jebusite]] fortress of the same name that was conquered by [[David]] and was renamed the [[City of David]]. \nThat specific hill (\"mount\") is one of the many squat hills that form Jerusalem, which also includes Mount Moriah (the Temple Mount), the [[Mount of Olives]], etc. Over many centuries, until as recently as the Ottoman era, the city walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt many times in new locations, so that the particular hill known as Mount Zion is no longer inside the city wall, but its location is now just outside the portion of the Old City wall forming the southern boundary of  the Jewish Quarter of the current Old City. Most of the original City of David itself is thus also outside the current city wall.\n\nThe term ''Tzion'' came to designate the area of Davidic Jerusalem where the fortress stood, and was used as well as [[synecdoche]] for the entire city of Jerusalem; and later, when [[Solomon's Temple]] was built on the adjacent Mount Moriah (which, as a result, came to be known as the Temple Mount) the meanings of the term ''Tzion'' were further extended by [[synecdoche]] to the additional meanings of the Temple itself, the hill upon which the Temple stood, the entire city of Jerusalem, the entire biblical Land of Israel, and \"[[Jewish eschatology##.22The world to come.22|the World to Come]]\", the Jewish understanding of the [[afterlife]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of the word ''Zion'' (''\u1e63iy\u00f4n'') is uncertain.<ref name=Longmanp936>{{cite book|last1=Longman|first1=Tremper|authorlink1=Tremper Longman|last2=Enns|first2=Peter|authorlink2=Peter Enns|title=Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry & Writings: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&pg=PA936|year=2008|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1783-2|page=936}}</ref><ref name=Brileyp49>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Arnold Albert|title=The book of Psalms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq5gFlzMxQgC|year=1981|publisher=Eerdmans|isbn=978-0-551-00846-5}}</ref><ref name=Bromileyp1006>{{cite book|last=Bromiley|first=Geoffrey W.|authorlink=Geoffrey W.
