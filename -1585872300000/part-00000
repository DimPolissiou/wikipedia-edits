Hopper]] of Boston, purchased from [[Edward Burnett]] a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper's Judge), which was of a bull and terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is directly related to the original bull and terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The [[American Kennel Club]] cites Hooper's Judge as the ancestor of all true modern Boston Terriers.<ref name=\"Get to Know\">[http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boston-terrier/#standard \"Get to Know the Boston Terrier\"], 'The American Kennel Club', retrieved 19 May 2014</ref>\n\nJudge weighed about {{convert|32|lbs|kg|abbr=}}. Judge was bred to Burnett's Gyp (or Kate).''\u00a0'' Gyp was a white bulldog-type female, owned by Mr. Edward Burnett, of Southboro, MA.\u00a0She weighed about 20 pounds, was stocky and strong and had the typical blocky head now shown in Bostons.
