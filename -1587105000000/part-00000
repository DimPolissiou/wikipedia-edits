Its capital is [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] and the province is situated southeast of [[Metro Manila]], south of the province of [[Rizal province|Rizal]], west of [[Quezon]], north of [[Batangas]] and east of [[Cavite]]. Laguna hugs the southern shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.

It is also famous for attractions like [[Pagsanjan Falls]], the [[University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os]] and the [[University of the Philippines Open University]] in [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]] , the hot spring resorts of [[Calamba City|Calamba]] on the slopes of [[Mount Makiling]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] historic town plaza, Taytay Falls in [[Majayjay]], the wood carvings and ''[[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]'' created by the people of [[Paete, Laguna|Paet\u00e9]], the annual ''[[Sampaguita]] Festival'' in [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], the ''turumba'' of [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]], the ''tsinelas'' footwears from [[Liliw]], the ''Pandan Festival'' of [[Luisiana, Laguna|Luisiana]], the [[Seven Lakes of San Pablo]], and the [[Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery]] in [[Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic Era===\nThe history of the province of Laguna, and that of the [[CALABARZON|Southern Tagalog]] region, dates as far back as 900 AD. The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] is the oldest known written document found in the Philippines, which talks of its subject being released from a debt to the King of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]]. Pre-Hispanic settlement in the area can be dated to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as Pila, Laguna, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or ''Pilapil''.\n\nA prominent figure during the time of pre-Hispanic contact is [[Gat Pangil]], a chieftain in the area. The towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]] were reputed to have once been a part of his domain, although accounts vary on who exactly Gat Pangil was.\n\n===16th Century===\nThe Province of Laguna, which was formerly called ''La Laguna'' and ''La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay'', was named after [[Laguna de Bay]], the body of water that forms its northern boundary.<ref name=\"CalirayaLake\">{{cite web|title=History of Laguna|url=http://www.calirayalake.com/historylaguna.html|website=Calirayalake.com|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref> Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], the first provincial capital. Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] with a band of one hundred Spanish-Mexican soldiers conquered the province and its surrounding regions for [[Spain]] in 1571. The province of La Laguna comprised the modern province of Laguna, as well as parts of what is now known as [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] and [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]].\n\nIn 1577, the [[Franciscan]] [[missionaries]] arrived in [[Manila]], and in 1578 they started evangelizing Laguna, Morong (now [[Rizal]]), [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]] (now [[Quezon]]) and the [[Bicol Peninsula]]. [[Juan de Plasencia]] and Diego de Oropesa were the earliest Franciscans sent to these places. From 1580, the towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], Caliraya, [[Majayjay, Laguna|Majayjay]], [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]], [[Liliw]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], [[Lumban]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Siniloan]] were founded.

The most populous town at that time, [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], was capital of the province until 1688, when the seat of the provincial government was moved to Pagsanj\u00e1n. Pagsanj\u00e1n would be the provincial seat until 1858 when it was moved once again to Santa Cruz.

A detachment of British troops under Captain Thomas Backhouse entered the province in search of the silver cargo of the galleon ''Filipina'' while Francisco de San Juan led a band of volunteers that fought them in several engagements in and around the then provincial capital of Pagsanjan. Backhouse plundered the town and burned its newly reconstructed church but San Juan succeeded in escaping with the precious hoard to Pampanga where the treasure greatly bolstered the defense effort of Governor-General [[Sim\u00f3n de Anda y Salazar]]. For his actions, San Juan was made a brigade commander and ''alcalde mayor'' of Tayabas (now [[Quezon]]) province.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\n===19th Century===\nA major event in Laguna occurred in 1840, when religious intolerance led the people of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], and [[Bi\u00f1an]] to join the revolt of [[Hermano Pule]] ([[Apolinario de la Cruz]]) of [[Lucban]], Tayabas.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> This revolt was eventually crushed by Governor-General [[Marcelino de Ora\u00e1 Lecumberri]].\n\nAs part of political restructuring during the 19th century, the municipalities of [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]], [[Pililla, Rizal|Pililla]], [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], [[Baras, Rizal|Baras]], [[Binangonan]], [[Jalajala]], [[Angono]] and [[Cardona, Rizal|Cardona]] were separated from Laguna and re-organized to the province [[Distrito de Morong|Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong]]. In 1858, the provincial capital was once again moved from Pagsanjan to Santa Cruz, where it stands until today.\n\nIn 1861, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] was born in [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] to Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. Rizal would become one of the leading members of the [[Propaganda Movement]], who advocated political reforms for the colony. Rizal would go on to write two novels, ''[[Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', which in part fueled additional anti-colonial sentiment, contributing to the eventual [[Philippine Revolution]]. In 1896, thousands of inhabitants, especially of Bay, [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]], [[Nagcarlan]], [[Magdalena, Laguna|Magdalena]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], and Pagsanjan had joined the revolutionary [[Katipunan]].<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion.

The [[Battle of Mabitac]] was fought in defense of the town of [[Mabitac, Laguna|Mabitac]] and was won by Filipino forces. However, forces led by [[Henry W. Lawton]] fought and won in [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Santa Cruz]], [[Battle of Pagsanjan|Pagsanjan]], and [[Battle of Paete|Paete]], effectively securing the province for American forces. Resistance still occurred during this time. One of the province's [[folk heroes|folk hero]] during the continuing engagements was Teodoro Asedillo, who was considered a bandit by American forces.\n\nBy the end of the war, the entire country was occupied by American forces and was taken as a colony. The [[Taft Commission]] was established to govern the Philippines during the interim period, which appointed Juan Cailles as the provincial governor of Laguna. Act No. 83, or the Provincial Government Act, established a civilian government under American occupation. During this time, roads were built, schools were established, and in 1917, the [[Manila Railroad Company]] extended its line to Laguna as far as Pagsanjan.\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] (1942\u20131945), Laguna was a center of Filipino resistance despite the presence of [[Makapili]] collaborators.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\nThe establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] is a military unit organization was founded on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 in the province of Laguna, and aided of the local military regular units of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th and 42nd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 4th Constabulary Regiment.

Its capital is [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] and the province is situated southeast of [[Metro Manila]], south of the province of [[Rizal province|Rizal]], west of [[Quezon]], north of [[Batangas]] and east of [[Cavite]]. Laguna hugs the southern shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.

It is also famous for attractions like [[Pagsanjan Falls]], the [[University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os]] and the [[University of the Philippines Open University]] in [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]] , the hot spring resorts of [[Calamba City|Calamba]] on the slopes of [[Mount Makiling]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] historic town plaza, Taytay Falls in [[Majayjay]], the wood carvings and ''[[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]'' created by the people of [[Paete, Laguna|Paet\u00e9]], the annual ''[[Sampaguita]] Festival'' in [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], the ''turumba'' of [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]], the ''tsinelas'' footwears from [[Liliw]], the ''Pandan Festival'' of [[Luisiana, Laguna|Luisiana]], the [[Seven Lakes of San Pablo]], and the [[Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery]] in [[Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic Era===\nThe history of the province of Laguna, and that of the [[CALABARZON|Southern Tagalog]] region, dates as far back as 900 AD. The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] is the oldest known written document found in the Philippines, which talks of its subject being released from a debt to the King of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]]. Pre-Hispanic settlement in the area can be dated to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as Pila, Laguna, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or ''Pilapil''.\n\nA prominent figure during the time of pre-Hispanic contact is [[Gat Pangil]], a chieftain in the area. The towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]] were reputed to have once been a part of his domain, although accounts vary on who exactly Gat Pangil was.\n\n===16th Century===\nThe Province of Laguna, which was formerly called ''La Laguna'' and ''La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay'', was named after [[Laguna de Bay]], the body of water that forms its northern boundary.<ref name=\"CalirayaLake\">{{cite web|title=History of Laguna|url=http://www.calirayalake.com/historylaguna.html|website=Calirayalake.com|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref> Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], the first provincial capital. Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] with a band of one hundred Spanish-Mexican soldiers conquered the province and its surrounding regions for [[Spain]] in 1571. The province of La Laguna comprised the modern province of Laguna, as well as parts of what is now known as [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] and [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]].\n\nIn 1577, the [[Franciscan]] [[missionaries]] arrived in [[Manila]], and in 1578 they started evangelizing Laguna, Morong (now [[Rizal]]), [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]] (now [[Quezon]]) and the [[Bicol Peninsula]]. [[Juan de Plasencia]] and Diego de Oropesa were the earliest Franciscans sent to these places. From 1580, the towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], Caliraya, [[Majayjay, Laguna|Majayjay]], [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]], [[Liliw]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], [[Lumban]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Siniloan]] were founded.

The most populous town at that time, [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], was capital of the province until 1688, when the seat of the provincial government was moved to Pagsanj\u00e1n. Pagsanj\u00e1n would be the provincial seat until 1858 when it was moved once again to Santa Cruz.

A detachment of British troops under Captain Thomas Backhouse entered the province in search of the silver cargo of the galleon ''Filipina'' while Francisco de San Juan led a band of volunteers that fought them in several engagements in and around the then provincial capital of Pagsanjan. Backhouse plundered the town and burned its newly reconstructed church but San Juan succeeded in escaping with the precious hoard to Pampanga where the treasure greatly bolstered the defense effort of Governor-General [[Sim\u00f3n de Anda y Salazar]]. For his actions, San Juan was made a brigade commander and ''alcalde mayor'' of Tayabas (now [[Quezon]]) province.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\n===19th Century===\nA major event in Laguna occurred in 1840, when religious intolerance led the people of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], and [[Bi\u00f1an]] to join the revolt of [[Hermano Pule]] ([[Apolinario de la Cruz]]) of [[Lucban]], Tayabas.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> This revolt was eventually crushed by Governor-General [[Marcelino de Ora\u00e1 Lecumberri]].\n\nAs part of political restructuring during the 19th century, the municipalities of [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]], [[Pililla, Rizal|Pililla]], [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], [[Baras, Rizal|Baras]], [[Binangonan]], [[Jalajala]], [[Angono]] and [[Cardona, Rizal|Cardona]] were separated from Laguna and re-organized to the province [[Distrito de Morong|Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong]]. In 1858, the provincial capital was once again moved from Pagsanjan to Santa Cruz, where it stands until today.\n\nIn 1861, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] was born in [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] to Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. Rizal would become one of the leading members of the [[Propaganda Movement]], who advocated political reforms for the colony. Rizal would go on to write two novels, ''[[Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', which in part fueled additional anti-colonial sentiment, contributing to the eventual [[Philippine Revolution]]. In 1896, thousands of inhabitants, especially of Bay, [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]], [[Nagcarlan]], [[Magdalena, Laguna|Magdalena]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], and Pagsanjan had joined the revolutionary [[Katipunan]].<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion. Today Rizal is recognized as one of the national heroes of the Philippines.\n\n[[File:Battle of Sambat historical marker.jpg|upright|thumb|Historical marker of the [[Battle of Sambat]], Pagsanjan, Laguna]]\nLaguna was one of the eight provinces to [[Philippine Revolution|rise in revolt]] against the Spanish misrule led by Generals [[Paciano Rizal]] of Calamba, Severino Tai\u00f1o of Pagsanjan, [[Agueda Kahabagan]] of [[Calauan]], and [[Miguel Malvar]] of [[Batangas]].<ref name=\"CalirayaLake\" /> One of the early engagements of the revolution was the [[Battle of Sambat]], in Pagsanjan.

Its two delegates to the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] were Don Higino Ben\u00edtez and Don Graciano Cordero, both natives of Pagsanj\u00e1n.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\n===20th Century===\nUpon the outbreak of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Generals [[Juan Cailles]] and [[Paciano Rizal]] led the defense of Laguna during the war's early stages. The [[Battle of Mabitac]] was fought in defense of the town of [[Mabitac, Laguna|Mabitac]] and was won by Filipino forces. However, forces led by [[Henry W. Lawton]] fought and won in [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Santa Cruz]], [[Battle of Pagsanjan|Pagsanjan]], and [[Battle of Paete|Paete]], effectively securing the province for American forces. Resistance still occurred during this time. One of the province's [[folk heroes|folk hero]] during the continuing engagements was Teodoro Asedillo, who was considered a bandit by American forces.\n\nBy the end of the war, the entire country was occupied by American forces and was taken as a colony.
