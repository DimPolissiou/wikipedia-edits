Migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations, by modifying the [[allele frequencies]] (the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of a gene). High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between the two groups, increasing homogeneity. For this reason, gene flow has been thought to constrain [[speciation]] by combining the gene pools of the groups, thus preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have led to full speciation.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Evolution|volume = 61|issue = 9|pages = 2229\u20132243|last=Daniel I.

Physical barriers to gene flow are usually, but not always, natural. They may include impassable mountain ranges, oceans, or vast deserts. In some cases, they can be artificial, man-made barriers, such as the [[Great Wall of China]], which has hindered the gene flow of native plant populations.<ref name=\"pmid12634804\" /> One of these native plants, ''[[Ulmus pumila]]'', demonstrated a lower prevalence of genetic differentiation than the plants ''Vitex negundo,'' ''Ziziphus jujuba,'' ''Heteropappus hispidus,'' and ''Prunus armeniaca'' whose habitat is located on the opposite side of the [[Great Wall of China]] where ''Ulmus pumila'' grows.<ref name=\"pmid12634804\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Su H, Qu LJ, He K, Zhang Z, Wang J, Chen Z, Gu H | title = The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow? | journal = Heredity | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 212\u20139 |date=March 2003 | pmid = 12634804 | doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800237}}</ref> This is because ''Ulmus pumila'' has wind-pollination as its primary means of propagation and the latter-plants carry out pollination through insects.<ref name=\"pmid12634804\" /> Samples of the same species which grow on either side have been shown to have developed genetic differences, because there is little to no gene flow to provide recombination of the gene pools.\n\n=== Sympatric speciation ===\n\nBarriers to gene flow need not always be physical. Sympatric speciation happens when new species from the same ancestral species arise along the same range. This is often a result of a reproductive barrier. For example, two palm species of ''Howea'' found on Lord Howe Island were found to have substantially different flowering times correlated with soil preference, resulting in a reproductive barrier inhibiting gene flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Savolainen |first1=Vincent |last2=Anstett |first2=Marie-Charlotte |last3=Lexer |first3=Christian |last4=Hutton |first4=Ian |last5=Clarkson |first5=James J. |last6=Norup |first6=Maria V. |last7=Powell |first7=Martyn P. |last8=Springate |first8=David |last9=Salamin |first9=Nicolas |last10=Baker |first10=William J. |title=Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island |journal=Nature |date=8 February 2006 |volume=441 |issue=7090 |pages=210\u2013213 |doi=10.1038/nature04566 |pmid=16467788 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..210S }}</ref> Species can live in the same environment, yet show very limited gene flow due to reproductive barriers, fragmentation, specialist pollinators, or limited hybridization or hybridization yielding unfit hybrids. A cryptic species is a species that humans cannot tell is different without the use of genetics. Moreover, gene flow between hybrid and wild populations can result in loss of genetic diversity via [[genetic pollution]], [[assortative mating]] and [[outbreeding]]. In human populations, genetic differentiation can also result from [[endogamy]], due to differences in caste, ethnicity, customs and religion.\n\n== Human assisted gene-flow ==\n\n=== Genetic rescue ===\nGene flow can also be used to assist species which are threatened with extinction. When a species exist in small populations there is an increased risk of inbreeding and  greater susceptibility to loss of diversity due to drift. These populations can benefit greatly from the introduction of unrelated individuals who can increase diversity and reduce the amount of inbreeding, and thus increase overall fitness. This was demonstrated in the lab with two bottleneck strains of ''drosophila'' ''melanogaster'', in which crosses between the two populations reversed the effects of inbreeding and led to greater chances of survival in not only one generation but two.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heber |first1=Sol |last2=Briskie |first2=James V. |last3=Apiolaza |first3=Luis A. |last4=Skoulakis |first4=Efthimios M.

These phenomena can be especially detrimental for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones which can occur between island and mainland species. Interbreeding between the species can cause a 'swamping' of the rarer species' gene pool, creating hybrids that supplant the native stock. This is a direct result of evolutionary forces such as natural selection, as well as genetic drift, which lead to the increasing prevalence of advantageous traits and homogenization. The extent of this phenomenon is not always apparent from [[morphology (biology)|outward appearance]] alone.

The first is through [[habitat fragmentation]], also called urban fragmentation, in which alterations to the landscape that disrupt or fragment the habitat decrease genetic diversity. The second is called the urban facilitation model, and suggests that in some populations, gene flow is enabled by anthropogenic changes to the landscape. Urban facilitation of gene flow connects populations, reduces isolation, and increases gene flow into an area which would otherwise not have this specific genome composition.<ref name = \"test\">{{cite journal |last1=Miles |first1=Lindsay S. |last2=Rivkin |first2=L.

Altering a habitat through urbanization will cause habitat fragmentation, but could also potentially disrupt barriers and create a pathway, or corridor, that can connect two formerly separated species. The effectiveness of this depends on individual species\u2019 dispersal abilities and adaptiveness to different environments to use anthropogenic structures to travel. Human-driven [[climate change]] is another mechanism by which southern-dwelling animals might be forced northward towards cooler temperatures, where they could come into contact with other populations not previously in their range. More directly, humans are known to introduce non-native species into new environments, which could lead to [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] of similar species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crispo |first1=Erica |last2=Moore |first2=J\u00e9an-Sebastian |last3=Lee-Yaw |first3=Julie A. |last4=Gray |first4=Suzanne M. |last5=Haller |first5=Benjamin C. |title=Broken barriers: Human\u2010induced changes to gene flow and introgression in animals |journal=BioEssays |date=2011 |volume=33 |issue=7 |page=508-518 |doi=10.1002/bies.201000154}}</ref>\n\nThis urban facilitation model was tested on a human health pest, the Western black widow spider (''Latrodectus hesperus''). A study by Miles et. al collected genome-wide [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] variation data in urban and rural spider populations and found evidence for increased gene flow in urban Western black widow spiders compared to rural populations. In addition, the genome of these spiders was more similar across rural populations than it was for urban populations, suggesting increased diversity, and therefore adaptation, in the urban populations of the Western black widow spider. Phenotypically, urban spiders are larger, darker, and more aggressive, which could lead to increased survival in urban environments. These findings demonstrate support for urban facilitation, as these spiders are actually able to spread and diversify faster across urban environments than they would in a rural one. However, it is also an example of how urban facilitation, despite increasing gene flow, is not necessarily beneficial to an environment, as Western black widow spiders have highly toxic venom and therefore pose risks for human health.<ref name = \"hi\">{{cite journal |last1=Miles |first1=Lindsay J. |last2=Johnson |first2=J.

A study by Marrote et. al sequenced fourteen different [[microsatellite]] loci in bobcats across the Great Lakes region, and found that longitude affected the interaction between anthropogenic landscape alterations and bobcat population gene flow. While rising global temperatures push bobcat populations into northern territory, increased human activity also enables bobcat migration northward. The increased human activity brings increased roads and traffic, but also increases road maintenance, plowing, and snow compaction, inadvertently clearing a path for bobcats to travel by. The anthropogenic influence on bobcat migration pathways is an example of urban facilitation via opening up a corridor for gene flow. However, in the bobcat\u2019s southern range, an increase in roads and traffic is correlated with a decrease in forest cover, which hinders bobcat population gene flow through these areas. Somewhat ironically, the movement of bobcats northward is caused by human-driven global warming, but is also enabled by increased anthropogenic activity in northern ranges that make these habitats more suitable to bobcats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marrottee |first1=Robby R. |last2=Bowman |first2=Jeff |last3=Wilson |first3=Paul J. |title=Climate connectivity of the bobcat in the Great Lakes region |journal=Ecology and Evolution |date=2020 |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=2131-2144 |doi=10.1002/ece3.6049}}</ref>\n\nConsequences of urban facilitation vary from species to species. Positive effects of urban facilitation can occur when increased gene flow enables better adaptation and introduces beneficial alleles, and would ideally increase biodiversity. This has implications for conservation: for example, urban facilitation benefits an endangered species of tarantula and could help increase the population size. Negative effects would occur when increased gene flow is maladaptive and causes the loss of beneficial alleles. In the worst case scenario, this would lead to genomic extinction through a [[hybrid swarm]]. It is also important to note that in the scheme of overall ecosystem health and biodiversity, urban facilitation is not necessarily beneficial, and generally applies to urban adapter pests.<ref name=\"hi\" /> Examples of this include the previously mentioned Western black widow spider, and also the [[cane toad]], which was able to use roads by which to travel and overpopulate Australia.<ref name=\"test\" />\n\n== Gene flow between species ==\n=== Horizontal gene transfer ===\n{{Main|Horizontal gene transfer}}\n\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) refers to the transfer of genes between organisms in a manner other than traditional reproduction, either through [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] (direct uptake of genetic material by a cell from its surroundings), [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] (transfer of [[plasmid|genetic material]] between two bacterial cells in direct contact), [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] (injection of foreign DNA by a [[bacteriophage]] virus into the host cell) or [[Gene transfer agent|GTA-mediated transduction]] (transfer by a virus-like element produced by a bacterium) .<ref name=Johnston>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston C, Martin B, Fichant G, Polard P, Claverys JP | title = Bacterial transformation: distribution, shared mechanisms and divergent control | journal = Nature Reviews.

This exchange is not always clear-cut, for sometimes the hybrids may look identical to the original species phenotypically but upon testing the mtDNA it is apparent that hybridization has occurred. Differential hybridization also occurs because some traits and DNA are more readily exchanged than others, and this is a result of selective pressure or the absence thereof that allows for easier transaction. In instances in which the introduced species begins to replace the native species, the native species becomes threatened and the biodiversity is reduced, thus making this phenomenon negative rather than a positive case of gene flow that augments genetic diversity. Introgression is the replacement of the native species genes with that of the invader species. It is important to note that hybrids are generally deemed less \"fit\" than their parental generation, and as a result is a closely monitored genetic issue as the ultimate goal in conservation genetics is to maintain the genetic integrity of a species and preserve biodiversity.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Marineiguana03.jpg|thumb|[[Marine iguana]] of the [[Galapagos Islands]] evolved via allopatric speciation, through limited gene flow and geographic isolation.]]While gene flow can greatly enhance the fitness of a population, it can also have negative consequences depending on the population and the environment in which they reside.

Physical barriers to gene flow are usually, but not always, natural. They may include impassable mountain ranges, oceans, or vast deserts. In some cases, they can be artificial, man-made barriers, such as the [[Great Wall of China]], which has hindered the gene flow of native plant populations.<ref name=\"pmid12634804\" /> One of these native plants, ''[[Ulmus pumila]]'', demonstrated a lower prevalence of genetic differentiation than the plants ''Vitex negundo,'' ''Ziziphus jujuba,'' ''Heteropappus hispidus,'' and ''Prunus armeniaca'' whose habitat is located on the opposite side of the [[Great Wall of China]] where ''Ulmus pumila'' grows.<ref name=\"pmid12634804\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Su H, Qu LJ, He K, Zhang Z, Wang J, Chen Z, Gu H | title = The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow? | journal = Heredity | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 212\u20139 |date=March 2003 | pmid = 12634804 | doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800237}}</ref> This is because ''Ulmus pumila'' has wind-pollination as its primary means of propagation and the latter-plants carry out pollination through insects.<ref name=\"pmid12634804\" /> Samples of the same species which grow on either side have been shown to have developed genetic differences, because there is little to no gene flow to provide recombination of the gene pools.\n\n=== Sympatric speciation ===\n\nBarriers to gene flow need not always be physical. Sympatric speciation happens when new species from the same ancestral species arise along the same range. This is often a result of a reproductive barrier. For example, two palm species of ''Howea'' found on Lord Howe Island were found to have substantially different flowering times correlated with soil preference, resulting in a reproductive barrier inhibiting gene flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Savolainen |first1=Vincent |last2=Anstett |first2=Marie-Charlotte |last3=Lexer |first3=Christian |last4=Hutton |first4=Ian |last5=Clarkson |first5=James J. |last6=Norup |first6=Maria V. |last7=Powell |first7=Martyn P. |last8=Springate |first8=David |last9=Salamin |first9=Nicolas |last10=Baker |first10=William J. |title=Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island |journal=Nature |date=8 February 2006 |volume=441 |issue=7090 |pages=210\u2013213 |doi=10.1038/nature04566 |pmid=16467788 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..210S }}</ref> Species can live in the same environment, yet show very limited gene flow due to reproductive barriers, fragmentation, specialist pollinators, or limited hybridization or hybridization yielding unfit hybrids. A cryptic species is a species that humans cannot tell is different without the use of genetics. Moreover, gene flow between hybrid and wild populations can result in loss of genetic diversity via [[genetic pollution]], [[assortative mating]] and [[outbreeding]]. In human populations, genetic differentiation can also result from [[endogamy]], due to differences in caste, ethnicity, customs and religion.\n\n== Human assisted gene-flow ==\n\n=== Genetic rescue ===\nGene flow can also be used to assist species which are threatened with extinction. When a species exist in small populations there is an increased risk of inbreeding and  greater susceptibility to loss of diversity due to drift. These populations can benefit greatly from the introduction of unrelated individuals who can increase diversity and reduce the amount of inbreeding, and thus increase overall fitness. This was demonstrated in the lab with two bottleneck strains of ''drosophila'' ''melanogaster'', in which crosses between the two populations reversed the effects of inbreeding and led to greater chances of survival in not only one generation but two.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heber |first1=Sol |last2=Briskie |first2=James V. |last3=Apiolaza |first3=Luis A. |last4=Skoulakis |first4=Efthimios M.

These phenomena can be especially detrimental for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones which can occur between island and mainland species. Interbreeding between the species can cause a 'swamping' of the rarer species' gene pool, creating hybrids that supplant the native stock. This is a direct result of evolutionary forces such as natural selection, as well as genetic drift, which lead to the increasing prevalence of advantageous traits and homogenization. The extent of this phenomenon is not always apparent from [[morphology (biology)|outward appearance]] alone.

The first is through [[habitat fragmentation]], also called urban fragmentation, in which alterations to the landscape that disrupt or fragment the habitat decrease genetic diversity. The second is called the urban facilitation model, and suggests that in some populations, gene flow is enabled by anthropogenic changes to the landscape. Urban facilitation of gene flow connects populations, reduces isolation, and increases gene flow into an area which would otherwise not have this specific genome composition.<ref name = \"test\">{{cite journal |last1=Miles |first1=Lindsay S. |last2=Rivkin |first2=L.

Altering a habitat through urbanization will cause habitat fragmentation, but could also potentially disrupt barriers and create a pathway, or corridor, that can connect two formerly separated species. The effectiveness of this depends on individual species\u2019 dispersal abilities and adaptiveness to different environments to use anthropogenic structures to travel. Human-driven [[climate change]] is another mechanism by which southern-dwelling animals might be forced northward towards cooler temperatures, where they could come into contact with other populations not previously in their range. More directly, humans are known to introduce non-native species into new environments, which could lead to [[hybridization]] of similar species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crispo |first1=Erica |last2=Moore |first2=J\u00e9an-Sebastian |last3=Lee-Yaw |first3=Julie A. |last4=Gray |first4=Suzanne M. |last5=Haller |first5=Benjamin C. |title=Broken barriers: Human\u2010induced changes to gene flow and introgression in animals |journal=BioEssays |date=2011 |volume=33 |issue=7 |page=508-518 |doi=10.1002/bies.201000154}}</ref>\n\nThis urban facilitation model was tested on a human health pest, the Western black widow spider (''Latrodectus hesperus''). A study by Miles et. al collected genome-wide [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] variation data in urban and rural spider populations and found evidence for increased gene flow in urban Western black widow spiders compared to rural populations. In addition, the genome of these spiders was more similar across rural populations than it was for urban populations, suggesting increased diversity, and therefore adaptation, in the urban populations of the Western black widow spider. Phenotypically, urban spiders are larger, darker, and more aggressive, which could lead to increased survival in urban environments. These findings demonstrate support for urban facilitation, as these spiders are actually able to spread and diversify faster across urban environments than they would in a rural one. However, it is also an example of how urban facilitation, despite increasing gene flow, is not necessarily beneficial to an environment, as Western black widow spiders have highly toxic venom and therefore pose risks for human health.<ref name = \"hi\">{{cite journal |last1=Miles |first1=Lindsay J. |last2=Johnson |first2=J.

A study by Marrote et. al sequenced fourteen different [[microsatellite]] loci in bobcats across the Great Lakes region, and found that longitude affected the interaction between anthropogenic landscape alterations and bobcat population gene flow. While rising global temperatures push bobcat populations into northern territory, increased human activity also enables bobcat migration northward. The increased human activity brings increased roads and traffic, but also increases road maintenance, plowing, and snow compaction, inadvertently clearing a path for bobcats to travel by. The anthropogenic influence on bobcat migration pathways is an example of urban facilitation via opening up a corridor for gene flow. However, in the bobcat\u2019s southern range, an increase in roads and traffic is correlated with a decrease in forest cover, which hinders bobcat population gene flow through these areas. Somewhat ironically, the movement of bobcats northward is caused by human-driven global warming, but is also enabled by increased anthropogenic activity in northern ranges that make these habitats more suitable to bobcats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marrottee |first1=Robby R. |last2=Bowman |first2=Jeff |last3=Wilson |first3=Paul J. |title=Climate connectivity of the bobcat in the Great Lakes region |journal=Ecology and Evolution |date=2020 |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=2131-2144 |doi=10.1002/ece3.6049}}</ref>\n\nConsequences of urban facilitation vary from species to species. Positive effects of urban facilitation can occur when increased gene flow enables better adaptation and introduces beneficial alleles, and would ideally increase biodiversity. This has implications for conservation: for example, urban facilitation benefits an endangered species of tarantula and could help increase the population size. Negative effects would occur when increased gene flow is maladaptive and causes the loss of beneficial alleles. In the worst case scenario, this would lead to genomic extinction through a [[hybrid swarm]]. It is also important to note that in the scheme of overall ecosystem health and biodiversity, urban facilitation is not necessarily beneficial, and generally applies to urban adapter pests.<ref name=\"hi\" /> Examples of this include the previously mentioned Western black widow spider, and also the [[cane toad]], which was able to use roads by which to travel and overpopulate Australia.<ref name=\"test\" />\n\n== Gene flow between species ==\n=== Horizontal gene transfer ===\n{{Main|Horizontal gene transfer}}\n\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) refers to the transfer of genes between organisms in a manner other than traditional reproduction, either through [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] (direct uptake of genetic material by a cell from its surroundings), [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] (transfer of [[plasmid|genetic material]] between two bacterial cells in direct contact), [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] (injection of foreign DNA by a [[bacteriophage]] virus into the host cell) or [[Gene transfer agent|GTA-mediated transduction]] (transfer by a virus-like element produced by a bacterium) .<ref name=Johnston>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston C, Martin B, Fichant G, Polard P, Claverys JP | title = Bacterial transformation: distribution, shared mechanisms and divergent control | journal = Nature Reviews.

This exchange is not always clear-cut, for sometimes the hybrids may look identical to the original species phenotypically but upon testing the mtDNA it is apparent that hybridization has occurred. Differential hybridization also occurs because some traits and DNA are more readily exchanged than others, and this is a result of selective pressure or the absence thereof that allows for easier transaction. In instances in which the introduced species begins to replace the native species, the native species becomes threatened and the biodiversity is reduced, thus making this phenomenon negative rather than a positive case of gene flow that augments genetic diversity. Introgression is the replacement of the native species genes with that of the invader species. It is important to note that hybrids are generally deemed less \"fit\" than their parental generation, and as a result is a closely monitored genetic issue as the ultimate goal in conservation genetics is to maintain the genetic integrity of a species and preserve biodiversity.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Marineiguana03.jpg|thumb|[[Marine iguana]] of the [[Galapagos Islands]] evolved via allopatric speciation, through limited gene flow and geographic isolation.]]While gene flow can greatly enhance the fitness of a population, it can also have negative consequences depending on the population and the environment in which they reside. The effects of gene flow are context-dependent. \n\n* '''Fragmented Population:''' fragmented landscapes such as the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]] are an ideal place for [[adaptive radiation]] to occur as a result of differing geography. [[Darwin's finches]] likely experienced allopatric speciation in some part due to differing geography, but that doesn't explain why we see so many different kinds of finches on the same island. This is due to adaptive radiation, or the evolution of varying traits in light of competition for resources. Gene flow moves in the direction of what resources are abundant at a given time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Peter R.|last2=Grant|first2=B.

Due to geographic isolation gene flow between the two species was limited and differing environments caused the marine iguana to evolve in order to adapt to the island environment. For instance, they are the only iguana that has evolved the ability to swim.\n\n* '''Human Populations:''' Two theories exist for the [[human evolution]] throughout the world. The first is known as the multiregional model in which modern human variation is seen as a product of radiation of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa after which local differentiation led to the establishment of regional population as we see them now.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tobias |first1=Phillip V. |last2=Strong |first2=Valerie |last3=White |first3=Heather |title=Hominid Evolution: Past, Present, and Future : Proceedings of the Taung Diamond Jubilee International Symposium, Johannesburg and Mmabatho, Southern Africa, 27th January-4th February 1985 |date=1985 |publisher=A.R.

One example is the [[giant panda]] which is part of an international breeding program in which genetic materials are shared between zoological organizations in order to increase genetic diversity in the small populations. As a result of low reproductive success, artificial insemination with fresh/frozen-thawed sperm was developed which increased cub survival rate. A 2014 study found that high levels of genetic diversity and low levels of inbreeding were estimated in the breeding centers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Shan|first=Lei |last2=Hu|first2=Yibo|last3=Zhu |first3=Lifeng |last4=Yan |first4=Li |last5=Wang|first5=Chengdong|last6=Li |first6=Desheng|last7=Jin|first7=Xuelin |last8=Zhang |first8=Chenglin |last9=Wei|first9=Fuwen |date=2014-10-01 |title=Large-Scale Genetic Survey Provides Insights into the Captive Management and Reintroduction of Giant Pandas |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=31|issue=10 |pages=2663\u20132671 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msu210|pmid=25015646 }}</ref>\n* '''Plants:''' Two populations of [[Erythranthe|monkeyflowers]] were found to use different pollinators (bees and hummingbirds) that limited gene flow, resulting in genetic isolation, eventually producing two different species, ''[[Mimulus lewisii]]'' and ''[[Mimulus cardinalis]]'' .<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schemske|first=Douglas W.|last2=Bradshaw|first2=H.
