[[Poseidon]] is originally conceived as a [[chthonic]] god, lord and husband of the Earth (for the etymolog gearoid \u03b3\u03b1\u03b9\u03ae\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, he who possesses the Earth, \u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 he who makes the Earth quake) with an equine form. He mates with [[Demeter]] under this form in the Arcadian myth from [[Thelpusa]], they beget the racing horse [[Areion]] and the unnamed daughter of those mysteries (story in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] VIII 25, 3). \n2. Poseidon ''hippios'' (horse) is the god of Earth and as springs come from beneath the earth, this is also a metaphora (or better a figure) of the origin of life on Earth;  the horse is universally considered as having a psychopompous character and Poseidon is known as tamer of  horses (''damaios'') and father of [[Pegasus]] who with its hoof can open up a spring.\n\n3. Poseidon is the god worshipped in the main temple of the Isle of [[Atlantis]] in the myth narrated by [[Plato]] in the dialogues Timaeus and Critias; there was also a hippodrome nearby.\n\n4. The island was swallowed up by an earthquake caused by Poseidon himself. This factor would connect the power over earth and that over waters. The Greek had a memory of the explosion of the Island of [[Santorini]] and of the seaquake it provoked as well as other consequences affecting climate.</ref>  [[Salacia]] is his wife.\n\nDepictions of Neptune in Roman [[mosaic]]s, especially those of [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]], are influenced by [[Hellenistic]] conventions.<ref>Alain Cadotte, \"Neptune Africain\", ''Phoenix'' '''56'''.3/4 (Autumn/Winter 2002:330-347) detected [[Sytncretism|syncretic]] traces of a Libyan/Punic agrarian god of fresh water sources, with the epithet ''Frugifer'', \"fruit-bearer\"; Cadotte enumerated (p.332) some north African Roman mosaics of the fully characteristic ''Triumph of Neptune'', whether riding in his chariot or mounted directly on albino dolphins.</ref> Neptune was likely associated with fresh water springs before the sea.<ref>Dum\u00e9zil, ''La religion romaine archa\u00efque  (Paris, 1966:381).</ref> Like Poseidon, Neptune was worshipped by the Romans also as a god of horses, under the name ''Neptunus Equester'', a [[patron god|patron]] of horse-racing.<ref>Compare [[Epona]].</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of Latin '''Neptunus''' is unclear and disputed.<ref>Michiel de Vaan, ''Etymological Dictionary of Latin\nand the other Italic Languages'', Leiden/Boston 2004, p. 406.</ref> The ancient grammarian [[Varro]] derived the name from ''nuptus'' i.e. \"covering\" (''opertio''), with a more or less explicit allusion to the ''nuptiae'', \"marriage of Heaven and Earth\".<ref>Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 72: ''Neptunus, quod mare terras obnubuit ut nubes caelum, ab nuptu, id est opertione, ut antiqui, a quo nuptiae, nuptus dictus.'': \"N., because the sea covered the lands as the clouds the sky, from ''nuptus'' i.e. \"covering\", as the ancients (used to say), whence ''nuptiae'' marriage, was named ''nuptus''\".</ref>\n\nAmong modern scholars [[Paul Kretschmer]] proposed a derivation from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ''*neptu-'' \"moist substance\".<ref>P. Kretschmer ''Einleitung in der Geschichte der Griechischen Sprache'' G\u00f6ttingen, 1896, p. 33.</ref> Similarly Raymond Bloch supposed it might be an adjectival form in ''-no''  from ''*nuptu-'', meaning \"he who is moist\".<ref>R. Bloch \"Quelques remarques sur Poseidon, Neptunus et Nethuns\" in ''Revue de l' Histoire des Religions'' (1981), p. 347.</ref>\n\n[[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] objected that words deriving root ''*nep-'' are not attested in Indo-European languages other than [[Vedic]] and [[Avestan]]. He proposed an etymology that brings together Neptunus with the Indian and Iranean theonyms [[Apam Napat]] and Apam Nap\u00e1 as well as with the Old Irish theonym [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtan]], all meaning \"descendant of the waters\". By using the comparative approach the Indo-Iranian, Avestan and Irish figures would show common features with the Roman historicised legends about Neptune. Dum\u00e9zil thence proposed to derive the nouns from an Indo-European root ''n\u00e9p\u014dts-'', \"descendant, sister's son\".<ref>Y. Bonnefoy, W.

The Indo-European root ''*nebh-'', having the original meaning of \"damp, wet\", has given Sanskrit ''n\u0101bhah'', Hittite ''nepis'', Latin ''nubs'', ''nebula'', German ''Nebel'', Slavic ''nebo'' etc. The concept would be close to that expressed in the name of Greek god ''\u038c\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2'' (''[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]''), derived from the root ''*h<sub>2</sub>w\u00f3rso-'', \"to water, irrigate\" and ''*h<sub>2</sub>wors\u00f3-'', \"the irrigator\".<ref>H.

The district was traditionally connected to the cult of the god. [[Messapus]] and [[Halesus]], the eponymous hero of [[Falerii]], were believed to be his own sons. Messapus led the Falisci and others to war in the [[Aeneid]].<ref>Vergil ''Aeneis'', VII, p. 691: L.

''Nepet'', however, might be considered a hydronymic toponym of pre-Indo-European origin, from an appellative meaning \"damp wide valley, plain\", cognate with pre-Greek ''\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7'', \"wooded vale, chasm\".<ref>Robert S.P.

Servius the grammarian also explicitly states Neptune is in charge of all the rivers, springs and waters.

V 724; later Doctor Fowler disowned this interpretation of Salacia.</ref>\n\n===Neptunalia===\n{{Main|Neptunalia}}\nThe [[Neptunalia]] was the [[Roman festivals|festival]] of Neptune on July 23, at the height of summer. The date and the construction of tree-branch shelters<ref>''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'', vol. 1,pt 2:323; [[Varro]], ''De lingua Latina'' vi.19.</ref> suggest a primitive role for Neptune as god of water sources in the summer's drought and heat, he lor of ye east, samuskaa.<ref>\"C'est-\u00e0-dire au plus fort de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, au moment de la grande s\u00e9cheresse, et qu'on y construisaient des huttes de feuillage en guise d'abris contre le soleil\" (Cadotte 2002:342, noting [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], ''De verborum significatu'' [ed. Lindsay 1913] 519.1)</ref>\n\nThe most ancient [[Roman calendar]] set the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'' of Neptunus on July 23, two days after the [[Lucaria]] of July 19 and 21 and two days before the [[Furrinalia]] of July 25.\n\n[[Georg Wissowa]] had already remarked that festivals falling in a range of three days are complementary. [[Dum\u00e9zil]] elaborated that these festivals in some way were all  related to the importance of water during the period of summer heat (''canicula'') and drought, when river and spring waters are at their lowest.\n\nFounding his analysis on the works of [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] and [[Columella]] Dum\u00e9zil argues that while the ''Lucaria'' were devoted to the dressing of woods, clearing the undergrown bushes by cutting on the 19, then by uprooting and burning on the 21,<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ''F\u00eates romaines d' \u00e9t\u00e9 et d' automne. Suivi de Dix questions romaines'' Paris 1975 1. \"Les eaux et les bois\" p. 25-31.</ref> the Neptunalia were devoted to works of conservation and draining of superficial waters, thus corresponding to the Lucaria of 19, that required only work above the ground.\n\nThen the ''Furrinalia'' of July 25, sacred to [[Furrina]] goddess of springs and wells, were devoted to those waters which had to be captured by drilling, i.e. required the work of man, thereby corresponding to the ''Lucaria'' of 21, which equally entailed human action upon the soil.\n\nThe Furrinalia are explained by Dum\u00e9zil on the grounds of the hydraulic works prescribed by Palladius on this day, i.e. the drilling of wells to detect and capture underground water: the visible and the hidden waters are thus dealt with on separate, albeit next, occasions: the Neptunalia and Furrinalia. This complementarity between Neptunalia and Furrinalia  corresponds to that between the first and second Lucaria, forming in fact two complementary couplets.\n\nIn recorded times the Neptunalia were spent in outings under branch huts (''umbrae, casae frondeae''), in a wood between the Tiber and the [[Via Salaria]], drinking springwater and wine to escape the heat. \nIt looks the Neptunalia were a time of general, free and unrestrained merrymaking, during which men and women mixed without the usual Roman traditional social constraints.<ref>Sarolta A. Takacs ''Vestal virgins, sibyls and matronae: women in Roman religion'' 2008, University of Texas Press, p. 53 f., citing Horace  ''Carmina'' III 28.</ref> This character of the festival as well as the fact that Neptune was offered the sacrifice of a bull would point to an agricultural fertility context.<ref>Sarolta A. Takacs above; citing Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 10, 4.</ref>\n\n===Temples===\nIn Rome Neptune had only one temple. It stood near the [[Circus Flaminius]], the Roman racetrack, in the southern part of the Campus Martius. It already existed in 206 BC.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] 17 fragment 57. 60 as cited by L. Richardson jr. ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' 1992 p. 267.</ref> It appears on a coin struck by Gn.

This prodigy was believed to be relevant on the siege of [[Veii]] because a [[haruspex]] from Veii recited some lines of a prophecy that illustrated the relationship between the level of its waters and either the safety or the fall of the town to the Romans. It foretold that as long as the waters of the lake remain high Veii would be impregnable to the Romans. If the waters of the lake were scattered in an inland direction on the other hand Veii would fall; but if they were to overflow through the usual streams or channels toward the sea this fact would be unfavourable to the Romans as well.<ref>Livy V 15-16. Cicero ''De Divinatione'' I 44 ff.</ref>\nDum\u00e9zil ascribed this story to the Roman custom of projecting religious legendary heritage onto history, considering it as a festival myth, aimed at giving relevance to an exceptional event which would have happened during the Neptunalia. This legend would show the scope of the powers hidden in waters and the religious importance of their control by man: Veientans too knowing the fact had been digging channels for a long time as recent archaeological finds confirm. There is a temporal coincidence between the conjuration of the prodigy and the works of derivation recommended by Palladius and Columella at the time of the ''canicula'', when the waters are at their lowest.<ref>G.

[[Barcelona]]: Llotja de Mar.]]\n''Paredrae'' are entities who pair or accompany a god. They represent the fundamental aspects or the powers of the god with whom they are associated. In Roman religion they are often female. In later times under Hellenising influence they came to be considered as separate deities and consorts of the god.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The Religious experience of the Roman People'' London, 1912, p. 346f.</ref> However this misconception might have been widespread in earlier folk belief.<ref>Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XIII 24, 1-18.</ref> In the view of Dum\u00e9zil,<ref>Dum\u00e9zil here accepts and reproposes the interpretations of Wissowa and von Domaszewski.</ref> Neptune's two ''paredrae'' Salacia and [[Venilia]] represent the overpowering and the tranquil aspects of water, both natural and domesticated: Salacia would impersonate the gushing, overbearing waters and Venilia the still or quietly flowing waters.<ref>Dumezil above p.31</ref> Dum\u00e9zil's interpretation has though been varied as he also stated that the jolt implied by Salacia's name, the attitude to be ''salax'' lustful, must underline a feature characteristic of the god.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ''La religione romana arcaica'' Milano 1977 p. 340.</ref>\n\nSalacia and Venilia have been discussed by scholars both ancient and modern.   Varro connects the first to ''salum'', sea, and the second to ''ventus'', wind.<ref>Varro Lingua Latina V 72.</ref> Festus writes of Salacia that she is the deity that generates the motion of the sea.<ref>Festus p.    L s.v.</ref> While Venilia would cause the waves to come to the shore Salacia would cause their retreating towards the high sea.<ref>Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 22.</ref> The issue has been discussed in many passages by Christian doctor [[St. Augustine]]. He devotes one full chapter of his ''De Civitate Dei'' to mocking the inconsistencies inherent in the theological definition of the two entitites: since Salacia would denote the nether part of the sea, he wonders how could it be possible that she be also the retreating waves, as waves are a phenomenon of the surface of the sea.<ref>Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 22.</ref> Elsewhere he writes that Venilia would be the  \"hope that comes\", one of the aspects or powers of the all encompassing Jupiter understood as ''anima mundi''.<ref>Augustine above II 11.</ref>\n\nServius in his commentary to the [[Aeneid]] also writes about Salacia and Venilia in various passages, e.g. V 724: \"''([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]) dicitur et Salacia, quae proprie meretricum dea appellata est a veteribus''\": \"(Venus) is also called Salacia, who was particularly named goddess of prostitutes by the ancient\". Elsewhere he writes that Salacia and Venilia are indeed the same entity.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' London, 1912, Appendix II.</ref>\n\nAmong  modern scholars Dum\u00e9zil with his followers Bloch and Schilling centre their interpretation of Neptune on the more direct, concrete, limited value and functions of water. Accordingly, Salacia would represent the forceful and violent aspect of gushing and overflowing water, Venilia the tranquil, gentle aspect of still or slowly flowing water.\n\nPreller, Fowler, Petersmann and Tak\u00e1cs attribute to the theology of Neptune broader significance as a god of universal worldly fertility, particularly relevant to agriculture and human reproduction. Thence they interpret Salacia as personifying  lust and Venilia as related to  ''venia'', the attitude of ingraciating, attraction, connected with love and desire for reproduction. [[Ludwig Preller]] remarked a significant aspect of Venilia mentioning that she was recorded in the [[indigitamenta]] also as a deity of longing, desire. He thinks this fact would allow to explain the theonym in the same way as that of Venus.<ref>Ludwig Preller ''R\u00f6mische Mythologie'' Berlin, 1858 part II, p.121-2; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 9.</ref> Other data seem to point in the same direction: Salacia would be the parallel of [[Thetis]] as the mother of Achilles, while Venilia would be the mother of [[Turnus]] and [[Iuturna]], whom she mothered with [[Daunus]] king of the [[Rutulians]]. According  to another source Venilia would be the partner of [[Janus]], with whom she mothered the nymph [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]] loved by [[Picus]].<ref>Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 334.</ref> These mythical data underline the reproductive function envisaged in the figures of Neptune's paredrae, particularly that of Venilia in childbirth and motherhood.

Pp. 304.  {{ISBN|3-525-25231-5}}.</ref>  Developing his understanding of the theonym as  rooted in IE *nebh, he argues that the god would be an ancient deity of the cloudy and rainy sky in company with and in opposition to [[Zeus]]/[[Jupiter]], god of the clear bright sky. Similar to [[Caelus]], he would be the father of all living beings on Earth through the fertilising power of rainwater. This ''hieros gamos'' of Neptune and Earth would be reflected in literature, e.g. in Vergil ''Aen.'' V 14 ''pater Neptunus''. The virile potency of Neptune would be represented by ''Salacia'' (derived from ''salax'', ''salio'' in its original sense of salacious, lustful, desiring sexual intercourse, covering). Salacia would then represent the god's desire for intercourse with Earth, his virile generating potency manifesting itself in rainfall. While Salacia would denote the overcast sky, the other character of the god would be reflected by his other paredra ''Venilia'', representing the clear sky dotted with clouds of good weather. The theonym Venilia would be rooted in a not attested adjective *venilis, from IE root *ven(h) meaning to love, desire, realised in Sanskrit ''v\u00e1nati, van\u00f3ti'', he loves, Old Island. ''vinr'' friend, German ''Wonne'', Latin ''Venus, venia''. Reminiscences of this double aspect of Neptune would be found in [[Catullus]] 31. 3: \"''uterque Neptunus''\".<ref>Catullus 31. 3: \"Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque/ ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis/ marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus/...\": the quoted words belong to a passage in which the poet seems to be hinting to the double nature of Neptune as god both of the freshwaters and of the sea.</ref>\n\nIn Petersmann's conjecture, besides Zeus/Jupiter, (rooted in IE *dei(h) to shine, who originally represented the bright daylight of fine weather sky), the ancient Indo-Europeans venerated a god of heavenly damp or wet as the generator of life. This fact would be testified by Hittite theonyms nepi\u0161a\u0161 (D)I\u0160KURa\u0161 or nepi\u0161a\u0161 (D)Tarhunna\u0161 \"the lord of sky wet\", that was revered as the sovereign of Earth and men.<ref>Eric Neun ''Die Anitta-Text'' Wiesbaden, 1974, p. 118.</ref> Even though over time this function was transferred to Zeus/Jupiter who became also the sovereign of weather, reminiscences of the old function survived in literature: e.g. in Vergil ''Aen.'' V 13-14 reading: \"''Heu, quianam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi?/ quidve, pater Neptune, paras?''\": \"What, why have so many clouds enringed the sky? What are you preparing, father Neptune?\".<ref>H. Petersmann \"Neptuns \u00fcrsprugliche Rolle im r\u00f6mischen Pantheon.

''facem'': \"facem in nuptiis in honore Cereris praeferebant, aqua aspergebatur nova nupta...ut ignem et aquam cum viro communicaret\", p.87 L.</ref>\nTak\u00e1cs too points to the implicit sexual and fertility significance of both Salacia and Venilia on the grounds of the context of the cults of Neptune, of Varro's interpretation of Salacia as ''eager  for sexual intercourse'' and of the connexion of Venilia with a nymph or [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].\n\nM\u00fcller and Deeke had already interpreted the theology of Neptune as that of a divine ancestor of a Latin stock, namely the Faliscans, as the father of their founder heroes Messapus and Halesus. Sharing this same approach Fowler considered Salacia the personification of the virile potency that generated a Latin people, parallel with Mars, Saturn, Janus and even Jupiter among other Latins.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 126</ref>\n\n===Neptunus equestris===\nPoseidon was connected to the horse since the earliest times, well before any connection of him with the sea was attested, and may even have  originally been conceived under equine form. Such a feature is a reflection of his own chronic, violent, brutal nature as earth-quaker, as well as of the link of the horse with springs, i.e. underground water, and  the [[psychopomp]]ous character  inherent in this animal.<ref>Raymond Bloch above p. 343</ref>\n\nThere is no such direct connection in Rome. Neptune does not show any direct equine character or linkage.\n\nOn the other hand, Roman god [[Consus]] was associated with horses: his underground altar was located in the valley of the [[Circus Maximus]] at the foot of the [[Palatine]], the place of horse races. On the day of his summer festival (August 21), the ''[[Consualia]] aestiva'', it was customary to bring horses and mules in procession crowned with flowers and then hold equine races in the Circus. It appears these games had a rustic and archaic character: they marked the end of the yearly agricultural cycle, when harvest was completed.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p.</ref> According to tradition this occasion was chosen to enact the abduction of the Sabine (and Latin) women. The episode might bear a reflection of the traditional sexual licence of such occasions.<ref>William Warde Fowler above, citing James G. Frazer.</ref>  On that day the [[flamen Quirinalis]] and the [[vestal virgins]] sacrificed on the underground altar of Consus. The fact the two festivals of Consus were followed after an equal interval of four days by the two festivals of [[Ops]] ([[Opeconsivia]] on August 25 and [[Opalia]] on December 19) testifies to the strict relationship between the two deities as both pertaining to agricultural plenty, or in Dumezilian terminology to the third function. In Dum\u00e9zil's view this fact shows the radically different symbolic value of the horse in the theology of Poseidon and of Consus. Tertullian (''De Spectaculis'' V 7) states that according to Roman tradititon Consus was the god who had advised [[Romulus]] on the abduction of the Sabines because of his quality of god of hidden counsels and quotes an inscription that was on the southern ''meta'' of the circus  corroborating his assertion: ''Conso consilio Marte duello Lares + covillo potentes'': Consus is powerful in counsel, Mars in war, the Lares in meeting. A. Von Blumenthal and G. Radke have proposed to read ''consivio'' instead of ''consilio'', though this correction is not generally accepted: the inscription is not extant and it was visible only on the days of the sacrifices to Consus, so some scholars argue it may have been misread.<ref>S. Du\u0161ani\u0107, \u017d. Petkovi\u0107 \"The Flamen Quirinalis at  the Consualia and the Horseman of the Lacus Curtius\" in ''Aevum'' 2002 1. p. 63.</ref>\n\nPerhaps under the influence of Poseidon \u038a\u03c0\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 Consus, whose festival entailed horse races, was reinterpreted as ''Neptunus equestris'' and for his underground altar also identified with Poseidon \u0388\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03c7\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd. Moreover, the etymology of ''Poseidon'', understood as from ''Posis'' lord, husband and ''De'' grain or Earth, may have contributed to the identification of Consus with Neptune.<ref>Sarolta A. Takacs ''Vestal Virgins, Sybils and Matrons'' University of Texas Press 2008 p. 55-56, also citing Scullard on the influence of horse races in the identification. Bloch citing Chantraine DELG s.v. Poseidon.</ref> The archaic and arcane character of his cult, which required the unearthing of the altar, are signs of the great antiquity of this deity and of his  chthonic character. He was certainly a deity of agrarian plenty and of fertility. On the basis of Augustine (''De Civitate Dei'' IV 8 about the role of Tutilina in assuring the safety of stored grain) Dum\u00e9zil interprets its name as derived from verb ''condere'' to hide, store, as a verbal noun in -u parallel to [[Sancus]] and [[Janus]], meaning god of stored grains.<ref>Cf. the related deities of the Circus Semonia, Seia, Segetia, Tutilina: Tertullian ''De Spectaculis'' VIII 3.</ref> A direct identification of Consus with Poseidon in spite of all the data pointing to it is the fact that Poseidon is nowhere worshipped on underground shrines or altars.<ref>G. Capdeville \"Jeux athletiques et rituels de fondation\" ''Revue de l' histoire des religions''.</ref>\n\nMartianus Capella places Neptune and Consus together in region X of Heaven: it might be that he followed an already old [[interpretatio graeca]] of Consus or he might be reflecting an Etruscan idea of a chthonic Neptune which is apparent in the recommendation of the ''De Haruspicum Responso''<ref>Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'' 20. Neptunus is mentioned third after Jupiter and Saturn and before Tellus.</ref> stating the need of expiations to Neptune for the prodigy of the cracking sounds heard underground in the ''ager latiniensis''.

In the past it has been believed that the Roman theonym derived from Etruscan but more recently this view has been rejected.<ref>Bloch p. 348.  {{cite book\n | authorlink = Giuliano Bonfante\n | last = Bonfante | first =  Giuliano\n |author2=Bonfante, Larissa |authorlink2=Larissa Bonfante \n | title = The Etruscan Language: an Introduction\n | location = Manchester\n | publisher = University of Manchester Press\n | year = 2002\n | isbn = 0-7190-5540-7\n }} p. 202, {{cite book | author=De Grummond, Nancy Thomson | year=2006 | title=Etruscan Mythology, Sacred History and Legend: An Introduction | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology | isbn=1-931707-86-3}} p. 59.</ref>\n\nNethuns was certainly an important god for the Etruscans. His name is to be found on two cases of the [[Piacenza Liver]], namely case 7 on the outer rim and case 28 on the gall-bladder, (plus once in case 22 along with Tinia). This last location tallies with Pliny the Elder's testimony that the gall-bladder is sacred to Neptune.<ref>R. Bloch above; Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' XI 195</ref> Theonym Nethuns recurs eight times on columns VIII, IX and XI of the [[Liber Linteus]] (flere, flerchva Nethunsl), requiring offerings of wine.<ref>N. Thomas De Grummond ''Etruscam Myth, Sacred History and Legend'' Univ. of Pennsylvania Press 2006 p. 145</ref>\n\nOn a mirror from Tuscania (E. S. 1. 76) Nethuns is represented while talking to [[U\u015bil]] (the Sun) and [[Thesan]] (the goddess of Dawn). Nethuns is on the left hand side, sitting, holding a double ended trident in his right hand and with his left arm raised in the attitude of giving instructions, U\u015bil is standing at the centre of the picture, holding in his right hand [[Apollo|Aplu]]'s bow, and Thesan is on the right, with her right hand on U\u015bil's shoulder: both gods look intent in listening Nethuns's words. The identification of U\u015bil with Aplu (and his association with Nethuns) is further underlined by the anguiped demon holding two dolphins of the exergue below. The scene highlights the identities and association of Nethuns and Aplu (here identified as U\u015bil) as main deities of the worldly realm and the life cycle. Thesan and U\u015bil-Aplu, who has been identified with  \u015auri (Soranus Pater, the underwold Sun god) make clear the transient character of worldly life.<ref>Erika Simon \"Gods in Harmony: The Etruscan Pantheon\" in N.

Thomas DeGrummond above p.139</ref> The association of Nethuns and U\u015bil-Aplu is consistent with one version of the theory of the Etruscan Penates (see section below).\n\nIn [[Martianus Capella]]'s depiction of Heaven Neptune is located in region X along with the [[Lares|Lar]] Omnium Cunctalis (of everybody), [[Neverita]] and Consus. The presence of the Lar Omnium Cunctalis might be connected with the theology of Neptune as a god of fertility, human included, while Neverita is a theonym derived from an archaic form of [[Nereus]] and [[Nereid]], before the fall of the digamma.<ref>Ludwig Preller ''R\u00f6mische Mythologie'' Berlin, 1858, II p. 1</ref> For the relationship of Neptune with Consus see the above paragraph. Martianus's placing of Neptune is fraught with questions: according to the order of the main three gods he should be located in region II, (Jupiter is indeed in region I and Pluto in region III). However, in region II are to be found two deities related to Neptune, namely [[Fontus|Fons]] and [[Lympha]]e. [[Stephen Weinstock]] supposes that while Jupiter is present in each of the first three regions, in each one under different aspects related to the character of the region itself, Neptune should have been originally located in the second, as is testified by the presence of Fons and Lymphae, and Pluto in the third. The reason of the displacement of Neptune to region X remains unclear, but might point to a second appearance of the triads in the third quarter, which is paralleled by the location of ''Neth'' in case 7 of the Liver.<ref>G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974 2nd, Appendix; It. tr. p. 584; citing Stephen Weinstock \"Martianus Capella and the Cosmic System of the Etruscans\" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 36, 1946, p. 104 ff.; G. Capdeville \"Les dieux de Martianus Capella\" in ''Revue de l'Histoire des Religions'' 213-3, 1996, p. 280-281</ref>   It is however consistent with the collocation in the third quadrant of the deities directly related to the human world.<ref>Cf.

In another place of his work, book VI, Nigidius wrote that, according to the [[Etrusca Disciplina]], his  were one among the four ''genera'', types of [[Penates]]: of Iupiter, of Neptune, of the underworld and of mortal men. According to another tradition related  by a [[Caesius (gens)|Caesius]],<ref>It is difficult to ascertain his identity.</ref> also based on the  same source, the Etruscan Penates would be [[Fortuna]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Genius Iovialis]] and [[Pales]], this last one being the male Etruscan god (''ministrum Iovis et vilicum'', domestic and peasant of Jupiter).<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40, 1-2.</ref>\n\n==Depiction in art==\n<!--An overview of Neptune's ancient iconography goes here, perhaps?-->\nNeptune is depicted in the 7th and final movement of Gustav Holst's orchestral suite 'The Planets', subtitled 'The Mystic' as Holst described the god.\n\nThe French Department of Subaquatic Archaeological Research divers (headed by Michel L'Hour) discovered a lifesize marble statue of Neptune, in the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] River at [[Arles]]; it is dated to the early fourth century.<ref name=\"statue\">{{citation |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Divers+find+Caesar+bust+that+may+date+to+46+B.C.-a01611530816 |title=Divers find Caesar bust that may date to 46 B.C. |date=2008-05-14 |publisher=Associated Press}}</ref> The statue is one of a hundred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that the team excavated between September and October 2007.<ref name=\"statue\"/><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1955773/Julius-Caesar-bust-found-in-Rhone-River.html Henry Samuel, \"Julius Caesar bust found in Rhone River\"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''</ref>\n\nEtruscan representations of the god are rare but significative. The oldest is perhaps the carved carnelian scarab from Vulci of the 4th century BC: Nethuns kicks a rock and creates a spring. (Paris: Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Cabinet des Medailles).\n\nAnother Etruscan  gem (from the collection of Luynes, inscribed ''Nethunus'')  depicts the god making a horse spring out of the earth with a blow of his trident.<ref>[[Jacques Heurgon]] in R.

S. 1. 76). Nethuns is talking to Usil and Thesan. In the lower exergue is an anguiped demon who holds a dolphin in each hand (identification with Aplu-Apollo is clear also because U\u015bil holds a bow).

[[Poseidon]] is originally conceived as a [[chthonic]] god, lord and husband of the Earth (for the etymolog gearoid \u03b3\u03b1\u03b9\u03ae\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, he who possesses the Earth, \u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 he who makes the Earth quake) with an equine form. He mates with [[Demeter]] under this form in the Arcadian myth from [[Thelpusa]], they beget the racing horse [[Areion]] and the unnamed daughter of those mysteries (story in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] VIII 25, 3). \n2. Poseidon ''hippios'' (horse) is the god of Earth and as springs come from beneath the earth, this is also a metaphora (or better a figure) of the origin of life on Earth;  the horse is universally considered as having a psychopompous character and Poseidon is known as tamer of  horses (''damaios'') and father of [[Pegasus]] who with its hoof can open up a spring.\n\n3. Poseidon is the god worshipped in the main temple of the Isle of [[Atlantis]] in the myth narrated by [[Plato]] in the dialogues Timaeus and Critias; there was also a hippodrome nearby.\n\n4. The island was swallowed up by an earthquake caused by Poseidon himself. This factor would connect the power over earth and that over waters. The Greek had a memory of the explosion of the Island of [[Santorini]] and of the seaquake it provoked as well as other consequences affecting climate.</ref>  [[Salacia]] is his wife.\n\nDepictions of Neptune in Roman [[mosaic]]s, especially those of [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]], are influenced by [[Hellenistic]] conventions.<ref>Alain Cadotte, \"Neptune Africain\", ''Phoenix'' '''56'''.3/4 (Autumn/Winter 2002:330-347) detected [[Sytncretism|syncretic]] traces of a Libyan/Punic agrarian god of fresh water sources, with the epithet ''Frugifer'', \"fruit-bearer\"; Cadotte enumerated (p.332) some north African Roman mosaics of the fully characteristic ''Triumph of Neptune'', whether riding in his chariot or mounted directly on albino dolphins.</ref> Neptune was likely associated with fresh water springs before the sea.<ref>Dum\u00e9zil, ''La religion romaine archa\u00efque  (Paris, 1966:381).</ref> Like Poseidon, Neptune was worshipped by the Romans also as a god of horses, under the name ''Neptunus Equester'', a [[patron god|patron]] of horse-racing.<ref>Compare [[Epona]].</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of Latin '''Neptunus''' is unclear and disputed.<ref>Michiel de Vaan, ''Etymological Dictionary of Latin\nand the other Italic Languages'', Leiden/Boston 2004, p. 406.</ref> The ancient grammarian [[Varro]] derived the name from ''nuptus'' i.e. \"covering\" (''opertio''), with a more or less explicit allusion to the ''nuptiae'', \"marriage of Heaven and Earth\".<ref>Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 72: ''Neptunus, quod mare terras obnubuit ut nubes caelum, ab nuptu, id est opertione, ut antiqui, a quo nuptiae, nuptus dictus.'': \"N., because the sea covered the lands as the clouds the sky, from ''nuptus'' i.e. \"covering\", as the ancients (used to say), whence ''nuptiae'' marriage, was named ''nuptus''\".</ref>\n\nAmong modern scholars [[Paul Kretschmer]] proposed a derivation from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ''*neptu-'' \"moist substance\".<ref>P. Kretschmer ''Einleitung in der Geschichte der Griechischen Sprache'' G\u00f6ttingen, 1896, p. 33.</ref> Similarly Raymond Bloch supposed it might be an adjectival form in ''-no''  from ''*nuptu-'', meaning \"he who is moist\".<ref>R. Bloch \"Quelques remarques sur Poseidon, Neptunus et Nethuns\" in ''Revue de l' Histoire des Religions'' (1981), p. 347.</ref>\n\n[[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] objected that words deriving root ''*nep-'' are not attested in Indo-European languages other than [[Vedic]] and [[Avestan]]. He proposed an etymology that brings together Neptunus with the Indian and Iranean theonyms [[Apam Napat]] and Apam Nap\u00e1 as well as with the Old Irish theonym [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtan]], all meaning \"descendant of the waters\". By using the comparative approach the Indo-Iranian, Avestan and Irish figures would show common features with the Roman historicised legends about Neptune. Dum\u00e9zil thence proposed to derive the nouns from an Indo-European root ''n\u00e9p\u014dts-'', \"descendant, sister's son\".<ref>Y. Bonnefoy, W.

The Indo-European root ''*nebh-'', having the original meaning of \"damp, wet\", has given Sanskrit ''n\u0101bhah'', Hittite ''nepis'', Latin ''nubs'', ''nebula'', German ''Nebel'', Slavic ''nebo'' etc. The concept would be close to that expressed in the name of Greek god ''\u038c\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2'' (''[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]''), derived from the root ''*h<sub>2</sub>w\u00f3rso-'', \"to water, irrigate\" and ''*h<sub>2</sub>wors\u00f3-'', \"the irrigator\".<ref>H.

The district was traditionally connected to the cult of the god. [[Messapus]] and [[Halesus]], the eponymous hero of [[Falerii]], were believed to be his own sons. Messapus led the Falisci and others to war in the [[Aeneid]].<ref>Vergil ''Aeneis'', VII, p. 691: L.

The date and the construction of tree-branch shelters<ref>''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'', vol. 1,pt 2:323; [[Varro]], ''De lingua Latina'' vi.19.</ref> suggest a primitive role for Neptune as god of water sources in the summer's drought and heat, he lor of ye east, samuskaa.<ref>\"C'est-\u00e0-dire au plus fort de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, au moment de la grande s\u00e9cheresse, et qu'on y construisaient des huttes de feuillage en guise d'abris contre le soleil\" (Cadotte 2002:342, noting [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], ''De verborum significatu'' [ed. Lindsay 1913] 519.1)</ref>\n\nThe most ancient [[Roman calendar]] set the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'' of Neptunus on July 23, two days after the [[Lucaria]] of July 19 and 21 and two days before the [[Furrinalia]] of July 25.\n\n[[Georg Wissowa]] had already remarked that festivals falling in a range of three days are complementary. [[Dum\u00e9zil]] elaborated that these festivals in some way were all  related to the importance of water during the period of summer heat (''canicula'') and drought, when river and spring waters are at their lowest.\n\nFounding his analysis on the works of [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] and [[Columella]] Dum\u00e9zil argues that while the ''Lucaria'' were devoted to the dressing of woods, clearing the undergrown bushes by cutting on the 19, then by uprooting and burning on the 21,<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ''F\u00eates romaines d' \u00e9t\u00e9 et d' automne. Suivi de Dix questions romaines'' Paris 1975 1. \"Les eaux et les bois\" p. 25-31.</ref> the Neptunalia were devoted to works of conservation and draining of superficial waters, thus corresponding to the Lucaria of 19, that required only work above the ground.\n\nThen the ''Furrinalia'' of July 25, sacred to [[Furrina]] goddess of springs and wells, were devoted to those waters which had to be captured by drilling, i.e. required the work of man, thereby corresponding to the ''Lucaria'' of 21, which equally entailed human action upon the soil.\n\nThe Furrinalia are explained by Dum\u00e9zil on the grounds of the hydraulic works prescribed by Palladius on this day, i.e. the drilling of wells to detect and capture underground water: the visible and the hidden waters are thus dealt with on separate, albeit next, occasions: the Neptunalia and Furrinalia. This complementarity between Neptunalia and Furrinalia  corresponds to that between the first and second Lucaria, forming in fact two complementary couplets.\n\nIn recorded times the Neptunalia were spent in outings under branch huts (''umbrae, casae frondeae''), in a wood between the Tiber and the [[Via Salaria]], drinking springwater and wine to escape the heat. \nIt looks the Neptunalia were a time of general, free and unrestrained merrymaking, during which men and women mixed without the usual Roman traditional social constraints.<ref>Sarolta A. Takacs ''Vestal virgins, sibyls and matronae: women in Roman religion'' 2008, University of Texas Press, p. 53 f., citing Horace  ''Carmina'' III 28.</ref> This character of the festival as well as the fact that Neptune was offered the sacrifice of a bull would point to an agricultural fertility context.<ref>Sarolta A. Takacs above; citing Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 10, 4.</ref>\n\n===Temples===\nIn Rome Neptune had only one temple. It stood near the [[Circus Flaminius]], the Roman racetrack, in the southern part of the Campus Martius. It already existed in 206 BC.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] 17 fragment 57. 60 as cited by L.

This prodigy was believed to be relevant on the siege of [[Veii]] because a [[haruspex]] from Veii recited some lines of a prophecy that illustrated the relationship between the level of its waters and either the safety or the fall of the town to the Romans. It foretold that as long as the waters of the lake remain high Veii would be impregnable to the Romans. If the waters of the lake were scattered in an inland direction on the other hand Veii would fall; but if they were to overflow through the usual streams or channels toward the sea this fact would be unfavourable to the Romans as well.<ref>Livy V 15-16. Cicero ''De Divinatione'' I 44 ff.</ref>\nDum\u00e9zil ascribed this story to the Roman custom of projecting religious legendary heritage onto history, considering it as a festival myth, aimed at giving relevance to an exceptional event which would have happened during the Neptunalia. This legend would show the scope of the powers hidden in waters and the religious importance of their control by man: Veientans too knowing the fact had been digging channels for a long time as recent archaeological finds confirm. There is a temporal coincidence between the conjuration of the prodigy and the works of derivation recommended by Palladius and Columella at the time of the ''canicula'', when the waters are at their lowest.<ref>G.

In Roman religion they are often female. In later times under Hellenising influence they came to be considered as separate deities and consorts of the god.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The Religious experience of the Roman People'' London, 1912, p. 346f.</ref> However this misconception might have been widespread in earlier folk belief.<ref>Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XIII 24, 1-18.</ref> In the view of Dum\u00e9zil,<ref>Dum\u00e9zil here accepts and reproposes the interpretations of Wissowa and von Domaszewski.</ref> Neptune's two ''paredrae'' Salacia and [[Venilia]] represent the overpowering and the tranquil aspects of water, both natural and domesticated: Salacia would impersonate the gushing, overbearing waters and Venilia the still or quietly flowing waters.<ref>Dumezil above p.31</ref> Dum\u00e9zil's interpretation has though been varied as he also stated that the jolt implied by Salacia's name, the attitude to be ''salax'' lustful, must underline a feature characteristic of the god.<ref>G. Dum\u00e9zil ''La religione romana arcaica'' Milano 1977 p. 340.</ref>\n\nSalacia and Venilia have been discussed by scholars both ancient and modern.   Varro connects the first to ''salum'', sea, and the second to ''ventus'', wind.<ref>Varro Lingua Latina V 72.</ref> Festus writes of Salacia that she is the deity that generates the motion of the sea.<ref>Festus p.    L s.v.</ref> While Venilia would cause the waves to come to the shore Salacia would cause their retreating towards the high sea.<ref>Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 22.</ref> The issue has been discussed in many passages by Christian doctor [[St. Augustine]]. He devotes one full chapter of his ''De Civitate Dei'' to mocking the inconsistencies inherent in the theological definition of the two entitites: since Salacia would denote the nether part of the sea, he wonders how could it be possible that she be also the retreating waves, as waves are a phenomenon of the surface of the sea.<ref>Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 22.</ref> Elsewhere he writes that Venilia would be the  \"hope that comes\", one of the aspects or powers of the all encompassing Jupiter understood as ''anima mundi''.<ref>Augustine above II 11.</ref>\n\nServius in his commentary to the [[Aeneid]] also writes about Salacia and Venilia in various passages, e.g. V 724: \"''([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]) dicitur et Salacia, quae proprie meretricum dea appellata est a veteribus''\": \"(Venus) is also called Salacia, who was particularly named goddess of prostitutes by the ancient\". Elsewhere he writes that Salacia and Venilia are indeed the same entity.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' London, 1912, Appendix II.</ref>\n\nAmong  modern scholars Dum\u00e9zil with his followers Bloch and Schilling centre their interpretation of Neptune on the more direct, concrete, limited value and functions of water. Accordingly, Salacia would represent the forceful and violent aspect of gushing and overflowing water, Venilia the tranquil, gentle aspect of still or slowly flowing water.\n\nPreller, Fowler, Petersmann and Tak\u00e1cs attribute to the theology of Neptune broader significance as a god of universal worldly fertility, particularly relevant to agriculture and human reproduction. Thence they interpret Salacia as personifying  lust and Venilia as related to  ''venia'', the attitude of ingraciating, attraction, connected with love and desire for reproduction. [[Ludwig Preller]] remarked a significant aspect of Venilia mentioning that she was recorded in the [[indigitamenta]] also as a deity of longing, desire. He thinks this fact would allow to explain the theonym in the same way as that of Venus.<ref>Ludwig Preller ''R\u00f6mische Mythologie'' Berlin, 1858 part II, p.121-2; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 9.</ref> Other data seem to point in the same direction: Salacia would be the parallel of [[Thetis]] as the mother of Achilles, while Venilia would be the mother of [[Turnus]] and [[Iuturna]], whom she mothered with [[Daunus]] king of the [[Rutulians]]. According  to another source Venilia would be the partner of [[Janus]], with whom she mothered the nymph [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]] loved by [[Picus]].<ref>Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 334.</ref> These mythical data underline the reproductive function envisaged in the figures of Neptune's paredrae, particularly that of Venilia in childbirth and motherhood. A legendary king [[Venulus]] was remembered at [[Tibur]] and [[Lavinium]].<ref>Ludwig Preller above citing Servius; C. J.

Pp. 304.  {{ISBN|3-525-25231-5}}.</ref>  Developing his understanding of the theonym as  rooted in IE *nebh, he argues that the god would be an ancient deity of the cloudy and rainy sky in company with and in opposition to [[Zeus]]/[[Jupiter]], god of the clear bright sky. Similar to [[Caelus]], he would be the father of all living beings on Earth through the fertilising power of rainwater. This ''hieros gamos'' of Neptune and Earth would be reflected in literature, e.g. in Vergil ''Aen.'' V 14 ''pater Neptunus''. The virile potency of Neptune would be represented by ''Salacia'' (derived from ''salax'', ''salio'' in its original sense of salacious, lustful, desiring sexual intercourse, covering). Salacia would then represent the god's desire for intercourse with Earth, his virile generating potency manifesting itself in rainfall. While Salacia would denote the overcast sky, the other character of the god would be reflected by his other paredra ''Venilia'', representing the clear sky dotted with clouds of good weather. The theonym Venilia would be rooted in a not attested adjective *venilis, from IE root *ven(h) meaning to love, desire, realised in Sanskrit ''v\u00e1nati, van\u00f3ti'', he loves, Old Island. ''vinr'' friend, German ''Wonne'', Latin ''Venus, venia''. Reminiscences of this double aspect of Neptune would be found in [[Catullus]] 31. 3: \"''uterque Neptunus''\".<ref>Catullus 31. 3: \"Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque/ ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis/ marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus/...\": the quoted words belong to a passage in which the poet seems to be hinting to the double nature of Neptune as god both of the freshwaters and of the sea.</ref>\n\nIn Petersmann's conjecture, besides Zeus/Jupiter, (rooted in IE *dei(h) to shine, who originally represented the bright daylight of fine weather sky), the ancient Indo-Europeans venerated a god of heavenly damp or wet as the generator of life. This fact would be testified by Hittite theonyms nepi\u0161a\u0161 (D)I\u0160KURa\u0161 or nepi\u0161a\u0161 (D)Tarhunna\u0161 \"the lord of sky wet\", that was revered as the sovereign of Earth and men.<ref>Eric Neun ''Die Anitta-Text'' Wiesbaden, 1974, p. 118.</ref> Even though over time this function was transferred to Zeus/Jupiter who became also the sovereign of weather, reminiscences of the old function survived in literature: e.g. in Vergil ''Aen.'' V 13-14 reading: \"''Heu, quianam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi?/ quidve, pater Neptune, paras?''\": \"What, why have so many clouds enringed the sky? What are you preparing, father Neptune?\".<ref>H. Petersmann \"Neptuns \u00fcrsprugliche Rolle im r\u00f6mischen Pantheon.

''facem'': \"facem in nuptiis in honore Cereris praeferebant, aqua aspergebatur nova nupta...ut ignem et aquam cum viro communicaret\", p.87 L.</ref>\nTak\u00e1cs too points to the implicit sexual and fertility significance of both Salacia and Venilia on the grounds of the context of the cults of Neptune, of Varro's interpretation of Salacia as ''eager  for sexual intercourse'' and of the connexion of Venilia with a nymph or [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].\n\nM\u00fcller and Deeke had already interpreted the theology of Neptune as that of a divine ancestor of a Latin stock, namely the Faliscans, as the father of their founder heroes Messapus and Halesus. Sharing this same approach Fowler considered Salacia the personification of the virile potency that generated a Latin people, parallel with Mars, Saturn, Janus and even Jupiter among other Latins.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 126</ref>\n\n===Neptunus equestris===\nPoseidon was connected to the horse since the earliest times, well before any connection of him with the sea was attested, and may even have  originally been conceived under equine form. Such a feature is a reflection of his own chronic, violent, brutal nature as earth-quaker, as well as of the link of the horse with springs, i.e. underground water, and  the [[psychopomp]]ous character  inherent in this animal.<ref>Raymond Bloch above p. 343</ref>\n\nThere is no such direct connection in Rome. Neptune does not show any direct equine character or linkage.\n\nOn the other hand, Roman god [[Consus]] was associated with horses: his underground altar was located in the valley of the [[Circus Maximus]] at the foot of the [[Palatine]], the place of horse races. On the day of his summer festival (August 21), the ''[[Consualia]] aestiva'', it was customary to bring horses and mules in procession crowned with flowers and then hold equine races in the Circus. It appears these games had a rustic and archaic character: they marked the end of the yearly agricultural cycle, when harvest was completed.<ref>William Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p.</ref> According to tradition this occasion was chosen to enact the abduction of the Sabine (and Latin) women. The episode might bear a reflection of the traditional sexual licence of such occasions.<ref>William Warde Fowler above, citing James G. Frazer.</ref>  On that day the [[flamen Quirinalis]] and the [[vestal virgins]] sacrificed on the underground altar of Consus. The fact the two festivals of Consus were followed after an equal interval of four days by the two festivals of [[Ops]] ([[Opeconsivia]] on August 25 and [[Opalia]] on December 19) testifies to the strict relationship between the two deities as both pertaining to agricultural plenty, or in Dumezilian terminology to the third function. In Dum\u00e9zil's view this fact shows the radically different symbolic value of the horse in the theology of Poseidon and of Consus. Tertullian (''De Spectaculis'' V 7) states that according to Roman tradititon Consus was the god who had advised [[Romulus]] on the abduction of the Sabines because of his quality of god of hidden counsels and quotes an inscription that was on the southern ''meta'' of the circus  corroborating his assertion: ''Conso consilio Marte duello Lares + covillo potentes'': Consus is powerful in counsel, Mars in war, the Lares in meeting. A. Von Blumenthal and G. Radke have proposed to read ''consivio'' instead of ''consilio'', though this correction is not generally accepted: the inscription is not extant and it was visible only on the days of the sacrifices to Consus, so some scholars argue it may have been misread.<ref>S. Du\u0161ani\u0107, \u017d. Petkovi\u0107 \"The Flamen Quirinalis at  the Consualia and the Horseman of the Lacus Curtius\" in ''Aevum'' 2002 1. p. 63.</ref>\n\nPerhaps under the influence of Poseidon \u038a\u03c0\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 Consus, whose festival entailed horse races, was reinterpreted as ''Neptunus equestris'' and for his underground altar also identified with Poseidon \u0388\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03c7\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd. Moreover, the etymology of ''Poseidon'', understood as from ''Posis'' lord, husband and ''De'' grain or Earth, may have contributed to the identification of Consus with Neptune.<ref>Sarolta A. Takacs ''Vestal Virgins, Sybils and Matrons'' University of Texas Press 2008 p. 55-56, also citing Scullard on the influence of horse races in the identification. Bloch citing Chantraine DELG s.v. Poseidon.</ref> The archaic and arcane character of his cult, which required the unearthing of the altar, are signs of the great antiquity of this deity and of his  chthonic character. He was certainly a deity of agrarian plenty and of fertility. On the basis of Augustine (''De Civitate Dei'' IV 8 about the role of Tutilina in assuring the safety of stored grain) Dum\u00e9zil interprets its name as derived from verb ''condere'' to hide, store, as a verbal noun in -u parallel to [[Sancus]] and [[Janus]], meaning god of stored grains.<ref>Cf. the related deities of the Circus Semonia, Seia, Segetia, Tutilina: Tertullian ''De Spectaculis'' VIII 3.</ref> A direct identification of Consus with Poseidon in spite of all the data pointing to it is the fact that Poseidon is nowhere worshipped on underground shrines or altars.<ref>G. Capdeville \"Jeux athletiques et rituels de fondation\" ''Revue de l' histoire des religions''.</ref>\n\nMartianus Capella places Neptune and Consus together in region X of Heaven: it might be that he followed an already old [[interpretatio graeca]] of Consus or he might be reflecting an Etruscan idea of a chthonic Neptune which is apparent in the recommendation of the ''De Haruspicum Responso''<ref>Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'' 20. Neptunus is mentioned third after Jupiter and Saturn and before Tellus.</ref> stating the need of expiations to Neptune for the prodigy of the cracking sounds heard underground in the ''ager latiniensis''. Etruscans were particularly fond of horse races.<ref>R. Bloch above ; G. Capdeville \"Les dieux de Martianus Capella\" in ''Revue de l'Histoire des Religions'' 213-3, 1996, p. 282 n. 112</ref>\n\n==Neptune in Etruria==\n[[Nethuns]] is the Etruscan name of the god. In the past it has been believed that the Roman theonym derived from Etruscan but more recently this view has been rejected.<ref>Bloch p. 348.  {{cite book\n | authorlink = Giuliano Bonfante\n | last = Bonfante | first =  Giuliano\n |author2=Bonfante, Larissa |authorlink2=Larissa Bonfante \n | title = The Etruscan Language: an Introduction\n | location = Manchester\n | publisher = University of Manchester Press\n | year = 2002\n | isbn = 0-7190-5540-7\n }} p. 202, {{cite book | author=De Grummond, Nancy Thomson | year=2006 | title=Etruscan Mythology, Sacred History and Legend: An Introduction | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology | isbn=1-931707-86-3}} p. 59.</ref>\n\nNethuns was certainly an important god for the Etruscans. His name is to be found on two cases of the [[Piacenza Liver]], namely case 7 on the outer rim and case 28 on the gall-bladder, (plus once in case 22 along with Tinia). This last location tallies with Pliny the Elder's testimony that the gall-bladder is sacred to Neptune.<ref>R. Bloch above; Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' XI 195</ref> Theonym Nethuns recurs eight times on columns VIII, IX and XI of the [[Liber Linteus]] (flere, flerchva Nethunsl), requiring offerings of wine.<ref>N. Thomas De Grummond ''Etruscam Myth, Sacred History and Legend'' Univ. of Pennsylvania Press 2006 p. 145</ref>\n\nOn a mirror from Tuscania (E. S. 1. 76) Nethuns is represented while talking to [[U\u015bil]] (the Sun) and [[Thesan]] (the goddess of Dawn). Nethuns is on the left hand side, sitting, holding a double ended trident in his right hand and with his left arm raised in the attitude of giving instructions, U\u015bil is standing at the centre of the picture, holding in his right hand [[Apollo|Aplu]]'s bow, and Thesan is on the right, with her right hand on U\u015bil's shoulder: both gods look intent in listening Nethuns's words. The identification of U\u015bil with Aplu (and his association with Nethuns) is further underlined by the anguiped demon holding two dolphins of the exergue below. The scene highlights the identities and association of Nethuns and Aplu (here identified as U\u015bil) as main deities of the worldly realm and the life cycle. Thesan and U\u015bil-Aplu, who has been identified with  \u015auri (Soranus Pater, the underwold Sun god) make clear the transient character of worldly life.<ref>Erika Simon \"Gods in Harmony: The Etruscan Pantheon\" in N. Thomas De Grummond (editor) ''Etruscan Religion'' 2006 p. 48; G. Colonna \"Altari e sacelli: l'area sud di Pyrgi dop otto anni di ricerche\" ''Rendiconti della Pontificia Accademia di Archeologia''  '''64''' p. 63-115; \"Sacred Architecture and the Religion of the Etruscans\" in N. Thomas DeGrummond above p.139</ref> The association of Nethuns and U\u015bil-Aplu is consistent with one version of the theory of the Etruscan Penates (see section below).\n\nIn [[Martianus Capella]]'s depiction of Heaven Neptune is located in region X along with the [[Lares|Lar]] Omnium Cunctalis (of everybody), [[Neverita]] and Consus. The presence of the Lar Omnium Cunctalis might be connected with the theology of Neptune as a god of fertility, human included, while Neverita is a theonym derived from an archaic form of [[Nereus]] and [[Nereid]], before the fall of the digamma.<ref>Ludwig Preller ''R\u00f6mische Mythologie'' Berlin, 1858, II p. 1</ref> For the relationship of Neptune with Consus see the above paragraph. Martianus's placing of Neptune is fraught with questions: according to the order of the main three gods he should be located in region II, (Jupiter is indeed in region I and Pluto in region III). However, in region II are to be found two deities related to Neptune, namely [[Fontus|Fons]] and [[Lympha]]e. [[Stephen Weinstock]] supposes that while Jupiter is present in each of the first three regions, in each one under different aspects related to the character of the region itself, Neptune should have been originally located in the second, as is testified by the presence of Fons and Lymphae, and Pluto in the third. The reason of the displacement of Neptune to region X remains unclear, but might point to a second appearance of the triads in the third quarter, which is paralleled by the location of ''Neth'' in case 7 of the Liver.<ref>G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974 2nd, Appendix; It. tr. p. 584; citing Stephen Weinstock \"Martianus Capella and the Cosmic System of the Etruscans\" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 36, 1946, p. 104 ff.; G. Capdeville \"Les dieux de Martianus Capella\" in ''Revue de l'Histoire des Religions'' 213-3, 1996, p. 280-281</ref>   It is however consistent with the collocation in the third quadrant of the deities directly related to the human world.<ref>Cf. M. Pallottino \"Deorum sedes\"  in ''Saggi di antichit\u00e1. II. Documenti per la storia della civilt\u00e1 etrusca'' Roma 1979 p. 779-790. For a summary exposition of the content of this work the reader is referred to article [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], section Etrurian Uni note n. 201.</ref>\n\nBloch remarks the possible  chthonic character and stricter link of Nethuns with Poseidon to which would hint a series of circumstances, particularly the fact that he was among the four gods (Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune  and Tellus in order) the haruspices indicated as needing placation for the prodigy related in [[Cicero]]'s ''De haruspicum responso'' 20, i.e. a cracking sound perceived as coming from the underground in the ''ager latiniensis''.\n\n===Neptune and the Etruscan Penates===\nAmong ancient sources [[Arnobius]] provides important information about the theology of Neptune: he writes that according to [[Nigidius Figulus]] Neptune was considered one of the Etruscan [[Penates]], together with [[Apollo]], the two deities being credited with bestowing [[Troy|Ilium]] with its immortal walls. In another place of his work, book VI, Nigidius wrote that, according to the [[Etrusca Disciplina]], his  were one among the four ''genera'', types of [[Penates]]: of Iupiter, of Neptune, of the underworld and of mortal men. According to another tradition related  by a [[Caesius (gens)|Caesius]],<ref>It is difficult to ascertain his identity.</ref> also based on the  same source, the Etruscan Penates would be [[Fortuna]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Genius Iovialis]] and [[Pales]], this last one being the male Etruscan god (''ministrum Iovis et vilicum'', domestic and peasant of Jupiter).<ref>Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40, 1-2.</ref>\n\n==Depiction in art==\n<!--An overview of Neptune's ancient iconography goes here, perhaps?-->\nNeptune is depicted in the 7th and final movement of Gustav Holst's orchestral suite 'The Planets', subtitled 'The Mystic' as Holst described the god.\n\nThe French Department of Subaquatic Archaeological Research divers (headed by Michel L'Hour) discovered a lifesize marble statue of Neptune, in the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] River at [[Arles]]; it is dated to the early fourth century.<ref name=\"statue\">{{citation |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Divers+find+Caesar+bust+that+may+date+to+46+B.C.-a01611530816 |title=Divers find Caesar bust that may date to 46 B.C. |date=2008-05-14 |publisher=Associated Press}}</ref> The statue is one of a hundred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that the team excavated between September and October 2007.<ref name=\"statue\"/><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1955773/Julius-Caesar-bust-found-in-Rhone-River.html Henry Samuel, \"Julius Caesar bust found in Rhone River\"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''</ref>\n\nEtruscan representations of the god are rare but significative. The oldest is perhaps the carved carnelian scarab from Vulci of the 4th century BC: Nethuns kicks a rock and creates a spring. (Paris: Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Cabinet des Medailles).\n\nAnother Etruscan  gem (from the collection of Luynes, inscribed ''Nethunus'')  depicts the god making a horse spring out of the earth with a blow of his trident.<ref>[[Jacques Heurgon]] in R. Bloch above p. 352.</ref>\n\nA bronze mirror of the late 4th century in the Vatican Museums (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco: C.S.E. Vaticano 1.5a) depicts the god with [[Amymone]], daughter of [[Danaus]], whom he prevents being assaulted by a satyr and to whom he will teach the art of creating springs.\n\nA bronze mirror from Tuscania dated to 350 BC also in the Vatican Museums (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco E. S. 1. 76). Nethuns is talking to Usil and Thesan. In the lower exergue is an anguiped demon who holds a dolphin in each hand (identification with Aplu-Apollo is clear also because U\u015bil holds a bow). Nethuns holds a double-ended trident, suggesting he might be one of the gods who can wield lightningbolts.<ref>N.

Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. the kholokoe tribe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where the kholokoe tribe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of the kholokoe tribe.

Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as [[Phuthaditjhaba|Wetzieshoek]] was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of the Kholokoe tribe<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/1161133</ref>.\n\nLike many other tribes, the kholokoe tribe was dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of the kholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the kholokoes and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region<ref>https://www.ufs.ac.za/docs/default-source/all-documents/from-unin-to-ufs---25-years-qwaqwa-book_2014.pdf?sfvrsn=1cb5e321_2</ref>, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district<ref>https://books.google.co.za/books?id=bH1cVBzspaUC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=makgolokwe+and+qwaqwa&source=bl&ots=z2PraMVT-q&sig=ACfU3U1mO5XZF6ygrkA21lwMRGY-E-SZoA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsrcy15-noAhU9aRUIHb2dB6UQ6AEwB3oECAwQKQ#v=onepage&q=makgolokwe%20and%20qwaqwa&f=false</ref> and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Kholokoe tribe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854<ref>http://webcms.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/183/fhya_library/Theal%2C%20G.M.%20History%20of%20South%20Africa%20since%20September%201795%20vol%204.pdf</ref>.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. This is still one of the case studies about land dispossession even today, as seen in the book called The land is ours<ref>https://books.google.co.za/books?id=5g5bDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT108&lpg=PT108&dq=batlokoa+deputation&source=bl&ots=8yFAXpEcTO&sig=ACfU3U0PiLghzXzIQujd1lDTUvsQ1tCyyg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi44OXg8enoAhWUtXEKHdXMAMgQ6AEwBXoECAsQMQ#v=onepage&q=batlokoa%20deputation&f=false</ref>\n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and the Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 7000 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Kholokoes were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked the Kholokoes a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and the Kholokoes under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\n[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/9701/Appendix%201-11.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y In 1856/7 the battle of the Kholokoes under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi] and the Boers saw many of the kholokoes killed in the cave while Wetsi (Oetsi) managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of the kholokoe tribe ===\n\n[[File:Complete Makholokoe Structure-6.png|thumb|Family Tree of Kholokoe/Kgolokoe/Kgolokwe Tribe]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable kholokoe People ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

The kholokoe tribe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the [[Bantu peoples|central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD]]. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief.

The kholokoe tribe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism the kholokoe tribe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof.

The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. This is still one of the case studies about land dispossession even today, as seen in the book called The land is ours<ref>https://books.google.co.za/books?id=5g5bDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT108&lpg=PT108&dq=batlokoa+deputation&source=bl&ots=8yFAXpEcTO&sig=ACfU3U0PiLghzXzIQujd1lDTUvsQ1tCyyg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi44OXg8enoAhWUtXEKHdXMAMgQ6AEwBXoECAsQMQ#v=onepage&q=batlokoa%20deputation&f=false</ref>\n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and the Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 7000 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Kholokoes were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked the Kholokoes a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and the Kholokoes under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\n[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/9701/Appendix%201-11.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y In 1856/7 the battle of the Kholokoes under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi] and the Boers saw many of the kholokoes killed in the cave while Wetsi (Oetsi) managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of the kholokoe tribe ===\n\n[[File:Complete Makholokoe Structure-6.png|thumb|Family Tree of Kholokoe/Kgolokoe/Kgolokwe Tribe]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable kholokoe People ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him.

Keitt]] of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a \"black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy\". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that \"No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me\". Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke him for that\". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&pg=PA193|title=His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838\u201364|first1=Owen|last1=Lovejoy|first2=William Frederick|last2=Moore|first3=Jane Ann|last3=Moore|first4=Paul|last4=Simon|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Illinois|chapter=Debate on Slavery, Conducted under Hostile Conditions in Congress, 5 April 1860|pages=191\u2013200|isbn=0-252-02919-4|date=2004}}</ref>\n\n=== 24 February 1887 ===\nThe [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party's attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].\n\n=== 20 February 1902 ===\nDuring a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of \"treachery\" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On 28 February, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.\n\n=== 4 March 1985 ===\nOn the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Dornan had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a \"[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp\" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered \"I did and you are.\" The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with \"bodily harm.\" Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, \"I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know.\" Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to \"get out of my face.\" After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters \"until Dornan apologizes.\" His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, \"Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself.\" Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, \"I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, \"You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor.\" He also told reporters that \"discipline\" would ensue if \"anything like that\" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, \"Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology.\" Dornan responded, \"Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 7 June 2007 ===\nDuring the final day of the 2007 regular session of the [[Alabama State Senate]] Republican Sen.

The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n== Armenia ==\nLegislative violence has happened in Armenia.<ref>[https://news.am/eng/news/141650.html Fight breaks in Armenian parliament]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arminfo.info/full_news.php?id=27607&lang=3|title=Arminfo: Another fight occurred in the Armenian parliament: At this time RPA deputy Artashes Geghamyan and oppositionist Nikol Pashinyan met in hand-to-hand fight|website=arminfo.info|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref><ref>[https://www.rferl.org/a/armenia-female-legislator-attacked-brawl-sewage-smell-city-council/29037927.html Female Legislator Attacked In Brawl Over Yerevan Sewage Water ]</ref>\n\n== Australia ==\n===13 February 2019 ===\n[[Brian Burston]] and [[James Ashby]] have clashed in The Great Hall amid claims of sexual harassment.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/14/blood-on-the-door-24-hours-of-chaos-australian-politics Blood on the door: 24 hours of chaos in Australian politics]</ref><ref>[https://www.news24.com/World/News/police-investigate-australia-parliament-brawl-20190214 Police investigate Australia parliament brawl]</ref><ref>[https://ewn.co.za/2019/02/14/police-investigate-aussie-parliament-brawl Police investigate Aussie Parliament brawl]</ref>\n\n== Bolivia ==\n=== 27 October 2007 ===\nIn 2007 a fight broke out in the lower chamber of the national legislature of [[Bolivia]], [[Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia|the Chamber of Deputies]].

Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.\n\nThe two men had a prior history of conflict. On 30 January of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face.

After having consulted with fellow South Carolina Congressman [[Laurence Keitt]] on the situation, Brooks and Keitt decided that Sumner had the social status of a \"drunkard\" and was thus unworthy of the traditional challenge to a [[duelling|duel]]. Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, \"Let them be!\"<ref>Donald, David Herbert ''Charles Sumner and the Coming Civil War'' New York: Alfred A.

Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a \"black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy\". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that \"No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me\". Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke him for that\". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]].

As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&pg=PA193|title=His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838\u201364|first1=Owen|last1=Lovejoy|first2=William Frederick|last2=Moore|first3=Jane Ann|last3=Moore|first4=Paul|last4=Simon|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Illinois|chapter=Debate on Slavery, Conducted under Hostile Conditions in Congress, 5 April 1860|pages=191\u2013200|isbn=0-252-02919-4|date=2004}}</ref>\n\n=== 24 February 1887 ===\nThe [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party's attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].\n\n=== 20 February 1902 ===\nDuring a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of \"treachery\" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On 28 February, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.\n\n=== 4 March 1985 ===\nOn the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Dornan had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a \"[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp\" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered \"I did and you are.\" The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with \"bodily harm.\" Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, \"I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know.\" Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to \"get out of my face.\" After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters \"until Dornan apologizes.\" His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, \"Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself.\" Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, \"I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, \"You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor.\" He also told reporters that \"discipline\" would ensue if \"anything like that\" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, \"Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology.\" Dornan responded, \"Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 7 June 2007 ===\nDuring the final day of the 2007 regular session of the [[Alabama State Senate]] Republican Sen.

The bottom of each cone has a [[mirror]] and a light that assists in producing a reflection. Each angle produces a different [[hue]] which emanates from the windows, visible from the bridge, the [[Washington Metro]] and the [[Potomac River]], but in compliance with [[U.S. Coast Guard]] regulations, not allowing it to distract drivers on land or water.

The reflective and dichroic panels are clipped and bolted to the masonry window sill of the structure. The acrylic was chosen due to its sturdiness as a shatterproof, heat resistant, fire retardant product that also resists sunlight fading. Three [[fiber optic]] illumination boxes with a central [[halide]] fixture are installed with multiple fiber optic cables that serve as lighting sources for the kaleidoscopes. They are secured with [[steel]] beams and platforms, which also serve as  a rotating table for the lights.<ref name=\"Proposal\"/>\n\n==Acquisition==\n[[File:14th Street Bridge Complex 1.jpg|thumb|Position of the project on the [[14th Street Bridge (Potomac River)|14th Street Bridge]]]]\nThe Washington D.C.

The submission requirements set by the [[District of Columbia Department of Transportation|District Department of Transportation]] reflected concerns for driver safety: no additional extensions to the height of the tower or flashing lights were allowed, the artwork could not slow down traffic, and of course safety, low maintenance, and durability to the work of art were required.

The bottom of each cone has a [[mirror]] and a light that assists in producing a reflection. Each angle produces a different [[hue]] which emanates from the windows, visible from the bridge, the [[Washington Metro]] and the [[Potomac River]], but in compliance with [[U.S. Coast Guard]] regulations, not allowing it to distract drivers on land or water. Overall, the piece sends out \"thousands of glimmering colors in six directions where a drawbridge once sat.\"<ref name=\"PostBridge1\"/><ref name=\"Proposal\">{{cite web | author=Mikyoung Kim | title=Proposal: 14th Street Bridge Tenders' House. | work=Projects | publisher=DC Department of Transportation | url=http://apia.dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Publication%20Files/Projects%20and%20Planning/DDOT%20Projects/14th%20Street%20Bridge/mikyoungkim_artist-proposal.pdf | accessdate=7 Feb 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721033938/http://apia.dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Publication%20Files/Projects%20and%20Planning/DDOT%20Projects/14th%20Street%20Bridge/mikyoungkim_artist-proposal.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe kaleidoscopes consist of panels of clear and reflective [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] material. The reflective and dichroic panels are clipped and bolted to the masonry window sill of the structure. The acrylic was chosen due to its sturdiness as a shatterproof, heat resistant, fire retardant product that also resists sunlight fading. Three [[fiber optic]] illumination boxes with a central [[halide]] fixture are installed with multiple fiber optic cables that serve as lighting sources for the kaleidoscopes. They are secured with [[steel]] beams and platforms, which also serve as  a rotating table for the lights.<ref name=\"Proposal\"/>\n\n==Acquisition==\n[[File:14th Street Bridge Complex 1.jpg|thumb|Position of the project on the [[14th Street Bridge (Potomac River)|14th Street Bridge]]]]\nThe Washington D.C.

The submission requirements set by the [[District of Columbia Department of Transportation|District Department of Transportation]] reflected concerns for driver safety: no additional extensions to the height of the tower or flashing lights were allowed, the artwork could not slow down traffic, and of course safety, low maintenance, and durability to the work of art were required.
