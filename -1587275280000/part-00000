The organization runs teams that participate in several video games, including ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' and ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]''. The Thieves' ''League of Legends'' team is a [[Sports league|franchise]] team of the [[League of Legends Championship Series]] (LCS). The organization was founded in 2017 by [[Nadeshot|Matthew \"Nadeshot\" Haag]], a former OpTic Gaming [[Call of Duty]] team captain, (MLG) X Games gold medalist, and 2014 Esports Athlete of the year. It was co-founded alongside [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] owner [[Dan Gilbert]].

Other participants in the financing round include [[Marc Benioff]], [[Drew Houston]], and [[Sequoia Capital]], among others.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2018/10/23/drake-and-scooter-braun-invest-in-esports-company-100-thieves/#7c57dfac710a</ref>\n\n==History==\n===League of Legends===\n====2018 Season====\nOn November 20, 2017, 100 Thieves was accepted<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mickunas |first1=Aaron |title=Nadeshot on 100 Thieves\u2019 acceptance into the NA LCS: 'We\u2019re gonna be hyper-focused on esports, content creation, and apparel'|url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/nadeshot-100-thieves-na-lcs-franchise-slot-18867 |website=Dot Esports |publisher=Dot Esports |accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref> as a franchise organization for the [[2018 NA LCS season]]. The team signed Prolly as its head coach and Ssumday, [[Meteos (video game player)|Meteos]], Ryu, [[Cody Sun]], and [[Aphromoo]]<ref>{{cite web |title=We\u2019re proud to share that we have officially signed @Cody_Sun1.

The team placed first in the spring split [[2018_NA_LCS_season#Results|regular season]] with a 12-6 record, securing a bye to the semifinals. They ultimately finished second in the spring [[2018_NA_LCS_season#Playoffs|playoffs]], losing 0-3 to [[Team Liquid]] in the finals. \n\n100 Thieves' second-place finish qualified them for [[League of Legends Rift Rivals|Rift Rivals]] 2018, an international tournament between the top three spring teams from [[League of Legends European Championship|Europe]] and North America. The team elected to use [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] substitute player Levi in place of Meteos for the duration of the tournament. Team Liquid, 100 Thieves, and [[Echo Fox]] competed against Europe's [[Fnatic]], [[G2 Esports]], and [[Splyce]], going a combined 4-5 in the double round-robin group stage with 100 Thieves maintaining a 1-2 record after a single win against Splyce. In the best-of-five \"relay race\" finals, the team lost their game against Fnatic, contributing to North America's combined 1-3 loss to Europe. \n\nBefore the summer split, 100 Thieves traded Meteos for [[Flyquest]]'s AnDa.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regarding Meteos and our LCS roster:\n |url=https://twitter.com/100Thieves/status/1013815357360910342 |website=Twitter |accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref> Following this roster move, the team placed third in the regular season with a 10-8 record. They subsequently finished fourth in the summer playoffs, first losing 1-3 in the semifinals to Team Liquid, then losing 2-3 in the [[third place match]] to [[Team SoloMid]]. \n\nTheir consistent performance across both splits allowed 100 Thieves to qualify for the [[2018 League of Legends World Championship]] in [[South Korea]], securing a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] to [[2018_League_of_Legends_World_Championship#Group_D_2|Group D]] with Fnatic, [[Invictus Gaming]], and [[G-Rex]]. Shortly after qualifying for the world championship, they replaced Cody Sun with substitute player Rikara. 100 Thieves finished third in their group with a 2-4 record and in the 9th-12th bracket overall, thus failing reach the knock-out stage.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2020/03/04/100-thieves-wants-untapped-league-legends-talent-theyre-signing-high-schoolers/</ref>\n\n====2019 Season====\nIn 2019, player Ssumday's contract was extended, while Ryu was relegated to an assistant position. Cody Sun and Rikara opted to leave the team at this point and they were replaced by players Huhi and Bang. Having many internal issues, Huhi moved to the 100 Thieves Academy roster, replacing Soligo, even though the team placed last in the spring regular season. Before the summer season started, Huhi left the team. A new addition, Amazing, joined the team to replace AnDa who reluctantly joins the Academy roster, while Ryu is moved to the Academy roster as the mid-laner. A month into the summer season, the team replaced Ssumday and Soligo with FakeGod and Ryu from the Academy roster. They ultimately finished the summer season in 8th place.\n\n====2020 Season====\nThe team started the season with PapaSmithy, joining the team as the new general manager. Zikz was the next addition to the roster, replacing Prolly as head coach. Meteos and Cody Sun rejoined the team for the second time, alongside additions Stunt and Ryoma. Ryu, Amazing, Bang and Aphromoo all left the team, with FakeGod rejoining Academy and Ssumday rejoining the main roster.\n\n===Counter-Strike: Global Offensive===\n====2017/2018 Season====\nIn December 2017, 100 Thieves announced that they signed the former roster of [[Immortals_(esports)|Immortals]]. The organization had issues with visas and a particular player, resulting in the team being disbanded.\n====2019/2020 Season====\nIn late October 2019, 100 Thieves announced the signing of the former [[Renegades (esports)|Renegades]] roster. At IEM Beijing 2019, the team placed second in the tournament, losing to [[Astralis]]. The team placed 7th-8th at the ESL Season 10 Pro League Finals, losing to [[Fnatic]].\n\n===Call of Duty===\nThe team started the season off signing the team of Kenny, Fero, Octane, Slasher, and Enable. They placed 9th-12th at CWL Las Vegas 2019, qualifying for the Pro League Qualifiers and the team qualified easily for the Pro League. After this, they had to re-evaluate the roster, and loan Priestahh and head coach Crowder from FaZe Clan, with Fero getting benched. At CWL Fort Worth 2019, the team was very close to winning the tournament, but because of a health issue involving Priestahh, he was sent to the hospital and replaced by Fero and the team ultimately finished 4th, losing to Team Reciprocity. At CWL London 2019, the team won the organization's first trophy. At CWL Anaheim 2019, the team won the organization's second trophy. After a long season of the Pro League, 100 Thieves finished second in Division B, qualifying for Pro League playoffs. At the Pro League Playoffs, the team placed 5th-6th, losing to [[Gen.G esports]].

Cody Sun and Rikara opted to leave the team at this point and they were replaced by players Huhi and Bang. Having many internal issues, Huhi moved to the 100 Thieves Academy roster, replacing Soligo, even though the team placed last in the spring regular season.

A new addition, Amazing, joined the team to replace AnDa who reluctantly joins the Academy roster, while Ryu is moved to the Academy roster as the mid-laner.

Denoting this number by <math>W</math>, the goal of the problem is to change <math>W</math> from 1 to 0, i.e. by <math>-1</math>. The problem is insoluble because any move changes <math>W</math> by an even number. Since a move inverts two cups and each inversion changes <math>W</math> by <math>+1</math> (if the cup was the right way up) or <math>-1</math> (otherwise), a move changes <math>W</math> by the sum of two odd numbers, which is even, completing the proof.\n\nAnother way of looking is that at the start 2 cups are in the \"right\" orientation and 1 is \"wrong\". Changing 1 right cup and 1 wrong cup, the situation remains the same. Changing 2 right cups results in a situation with 3 wrong cups, after which the next move restores the original status of 1 wrong cup. Thus, any number of moves results in a situation either with 3 wrongs or with 1 wrong, and never with 0 wrongs.\n\nMore generally, this argument shows that for any number of cups, it is impossible to reduce <math>W</math> to 0 if it is initially odd. On the other hand, if <math>W</math> is even, inverting cups two at a time will eventually result in <math>W</math> equaling 0.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Water pouring puzzle]] an unrelated puzzle, typically using three cups or glasses of water\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite web|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=Can you solve the Three Cups Problem?|url=http://education.abc.net.au/home#!/media/2977513/can-you-solve-the-three-cups-problem-|website=ABC Education}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of impossible puzzles]]\n*[[Puzzle]]\n*[[Recreational mathematics]]\n\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Unsolvable puzzles]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Threecups unsolvable.jpg|thumb|The standard, unsolvable, arrangement of the three cups.
