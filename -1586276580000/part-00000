In Italy, a series of measures were taken to eliminate the negative effects of the industrial revolution.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Compared to other European countries, Italian socialism spread in the right conditions for a struggling and an impoverished Italian people to willingly engage with, understand, and accept the core spirit of socialism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Biennio Rosso===\nBiennio Rosso was a two-year period between 1919 and 1920. After the First World War, it had a great impact on Italian and European socialism, and there were a great number of intense social conflicts in Italy during that time.<ref name=\":1\" /> During this period, conflicts between reformists and communist wings of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) occurred.<ref name=\":0\" /> By late 1920, there were divisions in Italian socialism between revolutionaries and reformists. Officially, the PSI held neutral attitudes and upheld its famous \u2018neither support nor sabotage\u2019 policy.\n\nHowever, the PSI divided into three main groups with different political positions: [[Reformist socialism|reformist]], communist, and [[Maximalist Italian Socialist Party|maximalist]].<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout 1918\u20131919, working-class unrest had increased steadily in Italy.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Italian-Socialist-Party|title=Italian Socialist Party|last=Encyclopedia Britannica|date=September 2015}}</ref> Due to the impact of the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Comintern, Italian workers lacked trust in their political representatives and wanted to establish a union that represented themselves. This trend was commonly regarded as the rise of mass power and inspired a tendency towards radicalism.\n\n=== Peasant strike ===\n[[File:Peasant_strike.jpg|thumb|The symbol of peasant]]\nAnother important event in Italy's socialist history was the peasant strike in southern Italy. Peasants formed a defensive union against government forces to advocate for their rights. The union attacked every sign and symbol of the government. Peasants intended to voice their grievances,<ref name=\":1\" /> so they turned to \u201cState\u201d socialists and labor leaders to campaign and legislate fair and equal treatment. In the end, the government gave up its original plan and formed a truce with the peasants.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Italy/Political-process#ref318132|title=Italy Political process|last=Encyclopedia Britannica|date=n.d.}}</ref> However, a man named Spriano had a differing view. He believed that the unions should have negotiations with the government to resolve the conflicts peacefully and legally.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nThis peasant strike was considered an important movement because it allowed people to recognize the possibilities of direct action and it represented the beginning of the struggle for collective power.<ref name=\":6\" /> The possibility of violent action was magnified during this stage and the potential of further violent insurrections across Italy, received mass support across other Western European states.\n\n===Development===\nSince the First World War, the political and religious climate had changed to a large extent. After previous political movements, socialists began to pay more attention to different types of radical experiments and manifestation.<ref name=\":2\"/> Through continuous education and experience, socialists tried to create more effective reform programs or foment revolutions whether through direct or indirect action. The necessity of powerful and independent socialist movements was widely acknowledged among researchers of socialism. Also, the importance of revolutionary tactics and violence proved to be effective.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nSocialists took great efforts to establish nationwide political organizations that were desperately needed in the early ages of development, with the assistance of local people. Through protracted and unremitting efforts, socialists gained support from a majority of industrial workers and had their greatest strength in industrial areas.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAfter a long period of development, there were still several long-standing difficulties that existed in poor social conditions since World War II.

However, socialists were convinced that with great patience and effort, they could start to tackle some of these issues.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Political parties ==\nItalian socialism divided into two major parties, the Partito Socialista Italiano (PSI), led by Pietro Nenni, and Democratico Italiano, led by Giuseppe Saragat. Both of them faced a series of problems for democratic socialism, especially the absence of a powerful and independent socialist movement after World War II.\n\n=== Italian Socialist Party ===\n{{main|Italian Socialist Party}}\nThe [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), also known as the Italian Workers\u2019 Party,<ref name=\":7\" /> was founded in 1892 in Genoa. It was introduced to the socialist world under the brand of the Italian Socialist Party in 1893. Later in 1988, the PSI took the name the \"Italian Democratic Socialists\" (Socialisti Democratici Italiani, SDI), and then in 1994, it was transformed into the Italian Socialists (Socialisti Italiani, SI).<ref name=\":3\" /> As a modern democratic organization, PSI used different tactics such as trade unions, socialist circles, and cooperative organizations to broaden its national influence.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the PSI had financial challenges due to its unfavorable political statements.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=The Organization of Political Parties in Southern Europe|last=Luciano Bardi; Piero Ignazi|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The Communists Third International and the reformist Socialist Workers International disagreed with the PSI's belief structure, which prevented PSI from obtaining much-needed financial aid from them.\n\nFrom 1900\u20131920, the party's left wing (maximalists) fought over leadership with the reformists (led by Filippo Turati).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Socialism|last=Lamb|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=182}}</ref> The most serious conflicts between reformist and revolutionary socialists in Italy happened during the Biennio Rosso (1919-1920).

Before the early 1990s, the PSI had a long-term partnership with centrist coalition governments.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, due to several political corruption and financial scandals during the 1994 elections, the PSI lost the controlling position in government and became a minor party.\n\n=== Modern Italian Socialist Party ===\n{{main|Italian Socialist Party (2007)}}\nThe modern Italian socialist party was founded in 2007\u20132008, following the merger of the following poarties: the Italian Democratic Socialists, the New Italian Socialist Party, The Italian Socialists, Democracy and Socialism.

In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Italy was still a relatively backward country, with deep economic differences between the north and south. Due to slow economic development and a late industrialization process, the time of Italian Catholic and socialist connection was later than their other European counterparts,<ref name=\":1\" /> and socialists had missed many opportunities to establish a socialist state in Italy with the support of Catholics.\n\nFather Carlo Maria Curcie, who was the first man who tried to tackle the challenges caused by socialism as a Catholic, made great contributions to peaceful communications between Christian and socialist groups.<ref name=\":4\" /> He studied the origins of the Church and tried to conclude that Christian ethics were compatible with the spiritual core of socialism. In his opinion, Christianity and socialism should consider the possibility of exchanging cultural and political proposals,<ref name=\":0\" /> and working simultaneously for political and religious innovation.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the PSI<ref name=\":3\" /> desired collaboration with the Christian Democrats and the communists. Initially, the socialists' bargaining power was limited, so they had to cope with Christian Democrats to guarantee Italy's govern ability. A growing number of socialists understood the necessity of communications with Catholics, and tried to find an appropriate track to have an alliance with them.<ref name=\":2\" /> They reached a consensus on the opinion that establishing an alliance between two authoritarian organizations was an effective solution to improve the dilapidated social conditions.<ref name=\":0\" /> From 1945 to 1947 Communists, Socialists, and Christian Democrats shared the responsibilities of power,<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Italy: A Difficult Democracy: A Survey of Italian Politics|last=Wieser|first=Theodor|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=30 April 1986|isbn=|location=|pages=68, 80}}</ref> while they also strengthened their own positions during the period of collaboration. Christian Democracy built power centers in every area in Italy, from urban to rural, rich to poor. Meanwhile, socialism and social democracy mainly focused on the northern areas and the south of Rome. But in 1963, the PSI joined a Christian Democratic government.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Renewing Italian Socialism: Nenni to Craxi|last=DiScala|first=Spencer|publisher=|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Influences on Italy==\nBakunin, who was the first man in Italy to explore socialism,<ref name=\":1\" /> is regarded as one of the greatest leaders of the worldwide movement of today. His work has deeply influenced Italy and the rest of the world, and his teaching has helped Italians understand anarchism, which originated in Germany with Marx. His activities also motivated other people to fight for their rights, especially the working classes. They felt an urgent desire to form an open, free, and democratic socialist organization, which could contribute to the development of democratic processes in Italy.<ref name=\":6\" /> Moreover, his beliefs brought to light more challenges to the capitalist system than ever before.\n\nFollowing previous pioneers\u2019 action, a great number of socialists were effective in breaking social barriers and reforming societies for a better future.<ref name=\":5\" /> They used trade unions, co-operative societies, and parties to progress the labor movement.<ref name=\":10\" /> The socialist parties produced radical political and economic reform to solve the problems of contemporary society. Finally, they achieved their goal of a radical transformation of society. Moreover, they contributed to Italy's economic and social modernization,<ref name=\":6\" /> and succeeded in solidifying socialism's social and geographical bases. More and more young socialists engaged in political movements to strengthen the next generation's faith in social democracy, which prepared them for modern society.<ref name=\":0\" /> They supported legislation for land reform, divorce, education, and similar measures that could modernize society.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Modern Italian Social Theory: Ideology and Politics from Pareto to the Present|last=Bellamy|first=Richard|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> These unexpected and dramatic developments not only developed socialism in Italy but also stimulated the political efficiency of Italian democratic process.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, the speed of socialist development largely depended on the level of local development.

The [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) was one of the first modern democratic organizations in Italy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Walter, K|date=1907|title=Socialism in Italy|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/57c3696bb2871e06/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2316|journal=The Economic Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> As a main political party in twentieth-century Italy, the PSI not only significantly influenced Italy's development, but also contributed to the democratic process on a national scale.\n\n==History==\nDue to the economic and social struggles at the beginning of the twentieth century, socialist ideas were widely accepted by the Italian working-class population during this time.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/328119/460827/churchsaresella1.pdf|title=Christianity and Socialism in Italy in the Early Twentieth Century|last=Saresella|first=Daniela|date=September 2015}}</ref> National industrial systems were established to bring attention to problems in different areas, such as the wealth gap, widespread unemployment, and environmental pollution. In Italy, a series of measures were taken to eliminate the negative effects of the industrial revolution.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Compared to other European countries, Italian socialism spread in the right conditions for a struggling and an impoverished Italian people to willingly engage with, understand, and accept the core spirit of socialism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Biennio Rosso===\nBiennio Rosso was a two-year period between 1919 and 1920. After the First World War, it had a great impact on Italian and European socialism, and there were a great number of intense social conflicts in Italy during that time.<ref name=\":1\" /> During this period, conflicts between reformists and communist wings of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) occurred.<ref name=\":0\" /> By late 1920, there were divisions in Italian socialism between revolutionaries and reformists. Officially, the PSI held neutral attitudes and upheld its famous \u2018neither support nor sabotage\u2019 policy.\n\nHowever, the PSI divided into three main groups with different political positions: [[Reformist socialism|reformist]], communist, and [[Maximalist Italian Socialist Party|maximalist]].<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout 1918\u20131919, working-class unrest had increased steadily in Italy.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Italian-Socialist-Party|title=Italian Socialist Party|last=Encyclopedia Britannica|date=September 2015}}</ref> Due to the impact of the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Comintern, Italian workers lacked trust in their political representatives and wanted to establish a union that represented themselves. This trend was commonly regarded as the rise of mass power and inspired a tendency towards radicalism.\n\n=== Peasant strike ===\n[[File:Peasant_strike.jpg|thumb|The symbol of peasant]]\nAnother important event in Italy's socialist history was the peasant strike in southern Italy. Peasants formed a defensive union against government forces to advocate for their rights. The union attacked every sign and symbol of the government. Peasants intended to voice their grievances,<ref name=\":1\" /> so they turned to \u201cState\u201d socialists and labor leaders to campaign and legislate fair and equal treatment. In the end, the government gave up its original plan and formed a truce with the peasants.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Italy/Political-process#ref318132|title=Italy Political process|last=Encyclopedia Britannica|date=n.d.}}</ref> However, a man named Spriano had a differing view. He believed that the unions should have negotiations with the government to resolve the conflicts peacefully and legally.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nThis peasant strike was considered an important movement because it allowed people to recognize the possibilities of direct action and it represented the beginning of the struggle for collective power.<ref name=\":6\" /> The possibility of violent action was magnified during this stage and the potential of further violent insurrections across Italy, received mass support across other Western European states.\n\n===Development===\nSince the First World War, the political and religious climate had changed to a large extent. After previous political movements, socialists began to pay more attention to different types of radical experiments and manifestation.<ref name=\":2\"/> Through continuous education and experience, socialists tried to create more effective reform programs or foment revolutions whether through direct or indirect action. The necessity of powerful and independent socialist movements was widely acknowledged among researchers of socialism. Also, the importance of revolutionary tactics and violence proved to be effective.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nSocialists took great efforts to establish nationwide political organizations that were desperately needed in the early ages of development, with the assistance of local people. Through protracted and unremitting efforts, socialists gained support from a majority of industrial workers and had their greatest strength in industrial areas.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAfter a long period of development, there were still several long-standing difficulties that existed in poor social conditions since World War II. Meanwhile, social problems caused by the emergence of capitalism were increasingly serious.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Raphael|first=Zariski|date=May 1956|title=Problems and Prospects of Democratic Socialism in France and Italy|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=18|issue=2|pages=254\u2013280|jstor=2126984|doi=10.2307/2126984}}</ref> Therefore, faced with these insoluble difficulties, socialists in Italy could hardly find a short-term solution in contemporary society to solve them. However, socialists were convinced that with great patience and effort, they could start to tackle some of these issues.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Political parties ==\nItalian socialism divided into two major parties, the Partito Socialista Italiano (PSI), led by Pietro Nenni, and Democratico Italiano, led by Giuseppe Saragat. Both of them faced a series of problems for democratic socialism, especially the absence of a powerful and independent socialist movement after World War II.\n\n=== Italian Socialist Party ===\n{{main|Italian Socialist Party}}\nThe [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), also known as the Italian Workers\u2019 Party,<ref name=\":7\" /> was founded in 1892 in Genoa. It was introduced to the socialist world under the brand of the Italian Socialist Party in 1893. Later in 1988, the PSI took the name the \"Italian Democratic Socialists\" (Socialisti Democratici Italiani, SDI), and then in 1994, it was transformed into the Italian Socialists (Socialisti Italiani, SI).<ref name=\":3\" /> As a modern democratic organization, PSI used different tactics such as trade unions, socialist circles, and cooperative organizations to broaden its national influence.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the PSI had financial challenges due to its unfavorable political statements.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=The Organization of Political Parties in Southern Europe|last=Luciano Bardi; Piero Ignazi|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The Communists Third International and the reformist Socialist Workers International disagreed with the PSI's belief structure, which prevented PSI from obtaining much-needed financial aid from them.\n\nFrom 1900-1920, the party's left wing (maximalists) fought over leadership with the reformists (led by Filippo Turati).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Socialism|last=Lamb|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=182}}</ref> The most serious conflicts between reformist and revolutionary socialists in Italy happened during the Biennio Rosso (1919-1920). However, in 1934, the PSI established an alliance with the communists and it gradually cooperated with conservative reformists, revolutionaries, and syndicalists.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1983, Bettino Craxi took a significant role in Italian socialist history.<ref name=\":0\" /> His first government (1983\u20131986) was active in the political arena for a long time, and he cooperated with the PSI to stabilize the political situation. Before the early 1990s, the PSI had a long-term partnership with centrist coalition governments.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, due to several political corruption and financial scandals during the 1994 elections, the PSI lost the controlling position in government and became a minor party.\n\n=== Modern Italian Socialist Party ===\n{{main|Italian Socialist Party (2007)}}\nThe modern Italian socialist party was founded in 2007\u20132008, following the merger of the following poarties: the Italian Democratic Socialists, the New Italian Socialist Party, The Italian Socialists, Democracy and Socialism.

In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Italy was still a relatively backward country, with deep economic differences between the north and south. Due to slow economic development and a late industrialization process, the time of Italian Catholic and socialist connection was later than their other European counterparts,<ref name=\":1\" /> and socialists had missed many opportunities to establish a socialist state in Italy with the support of Catholics.\n\nFather Carlo Maria Curcie, who was the first man who tried to tackle the challenges caused by socialism as a Catholic, made great contributions to peaceful communications between Christian and socialist groups.<ref name=\":4\" /> He studied the origins of the Church and tried to conclude that Christian ethics were compatible with the spiritual core of socialism. In his opinion, Christianity and socialism should consider the possibility of exchanging cultural and political proposals,<ref name=\":0\" /> and working simultaneously for political and religious innovation.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the PSI<ref name=\":3\" /> desired collaboration with the Christian Democrats and the communists. Initially, the socialists' bargaining power was limited, so they had to cope with Christian Democrats to guarantee Italy's govern ability. A growing number of socialists understood the necessity of communications with Catholics, and tried to find an appropriate track to have an alliance with them.<ref name=\":2\" /> They reached a consensus on the opinion that establishing an alliance between two authoritarian organizations was an effective solution to improve the dilapidated social conditions.<ref name=\":0\" /> From 1945 to 1947 Communists, Socialists, and Christian Democrats shared the responsibilities of power,<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Italy: A Difficult Democracy: A Survey of Italian Politics|last=Wieser|first=Theodor|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=30 April 1986|isbn=|location=|pages=68, 80}}</ref> while they also strengthened their own positions during the period of collaboration. Christian Democracy built power centers in every area in Italy, from urban to rural, rich to poor. Meanwhile, socialism and social democracy mainly focused on the northern areas and the south of Rome. But in 1963, the PSI joined a Christian Democratic government.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Renewing Italian Socialism: Nenni to Craxi|last=DiScala|first=Spencer|publisher=|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Influences on Italy==\nBakunin, who was the first man in Italy to explore socialism,<ref name=\":1\" /> is regarded as one of the greatest leaders of the worldwide movement of today. His work has deeply influenced Italy and the rest of the world, and his teaching has helped Italians understand anarchism, which originated in Germany with Marx. His activities also motivated other people to fight for their rights, especially the working classes. They felt an urgent desire to form an open, free, and democratic socialist organization, which could contribute to the development of democratic processes in Italy.<ref name=\":6\" /> Moreover, his beliefs brought to light more challenges to the capitalist system than ever before.\n\nFollowing previous pioneers\u2019 action, a great number of socialists were effective in breaking social barriers and reforming societies for a better future.<ref name=\":5\" /> They used trade unions, co-operative societies, and parties to progress the labor movement.<ref name=\":10\" /> The socialist parties produced radical political and economic reform to solve the problems of contemporary society. Finally, they achieved their goal of a radical transformation of society. Moreover, they contributed to Italy's economic and social modernization,<ref name=\":6\" /> and succeeded in solidifying socialism's social and geographical bases. More and more young socialists engaged in political movements to strengthen the next generation's faith in social democracy, which prepared them for modern society.<ref name=\":0\" /> They supported legislation for land reform, divorce, education, and similar measures that could modernize society.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Modern Italian Social Theory: Ideology and Politics from Pareto to the Present|last=Bellamy|first=Richard|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> These unexpected and dramatic developments not only developed socialism in Italy but also stimulated the political efficiency of Italian democratic process.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, the speed of socialist development largely depended on the level of local development. In the big cities of northern and central Italy or in economically developed agricultural areas, socialism was more widely spread than in southern Italy or underdeveloped areas.<ref name=\":7\" /> Lack of education and poverty created inevitable barriers for lower-class people to participate in the movement.\n\nAlthough some views of socialism and democracy that developed in the Biennio Rosso were ahead of that time, the approach to democracy and the transition from capitalism to socialism are increasingly more meaningful in contemporary debates on socialist strategy.<ref name=\":4\" /> By meeting and exchanging views, socialists could adopt innovative strategies towards greater social justice<ref name=\":0\" /> to help deprived and underprivileged members of the community. Italian socialism consistently makes connections with the whole nature of humankind and give tens of thousands of Italians a sense of participation in the political process.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

The school was created in 1968 as an add-on to the other high schools in Livonia in response to the population boom that the city saw at the time.  The first school year (1968\u201369), a sophomore class attended classes at nearby [[Franklin High School (Livonia, Michigan)|Franklin High School]].  Beginning in the 1969\u201370 school year, classes were then held in the new building with a junior and sophomore class.  The first graduating class graduated in June 1971.  The school is home to the MSC (Math, Science, and Computers) program as well as the Creative and Performing Arts program (CAPA). It also has a wide variety of athletics. The Girls' Cross-Country team finished second in the state of Michigan in 2006, and the Girls' Varsity Volleyball team won the 2007 state championship.<ref>[http://www.mhsaa.com/sports/vb/07reg.html 2007 MHSAA Volleyball Regionals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Livonia Career Technical Center is across the street, providing all Livonia Public School students the opportunity to engage in many hands-on activities.\n\n==Math, Science, and Computer program==\nThe Livonia Public School District provides magnet programs for the academically talented student, in grade 9 through grade 12. The magnet programs offer students the opportunity to experience an appropriately accelerated, integrated curriculum in an enriched environment with their intellectual peers. Teachers and support staffs are sensitive to the developmental issues of the particular age as well as the social/emotional issues of highly talented youngsters.\n\nTeachers in the magnet programs at each level meet as a team on a regularly scheduled basis to integrate curricular content. Child study meetings dealing with social/emotional needs are conducted regularly in the programs.\n\nThe magnet programs include programming at the elementary level, 1\u20136, ACAT; middle school level, 7\u20138, MACAT; the high school level, 9\u201312 in the Math, Science and Computer Program (MSC) which is housed at Churchill High School.\n\nThe Math/Science/Computer Program, MSC, located at Churchill High School, is a four-year program that begins with a thirty-student ninth grade class. Admissions are based on previous standardized testing and a special test usually administered in a student's second year of [[middle school|junior high school]], during the month of December. A number of students who are not initially accepted into the program (known as \"alternates\") may participate in a limited number of MSC classes, or may be allowed full entry if students drop out of the program at the end of a school year.\n\nThe curriculum is specifically designed for students who have an intense interest in math and science. The accelerated courses are taught at a faster pace and in greater depth. The Advance Placement, AP, Program gives students the opportunity to pursue college-level studies and receive advance placement and/or credit upon entering college. Many of the students also participate in Churchill High School's Accelerated Language Arts Program.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Zach Gowen]], former [[WWE]] and [[TNA Wrestling]] star\n* [[Judy Greer]], actress and former member of CAPA\n* [[Ryan Kesler]], professional hockey player of the Anaheim Ducks and Olympic silver medalist on Team USA\n* [[Jonathan B.

The school was created in 1968 as an add-on to the other high schools in Livonia in response to the population boom that the city saw at the time.  The first school year (1968\u201369), a sophomore class attended classes at nearby [[Franklin High School (Livonia, Michigan)|Franklin High School]].  Beginning in the 1969-70 school year, classes were then held in the new building with a junior and sophomore class.  The first graduating class graduated in June 1971.  The school is home to the MSC (Math, Science, and Computers) program as well as the Creative and Performing Arts program (CAPA). It also has a wide variety of athletics. The Girls' Cross-Country team finished second in the state of Michigan in 2006, and the Girls' Varsity Volleyball team won the 2007 state championship.<ref>[http://www.mhsaa.com/sports/vb/07reg.html 2007 MHSAA Volleyball Regionals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Livonia Career Technical Center is across the street, providing all Livonia Public School students the opportunity to engage in many hands-on activities.\n\n==Math, Science, and Computer program==\nThe Livonia Public School District provides magnet programs for the academically talented student, in grade 9 through grade 12.
