They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers.

From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. say). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cwill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs.

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, respectively, searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, respectively, searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her.

It was released on April 17, 2020, and is Apple's first release in nearly eight years, since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah. In 2015, she began recording the album with bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]], drummer Amy Aileen Wood and guitarist [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThey began recording in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting  as they marched around the house. They spent three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. Upon returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording, making the announcement in sign language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=NME|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".

It was released on April 17, 2020, and is Apple's first release in nearly eight years, since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah. In 2015, she began recording the album with bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]], drummer Amy Aileen Wood and guitarist [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThey began recording in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting  as they marched around the house. They spent three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. Upon returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording, making the announcement in sign language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=NME|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\".
