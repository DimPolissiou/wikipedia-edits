It is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} west of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[Tualatin Valley]] and is among the main cities that make up the [[Portland metropolitan area]]. The city's population was 89,803 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the second-largest city in the county and the sixth-largest city in Oregon.<ref name=factfinder>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST10&prodType=table|title=American Factfinder|author= |date=|work=2010 Census|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Beaverton is an economic center for Washington County along with neighboring [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]]. It surrounds the world headquarters of [[Nike, Inc.]], which occupies [[unincorporated area|unincorporated county land]].\n\nThe hunter\u2013gatherer [[Atfalati]] tribe of the [[Kalapuya]] people inhabited the Tualatin Valley prior to the arrival of European\u2013American settlers in the 19th century. They occupied a village near the Beaverton and Fanno creeks called Chakeipi, which meant \"place of the beaver.\" Early white settlers referred to this village as Beaverdam. Lawrence Hall took up the first land claim in 1847 and established a [[grist mill]]. The entry of a railroad in 1868 spurred growth in the small farming communities and led to the town's incorporation in 1893. \n\n[[File:City Park Beaverton Oregon.JPG|thumb|City Park in Beaverton]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nAccording to ''[[Oregon Geographic Names]]'', Beaverton's name is derived from the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from [[American Beaver|beaver]] dams.\n\n===Native Americans===\nThe area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the ''[[Atfalati]]'', which settlers mispronounced as ''Tualatin''.  The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to \"place of the beaver\".<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | title = Beaverton History\n  | publisher = City of Beaverton\n  | accessdate = September 7, 2007\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062919/http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | archivedate = September 28, 2007\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Early settlers====\nThe natives had a village called ''Chakeipi'', meaning ''Place of the Beaver'', and early settlers referred to it as \"Beaverdam\".  Early settlers include the Hall Family from [[Kentucky]], the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York.<ref name=\"hist\"/>  Lawrence Hall purchased {{convert|640|acre|km2}} in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a [[grist mill]] with his brother near present-day Walker Road.<ref name=\"hist\" />  His was the first land claim in the area.  He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill.  In 1860, a toll [[plank road]] from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called [[Canyon Road]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\n====Beginning of the town====\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, \"mostly swamps & marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.\"  In 1872,  Beaverton's first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community.  Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him.  In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor.\nMany major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Automobile dealerships====\nBeaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A [[Ford Motor Company]] dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.\n\n====Movies and airplanes====\n[[File:View of Beaverton 1950's (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (10).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Beaverton in the 1950s]]\nIn the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to [[Premium Picture Productions]], a [[movie studio]] which produced about fifteen films.  The studio site was later converted into [[Bernard's Airport#History|Watt's Field]] and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities.  A second Beaverton airport, [[Bernard's Airport]], was later developed farther north, at the present location of the [[Cedar Hills Crossing]] mall.\n\n====Library====\nThe [[Beaverton City Library|town's first library]] opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street.  A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood.  The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the [[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]].\n\n====Mass transit====\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|left|Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway, ca. 1911]]\nIn the 1940s, [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|Tualatin Valley Stages]], a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited [[Public transport bus service|bus transit]] service connecting the city with [[downtown Portland]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Stage Fares To Increase|date=August 6, 1947|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=9}}</ref> operating later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies serving the [[Portland metropolitan area]] which became collectively known as the [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|\"Blue Bus\" lines]].  All four companies were replaced in 1970 by [[TriMet]], a then-new regional transit authority,<ref name=\"tri-met action averts\">{{cite news|last=Federman|first=Stan|date=September 2, 1970|title=Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}</ref> which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a [[light rail]] system was proposed to connect Beaverton to downtown Portland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Nancy|date=November 9, 1979|title=Westside transitway options narrowed to 5|newspaper=[[Beaverton Valley Times|The Valley Times]]|location=Beaverton|page=A-1}}</ref> as part of [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro's]] plans for the region's transportation.  In 1990, voters approved funding for [[MAX Blue Line#Westside MAX|Westside MAX]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mayer|first=James|date=November 8, 1990|title=Light-rail bond approved, but Tri-Met worries not over|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=C4}}</ref> Construction of the line began in 1993 and was completed in 1998.  Six stations are located within the city of Beaverton: [[Elmonica / Southwest 170th Avenue|Elmonica/SW 170th Avenue]], [[Merlo Road / Southwest 158th Avenue|Merlo Road/SW 158th]], [[Beaverton Creek (MAX station)|Beaverton Creek]], [[Millikan Way (MAX station)|Millikan Way]], [[Beaverton Central (MAX station)|Beaverton Central]], and the [[Beaverton Transit Center (MAX station)|Beaverton Transit Center]].  All but the last of these (the transit center) are located along [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] formerly owned by [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and originally by the [[Oregon Electric Railway]], which provided [[interurban]] service through Beaverton until 1933.  The present-day light rail service (MAX) is operated by TriMet, which also continues to operate several bus routes serving Beaverton and the surrounding communities.  Since early 2009, Beaverton has also been served by [[commuter rail]] service, TriMet's [[Westside Express Service]] (WES), running south to [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] via [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] and [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]].\n\n===21st century=== <!-- note forward reference to this section in intro -->\n{{Update|date=July 2009}}\n[[Image:DennisDoyle.JPG|thumb|right|Mayor Denny Doyle]]\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:Southwest corner of The Round - Beaverton, Oregon.JPG|thumb|The Round in 2009]]\nIn December 2004, the city and Washington County announced an \"interim plan\" which would lead to Beaverton becoming the second-largest city in Oregon, second only to Portland.<ref name=\"county\">[http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm County Board Approves Interim Plan with Beaverton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818231719/http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }}, a December 2004 article from the [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] website</ref>  The \"interim\" plan actually covered a period of more than ten years; from the county's perspective,<ref name=\"county\" /> the plan supported its strategy of having cities and special districts provide urban services.

The city's population was 89,803 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the second-largest city in the county and the sixth-largest city in Oregon.<ref name=factfinder>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST10&prodType=table|title=American Factfinder|author= |date=|work=2010 Census|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Beaverton is an economic center for Washington County along with neighboring [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]]. It surrounds the world headquarters of [[Nike, Inc.]], which occupies [[unincorporated area|unincorporated county land]].\n\nThe hunter\u2013gatherer [[Atfalati]] tribe of the [[Kalapuya]] people inhabited the Tualatin Valley prior to the arrival of European\u2013American settlers in the 19th century. They occupied a village near the Beaverton and Fanno creeks called Chakeipi, which meant \"place of the beaver.\" Early white settlers referred to this village as Beaverdam. Lawrence Hall took up the first land claim in 1847 and established a [[grist mill]]. The entry of a railroad in 1868 spurred growth in the small farming communities and led to the town's incorporation in 1893. \n\n[[File:City Park Beaverton Oregon.JPG|thumb|City Park in Beaverton]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nAccording to ''[[Oregon Geographic Names]]'', Beaverton's name is derived from the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from [[American Beaver|beaver]] dams.\n\n===Native Americans===\nThe area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the ''[[Atfalati]]'', which settlers mispronounced as ''Tualatin''.  The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to \"place of the beaver\".<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | title = Beaverton History\n  | publisher = City of Beaverton\n  | accessdate = September 7, 2007\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062919/http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx\n  | archivedate = September 28, 2007\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Early settlers====\nThe natives had a village called ''Chakeipi'', meaning ''Place of the Beaver'', and early settlers referred to it as \"Beaverdam\".  Early settlers include the Hall Family from [[Kentucky]], the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York.<ref name=\"hist\"/>  Lawrence Hall purchased {{convert|640|acre|km2}} in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a [[grist mill]] with his brother near present-day Walker Road.<ref name=\"hist\" />  His was the first land claim in the area.  He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill.  In 1860, a toll [[plank road]] from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called [[Canyon Road]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\n====Beginning of the town====\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, \"mostly swamps & marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.\"  In 1872,  Beaverton's first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community.  Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him.  In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor.\nMany major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Automobile dealerships====\nBeaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A [[Ford Motor Company]] dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.\n\n====Movies and airplanes====\n[[File:View of Beaverton 1950's (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (10).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Beaverton in the 1950s]]\nIn the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to [[Premium Picture Productions]], a [[movie studio]] which produced about fifteen films.  The studio site was later converted into [[Bernard's Airport#History|Watt's Field]] and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities.  A second Beaverton airport, [[Bernard's Airport]], was later developed farther north, at the present location of the [[Cedar Hills Crossing]] mall.\n\n====Library====\nThe [[Beaverton City Library|town's first library]] opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street.  A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood.  The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the [[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]].\n\n====Mass transit====\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|left|Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway, ca. 1911]]\nIn the 1940s, [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|Tualatin Valley Stages]], a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited [[Public transport bus service|bus transit]] service connecting the city with [[downtown Portland]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Stage Fares To Increase|date=August 6, 1947|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=9}}</ref> operating later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies serving the [[Portland metropolitan area]] which became collectively known as the [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|\"Blue Bus\" lines]].  All four companies were replaced in 1970 by [[TriMet]], a then-new regional transit authority,<ref name=\"tri-met action averts\">{{cite news|last=Federman|first=Stan|date=September 2, 1970|title=Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}</ref> which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a [[light rail]] system was proposed to connect Beaverton to downtown Portland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Nancy|date=November 9, 1979|title=Westside transitway options narrowed to 5|newspaper=[[Beaverton Valley Times|The Valley Times]]|location=Beaverton|page=A-1}}</ref> as part of [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro's]] plans for the region's transportation.

Six stations are located within the city of Beaverton: [[Elmonica / Southwest 170th Avenue|Elmonica/SW 170th Avenue]], [[Merlo Road / Southwest 158th Avenue|Merlo Road/SW 158th]], [[Beaverton Creek (MAX station)|Beaverton Creek]], [[Millikan Way (MAX station)|Millikan Way]], [[Beaverton Central (MAX station)|Beaverton Central]], and the [[Beaverton Transit Center (MAX station)|Beaverton Transit Center]].  All but the last of these (the transit center) are located along [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] formerly owned by [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and originally by the [[Oregon Electric Railway]], which provided [[interurban]] service through Beaverton until 1933.  The present-day light rail service (MAX) is operated by TriMet, which also continues to operate several bus routes serving Beaverton and the surrounding communities.  Since early 2009, Beaverton has also been served by [[commuter rail]] service, TriMet's [[Westside Express Service]] (WES), running south to [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] via [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] and [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]].\n\n===21st century=== <!-- note forward reference to this section in intro -->\n{{Update|date=July 2009}}\n[[Image:DennisDoyle.JPG|thumb|right|Mayor Denny Doyle]]\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:Southwest corner of The Round - Beaverton, Oregon.JPG|thumb|The Round in 2009]]\nIn December 2004, the city and Washington County announced an \"interim plan\" which would lead to Beaverton becoming the second-largest city in Oregon, second only to Portland.<ref name=\"county\">[http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm County Board Approves Interim Plan with Beaverton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818231719/http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }}, a December 2004 article from the [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] website</ref>  The \"interim\" plan actually covered a period of more than ten years; from the county's perspective,<ref name=\"county\" /> the plan supported its strategy of having cities and special districts provide urban services.

Suppose {{math|''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X<sub>n</sub>''}} are {{mvar|n}} independent random variables such that \n\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}\\left (X_i\\in [a_i,b_i] \\right)=1, \\qquad 1\\leq i\\leq n.</math>\n\nLet \n\n:<math>S_n = X_1 + \\cdots + X_n.</math>\n\nThen for {{math|''s'', ''t'' > 0}}, [[Markov's inequality]] and the independence of {{mvar|X<sub>i</sub>}} implies:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{P}\\left(S_n-\\mathrm{E}\\left [S_n \\right ]\\geq t \\right) &= \\operatorname{P} \\left (e^{s(S_n-\\mathrm{E}\\left [S_n \\right ])} \\geq e^{st} \\right)\\\\\n&\\leq e^{-st} \\mathrm{E} \\left [e^{s(S_n-\\mathrm{E}\\left [S_n \\right ])} \\right ]\\\\\n&= e^{-st} \\prod_{i=1}^n\\mathrm{E} \\left [e^{s(X_i-\\mathrm{E}\\left [X_i\\right])} \\right ]\\\\\n&\\leq e^{-st} \\prod_{i=1}^n e^{\\frac{s^2 (b_i-a_i)^2}{8} } \\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(-st+\\tfrac{1}{8} s^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i-a_i)^2\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo get the best possible upper bound, we find the minimum of the right hand side of the last inequality as a function of {{mvar|s}}.

Suppose {{math|''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X<sub>n</sub>''}} are {{mvar|n}} independent random variables such that \n\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}\\left (X_i\\in [a_i,b_i] \\right)=1, \\qquad 1\\leq i\\leq n.</math>\n\nLet \n\n:<math>S_n = X_1 + \\cdots + X_n.</math>\n\nThen for {{math|''s'', ''t'' > 0}}, [[Markov's inequality]] and the independence of {{mvar|X<sub>i</sub>}} implies:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{P}\\left(S_n-\\mathrm{E}\\left [S_n \\right ]\\geq t \\right) &= \\operatorname{P} \\left (e^{s(S_n-\\mathrm{E}\\left [S_n \\right ])} \\geq e^{st} \\right)\\\\\n&\\leq e^{-st} \\mathrm{E} \\left [e^{s(S_n-\\mathrm{E}\\left [S_n \\right ])} \\right ]\\\\\n&= e^{-st} \\prod_{i=1}^n\\mathrm{E} \\left [e^{s(X_i-\\mathrm{E}\\left [X_i\\right])} \\right ]\\\\\n&\\leq e^{-st} \\prod_{i=1}^n e^{\\frac{s^2 (b_i-a_i)^2}{8} } \\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(-st+\\tfrac{1}{8} s^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i-a_i)^2\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo get the best possible upper bound, we find the minimum of the right hand side of the last inequality as a function of {{mvar|s}}. Define \n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} g\\colon \\mathbf{R_{+}} \\to \\mathbf{R} \\\\ g(s)=-st+\\frac{s^2}{8}\\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i-a_i)^2 \\end{cases}</math>\n\nNote that {{mvar|g}} is a [[quadratic function]] and achieves its minimum at\n\n:<math>s=\\frac{4t}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i-a_i)^2}.</math>\n\nThus we get\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{P} \\left(S_n-\\mathrm{E}\\left [S_n \\right ]\\geq t \\right)\\leq \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i-a_i)^2}\\right).</math>\n\n==Usage==\n===Confidence intervals===\nHoeffding's inequality is useful to analyse the number of required samples needed to obtain a [[confidence interval]] by solving the inequality in Theorem 1: \n\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}(\\overline X - \\mathrm{E}[\\overline X] \\geq t) \\leq e^{-2nt^2}</math>\n\nThe inequality states that the probability that the estimated and true values differ by more than {{mvar|t}} is bounded by ''e''<sup>\u22122''nt''<sup>2</sup></sup>.\nSymmetrically, the inequality is also valid for another side of the difference:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}(-\\overline X + \\mathrm{E}[\\overline X] \\geq t) \\leq e^{-2nt^2}</math>\n\nBy adding them both up, we can obtain two-sided variant of this inequality:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}(|\\overline X - \\mathrm{E}[\\overline X]| \\geq t) \\leq 2e^{-2nt^2}</math>\n\nThis probability can be interpreted as the level of significance <math>\\alpha</math> (probability of making an error) for a confidence interval around <math>\\mathrm{E}[\\overline X]</math> of size 2{{mvar|t}}:\n\n:<math>\\alpha=\\operatorname{P}(\\overline X \\notin [\\mathrm{E}[\\overline X]-t, \\mathrm{E}[\\overline X]+t]) \\leq 2e^{-2nt^2}</math>\n\nSolving the above for {{mvar|n}} gives us the following:\n\n:<math>n\\leq \\frac{\\log(2/\\alpha)}{2t^2}</math>\n\nTherefore, we require at least <math>\\textstyle \\frac{\\log(2/\\alpha)}{2t^2}</math> samples to acquire <math>\\textstyle (1-\\alpha)</math>-confidence interval <math>\\textstyle \\mathrm{E}[\\overline X]\\pm t</math>.\n\nHence, the cost of acquiring the confidence interval is sublinear in terms of confidence level and quadratic in terms of precision.\n\nNote that this inequality is the most conservative of the three in Theorem 1, and there are more efficient methods of estimating a [[confidence interval]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Concentration inequality]] \u2013 a summary of tail-bounds on random variables.\n*[[Hoeffding's lemma]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal\n | first1=Robert J. | last1=Serfling\n | title=Probability Inequalities for the Sum in Sampling without Replacement\n | journal=The Annals of Statistics\n | pages=39\u201348\n | year=1974\n | ref=harv\n | volume=2\n | number=1\n | doi=10.1214/aos/1176342611\n | mr=0420967| doi-access=free\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n | first1=Wassily | last1=Hoeffding\n | title=Probability inequalities for sums of bounded random variables\n | journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association\n | pages=13\u201330\n | year=1963\n | ref=harv\n | volume=58\n | number=301\n | jstor=2282952\n | doi=10.1080/01621459.1963.10500830 \n | mr=0144363| url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/bitstream/1840.4/2170/1/ISMS_1962_326.pdf\n }}\n* {{cite web \n | url = http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/SLT09/lecture7.pdf \n | title = Lecture 7: Chernoff's Bound and Hoeffding's Inequality \n | author = Robert Nowak \n | publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison \n | date = 2009\n | work = ECE 901 (Summer '09) : Statistical Learning Theory Lecture Notes \n | accessdate = May 16, 2014}}\n* {{cite book  \n | first1=Roman | last1=Vershynin\n | title = High-Dimensional Probability \n | publisher = Cambridge University Press \n | year = 2018\n | isbn = 9781108415194}}\n  {{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Probabilistic inequalities]]\n", "name_user": "A.

It is named after [[Bromley]], its principal town; other major towns are [[Penge]],  [[Hayes]], [[West Wickham]], [[Chislehurst]], [[Beckenham]] and [[Orpington]]. The local authority is [[Bromley London Borough Council]].{{Refn|group=n|As a borough, the alternative legal form of address, as shown, in most leases granted by it and in older Law Reports is '''The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Bromley'''}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe borough is the largest in Greater London by area and occupies {{convert|59|sqmi|km2|0}}. The majority of the borough is [[Metropolitan Green Belt]], including nearly all of the land south of the A232-A21 route between West Wickham and Pratts Bottom.<ref>London Green Belt Council http://londongreenbeltcouncil.org.uk/threats_map/</ref> Consequently, it is also perhaps the most rural borough and contains more of the [[North Downs]] than any other, as that escarpment is broad between Bromley and Banstead. This is also reflected in its population density, which is the lowest of the 32 London boroughs.<ref>https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/land-area-and-population-density-ward-and-borough</ref>\n\nMost of the population lives in the north and west of the borough, with an outlier at [[Biggin Hill]] in the far south. The borough shares borders with the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]] and [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] to the north, [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] to the north-east, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] and [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] to the north-west, and [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] to the west. It also borders the [[Sevenoaks District]] of [[Kent]] to the east and south, and the [[Tandridge District]] of [[Surrey]] to the south-west.\n\n[[Westerham Heights]], the [[List of highest points in London|highest point in London]] at an altitude of 804 feet (245 m), is on the southern boundary. The [[Prime Meridian]] passes through Bromley.\n\nAbout 30% of the land in Bromley is farmland, the highest figure of a London Borough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|title=Capital Growth: Facts and figures about food growing and farming in and around London|website=www.capitalgrowth.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330215755/http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Districts==\n{{see also|List of districts in Bromley}}\n[[File:Sundridge Park Manor, Willoughby Lane, Bromley-geograph-2422018.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Sundridge Park]]\nThe borough is partly urban and partly rural, the former to the north and very much part of the built-up area of suburban London.\n\nThe principal parts of the northern section, from west to east, are [[Beckenham]], which includes [[Eden Park, London, England|Eden Park]] and [[Elmers End]]; [[Bromley]] with [[Bickley]], Bromley Park and [[Bromley Common]], Park Langley, Plaistow, [[Shortlands]] and Southborough; [[Chislehurst]], with [[Elmstead, London|Elmstead]] and [[Sundridge, London|Sundridge]]. The built-up area around [[Orpington]] not only encompasses its direct outskirts of [[Chelsfield]], Crofton, Derry Downs, [[Goddington]], Kevingtown, and [[Petts Wood]]; it also includes the erstwhile separate settlements of [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]], [[Green Street Green]], [[Pratts Bottom]], [[St Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]]. Other smaller suburban areas include [[Anerley]] and nearby [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]]; and [[Penge]]. In addition, parts of [[Mottingham]], [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]], [[Swanley]] and [[Ruxley]] lie within the borough boundaries.\n\nThere are two main built-up areas in the southern part of the borough: [[Hayes, Bromley|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]]. [[Biggin Hill]], [[Downe]] and [[Keston]] with [[Leaves Green]] and Nash are separate, smaller, rural settlements.\n\nLocal attractions include [[Down House]] (the home of [[Charles Darwin]]), [[Chislehurst Caves]], [[Holwood House]] (the home of [[William Pitt the Younger]]), [[Crofton Roman Villa]], and the site of [[The Crystal Palace]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{See also|List of electoral wards in Greater London#Bromley|label 1=List of electoral wards in Bromley}}\n[[File:Bromley Ward Map.PNG|left|thumb|The 22 wards of the London Borough of Bromley (orange) and the surrounding London boroughs (yellow) and districts outside Greater London (grey)]]\nBromley is divided into 22 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] with a total of 60 council seats.

This rose slowly throughout the nineteenth century, as the district became built up; reaching 17,192 in the middle of the century. When the railways arrived, the rate of [[population growth]] increased. The population peaked in the 1970s, when industry began to relocate from London.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]], the borough had a population of 309,392. All major religions are represented, but of those stating a choice, 60.07% described themselves as [[Christians|Christian]].

The borough shares borders with the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]] and [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] to the north, [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] to the north-east, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] and [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] to the north-west, and [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] to the west. It also borders the [[Sevenoaks District]] of [[Kent]] to the east and south, and the [[Tandridge District]] of [[Surrey]] to the south-west.\n\n[[Westerham Heights]], the [[List of highest points in London|highest point in London]] at an altitude of 804 feet (245 m), is on the southern boundary. The [[Prime Meridian]] passes through Bromley.\n\nAbout 30% of the land in Bromley is farmland, the highest figure of a London Borough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|title=Capital Growth: Facts and figures about food growing and farming in and around London|website=www.capitalgrowth.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330215755/http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe borough was formed on 1 April 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]]. It covered the areas of the [[Municipal Borough of Bromley]], the [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]], [[Penge Urban District]], [[Orpington Urban District]] and the [[Chislehurst]] part of [[Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District]]. The local government authorities that until then had administered those other areas were simultaneously abolished by the London Government Act on 1 April 1965.\nIn 1969, after a local campaign, local government responsibility for the village of [[Knockholt]] was transferred to the neighbouring [[Sevenoaks Rural District]]: before 1965, it had been part of the [[Orpington Urban District]].\n\n==Districts==\n{{see also|List of districts in Bromley}}\n[[File:Sundridge Park Manor, Willoughby Lane, Bromley-geograph-2422018.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Sundridge Park]]\nThe borough is partly urban and partly rural, the former to the north and very much part of the built-up area of suburban London.\n\nThe principal parts of the northern section, from west to east, are [[Beckenham]], which includes [[Eden Park, London, England|Eden Park]] and [[Elmers End]]; [[Bromley]] with [[Bickley]], Bromley Park and [[Bromley Common]], Park Langley, Plaistow, [[Shortlands]] and Southborough; [[Chislehurst]], with [[Elmstead, London|Elmstead]] and [[Sundridge, London|Sundridge]]. The built-up area around [[Orpington]] not only encompasses its direct outskirts of [[Chelsfield]], Crofton, Derry Downs, [[Goddington]], Kevingtown, and [[Petts Wood]]; it also includes the erstwhile separate settlements of [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]], [[Green Street Green]], [[Pratts Bottom]], [[St Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]]. Other smaller suburban areas include [[Anerley]] and nearby [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]]; and [[Penge]]. In addition, parts of [[Mottingham]], [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]], [[Swanley]] and [[Ruxley]] lie within the borough boundaries.\n\nThere are two main built-up areas in the southern part of the borough: [[Hayes, Bromley|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]]. [[Biggin Hill]], [[Downe]] and [[Keston]] with [[Leaves Green]] and Nash are separate, smaller, rural settlements.\n\nLocal attractions include [[Down House]] (the home of [[Charles Darwin]]), [[Chislehurst Caves]], [[Holwood House]] (the home of [[William Pitt the Younger]]), [[Crofton Roman Villa]], and the site of [[The Crystal Palace]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{See also|List of electoral wards in Greater London#Bromley|label 1=List of electoral wards in Bromley}}\n[[File:Bromley Ward Map.PNG|left|thumb|The 22 wards of the London Borough of Bromley (orange) and the surrounding London boroughs (yellow) and districts outside Greater London (grey)]]\nBromley is divided into 22 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] with a total of 60 council seats.

When the railways arrived, the rate of [[population growth]] increased. The population peaked in the 1970s, when industry began to relocate from London.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]], the borough had a population of 309,392.

A native of [[Zephyrhills, Florida]], he has competed in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]], [[NASCAR Nationwide Series]], and [[Camping World Truck Series]]. In 2004, he won [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year]] honors in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]]. He is the son of [[Buzzie Reutimann]].\n\nHe began his racing career in dirt-track modifieds and late models. In 1997, Reutimann moved into the NASCAR regional series before moving to the Busch Series in 2002. He moved up to the [[Sprint Cup Series]] in 2007, driving for [[Michael Waltrip Racing]]. Between the 2007 and 2011 Sprint Cup seasons, Reutimann recorded two wins, 26 top-tens, and four [[pole positions]].\n\n==Personal life==\nReutimann lives in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]], with his wife Lisa and daughter Emilia. They are members of Berea Baptist Church in Mooresville.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpsports.net/bpsports.asp?ID=5552 |title=BPSports.net \u2013 NASCAR's Reutimann: Faith-driven<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007174552/http://www.bpsports.net/bpsports.asp?ID=5552 |archive-date=2007-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBefore he was a full-time race car driver, Reutimann worked briefly for the [[United Parcel Service]], which in 2008 became his primary sponsor for the rest of that season.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2007/news/opinion/10/13/jmenzer.dreutimann.ups.djarrett/1.html NASCAR.COM \u2013 Blast from the past: UPS, Reutimann a perfect match \u2013 Oct 13, 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\nReutimann, a third-generation racer, began his racing career in dirt-track modifieds and late models before moving up to the [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Southeast Series|Slim Jim All Pro Series]] in 1997. He was named Rookie of the Year, finishing in the top-ten eight times and had a fifth-place points finish. The next season, he dropped to seventh in points, but received the Sportsmanship award at season's end. After several years, Reutimann got his first three wins in 2002 and finished second in the overall championship standings.\n\nThat same year, Reutimann made his Busch Series debut at [[Richmond International Raceway]]. Driving the No. 87 [[GEICO]] [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] for [[NEMCO Motorsports]], Reutimann started thirty-fourth but finished sixteenth. He led twelve laps at his next race at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]], and finished in the top-fifteen in each of his next two races. In 2003, Reutimann won a contest named \"Hills Bros. Coffee Break of a Lifetime\", a contest where [[Hills Bros. Coffee]] selected one driver to receive full sponsorship from them for 5 Busch Series races, and if that driver were to score three top 10s in those races, they'd receive a chance to start a Cup race. He ran those 5 races, along with 2 extra races, for NEMCO Motorsports. He finished fifth at [[Nashville Speedway USA]] and [[The Milwaukee Mile]], as well as qualifying [[Greg Biffle]]'s car on the pole at Memphis. He also attempted the [[New England 300]] and the [[Brickyard 400]] in the [[Winston Cup Series]] in the No. 04 for [[Morgan-McClure Motorsports]], but failed to qualify both times.\n\nIn 2004, Reutimann signed on with [[Darrell Waltrip Motorsports]] to race the [[NTN Bearings]] truck in the Craftsman Truck Series. Winning the pole in his second race at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]], Reutimann had four top-fives and finished 14th in points, garnering Rookie of the Year honors. Reutimann won his first career race in [[2005 in NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2005]] at [[Nashville Superspeedway]], and ended the season thirteenth in points. He also made his Cup debut at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]], driving the No. 00 [[State Fair Corn Dogs]] [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] for [[Michael Waltrip]]. He finished 22nd. He went winless in [[2006 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2006]], but had two poles and finished third in the championship standings. He also made fifteen Busch starts and had four top-tens.\n\n==Sprint Cup Series==\n\n===2007===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2020}}\n[[Image:DavidReutimann2007AaronsDreamMachineBuschSeriesRacecar.jpg|thumb|left|2007 [[Busch Series]] car]]\nReutimann moved up to the Nextel Cup Series in 2007 with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]], and was a Raybestos Rookie of the Year Candidate.\n\nReutimann edged [[Kevin Lepage]] for a transfer spot during the Gatorade Duels into the Daytona 500. However, despite qualifying 14th, he was started from the rear of the field  because before the Duels, NASCAR penalized Waltrip's team including Reutimann's for illegal fuel additives in all MWR cars. At the same time the No. 00 car suffered an electrical problem during a wind-down lap. Reutimann ran in the top twenty of the Daytona 500 until he was collected in an accident on lap 173; he eventually finished 40th.\n\nThe following race, at [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]], Reutimann was involved in a vicious crash. With 4 laps left in the race, [[Greg Biffle]] tapped his bumper, sending his car head-on into the wall. Upon impact, the car exploded in flames and slid backwards. The red flag flew, as Reutimann had instantly fallen unconscious. Paramedics came to the wreck, extinguished the flames, and helped a sore, dazed Reutimann out of his racecar. He was airlifted by a helicopter to a hospital. Reutimann suffered a minor concussion, a cracked rib and a few bruises; despite the injuries he returned to the track the next weekend in [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez|Mexico City]] for the Busch series. NASCAR said that Reutimann's accident tied with several other wrecks as the hardest crash in NASCAR history. This record stood until [[Elliott Sadler]] crashed at Pocono in 2010.\n\nThe next few weeks after were not very good for Reutimann and the 00 team, failing to qualify at Las Vegas, Bristol, and Texas. However, in the races he did make, he failed to make the top 30 until the tenth race of the season at Richmond, where he finished 28th. After having engine issues at Darlington and failing to qualify for the Coca-Cola 600 and the spring Dover race, along with a disappointing run at Pocono, Reutimann finished in the top 20 for the first time in his Cup career at Michigan, finishing 15th. Despite this, Reutimann was replaced for the races at [[Sonoma Raceway|Sonoma]] and [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] by [[Road course ringer|road course ringer]] [[P. J. Jones]] in an attempt to get the #00 to the top 35 positions in owner points.<ref>{{cite web |title=MWR taps PJ Jones for Sears Point |url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/mwr-taps-pj-jones-for-sears-point/2188367/ |website=Motorsport |accessdate=January 30, 2020 |date=June 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe rest of the season would end up repeating a cycle of bad finishes below 30th followed by a good finish above the top 20. After failing to qualify at Bristol, Atlanta, and Phoenix, Reutimann went on to finish the season 39th in points.\n\nLate in the season, he won the [[2007 NASCAR Busch Series|2007]] [[Sam's Town 250]] at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]] for his first career Busch Series win, and [[Toyota]]'s second win in Busch Series competition. He finished second overall in the Busch Series' last season before becoming the [[Nationwide Series]].\n\n===2008===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:David Reutimann 2008 Aarons Toyota Camry.jpg|thumb|left|Sprint Cup car Reutimann drove first five races of 2008]]\nIn 2008, Reutimann ran the first five races of the [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|season]] in the No. 00 [[Aaron's, Inc.|Aaron's]] Dream Machine-sponsored car, before taking over for the retiring [[Dale Jarrett]] in the No. 44 [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]-sponsored car and handing the No. 00 car over to rookie [[Michael McDowell (driver)|Michael McDowell]]. Starting the season out with an 18th place in the Daytona 500, Reutimann started to show improvement over the last season. At Fontana the following week, he finished 23rd before getting 37th at Las Vegas a week later.\n\nIn his first two races in the No. 44 car, Reutimann had mechanical issues, having a suspension issue at Martinsville and getting a blown engine the following week at Texas.\n\nReutimann scored his first career top 10 at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] during the [[Coca-Cola 600]] with a 10th-place finish. He also recorded top 10's at the [[Auto Club Speedway]], [[Texas Motor Speedway]], and the [[Richmond International Raceway]]. At the Richmond race in September, Reutimann led a race high 104 laps, but fell to 9th place. In the season finale at the [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]], Reutimann claimed his first career pole position, becoming the 23rd driver to win poles in all three of NASCAR's top series.\n\n===2009===\nIn 2009, Reutimann moved back to the No. 00 car. He competed a limited schedule in the [[Nationwide Series]], splitting time with MWR's No. 99 Toyota Camry and [[Braun Racing]]'s No. 10 Toyota Camry. During the Daytona 500, Reutimann finished 12th, which would be a new career high at the race. Two weeks later at Las Vegas, Reutimann would score his first top 5, finishing 5th in the race. At Texas, Reutimann would score his first pole of the season, finishing 11th in the race. A week later, at Phoenix, Reutimann would score his 2nd top 10 of the season.\n\nOn May 24, he qualified well in the Coca-Cola 600 but the race was delayed due to rain. The next day on lap 222 his crew chief Rodney Childers made a call to conserve fuel which put Reutimann in the lead. A few laps later on lap 227, a rain shower soaked the track for the second time of the race, red-flagging it with Reutimann in the lead. Reutimann spent a 1-hour wait praying and planning backup plans with boss Michael Waltrip and his pit crew. Despite blue skies being shown nearby the track, officials declared that the rain would last for the remainder of the night and called the race, thus giving Reutimann his first Cup series win in the Coca-Cola 600 and Waltrip giving him a full-time sponsorship until 2011.\n\nWith this emotional victory, Reutimann became the 20th driver to win a race in all three of NASCAR's top series (Cup, Nationwide, and Truck). This race was also the 50th [[Coca-Cola 600]] at [[Lowes Motor Speedway]]. He also became the first driver in Cup history to win a race without leading a lap under green. In addition, he was the first driver to ever win with the No. 00 in the NASCAR Cup Series<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/bg/01/10/dreutimann.full.season/story_single.html#page2 NASCAR.COM \u2013 Reutimann confident in challenge for N'wide title \u2013 Jan 10, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  This also entered Reutimann automatically into the [[NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race XXVI|2010 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race]]. \n\nA week after his victory, Reutimann would win his second pole of the season at Dover, finishing the race in 18th on the lead lap. The next week at Pocono, Reutimann would end up finishing 3rd, and would get another top 5 at Loudon a couple races after. Reutimann would end up getting five more top 10's at Indianapolis, Michigan, Atlanta, Kansas, and Phoenix. Reutimann would go on to finish the season 16th in the point standings, a personal best.\n\n===2010===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\nReutimann returned to the No. 00 car during the 2010 season. He would start the season with a personal best finish in the Daytona 500, finishing 5th. Reutimann won his second career race at the 2010 [[LifeLock.com 400]] at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] in the No. 00 [[Tums|TUMS]] MWR Toyota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/2010_LifeLock.com_400/W|title=07/10/2010 race: LifeLock.com 400 (Cup) - Racing-Reference.info|website=www.racing-reference.info|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> Reutimann ran in the top-five all night and with under seventy laps remaining, chased down [[Jeff Gordon]] and passed him for the lead. He would pull away and lead the rest of the race, holding off a late charge by [[Carl Edwards]].\n\n===2011===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\n2011 was a disappointing year for both Reutimann and MWR. Reutimann and the No. 00 team only scored one top five finish and two top ten finishes. At [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] on the final lap, [[Boris Said]] accidentally turned [[David Ragan]] entering the esses. Ragan came back onto the track and hit Reutimann, hit the ARMCO outside barrier and he rolled over spectacularly after the hard hit. He was mostly unscathed and Ragan dislocated his ankle as a result.\n\nWith three weeks remaining in the 2011 season, Reutimann could not come to an agreement with Aaron's for 2012 and thus Michael Waltrip and MWR's staff reluctantly released Reutimann from his team as well as the number 00.\n\nAfter Christmas 2011, Reutimann signed up to drive for part-time with [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] and [[Tommy Baldwin Racing]] in 2012 sharing the No. 10 [[Go Daddy]] car with rookie [[Danica Patrick]].\n\n===2012===\n[[File:David Reutimann Ricky Benton Racing Chevrolet Rockingham 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Reutimann's 2012 truck]]\nOn January 3, 2012, Reutimann signed a one-year contract to drive <!-- the No. 35 [[Chevrolet]] --> for Tommy Baldwin Racing.<ref name=\"reutytommy\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nascar.com/news/120103/dreutimann-tommy-baldwin-racing-2012/index.html | title=Reutimann finds ride with Tommy Baldwin Racing | publisher=NASCAR | date=January 3, 2012 | accessdate=January 3, 2012 | author=Rodman, Dave}}</ref> As part of an alliance with Stewart-Haas Racing that TBR agreed to on January 31, Reutimann shared the SHR No. 10 entry, which was fielded by TBR, with Danica Patrick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20120131/NASCAR/120139963|title=NASCAR: Danica Patrick to drive Tommy Baldwin Racing car in 10 Cup races, including Daytona 500|date=January 31, 2012|work=AutoWeek|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|accessdate=2012-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205154843/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20120131/NASCAR/120139963|archive-date=February 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also drove the No. 92 [[RBR Enterprises]] vehicle in the [[Camping World Truck Series]] on a limited schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/David-Reutimann-plans-limited-NASCAR-Camping-World-Truck-Series-schedule-010912|title=Reutimann plans some Truck racing|date=January 9, 2012|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> As Patrick drove the No. 10 in the [[2012 Daytona 500]], Reutimann drove the No. 93 Toyota Camry for [[BK Racing]] in the event with Todd Anderson serving as crew chief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/David-Reutimann-gets-Daytona-500-ride-with-BK-Racing-021412|title=Reutimann's Daytona ride is with BK|last=Spencer|first=Lee|date=February 14, 2012|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> Reutimann also drove the [[BK Racing]] No. 93 at Darlington.\n\nReutimann caused a controversy at the April Martinsville race when the No. 10 Tommy Baldwin Racing Chevrolet stalled on lap 497, drawing a caution. He was accused of intentionally causing the caution after limping around the track for a few laps at speeds well below the rest of the field. The result was a broken timing belt and Reutimann was credited with a 35th-place finish. He insists he was just trying to keep the car in the Top 35 in owner's points; the team left Martinsville just one point outside a guaranteed start.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/story/2012-04-05/David-Reutimann-blasts-critical-yahoos/54064426/1 David Reutimann: Martinsville actions were 'not for Danica']</ref> Reutimann qualified for the next race at Texas and finished 26th, getting the No. 10 back into the Top 35.

A native of [[Zephyrhills, Florida]], he has competed in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]], [[NASCAR Nationwide Series]], and [[Camping World Truck Series]]. In 2004, he won [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year]] honors in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]]. He is the son of [[Buzzie Reutimann]].\n\nHe began his racing career in dirt-track modifieds and late models. In 1997, Reutimann moved into the NASCAR regional series before moving to the Busch Series in 2002. He moved up to the [[Sprint Cup Series]] in 2007, driving for [[Michael Waltrip Racing]]. Between the 2007 and 2011 Sprint Cup seasons, Reutimann recorded two wins, 26 top-tens, and four [[pole positions]].\n\n==Personal life==\nReutimann lives in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]], with his wife Lisa and daughter Emilia. They are members of Berea Baptist Church in Mooresville.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpsports.net/bpsports.asp?ID=5552 |title=BPSports.net \u2013 NASCAR's Reutimann: Faith-driven<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007174552/http://www.bpsports.net/bpsports.asp?ID=5552 |archive-date=2007-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBefore he was a full-time race car driver, Reutimann worked briefly for the [[United Parcel Service]], which in 2008 became his primary sponsor for the rest of that season.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2007/news/opinion/10/13/jmenzer.dreutimann.ups.djarrett/1.html NASCAR.COM \u2013 Blast from the past: UPS, Reutimann a perfect match \u2013 Oct 13, 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\nReutimann, a third-generation racer, began his racing career in dirt-track modifieds and late models before moving up to the [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Southeast Series|Slim Jim All Pro Series]] in 1997. He was named Rookie of the Year, finishing in the top-ten eight times and had a fifth-place points finish. The next season, he dropped to seventh in points, but received the Sportsmanship award at season's end. After several years, Reutimann got his first three wins in 2002 and finished second in the overall championship standings.\n\nThat same year, Reutimann made his Busch Series debut at [[Richmond International Raceway]]. Driving the No. 87 [[GEICO]] [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] for [[NEMCO Motorsports]], Reutimann started thirty-fourth but finished sixteenth. He led twelve laps at his next race at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]], and finished in the top-fifteen in each of his next two races. In 2003, Reutimann won a contest named \"Hills Bros. Coffee Break of a Lifetime\", a contest where [[Hills Bros. Coffee]] selected one driver to receive full sponsorship from them for 5 Busch Series races, and if that driver were to score three top 10s in those races, they'd receive a chance to start a Cup race. He ran those 5 races, along with 2 extra races, for NEMCO Motorsports. He finished fifth at [[Nashville Speedway USA]] and [[The Milwaukee Mile]], as well as qualifying [[Greg Biffle]]'s car on the pole at Memphis. He also attempted the [[New England 300]] and the [[Brickyard 400]] in the [[Winston Cup Series]] in the No. 04 for [[Morgan-McClure Motorsports]], but failed to qualify both times.\n\nIn 2004, Reutimann signed on with [[Darrell Waltrip Motorsports]] to race the [[NTN Bearings]] truck in the Craftsman Truck Series. Winning the pole in his second race at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]], Reutimann had four top-fives and finished 14th in points, garnering Rookie of the Year honors. Reutimann won his first career race in [[2005 in NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2005]] at [[Nashville Superspeedway]], and ended the season thirteenth in points. He also made his Cup debut at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]], driving the No. 00 [[State Fair Corn Dogs]] [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] for [[Michael Waltrip]]. He finished 22nd. He went winless in [[2006 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2006]], but had two poles and finished third in the championship standings. He also made fifteen Busch starts and had four top-tens.\n\n==Sprint Cup Series==\n\n===2007===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2020}}\n[[Image:DavidReutimann2007AaronsDreamMachineBuschSeriesRacecar.jpg|thumb|left|2007 [[Busch Series]] car]]\nReutimann moved up to the Nextel Cup Series in 2007 with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]], and was a Raybestos Rookie of the Year Candidate.\n\nReutimann edged [[Kevin Lepage]] for a transfer spot during the Gatorade Duels into the Daytona 500. However, despite qualifying 14th, he was started from the rear of the field  because before the Duels, NASCAR penalized Waltrip's team including Reutimann's for illegal fuel additives in all MWR cars. At the same time the No. 00 car suffered an electrical problem during a wind-down lap. Reutimann ran in the top twenty of the Daytona 500 until he was collected in an accident on lap 173; he eventually finished 40th.\n\nThe following race, at [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]], Reutimann was involved in a vicious crash. With 4 laps left in the race, [[Greg Biffle]] tapped his bumper, sending his car head-on into the wall. Upon impact, the car exploded in flames and slid backwards. The red flag flew, as Reutimann had instantly fallen unconscious. Paramedics came to the wreck, extinguished the flames, and helped a sore, dazed Reutimann out of his racecar. He was airlifted by a helicopter to a hospital. Reutimann suffered a minor concussion, a cracked rib and a few bruises; despite the injuries he returned to the track the next weekend in [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez|Mexico City]] for the Busch series. NASCAR said that Reutimann's accident tied with several other wrecks as the hardest crash in NASCAR history. This record stood until [[Elliott Sadler]] crashed at Pocono in 2010.\n\nThe next few weeks after were not very good for Reutimann and the 00 team, failing to qualify at Las Vegas, Bristol, and Texas. However, in the races he did make, he failed to make the top 30 until the tenth race of the season at Richmond, where he finished 28th. After having engine issues at Darlington and failing to qualify for the Coca-Cola 600 and the spring Dover race, along with a disappointing run at Pocono, Reutimann finished in the top 20 for the first time in his Cup career at Michigan, finishing 15th. Despite this, Reutimann was replaced for the races at [[Sonoma Raceway|Sonoma]] and [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] by [[Road course ringer|road course ringer]] [[P. J. Jones]] in an attempt to get the #00 to the top 35 positions in owner points.<ref>{{cite web |title=MWR taps PJ Jones for Sears Point |url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/mwr-taps-pj-jones-for-sears-point/2188367/ |website=Motorsport |accessdate=January 30, 2020 |date=June 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe rest of the season would end up repeating a cycle of bad finishes below 30th followed by a good finish above the top 20. After failing to qualify at Bristol, Atlanta, and Phoenix, Reutimann went on to finish the season 39th in points.\n\nLate in the season, he won the [[2007 NASCAR Busch Series|2007]] [[Sam's Town 250]] at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]] for his first career Busch Series win, and [[Toyota]]'s second win in Busch Series competition. He finished second overall in the Busch Series' last season before becoming the [[Nationwide Series]].\n\n===2008===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:David Reutimann 2008 Aarons Toyota Camry.jpg|thumb|left|Sprint Cup car Reutimann drove first five races of 2008]]\nIn 2008, Reutimann ran the first five races of the [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|season]] in the No. 00 [[Aaron's, Inc.|Aaron's]] Dream Machine-sponsored car, before taking over for the retiring [[Dale Jarrett]] in the No. 44 [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]-sponsored car and handing the No. 00 car over to rookie [[Michael McDowell (driver)|Michael McDowell]]. Starting the season out with an 18th place in the Daytona 500, Reutimann started to show improvement over the last season. At Fontana the following week, he finished 23rd before getting 37th at Las Vegas a week later.\n\nIn his first two races in the No. 44 car, Reutimann had mechanical issues, having a suspension issue at Martinsville and getting a blown engine the following week at Texas.\n\nReutimann scored his first career top 10 at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] during the [[Coca-Cola 600]] with a 10th-place finish. He also recorded top 10's at the [[Auto Club Speedway]], [[Texas Motor Speedway]], and the [[Richmond International Raceway]]. At the Richmond race in September, Reutimann led a race high 104 laps, but fell to 9th place. In the season finale at the [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]], Reutimann claimed his first career pole position, becoming the 23rd driver to win poles in all three of NASCAR's top series.\n\n===2009===\nIn 2009, Reutimann moved back to the No. 00 car. He competed a limited schedule in the [[Nationwide Series]], splitting time with MWR's No. 99 Toyota Camry and [[Braun Racing]]'s No. 10 Toyota Camry. During the Daytona 500, Reutimann finished 12th, which would be a new career high at the race. Two weeks later at Las Vegas, Reutimann would score his first top 5, finishing 5th in the race. At Texas, Reutimann would score his first pole of the season, finishing 11th in the race. A week later, at Phoenix, Reutimann would score his 2nd top 10 of the season.\n\nOn May 24, he qualified well in the Coca-Cola 600 but the race was delayed due to rain. The next day on lap 222 his crew chief Rodney Childers made a call to conserve fuel which put Reutimann in the lead. A few laps later on lap 227, a rain shower soaked the track for the second time of the race, red-flagging it with Reutimann in the lead. Reutimann spent a 1-hour wait praying and planning backup plans with boss Michael Waltrip and his pit crew. Despite blue skies being shown nearby the track, officials declared that the rain would last for the remainder of the night and called the race, thus giving Reutimann his first Cup series win in the Coca-Cola 600 and Waltrip giving him a full-time sponsorship until 2011.\n\nWith this emotional victory, Reutimann became the 20th driver to win a race in all three of NASCAR's top series (Cup, Nationwide, and Truck). This race was also the 50th [[Coca-Cola 600]] at [[Lowes Motor Speedway]]. He also became the first driver in Cup history to win a race without leading a lap under green. In addition, he was the first driver to ever win with the No. 00 in the NASCAR Cup Series<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/bg/01/10/dreutimann.full.season/story_single.html#page2 NASCAR.COM \u2013 Reutimann confident in challenge for N'wide title \u2013 Jan 10, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  This also entered Reutimann automatically into the [[NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race XXVI|2010 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race]]. \n\nA week after his victory, Reutimann would win his second pole of the season at Dover, finishing the race in 18th on the lead lap. The next week at Pocono, Reutimann would end up finishing 3rd, and would get another top 5 at Loudon a couple races after. Reutimann would end up getting five more top 10's at Indianapolis, Michigan, Atlanta, Kansas, and Phoenix. Reutimann would go on to finish the season 16th in the point standings, a personal best.\n\n===2010===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\nReutimann returned to the No. 00 car during the 2010 season. He would start the season with a personal best finish in the Daytona 500, finishing 5th. Reutimann won his second career race at the 2010 [[LifeLock.com 400]] at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] in the No. 00 [[Tums|TUMS]] MWR Toyota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/2010_LifeLock.com_400/W|title=07/10/2010 race: LifeLock.com 400 (Cup) - Racing-Reference.info|website=www.racing-reference.info|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> Reutimann ran in the top-five all night and with under seventy laps remaining, chased down [[Jeff Gordon]] and passed him for the lead. He would pull away and lead the rest of the race, holding off a late charge by [[Carl Edwards]].\n\n===2011===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}\n2011 was a disappointing year for both Reutimann and MWR. Reutimann and the No. 00 team only scored one top five finish and two top ten finishes. At [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] on the final lap, [[Boris Said]] accidentally turned [[David Ragan]] entering the esses. Ragan came back onto the track and hit Reutimann, hit the ARMCO outside barrier and he rolled over spectacularly after the hard hit. He was mostly unscathed and Ragan dislocated his ankle as a result.\n\nWith three weeks remaining in the 2011 season, Reutimann could not come to an agreement with Aaron's for 2012 and thus Michael Waltrip and MWR's staff reluctantly released Reutimann from his team as well as the number 00.\n\nAfter Christmas 2011, Reutimann signed up to drive for part-time with [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] and [[Tommy Baldwin Racing]] in 2012 sharing the No. 10 [[Go Daddy]] car with rookie [[Danica Patrick]].\n\n===2012===\n[[File:David Reutimann Ricky Benton Racing Chevrolet Rockingham 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Reutimann's 2012 truck]]\nOn January 3, 2012, Reutimann signed a one-year contract to drive <!-- the No. 35 [[Chevrolet]] --> for Tommy Baldwin Racing.<ref name=\"reutytommy\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nascar.com/news/120103/dreutimann-tommy-baldwin-racing-2012/index.html | title=Reutimann finds ride with Tommy Baldwin Racing | publisher=NASCAR | date=January 3, 2012 | accessdate=January 3, 2012 | author=Rodman, Dave}}</ref> As part of an alliance with Stewart-Haas Racing that TBR agreed to on January 31, Reutimann shared the SHR No. 10 entry, which was fielded by TBR, with Danica Patrick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20120131/NASCAR/120139963|title=NASCAR: Danica Patrick to drive Tommy Baldwin Racing car in 10 Cup races, including Daytona 500|date=January 31, 2012|work=AutoWeek|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|accessdate=2012-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205154843/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20120131/NASCAR/120139963|archive-date=February 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also drove the No. 92 [[RBR Enterprises]] vehicle in the [[Camping World Truck Series]] on a limited schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/David-Reutimann-plans-limited-NASCAR-Camping-World-Truck-Series-schedule-010912|title=Reutimann plans some Truck racing|date=January 9, 2012|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> As Patrick drove the No. 10 in the [[2012 Daytona 500]], Reutimann drove the No. 93 Toyota Camry for [[BK Racing]] in the event with Todd Anderson serving as crew chief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/David-Reutimann-gets-Daytona-500-ride-with-BK-Racing-021412|title=Reutimann's Daytona ride is with BK|last=Spencer|first=Lee|date=February 14, 2012|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> Reutimann also drove the [[BK Racing]] No. 93 at Darlington.\n\nReutimann caused a controversy at the April Martinsville race when the No. 10 Tommy Baldwin Racing Chevrolet stalled on lap 497, drawing a caution. He was accused of intentionally causing the caution after limping around the track for a few laps at speeds well below the rest of the field. The result was a broken timing belt and Reutimann was credited with a 35th-place finish. He insists he was just trying to keep the car in the Top 35 in owner's points; the team left Martinsville just one point outside a guaranteed start.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/story/2012-04-05/David-Reutimann-blasts-critical-yahoos/54064426/1 David Reutimann: Martinsville actions were 'not for Danica']</ref> Reutimann qualified for the next race at Texas and finished 26th, getting the No. 10 back into the Top 35.

A [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] who could play in [[midfielder|midfield]], Vasovi\u0107 was renowned for his defensive positioning, never-say-die attitude and tactical awareness.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Po\u017earevac]] on the eve of World War II to parents hailing from [[Montenegro]] \u2014 tax office clerk \u017divojin Vasovi\u0107 and homemaker Jelka Lau\u0161evi\u0107 \u2014 young Velibor was the couple's ninth child.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\">[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/10/sportske-legende-velibor-vasovic-kako.html Velibor Vasovi\u0107 - Kako je milicija pendre\u010dila Milaneze!];''Duga'', 1986</ref> He had four older brothers and three older sisters while another one of his sisters died before he was born. With the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and subsequent dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom in April 1941, Vasovi\u0107's father got taken prisoner by the Germans, spending four years in captivity, while his oldest siblings joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\nThe youngster completed primary education in his hometown before moving to capital Belgrade along with his entire family courtesy of his maternal uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 who in the meantime rose to high post with the [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA). Vasovi\u0107 began his secondary studies by enrolling at the [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]].<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n==Club career==\nSimultaneous with starting gymnasium studies, Vasovi\u0107 got introduced to the game of football at FK Novi Beograd, a small local lower-league outfit.\n\n===Partizan===\nIn 1955, youngster's footballing talents got spotted by [[FK Partizan]] youth coach [[Florijan Matekalo]], initiating fifteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107's transfer across town to the big club's youth system where he came in alongside additional talented teenagers such as right back [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] and central midfielder [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], brought in from [[Prilep]] and [[Ivanjica]], respectively. Others already on the youth team were twin brothers [[Sr\u0111an \u010cebinac|Sr\u0111an]] and [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] as well as Branko Pejovi\u0107. The entire talented generation soon came to be known as \"Matekalo's Babies\".\n\nIn June 1958, eighteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107 got moved up to the full squad. He spent five seasons at [[FK Partizan]] in this stint (June 1958 \u2013 June 1963) before controversially transferring to [[Ve\u010diti derbi|archrivals]] [[Red Star Belgrade]] during summer 1963.\n\n===Six months at Red Star Belgrade===\nIn the summer of 1963, twenty-three-year-old Vasovi\u0107 was coming off another stellar season for Partizan in which he greatly contributed to the ''crno-beli'' winning their [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|third consecutive league title]]. However, his contract with Partizan was set to expire. In a 1986 interview for ''[[Duga (magazine)|Duga]]'' magazine, Vasovi\u0107 recalled how his transfer to Red Star came about: {{cquote|''Both my and Jusufi's contracts were expiring in the summer of 1963. And in addition to being key members of the Partizan team, both of us were also prominent national team players. My uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 was a Partizan board member so the geniuses at the club figured 'We better throw a lot of money at Jusufi to prevent him from leaving while Vasovi\u0107's gonna stay anyway because his uncle will take care of it'. Of course, I would have none of it so I immediately went across town to Red Star's technical director [[Aca Obradovi\u0107]] and I literally told him 'Mr. Obradovi\u0107, if Red Star has enough money I'd like to join your club'. So they dug into their [[emergency fund]] and paid me. Once the Partizan people found out, they were flabbergasted. Club president, [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] general {{ill|Ilija Radakovi\u0107|sr}}, immediately approved payment of the double amount Red Star gave me. My phone was ringing off the hook, they were sending letters, they organized fan protests. I was also getting [[death threat]]s. To this day I keep a letter in which one JNA officer threatens to kill me during a match with a [[sniper rifle]]. It's like a proper letter, he even included his full name, home address, and phone number''.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>}}\n\nVasovi\u0107 reportedly received [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]5 million (enough to buy two [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] vehicles at the time) from Red Star.<ref>[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/vasovic-velibor/ Biography in Serbian];reprezentacija.rs</ref>\n\nAt the start of the new [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league season]], Vasovi\u0107 got a spot in Red Star's central defense alongside [[Milan \u010cop]] and [[Vojislav Meli\u0107|Vojkan Meli\u0107]]. His first competitive match for Red Star on 1 September 1963 was also the grand opening of the club's still not fully finished grandiose new stadium [[Marakana]] as ''crveno-beli'' came from behind to beat [[NK Rijeka]] 2\u20131. The team easily led the [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league]] by five points at the winter break while defending league champion Partizan lagged far behind.\n\nOver the winter break, another transfer saga involving Vasovi\u0107 ensued as Partizan club president Radakovi\u0107 was successful in persuading the player to come back for even more money than Red Star gave him. Vasovi\u0107 agreed, but he was under contract with Red Star and the club didn't want to sign off on the move despite being offered some money as a transfer fee. Vasovi\u0107 even resorted to unilaterally training with his old club.\n\nWith the league season restarting following the winter break, Vasovi\u0107 was in legal limbo, out of the Red Star lineup, though still having his salary paid by the club. After several months of sitting out, Vasovi\u0107 got instructed by the Partizan vice-president \u010ceda D\u017eomba to try to get a meeting with the highest political authority in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]] at the time, federal interior secretary [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], in order to finally resolve the situation.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Vasovi\u0107 made the approach through private channels as his friend and teammate [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] was an old schoolmate of Rankovi\u0107's son so Vasovi\u0107 managed to get a 45-minute meeting with Rankovi\u0107 at the recently built [[SIV 1|SIV building]] in [[New Belgrade]] where nothing concrete was promised other than Rankovi\u0107 saying he'll look into it.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Several months later Red Star's technical director Obradovi\u0107 agreed to let Vasovi\u0107 return to Partizan while in return, as consolation of sorts for Red Star, Partizan's club president Radakovi\u0107 agreed to allow Zvezdan \u010cebinac's transfer to Red Star.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Return to Partizan===\nVasovi\u0107 thus managed to get both his money and his wishes of return, but many within Partizan did not welcome him back with open arms. Some of the players saw his stunt as blackmail and were further unhappy that the club bent over backwards to accommodate any single player like that. Furthermore, his return took place against the backdrop of internal squabbles within the club's managing board, specifically between president Radakovi\u0107 and general-secretary Mirko Nenezi\u0107 who acted as proxy for his brother, powerful JNA general {{ill|Radojica Nenezi\u0107|sr}}. The row started over the internal decision to relieve general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 of his duties as a person in charge of finances, a move pushed through by president Radakovi\u0107.\n\nAs the [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365 season]] began under new head coach [[Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1920)|Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107]], Partizan led the league, but with each coming week the row in the managing board increasingly affected player relations. By December 1964, ahead of the last league fixture before the winter break, two opposing camps clearly emerged within the team \u2014 one group supporting dissenting general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 was led by Jusufi and also included [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Radoslav Be\u010dejac]], [[Joakim Vislavski]], and head coach Atanackovi\u0107 while the other group supporting president Radakovi\u0107 was led by Vasovi\u0107 with [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Zoran Miladinovi\u0107, and several youth players. Remaining players [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], [[Josip Pirmajer]], and [[Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107]] stayed neutral. The dissenting group even resorted to initiating a mutiny, refusing to travel to [[Skopje]] for the final match of the first half of the season versus [[FK Vardar]]. Seeing they were missing half of their team along with head coach Atanackovi\u0107, president Radakovi\u0107 handed the head coaching reins to [[Mile Kos]] for one match. In difficult circumstances, Kos managed to put together eleven players and Partizan managed to retain the top league spot as winter break commenced. The very next day after the Skopje debacle, head coach Atanackovi\u0107 was relieved of his duties as the two factions prepared for the final showdown at the club's general assembly scheduled for January 1965 at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. The assembly saw the two groups of players make up. Still, the case even got to the highest echelons of power in Yugoslavia as general [[Ivan Go\u0161njak]], reporting directly to marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], became aware of his fellow JNA generals causing problems within the Partizan management. Once Tito caught whiff of this, he acted swiftly, ordering action against each officer from the club's management board involved in the row by having them reassigned to another location. General Radakovi\u0107 thus got moved to [[SR Slovenia]] while general Radojica Nenezi\u0107 got assigned to Skopje. Vladimir Duji\u0107, a civilian, became the new club president.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzPXzNvgSEQ Se\u0107anja: Propu\u0161tena \u0161ansa Partizana];SOS kanal, 4 September 2011</ref> The head coaching duties were handed to [[Marko Valok]].\n\nSeveral months later Partizan played a friendly versus [[A.C. Milan]] that went down in infamy for Vasovi\u0107 getting into a vicious fist fight with Milan's Peruvian defender [[V\u00edctor Ben\u00edtez]], all of which prompted a bench-clearing brawl. Though unpleasant, the ugly fracas actually served to further solidify the newly unified team spirit of the recently fractured Partizan squad.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Ajax===\nVasovi\u0107 transferred to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] after he had lost 2\u20131 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] with Partizan in the [[1966 European Cup Final]] (scoring the only goal for his team). He did the same (4\u20131 loss to [[A.C. Milan]], scoring from the spot) in the [[1969 European Cup Final]], before leading Ajax as captain to a 2\u20130 victory over [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in the [[1971 European Cup Final]].\n\nHe played 5 seasons for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] giants (1966\u20131971) and was the first foreign captain in the [[History of AFC Ajax|club's history]].\n\nHe played 32 games for the [[Yugoslavia national football team]]. During his career with Partizan he won 4 Yugoslav Championships ([[1960\u201361 Yugoslav First League|1960\u201361]], [[1961\u201362 Yugoslav First League|1961\u201362]], [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|1962\u201363]], [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365]]) and leading Partizan as captain to the [[1966 European Cup Final]].\n\nVasovi\u0107's career was relatively short. He only played 13 professional seasons due to the [[asthma]]tic condition he was suffering from.\n\n== National team ==\nIn the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]] Vasovi\u0107 appeared from 1961 until 1966 in 32 fixtures and scoring 2 goals. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+List of international goals scored by Velibor Vasovi\u0107 \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No. \n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Date \n! scope=\"col\" | Venue \n! scope=\"col\" | Opponent \n! scope=\"col\" | Score \n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" | Competition \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|1\n|| 4 November 1962 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|BEL}} || <center>3\u20132</center> || <center>3\u20132</center> || [[UEFA Euro 1964 qualifying]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2\n|| 7 November 1965 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|NOR}} || <center>1\u20131</center> || <center>1\u20131</center> || [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification]]\n|}\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter ending his career as a player in 1971, he coached [[FK Partizan]] (second part of [[1971\u201372 Yugoslav First League|1971\u201372]] season, full [[1972\u201373 Yugoslav First League|1972\u201373]], and the first part of [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|1973\u201374]]), [[FK Proleter Zrenjanin|Proleter Zrenjanin]], [[Angers SCO]] (1975\u20131976), [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (first part of [[1976\u201377 French Division 1|1976\u201377]] and the first part of [[1978\u201379 French Division 1|1978\u201379]] seasons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = France \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-fran-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> He also managed [[Egypt]]ian club [[Zamalek SC]] (1982\u20131983), [[Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.|Ethnikos Piraeus]] (1983), [[Red Star Belgrade]] (1986\u20131988), and [[AC Bellinzona]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = Switzerland \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-zwit-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> before returning home to [[Belgrade]] and working as a [[lawyer]].

His criticism particularly intensified after the breakup of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. In 1997 Vasovi\u0107 founded an organization called ''Udru\u017eenje za razvoj i prosperitet jugoslovenskog fudbala'' (Organization for the Development and Prosperity of Yugoslav Football) through which he channeled his criticism of the FSJ.\n\nThroughout the summer of 2000 he spoke at various town hall meetings throughout Serbia organized by the [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL), a political party headed by the [[President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav president]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s wife [[Mira Markovi\u0107]]. On October 10, 2000, five days after the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|overthrow of Milo\u0161evi\u0107's regime]] in [[Serbia]], Vasovi\u0107 and about a dozen bodyguards broke into the FSJ offices at [[Terazije]] square in downtown [[Belgrade]].<ref>[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&mm=10&dd=10&nav_category=1&nav_id=13578 VELIBOR VASOVIC UPAO U FSJ];B92, 10 October 2000</ref> They attempted to use the post-overthrow chaos and confusion in order to gain an upper hand on the expected FA leadership change, however they were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svetlost.co.yu/arhiva/2000/264/264-2.htm |title=Kontroverze prelaznog perioda: Preuzimanje i zauzimanje |accessdate=2013-07-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401073800/http://www.svetlost.co.yu/arhiva/2000/264/264-2.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2008 }};''Nezavisna svetlost'', 15 October 2000</ref>\n\nHe graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]].\n\n==Personal==\nVelibor Vasovi\u0107 was married twice, first with Mirjana Vasovi\u0107, and then to Branka Zori\u0107.

\u0412\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; 3 October 1939 \u2013 4 March 2002) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[association football|footballer]] and [[Manager (association football)|manager]], also one of the legendary players of [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] and one of greatest [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] of his generation. A [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] who could play in [[midfielder|midfield]], Vasovi\u0107 was renowned for his defensive positioning, never-say-die attitude and tactical awareness.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Po\u017earevac]] on the eve of World War II to parents hailing from [[Montenegro]] \u2014 tax office clerk \u017divojin Vasovi\u0107 and homemaker Jelka Lau\u0161evi\u0107 \u2014 young Velibor was the couple's ninth child.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\">[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/10/sportske-legende-velibor-vasovic-kako.html Velibor Vasovi\u0107 - Kako je milicija pendre\u010dila Milaneze!];''Duga'', 1986</ref> He had four older brothers and three older sisters while another one of his sisters died before he was born. With the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and subsequent dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom in April 1941, Vasovi\u0107's father got taken prisoner by the Germans, spending four years in captivity, while his oldest siblings joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\nThe youngster completed primary education in his hometown before moving to capital Belgrade along with his entire family courtesy of his maternal uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 who in the meantime rose to high post with the [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA). Vasovi\u0107 began his secondary studies by enrolling at the [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]].<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n==Club career==\nSimultaneous with starting gymnasium studies, Vasovi\u0107 got introduced to the game of football at FK Novi Beograd, a small local lower-league outfit.\n\n===Partizan===\nIn 1955, youngster's footballing talents got spotted by [[FK Partizan]] youth coach [[Florijan Matekalo]], initiating fifteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107's transfer across town to the big club's youth system where he came in alongside additional talented teenagers such as right back [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] and central midfielder [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], brought in from [[Prilep]] and [[Ivanjica]], respectively. Others already on the youth team were twin brothers [[Sr\u0111an \u010cebinac|Sr\u0111an]] and [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] as well as Branko Pejovi\u0107. The entire talented generation soon came to be known as \"Matekalo's Babies\".\n\nIn June 1958, eighteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107 got moved up to the full squad. He spent five seasons at [[FK Partizan]] in this stint (June 1958 \u2013 June 1963) before controversially transferring to [[Ve\u010diti derbi|archrivals]] [[Red Star Belgrade]] during summer 1963.\n\n===Six months at Red Star Belgrade===\nIn the summer of 1963, twenty-three-year-old Vasovi\u0107 was coming off another stellar season for Partizan in which he greatly contributed to the ''crno-beli'' winning their [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|third consecutive league title]]. However, his contract with Partizan was set to expire. In a 1986 interview for ''[[Duga (magazine)|Duga]]'' magazine, Vasovi\u0107 recalled how his transfer to Red Star came about: {{cquote|''Both my and Jusufi's contracts were expiring in the summer of 1963. And in addition to being key members of the Partizan team, both of us were also prominent national team players. My uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 was a Partizan board member so the geniuses at the club figured 'We better throw a lot of money at Jusufi to prevent him from leaving while Vasovi\u0107's gonna stay anyway because his uncle will take care of it'. Of course, I would have none of it so I immediately went across town to Red Star's technical director [[Aca Obradovi\u0107]] and I literally told him 'Mr. Obradovi\u0107, if Red Star has enough money I'd like to join your club'. So they dug into their [[emergency fund]] and paid me. Once the Partizan people found out, they were flabbergasted. Club president, [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] general {{ill|Ilija Radakovi\u0107|sr}}, immediately approved payment of the double amount Red Star gave me. My phone was ringing off the hook, they were sending letters, they organized fan protests. I was also getting [[death threat]]s. To this day I keep a letter in which one JNA officer threatens to kill me during a match with a [[sniper rifle]]. It's like a proper letter, he even included his full name, home address, and phone number''.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>}}\n\nVasovi\u0107 reportedly received [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]5 million (enough to buy two [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] vehicles at the time) from Red Star.<ref>[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/vasovic-velibor/ Biography in Serbian];reprezentacija.rs</ref>\n\nAt the start of the new [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league season]], Vasovi\u0107 got a spot in Red Star's central defense alongside [[Milan \u010cop]] and [[Vojislav Meli\u0107|Vojkan Meli\u0107]]. His first competitive match for Red Star on 1 September 1963 was also the grand opening of the club's still not fully finished grandiose new stadium [[Marakana]] as ''crveno-beli'' came from behind to beat [[NK Rijeka]] 2\u20131. The team easily led the [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league]] by five points at the winter break while defending league champion Partizan lagged far behind.\n\nOver the winter break, another transfer saga involving Vasovi\u0107 ensued as Partizan club president Radakovi\u0107 was successful in persuading the player to come back for even more money than Red Star gave him. Vasovi\u0107 agreed, but he was under contract with Red Star and the club didn't want to sign off on the move despite being offered some money as a transfer fee. Vasovi\u0107 even resorted to unilaterally training with his old club.\n\nWith the league season restarting following the winter break, Vasovi\u0107 was in legal limbo, out of the Red Star lineup, though still having his salary paid by the club. After several months of sitting out, Vasovi\u0107 got instructed by the Partizan vice-president \u010ceda D\u017eomba to try to get a meeting with the highest political authority in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]] at the time, federal interior secretary [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], in order to finally resolve the situation.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Vasovi\u0107 made the approach through private channels as his friend and teammate [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] was an old schoolmate of Rankovi\u0107's son so Vasovi\u0107 managed to get a 45-minute meeting with Rankovi\u0107 at the recently built [[SIV 1|SIV building]] in [[New Belgrade]] where nothing concrete was promised other than Rankovi\u0107 saying he'll look into it.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Several months later Red Star's technical director Obradovi\u0107 agreed to let Vasovi\u0107 return to Partizan while in return, as consolation of sorts for Red Star, Partizan's club president Radakovi\u0107 agreed to allow Zvezdan \u010cebinac's transfer to Red Star.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Return to Partizan===\nVasovi\u0107 thus managed to get both his money and his wishes of return, but many within Partizan did not welcome him back with open arms. Some of the players saw his stunt as blackmail and were further unhappy that the club bent over backwards to accommodate any single player like that. Furthermore, his return took place against the backdrop of internal squabbles within the club's managing board, specifically between president Radakovi\u0107 and general-secretary Mirko Nenezi\u0107 who acted as proxy for his brother, powerful JNA general {{ill|Radojica Nenezi\u0107|sr}}. The row started over the internal decision to relieve general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 of his duties as a person in charge of finances, a move pushed through by president Radakovi\u0107.\n\nAs the [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365 season]] began under new head coach [[Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1920)|Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107]], Partizan led the league, but with each coming week the row in the managing board increasingly affected player relations. By December 1964, ahead of the last league fixture before the winter break, two opposing camps clearly emerged within the team \u2014 one group supporting dissenting general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 was led by Jusufi and also included [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Radoslav Be\u010dejac]], [[Joakim Vislavski]], and head coach Atanackovi\u0107 while the other group supporting president Radakovi\u0107 was led by Vasovi\u0107 with [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Zoran Miladinovi\u0107, and several youth players. Remaining players [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], [[Josip Pirmajer]], and [[Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107]] stayed neutral. The dissenting group even resorted to initiating a mutiny, refusing to travel to [[Skopje]] for the final match of the first half of the season versus [[FK Vardar]]. Seeing they were missing half of their team along with head coach Atanackovi\u0107, president Radakovi\u0107 handed the head coaching reins to [[Mile Kos]] for one match. In difficult circumstances, Kos managed to put together eleven players and Partizan managed to retain the top league spot as winter break commenced. The very next day after the Skopje debacle, head coach Atanackovi\u0107 was relieved of his duties as the two factions prepared for the final showdown at the club's general assembly scheduled for January 1965 at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. The assembly saw the two groups of players make up. Still, the case even got to the highest echelons of power in Yugoslavia as general [[Ivan Go\u0161njak]], reporting directly to marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], became aware of his fellow JNA generals causing problems within the Partizan management. Once Tito caught whiff of this, he acted swiftly, ordering action against each officer from the club's management board involved in the row by having them reassigned to another location. General Radakovi\u0107 thus got moved to [[SR Slovenia]] while general Radojica Nenezi\u0107 got assigned to Skopje. Vladimir Duji\u0107, a civilian, became the new club president.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzPXzNvgSEQ Se\u0107anja: Propu\u0161tena \u0161ansa Partizana];SOS kanal, 4 September 2011</ref> The head coaching duties were handed to [[Marko Valok]].\n\nSeveral months later Partizan played a friendly versus [[A.C. Milan]] that went down in infamy for Vasovi\u0107 getting into a vicious fist fight with Milan's Peruvian defender [[V\u00edctor Ben\u00edtez]], all of which prompted a bench-clearing brawl. Though unpleasant, the ugly fracas actually served to further solidify the newly unified team spirit of the recently fractured Partizan squad.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Ajax===\nVasovi\u0107 transferred to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] after he had lost 2\u20131 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] with Partizan in the [[1966 European Cup Final]] (scoring the only goal for his team). He did the same (4\u20131 loss to [[A.C. Milan]], scoring from the spot) in the [[1969 European Cup Final]], before leading Ajax as captain to a 2\u20130 victory over [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in the [[1971 European Cup Final]].\n\nHe played 5 seasons for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] giants (1966\u20131971) and was the first foreign captain in the [[History of AFC Ajax|club's history]].\n\nHe played 32 games for [[Yugoslavia national football team]]. During his career with Partizan he won 4 Yugoslav Championships ([[1960\u201361 Yugoslav First League|1960\u201361]], [[1961\u201362 Yugoslav First League|1961\u201362]], [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|1962\u201363]], [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365]]) and leading Partizan as captain to the [[1966 European Cup Final]].\n\nVasovi\u0107's career was relatively short. He only played 13 professional seasons due to the [[asthma]]tic condition he was suffering from.\n\n== National team ==\nIn the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]] Vasovi\u0107 appeared from 1961 until 1966 in 32 fixtures and scoring 2 goals. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+List of international goals scored by Velibor Vasovi\u0107 \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No. \n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Date \n! scope=\"col\" | Venue \n! scope=\"col\" | Opponent \n! scope=\"col\" | Score \n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" | Competition \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|1\n|| 4 November 1962 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|BEL}} || <center>3\u20132</center> || <center>3\u20132</center> || [[UEFA Euro 1964 qualifying]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2\n|| 7 November 1965 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|NOR}} || <center>1\u20131</center> || <center>1\u20131</center> || [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification]]\n|}\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter ending his career as a player in 1971, he coached [[FK Partizan]] (second part of [[1971\u201372 Yugoslav First League|1971\u201372]] season, full [[1972\u201373 Yugoslav First League|1972\u201373]], and the first part of [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|1973\u201374]]), [[FK Proleter Zrenjanin|Proleter Zrenjanin]], [[Angers SCO]] (1975\u20131976), [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (first part of [[1976\u201377 French Division 1|1976\u201377]] and the first part of [[1978\u201379 French Division 1|1978\u201379]] seasons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = France \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-fran-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> He also managed [[Egypt]]ian club [[Zamalek SC]] (1982\u20131983), [[Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.|Ethnikos Piraeus]] (1983), [[Red Star Belgrade]] (1986\u20131988), and [[AC Bellinzona]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = Switzerland \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-zwit-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> before returning home to [[Belgrade]] and working as a [[lawyer]].
