For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street.

Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street.

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.<ref>{{cite web|title=1921 accident report|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_BirminghamNewStreet1921.pdf|publisher=Railways Archive|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gateway Plus]]\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station]]\n* [[Birmingham Moor Street railway station]]\n* [[Transport in Birmingham]]\n* [[Transport for West Midlands]]\n* [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Grand Central, Birmingham]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Foster, Richard, ''Birmingham New Street.

E. Lawrence]]'s account ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', and from the partly [[fiction]]alised depiction of him in [[David Lean]]'s film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.\n\n==The Howeitat==\nLawrence recorded that the Jazi [[Howeitat]] had formerly been under the leadership of the [[House of Rashid]], the [[amir]]s of [[Ha'il]], but had since fragmented and that Auda had come to control the [[Eastern Howeitat]], known as the abu Tayi.<ref name=lawrencereport>Lawrence, T.

''State, Society, and Land in Jordan'', BRILL, 2000, {{ISBN|90-04-11912-4}}, p.48. Auda claimed that the troops were shot when they opened fire on him.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nAuda abu Tayi is considered a hero of the Arab revolt. For while Prince Faisal was the prophet of Islam, Auda was the warrior.<ref>Lawrence, ''Seven Pillars'', p.169</ref>  T.E. Lawrence romanticized him as someone who epitomized everything noble, powerful and proud about the Bedouin, \"the greatest fighting man in northern Arabia\", with an impressive lineage of many generations of great desert Howeitat warriors of the Arabian peninsula. Lawrence wrote that\n\n<blockquote>\"He saw life as a saga, all the events in it were significant: all personages in contact with him heroic, his mind was stored with poems of old raids and epic tales of fights.\"<ref>''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' by T.E. Lawrence, {{ISBN|978-0-385-41895-9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs was customary in the desert Auda was known for his hospitality and generosity which \"kept him always poor, despite the profits of a hundred raids\". He claimed he had been married 28 times and wounded more than a dozen times in action. Legend had it that he had killed 75 Arabs by his own hand; he didn't even bother to keep count of the Turks. In battle Auda became a wild beast assuaged only after he had killed.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/auda.html</ref> He was hot-headed but always kept a smile on his face. Despite his fierce reputation he was described as modest, direct, honest, kind-hearted and warmly-loved.\n\nAuda lived in the desert near the [[Hejaz railway]]. He preferred the isolation which became necessary after he killed one too many debt collectors from [[Constantinople]] and the Turks put a price on his head. The desert landscapes were the exact areas Faisal and Lawrence needed to operate in to avoid close attention from the Turks. Lawrence wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Only by means of Auda abu Tayi could we swing the tribes from [[Ma'an]] to [[Aqaba]] so violently in our favour that they would help us take Aqaba and its hills from their Turkish garrisons.\"</blockquote>\n\n==The Arab Revolt==\nAuda's tribesmen were reputedly the finest fighters in the desert,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} which is why his support and assistance were vital to the Arab Revolt. Auda had initially been in the pay of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but switched allegiance to Lawrence and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal bin Al Hussein]]. With the incentives of kicking the Turks out of Arabia, and the lure of gold and booty, Auda joined the Arab Revolt, becoming a fervent supporter of the Arab independence movement (apparently going so far as to smash his Turkish [[false teeth]] with a hammer to demonstrate his patriotism).<ref name=\"lawrencereport\" /> He was repeatedly approached by the Turks with further financial inducements if he would switch to their side, but he refused to go back on his word. He was an Arab patriot and he would ride with Lawrence. He and his tribesmen were instrumental in the [[Battle of Aqaba|fall of Aqaba]] (July 1917) and [[Damascus]] (October 1918).\n\n==Post-war years==\nAfter the collapse of the Arab government in Damascus, Auda retired to the desert, building a modern palace at Al-Jafr east of [[Ma'an]] with captured Turkish slave labour. Before it was complete, however, he died in 1924 of natural causes; he is buried in Ras al-Ain, [[Amman]], Jordan.\n\n==Portrayal in film and media==\nHe was portrayed in the [[David Lean]] [[film]] ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' by [[Anthony Quinn]] as a complex character who blends together paternal wisdom and desert piracy. The depiction of Auda as interested only in financial rewards has been criticised, however, as he was a genuine supporter of Arab independence and was closely involved in planning the Revolt's military actions. Whatever the real motivations of Auda Abu Tayi, much of his presentation seems rooted in his sensationalised depiction by [[Lowell Thomas]] (and to an extent by Lawrence himself{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}) as a figure of anarchic, primitive masculine energy deliberately set against the idea of British 'civilisation' (see also [[Orientalism]]).<ref name=dawson184>Dawson, ''Soldier Heroes: British Adventure, Empire, and the Imagining of Masculinities'', Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-08882-8}}, p.184</ref> Auda's descendants were so incensed by the portrayal of their ancestor that they sued [[Columbia Studios]], the film's producers; the case was eventually dropped.<ref>Turner, Adrian, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', pp. 201\u2013206</ref>\n\nAuda was also featured as a supporting character in [[Terence Rattigan]]'s Lawrence-themed play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]''. The portrayal of Auda here is generally more well-rounded than in the film; he is shown to be a true Arab patriot, although he still retains fondness for financial reward.

He might be over fifty, and his black hair was streaked with white; but he was still strong and straight, loosely built, spare, and as active as a much younger man. His face was magnificent in its lines and hollows [...] He had large eloquent eyes, like black velvet in richness. His forehead was low and broad, his nose very high and sharp, powerfully hooked: his mouth rather large and mobile: his beard and moustaches had been trimmed to a point in Howeitat style, with the lower jaw shaven underneath.\"<ref>T.E.Lawrence, ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'', pp.169\u201370</ref> </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"His hospitality was sweeping, inconvenient except to very hungry souls.

He had married twenty-eight times, had been wounded thirteen times, and in the battles he provoked had seen all his tribesmen hurt, and most of his relations slain. He himself had slain seventy-five men, Arabs, by his own hand in battle: and never a man except in battle. Of the number of dead Turks he could give no account: they did not enter the register. His Toweiha under him had become the first fighters of the desert, with a tradition of desperate courage, and a sense of superiority which never left them while there was life and work to do [...] but which had reduced them from twelve hundred men to less than five hundred, in thirty years.\"<ref name=sevenpillars>Lawrence, T.

The Howeitat lived in what is now [[Saudi Arabia]]/[[Jordan]].\n\nAuda was a significant figure in the Arab Revolt; outside Arabia he is mainly known through his portrayal in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonel|Col.]] [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s account ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', and from the partly [[fiction]]alised depiction of him in [[David Lean]]'s film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.\n\n==The Howeitat==\n\nLawrence recorded that the Jazi [[Howeitat]] had formerly been under the leadership of the [[House of Rashid]], the [[amir]]s of [[Ha'il]], but had since fragmented and that Auda had come to control the [[Eastern Howeitat]], known as the abu Tayi.<ref name=lawrencereport>Lawrence, T.

''A History of Jordan and its Tribes'', University of Miami Press, 1958, p.212</ref> Auda and his ibn Jazi rival, Arar's half-brother Abtan, diverted the energies of the Howeitat - previously settled farmers and camel herders - into raiding, greatly increasing the tribe's wealth but introducing a mainly [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.<ref name=alonp34>Alon, Y. and Eilon, J. ''The Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State'', Tauris, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84511-138-9}}, p.34.

''State, Society, and Land in Jordan'', BRILL, 2000, {{ISBN|90-04-11912-4}}, p.48. Auda claimed that the troops were shot when they opened fire on him.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\nAuda abu Tayi is considered a hero of the Arab revolt.   For while Prince Faisal was the prophet of Islam, Auda was the warrior.<ref>Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p.169</ref>  T.E. Lawrence romanticized him as someone who epitomized everything noble, powerful and proud about the Bedouin, \"the greatest fighting man in northern Arabia\", with an impressive lineage of many generations of great desert Howeitat warriors of the Arabian peninsula. Lawrence wrote that\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cHe saw life as a saga, all the events in it were significant: all personages in contact with him heroic, his mind was stored with poems of old raids and epic tales of fights.\u201d''<ref>'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom' by T.E. Lawrence, {{ISBN|978-0-385-41895-9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs was customary in the desert Auda was known for his hospitality and generosity which \"kept him always poor, despite the profits of a hundred raids\". He claimed he had been married 28 times and wounded more than a dozen times in action. Legend had it that he had killed 75 Arabs by his own hand; he didn't even bother to keep count of the Turks. In battle Auda became a wild beast assuaged only after he had killed.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/auda.html</ref> He was hot-headed but always kept a smile on his face. Despite his fierce reputation he was described as modest, direct, honest, kind-hearted and warmly-loved.\n\nAuda lived in the desert near the [[Hejaz]] railway. He preferred the isolation which became necessary after he killed one too many debt collectors from [[Constantinople]] and the Turks put a price on his head. The desert landscapes were the exact areas Faisal and Lawrence needed to operate in to avoid close attention from the Turks. Lawrence wrote:\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cOnly by means of Auda abu Tayi could we swing the tribes from [[Ma'an]] to [[Aqaba]] so violently in our favour that they would help us take Aqaba and its hills from their Turkish garrisons.\u201d''</blockquote>\n\n==The Arab Revolt==\n\nAuda\u2019s tribesmen were reputedly the finest fighters in the desert{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, which is why his support and assistance were vital to the Arab Revolt. Auda had initially been in the pay of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but switched allegiance to Lawrence and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal bin Al Hussein]]. With the incentives of kicking the Turks out of Arabia, and the lure of gold and booty, Auda joined the Arab Revolt, becoming a fervent supporter of the Arab independence movement (apparently going so far as to smash his Turkish [[false teeth]] with a hammer to demonstrate his patriotism).<ref name=\"lawrencereport\"/> He was repeatedly approached by the Turks with further financial inducements if he would switch to their side, but he refused to go back on his word. He was an Arab patriot and he would ride with Lawrence. He and his tribesmen were instrumental in the [[Battle of Aqaba|fall of Aqaba]] (July 1917) and [[Damascus]] (October 1918).\n\n==Post-war years==\n\nAfter the collapse of the Arab government in Damascus, Auda retired to the desert, building a modern palace at Al-Jafr east of [[Ma'an]] with captured Turkish slave labour. Before it was complete, however, he died in 1924 of natural causes; he is buried in Ras al-Ain, [[Amman]], Jordan.\n\n==Portrayal in film and media==\n\nHe was portrayed in the [[David Lean]] [[film]] ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' by [[Anthony Quinn]] as a complex character who blends together paternal wisdom and desert piracy. The depiction of Auda as interested only in financial rewards has been criticised, however, as he was a genuine supporter of Arab independence and was closely involved in planning the Revolt's military actions. Whatever the real motivations of Auda Abu Tayi, much of his presentation seems rooted in his sensationalised depiction by [[Lowell Thomas]] (and to an extent by Lawrence himself{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}) as a figure of anarchic, primitive masculine energy deliberately set against the idea of British 'civilisation' (see also [[Orientalism]]).<ref name=dawson184>Dawson, ''Soldier Heroes: British adventure, empire, and the imagining of masculinities'', Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-08882-8}}, p.184</ref> Auda's descendants were so incensed by the portrayal of their ancestor that they sued [[Columbia Studios]], the film's producers; the case was eventually dropped .<ref>Turner, Adrian, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', pp. 201-206</ref>\n\nAuda was also featured as a supporting character in [[Terence Rattigan]]'s Lawrence-themed play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]''. The portrayal of Auda here is generally more well-rounded than in the film; he is shown to be a true Arab patriot, although he still retains fondness for financial reward. As Faisal and the film's fictional Sherif Ali were not present in the play, he served as the primary Arab character.\n\nHe is also portrayed in 2009 Qatari film [[Auda abu Tayeh (TV series)|Auda abu Tayeh]], which talks about his life in Arabia to Arab Revolt, and his death.\n\n==Lawrence on Auda==\nWhen Lawrence attended Prince Faisal's camp at Wejd, arrived late on February 16, 1916, bursting into the conference hall.\n<blockquote>''\"Auda was very simply dressed, northern fashion, in white cotton with a red [[Mosul]] [[keffiyeh|head-cloth]].

It is located near [[University of Delhi]] and has an area under 2 square kilometers. Its population is about 10,000. Timarpur is the first government colony<ref>http://www.delhigovt.nic.in</ref>{{Not in refs|date=July 2019}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019}} situated by the Government of India and is predominantly a government residential area.\n\nThe area includes eight schools, including six senior secondary schools, one primary school and one special school for intellectually disabled children. \n\nThe health services in Timarpur include the INMAS health centre, which is the biggest [[thyroid]] centre in [[India]]. A government-owned CGHS dispensary is also present in the area. \n\nTimarpur is well connected to the Delhi tilak basumatary service.\n\nThe area also includes a [[DRDO]] complex consisting of both residential and official areas. \n\nIn timarpur there is local dairy village of gurjar of Mandaar clan since 1911. In village there around 46 families and 180-220 house in village.  \n\n==Legislature==\nThe legislative assembly of Timarpur is currently (2014-2019) run by the [[Bhartiya Janata Party]]. The legislator of the area is [[Manoj Tiwari]].\n\n==Residence==\n[[File:Timarpur Residential Complex.jpg|thumb|200px|A building in the residential complex of Timarpur]]\nMost of the area is occupied by government flats, although a private colony is also present there. The area includes about 2,000 government flats which are meant for active government servants. A small portion of the area known as Banarsi Das Estate is privately owned. There are two police stations present in the area. Because it is a government residential area, Timarpur includes only a few markets. \n\nBesides being a government-owned area, a wide portion of the area is occupied by people living in slums. The residents in the government and the private sectors often find it difficult to co-operate with people living in slum areas.\n\nThe old market and timarpur dairy village of gurjars situated near the flats has a history of more than a hundred years. It was established in 1911.\n\nThe new market situated in Timarpur, just at a walking distance from the old market is the center of festivities during the Hindu festival of [[Dusshera]]. A grand Ramlila is organized there every year during the festival.\n\n==Places to Visit==\nTimarpur also bears the distinction of housing a 100-year-old plus market. The market (known as the Old Market) was established when Delhi was declared the capital during the British Raj in 1911. Yet the market has not seen development.\n\nTimarpur is surrounded by many tourist attractions like the northern ridge near the North Campus of [[University_of_Delhi|Delhi University]]. The area holds a forest where people come to jog and exercise. It was at one time used by the British armed forces during the British Raj. The flag staff tower there was used by British families as a hiding spot during the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857. The Mutiny Memorial is also situated near the ridge and is an example of the British architecture that was used in India at that time.{{According to whom|date=July 2019}} It was built in memory of the British soldiers who were killed during the mutiny of 1857.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Next to the Mutiny Memorial, is an Ashoka pillar that was shifted to Delhi by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] (a king from the Tughlaq Dynasty).{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nApart from the historic monuments, Choudhary Sweets (now closed), and the Darvesh Restaurant are some of the eating spaces in Timarpur.{{Relevance inline|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Budh Bazaar, held every Wednesday inside the Central Government Flats, is a center of attraction.\n\nTimarpur dairy village of Gurjars which supplies milk to the number of locals.\n\n==Education and health facilities==\n[[File:Timarpur Park.jpg|thumb|200px|Triangular Park in the Z-Block of Timarpur]]\n\nThe education facilities of Timarpur are moderate. In total, there are eight schools in Timarpur, six of them government-owned and two privately owned.

It is located near [[University of Delhi]] and has an area under 2 square kilometers. Its population is about 10,000. Timarpur is the first government colony<ref>http://www.delhigovt.nic.in</ref>{{Not in refs|date=July 2019}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019}} situated by the Government of India and is predominantly a government residential area.\n\nThe area includes eight schools, including six senior secondary schools, one primary school and one special school for intellectually disabled children. \n\nThe health services in Timarpur include the INMAS health centre, which is the biggest [[thyroid]] centre in [[India]]. A government-owned CGHS dispensary is also present in the area. \n\nTimarpur is well connected to the Delhi tilak basumatary service.\n\nThe area also includes a [[DRDO]] complex consisting of both residential and official areas. \n\nIn timarpur there is local dairy village of gurjar of Mandaar clan since 1911. In village there around 46 families and 180-220 house in village.  \n\n==Legislature==\nThe legislative assembly of Timarpur is currently (2014-2019) run by the [[Bhartiya Janata Party]]. The legislator of the area is [[Manoj Tiwari]].\n\n==Residence==\n[[File:Timarpur Residential Complex.jpg|thumb|200px|A building in the residential complex of Timarpur]]\nMost of the area is occupied by government flats, although a private colony is also present there. The area includes about 2,000 government flats which are meant for active government servants. A small portion of the area known as Banarsi Das Estate is privately owned. There are two police stations present in the area. Because it is a government residential area, Timarpur includes only a few markets. \n\nBesides being a government-owned area, a wide portion of the area is occupied by people living in slums. The residents in the government and the private sectors often find it difficult to co-operate with people living in slum areas.\n\nThe old market and timarpur dairy village of gurjars situated near the flats has a history of more than a hundred years. It was established in 1911.\n\nThe new market situated in Timarpur, just at a walking distance from the old market is the center of festivities during the Hindu festival of [[Dusshera]]. A grand Ramlila is organized there every year during the festival.\n\n==Places to Visit==\nTimarpur also bears the distinction of housing a 100-year-old plus market. The market (known as the Old Market) was established when Delhi was declared the capital during the British Raj in 1911. Yet the market has not seen development.\n\nTimarpur is surrounded by many tourist attractions like the northern ridge near the North Campus of [[University_of_Delhi|Delhi University]]. The area holds a forest where people come to jog and exercise. It was at one time used by the British armed forces during the British Raj. The flag staff tower there was used by British families as a hiding spot during the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857. The Mutiny Memorial is also situated near the ridge and is an example of the British architecture that was used in India at that time.{{According to whom|date=July 2019}} It was built in memory of the British soldiers who were killed during the mutiny of 1857.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Next to the Mutiny Memorial, is an Ashoka pillar that was shifted to Delhi by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] (a king from the Tughlaq Dynasty).{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nApart from the historic monuments, Choudhary Sweets (now closed), and the Darvesh Restaurant are some of the eating spaces in Timarpur.{{Relevance inline|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Budh Bazaar, held every Wednesday inside the Central Government Flats, is a center of attraction.\n\nTimarpur dairy village of gurjars which supplies milk to the number of locals.\n\n\n==Education and health facilities==\n[[File:Timarpur Park.jpg|thumb|200px|Triangular Park in the Z-Block of Timarpur]]\n\nThe education facilities of Timarpur are moderate.

It is located on a [[river delta|delta]] island near the junction of the [[Barito River|Barito]] and [[Martapura River|Martapura]] rivers. As a result, Banjarmasin is sometimes called the \"River City\". Its population was 625,395 at the 2010 Census and estimated to be \nmore than 720,000 in late 2018.\n\n==Economy==\nMain economic sectors include transportation and communication (26.1% of the city's GDP), processing industries (24.9%) and trade and commerce (16.5%). Main processing industries are: [[plywood]], [[rattan]], and rubber manufacturing.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Administration==\nThe city of Banjarmasin is divided into five [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), listed below with their population at the 2010 Census:<ref>Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The town is served by a deepwater port, [[Trisakti Harbour]], which is the centre of the Barito basin; exports include [[rubber]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[timber]], [[petroleum]], [[coal]], [[gold]], and [[diamond]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Passenger ships and ferries to and from Java also carry their operation here.\n\nThe city is laced with flood-prone waterways, and many houses are built on rafts or stilts over the water. The waterways are also used for travel, using relatively small rowboats (only major rivers are accessible by larger speedboats, tugboats, longboats, and barges).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nBanjarmasin serves as the closest town to the large coal loading anchorage port of '''Taboneo'''.

The EIC attempted, highly unsuccessfully, to trade with the city between 1736 and 1746, and then in 1747 the Sultan signed a treaty with the Dutch giving them a trade monopoly.<ref>Long, George (1835) ''The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge: v. 1-27''.

From that time on, until the script was supplanted by an early version of Coptic (about the 3rd and 4th centuries AD), the system remained virtually unchanged. Even the number of signs used remained constant at about 700 for more than 2,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hieroglyph {{!}} writing character |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/265009/hieroglyph |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=5 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Egyptian===\n\nMiddle Egyptian was spoken for about 700 years, beginning around 2000 BC.<ref name=\"l5\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=5}}</ref> As the classical variant of Egyptian, Middle Egyptian is the best-documented variety of the language, and has attracted the most attention by far from [[Egyptology]].

It survived into the medieval period, but by the 16th century was dwindling rapidly due to the persecution of Coptic Christians under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that.

There was also a form of [[cursive hieroglyphs]], used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of [[typographic ligature#History|ligatures]]. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as \"lapidary hieratic\".{{cn|date=January 2019}}\nIn the language's final stage of development, the [[Coptic alphabet]] replaced the older writing system.\n\nHieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as [[ideogram]]s to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] to represent their [[phonetics|phonetic]] value.\n\nAs the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of [[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliteration]] to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.<ref name=\"a13\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=13}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Further|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian}}\nWhile the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact [[phonetics]] are unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates [[Old Latin]] from [[Italian language|Modern Italian]], significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.\n\nPhonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and [[emphatic consonant]]s, as in many Semitic languages, or one of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[ejective consonant]]s, as in many [[Cushitic languages]].<ref>See ''Egyptian Phonology'', by Carsten Peust, for a review of the history of thinking on the subject; his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.</ref>\n\nSince vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems. Also, scribal errors provide evidence of changes in pronunciation over time.\n\nThe actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686\u20132181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Early Egyptian consonants'''<ref name=\"l33\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=33}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n!

Two consonants, alef and ayin, are generally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}. Yodh is pronounced {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, ''w'' {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Between other consonants, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is then inserted. Thus, for example, the name of an Egyptian king is most accurately transliterated as ''R\ua725-ms-sw'' and transcribed as \"R\u0251m\u025bssu\"; it means \"[[Ra]] has Fashioned (literally, \"Borne\") Him\".\n\nIn [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|u}} all represent consonants; for example, the name [[Tutankhamun]] (1341\u20131323 BC) was written in Egyptian as ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn''. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. For example, the name ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn'' is conventionally pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|u\u02d0|t|\u0259n|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|m|\u0259|n}} in English, but, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *{{IPA-sem|ta\u02c8wa\u02d0t \u02c8\u0295a\u02d0nxu \u0294a\u02c8ma\u02d0n|}}.<ref>Fecht, Gerhard, ''Wortakzent und Silbenstruktur: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache'', J.

Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: ''s\u1e2bd\u1e2bd'' \"be upside-down\".\n\nVowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic {{angbr|stp}} \"to choose\", for example, can represent the [[stative]] (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the [[imperfective]] forms or even a [[verbal noun]] (\"a choosing\").\n\n===Nouns===\nEgyptian [[noun]]s can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ''-t'') and singular or plural (''-w / -wt''), or dual (''-wy / -ty'').\n\n[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.\n\n===Pronouns===\nEgyptian has three different types of [[personal pronoun]]s: suffix, [[clitic|enclitic]] (called \"dependent\" by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the [[infinitive]] to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=65}}</ref> as a \"fourth\" set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!\n!Suffix\n!Dependent\n!Independent\n|-\n!1st sg.\n|''-\u0131\u0357''\n|''w\u0131\u0357''\n|''\u0131\u0357nk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. m.\n|''-k''\n|''tw''\n|''ntk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. f.\n|''-t''\n|''tn''\n|''ntt''\n|-\n!3rd sg. m.\n|''-f''\n|''sw''\n|''ntf''\n|-\n!3rd sg. f.\n|''-s''\n|''sy''\n|''nts''\n|-\n!1st pl.\n|''-n''\n|''n''\n|''\u0131\u0357nn''\n|-\n!2nd pl.\n|''-tn''\n|''tn''\n|''nttn''\n|-\n!3rd pl.\n|''-sn''\n|''sn''\n|''ntsn''\n|}\n\nDemonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Mas.\n!Fem.\n!Plu.\n!Meaning\n|-\n|''pn''\n|''tn''\n|''nn''\n|this, that, these, those\n|-\n|''pf''\n|''tf''\n|''nf''\n|that, those\n|-\n|''pw''\n|''tw''\n|''nw''\n|this, that, these, those (archaic)\n|-\n|''p\ua723''\n|''t\ua723''\n|''n\ua723''\n|this, that, these, those (colloquial [earlier] & Late Egyptian)\n|}\n\nFinally are interrogative pronouns. They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and [[Berber language|Berber]] counterparts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Pronoun\n!Meaning\n!Dependency\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|who / what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''ptr''\n|who / what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''i\u1e2b''\n|what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357\u0161st''\n|what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''z\u0131\u0357''\n|which\n|Independent & Dependent\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\nEgyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.\n\nFinite verbs convey [[Grammatical person|person]], tense/[[Lexical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Each is indicated by a set of [[affix]]al morphemes attached to the verb: the basic conjugation is ''s\u1e0fm.f'' \"he hears\".\n\nNon-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the [[participle]]s and the negative infinitive, which ''[[Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs]]'' calls \"negatival complement\". There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: [[past tense|past]] and temporally-unmarked [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[aorist]] forms. The latter are determined from their [[syntax|syntactic]] context.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s agree in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and number with the nouns they modify: ''s nfr''  \"(the) good man\" and ''st nfrt''  \"(the) good woman\".\n\nAttributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: \"(the) great god\" (''n\u1e6fr \ua725\ua723'').\n\nHowever, when they are used independently as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in an [[adjectival phrase]], as \"(the) god (is) great\"  (''\ua725\ua723 n\u1e6fr'') (literally, \"great (is the) god\"), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.\n\n===Prepositions===\nEgyptian uses [[preposition]]s, as in English and many other Indo-European languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''m''\n|\"in, as, with, from\"\n|-\n|''n''\n|\"to, for\"\n|-\n|''r''\n|\"to, at\"\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357n''\n|\"by\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25n\ua725''\n|\"with\"\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"like\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25r''\n|\"on, upon\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25\ua723''\n|\"behind, around\"\n|-\n|''\u1e96r''\n|\"under\"\n|-\n|''tp''\n|\"atop\"\n|-\n|''\u1e0fr''\n|\"since\"\n|}\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: in ''z\u0131\u0357.n n\u1e6fr \u0131\u0357m'' \"the god went there\", \"there\" (''\u0131\u0357m'') is the adverb. Here are some other common Egyptian adverbs:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''\ua725\ua723''\n|\"here\"\n|-\n|''\u1e6fn\u0131\u0357''\n|\"where\"\n|-\n|''zy-nw''\n|\"when\" (lit. \"what moment\")\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357-\u0131\u0357\u1e2b''\n|\"how\"  (lit. \"like-what\")\n|-\n|''r-m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"why\"  (lit. \"for what\")\n|-\n|''\u1e2bnt''\n|\"before\"\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have [[verb-subject-object]] as the basic [[word order]]. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.\n\nThe equivalent to \"the man opens the door\" would be a sentence that would correspond, in the language's earlier stages, to \"opens the man the door\" (''wn s \ua725\ua723''). The so-called [[status constructus|construct state]] combines two or more nouns to express the [[genitive]], as in Semitic and [[Berber languages]].\n\nThe early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use ''p\ua723'', ''t\ua723'' and ''n\ua723''. As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see|Coptic language#Influence on other languages}}\n\nThe Egyptian language survived into the early modern period in the form of the [[Coptic language]]. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular.\n\nHowever, in antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on [[Classical Greek]], so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include \n''[[:wikt:ebony|ebony]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\udf41\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udfed\ud80c\uddb1 ''hbny'', via Greek and then Latin), \n''[[:wikt:ivory|ivory]]'' (Egyptian ''\ua723bw'', literally \"ivory, elephant\"),\n''[[:wikt:natron|natron]]'' (via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:lily|lily]]'' (Coptic ''hl\u0113ri'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:ibis|ibis]]'' (Egyptian ''hbj'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:oasis|oasis]]'' (Demotic ''w\u1e25j'', via Greek),\nperhaps ''[[:wikt:barge|barge]]'' (Greek [[Wikt:\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2|\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2]] ''baris'' \"Egyptian boat\" from Coptic \u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89 ''ba\u0294r\u0259'' \"small boat\" from Egyptian [[Wikt:b\ua723jr|b\ua723jr]] ),\nand possibly ''[[:wikt:cat|cat]]'';<ref>Often assumed to represent the precursor of Coptic \u03e3\u2c81\u2ca9 (''\u0161au'' \"tomcat\") suffixed with feminine ''-t'', but some authorities dispute this, e.g. John Huehnergard, \"Qitta: Arabic Cats\", ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'' (2007).</ref> and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with [[Ancient Egypt]], such as\n''[[:wikt:pharaoh|pharaoh]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\ude50\ud80c\ude7b ''pr-\ua725\ua723'', literally \"great house\", transmitted via Hebrew and Greek). The [[Name of Egypt|name ''Egypt'']] itself is etymologically identical to that of the ''[[Copts]]'', ultimately from the [[Late Egyptian]] name of [[Memphis (Egypt)|Memphis]], ''Hikuptah'', a continuation of Middle Egyptian ''{{transl|egy|[[wikt:\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25|\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25]]}}''  \"temple of the [[Egyptian soul|ka (soul)]] of [[Ptah]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hoffmeier|first =James K|title =Rameses of the Exodus narratives is the 13th B.C.

There was also a form of [[cursive hieroglyphs]], used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of [[typographic ligature#History|ligatures]]. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as \"lapidary hieratic\".{{cn|date=January 2019}}\nIn the language's final stage of development, the [[Coptic alphabet]] replaced the older writing system.\n\nHieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as [[ideogram]]s to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] to represent their [[phonetics|phonetic]] value.\n\nAs the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of [[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliteration]] to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.<ref name=\"a13\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=13}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Further|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian}}\nWhile the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact [[phonetics]] are unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates [[Old Latin]] from [[Italian language|Modern Italian]], significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.\n\nPhonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and [[emphatic consonant]]s, as in many Semitic languages, or one of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[ejective consonant]]s, as in many [[Cushitic languages]].<ref>See ''Egyptian Phonology'', by Carsten Peust, for a review of the history of thinking on the subject; his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.</ref>\n\nSince vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems. Also, scribal errors provide evidence of changes in pronunciation over time.\n\nThe actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686\u20132181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Early Egyptian consonants'''<ref name=\"l33\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=33}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n!

Two consonants, alef and ayin, are generally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}. Yodh is pronounced {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, ''w'' {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Between other consonants, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is then inserted. Thus, for example, the name of an Egyptian king is most accurately transliterated as ''R\ua725-ms-sw'' and transcribed as \"R\u0251m\u025bssu\"; it means \"[[Ra]] has Fashioned (literally, \"Borne\") Him\".\n\nIn [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|u}} all represent consonants; for example, the name [[Tutankhamun]] (1341\u20131323 BC) was written in Egyptian as ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn''. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. For example, the name ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn'' is conventionally pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|u\u02d0|t|\u0259n|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|m|\u0259|n}} in English, but, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *{{IPA-sem|ta\u02c8wa\u02d0t \u02c8\u0295a\u02d0nxu \u0294a\u02c8ma\u02d0n|}}.<ref>Fecht, Gerhard, ''Wortakzent und Silbenstruktur: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache'', J.

Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: ''s\u1e2bd\u1e2bd'' \"be upside-down\".\n\nVowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic {{angbr|stp}} \"to choose\", for example, can represent the [[stative]] (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the [[imperfective]] forms or even a [[verbal noun]] (\"a choosing\").\n\n===Nouns===\nEgyptian [[noun]]s can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ''-t'') and singular or plural (''-w / -wt''), or dual (''-wy / -ty'').\n\n[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.\n\n===Pronouns===\nEgyptian has three different types of [[personal pronoun]]s: suffix, [[clitic|enclitic]] (called \"dependent\" by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the [[infinitive]] to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=65}}</ref> as a \"fourth\" set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!\n!Suffix\n!Dependent\n!Independent\n|-\n!1st sg.\n|''-\u0131\u0357''\n|''w\u0131\u0357''\n|''\u0131\u0357nk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. m.\n|''-k''\n|''tw''\n|''ntk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. f.\n|''-t''\n|''tn''\n|''ntt''\n|-\n!3rd sg. m.\n|''-f''\n|''sw''\n|''ntf''\n|-\n!3rd sg. f.\n|''-s''\n|''sy''\n|''nts''\n|-\n!1st pl.\n|''-n''\n|''n''\n|''\u0131\u0357nn''\n|-\n!2nd pl.\n|''-tn''\n|''tn''\n|''nttn''\n|-\n!3rd pl.\n|''-sn''\n|''sn''\n|''ntsn''\n|}\n\nDemonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Mas.\n!Fem.\n!Plu.\n!Meaning\n|-\n|''pn''\n|''tn''\n|''nn''\n|this, that, these, those\n|-\n|''pf''\n|''tf''\n|''nf''\n|that, those\n|-\n|''pw''\n|''tw''\n|''nw''\n|this, that, these, those (archaic)\n|-\n|''p\ua723''\n|''t\ua723''\n|''n\ua723''\n|this, that, these, those (colloquial [earlier] & Late Egyptian)\n|}\n\nFinally are interrogative pronouns. They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and [[Berber language|Berber]] counterparts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Pronoun\n!Meaning\n!Dependency\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|who / what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''ptr''\n|who / what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''i\u1e2b''\n|what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357\u0161st''\n|what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''z\u0131\u0357''\n|which\n|Independent & Dependent\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\nEgyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.\n\nFinite verbs convey [[Grammatical person|person]], tense/[[Lexical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Each is indicated by a set of [[affix]]al morphemes attached to the verb: the basic conjugation is ''s\u1e0fm.f'' \"he hears\".\n\nNon-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the [[participle]]s and the negative infinitive, which ''[[Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs]]'' calls \"negatival complement\". There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: [[past tense|past]] and temporally-unmarked [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[aorist]] forms. The latter are determined from their [[syntax|syntactic]] context.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s agree in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and number with the nouns they modify: ''s nfr''  \"(the) good man\" and ''st nfrt''  \"(the) good woman\".\n\nAttributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: \"(the) great god\" (''n\u1e6fr \ua725\ua723'').\n\nHowever, when they are used independently as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in an [[adjectival phrase]], as \"(the) god (is) great\"  (''\ua725\ua723 n\u1e6fr'') (literally, \"great (is the) god\"), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.\n\n===Prepositions===\nEgyptian uses [[preposition]]s, as in English and many other Indo-European languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''m''\n|\"in, as, with, from\"\n|-\n|''n''\n|\"to, for\"\n|-\n|''r''\n|\"to, at\"\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357n''\n|\"by\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25n\ua725''\n|\"with\"\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"like\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25r''\n|\"on, upon\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25\ua723''\n|\"behind, around\"\n|-\n|''\u1e96r''\n|\"under\"\n|-\n|''tp''\n|\"atop\"\n|-\n|''\u1e0fr''\n|\"since\"\n|}\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: in ''z\u0131\u0357.n n\u1e6fr \u0131\u0357m'' \"the god went there\", \"there\" (''\u0131\u0357m'') is the adverb. Here are some other common Egyptian adverbs:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''\ua725\ua723''\n|\"here\"\n|-\n|''\u1e6fn\u0131\u0357''\n|\"where\"\n|-\n|''zy-nw''\n|\"when\" (lit. \"what moment\")\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357-\u0131\u0357\u1e2b''\n|\"how\"  (lit. \"like-what\")\n|-\n|''r-m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"why\"  (lit. \"for what\")\n|-\n|''\u1e2bnt''\n|\"before\"\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have [[verb-subject-object]] as the basic [[word order]]. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.\n\nThe equivalent to \"the man opens the door\" would be a sentence that would correspond, in the language's earlier stages, to \"opens the man the door\" (''wn s \ua725\ua723''). The so-called [[status constructus|construct state]] combines two or more nouns to express the [[genitive]], as in Semitic and [[Berber languages]].\n\nThe early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use ''p\ua723'', ''t\ua723'' and ''n\ua723''. As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see|Coptic language#Influence on other languages}}\n\nThe Egyptian language survived into the early modern period in the form of the [[Coptic language]]. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular.\n\nHowever, in antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on [[Classical Greek]], so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include \n''[[:wikt:ebony|ebony]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\udf41\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udfed\ud80c\uddb1 ''hbny'', via Greek and then Latin), \n''[[:wikt:ivory|ivory]]'' (Egyptian ''\ua723bw'', literally \"ivory, elephant\"),\n''[[:wikt:natron|natron]]'' (via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:lily|lily]]'' (Coptic ''hl\u0113ri'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:ibis|ibis]]'' (Egyptian ''hbj'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:oasis|oasis]]'' (Demotic ''w\u1e25j'', via Greek),\nperhaps ''[[:wikt:barge|barge]]'' (Greek [[Wikt:\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2|\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2]] ''baris'' \"Egyptian boat\" from Coptic \u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89 ''ba\u0294r\u0259'' \"small boat\" from Egyptian [[Wikt:b\ua723jr|b\ua723jr]] ),\nand possibly ''[[:wikt:cat|cat]]'';<ref>Often assumed to represent the precursor of Coptic \u03e3\u2c81\u2ca9 (''\u0161au'' \"tomcat\") suffixed with feminine ''-t'', but some authorities dispute this, e.g. John Huehnergard, \"Qitta: Arabic Cats\", ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'' (2007).</ref> and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with [[Ancient Egypt]], such as\n''[[:wikt:pharaoh|pharaoh]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\ude50\ud80c\ude7b ''pr-\ua725\ua723'', literally \"great house\", transmitted via Hebrew and Greek). The [[Name of Egypt|name ''Egypt'']] itself is etymologically identical to that of the ''[[Copts]]'', ultimately from the [[Late Egyptian]] name of [[Memphis (Egypt)|Memphis]], ''Hikuptah'', a continuation of Middle Egyptian ''{{transl|egy|[[wikt:\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25|\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25]]}}''  \"temple of the [[Egyptian soul|ka (soul)]] of [[Ptah]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hoffmeier|first =James K|title =Rameses of the Exodus narratives is the 13th B.C.

However, he was confronted a few months later by Cash, Nav's manager, and admitted that he was lying in an attempt to stir up controversy and gain attention.\n\nIn August 2018, Nav featured on Travis Scott's third studio album, ''[[Astroworld (album)|Astroworld]]'', on the song \"[[Yosemite (song)|Yosemite]]\" alongside fellow rapper [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]].

Scott and producer [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] later confirmed this was an error, and re-mixed and re-released the track on streaming services with the updated vocal mix a week after the release of the song and album.\n\nIn March 2019 during an interview with Pitchfork, Nav expressed his frustration stating that \"Fame is something I want, it's a good problem to have. I'm still not there, because when I walk out of fucking Delilah in L.A. and [[TMZ]] will be standing out there with cameras and not even take a picture of me, I get sick.

He stated that it was commonly used among his friends, but once he had gotten global exposure, Nav said he started seeing some backlash.

In his tweets, Nav shared his thoughts that had ranged \"from angry and bitter to motivational and inspirational\". After his tweets and release of the single, Nav decided to step it up a notch by sending shots at the outlet's editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten through now deleted Instagram posts and further continued to diss the outlet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://hiphopwired.com/747419/nav-blasts-xxls-editor-in-chief-says-freshmen-list-website-is-trash/ | title=Nav Blasts XXL's Editor-In-Chief, Says Freshmen List & Website is Trash| date=2018-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Nav and Lil Uzi Vert were accused by Kid Buu of stealing his flow for their hit single, \"Wanted You\" which had charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, he was confronted a few months later by Cash, Nav's manager, and admitted that he was lying in an attempt to stir up controversy and gain attention.\n\nIn August 2018, Nav featured on Travis Scott's third studio album, ''[[Astroworld (album)|Astroworld]]'', on the song \"[[Yosemite (song)|Yosemite]]\" alongside fellow rapper [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]]. He was the subject of many [[Internet meme|memes]] mocking his feature, as the ending of the song, which Nav's four vocals lines were recorded, was initially mixed at a very low volume. Nav himself shared a meme on his Instagram, laughing at the error. Scott and producer [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] later confirmed this was an error, and re-mixed and re-released the track on streaming services with the updated vocal mix a week after the release of the song and album.\n\nIn March 2019 during an interview with Pitchfork, Nav expressed his frustration stating that \"Fame is something I want, it's a good problem to have. I'm still not there, because when I walk out of fucking Delilah in L.A. and [[TMZ]] will be standing out there with cameras and not even take a picture of me, I get sick.
