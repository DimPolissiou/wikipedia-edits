{"title_page": "French space program", "text_new": "{{confusing|date=January 2020}}\n{{expand French|Programme spatial fran\u00e7ais|category=Articles needing translation from French Wikipedia|date=August 2014}}\nThe '''French space program''' includes both [[commercial spaceflight|civil]] and [[military]] [[spaceflight]] activities. It is the 3rd oldest institutional space program in history, along with the [[USSR]] and the [[US]]; and the largest space program in [[Europe]].\n\n\nThe '''presidency of Donald Trump''' began at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2017, when [[Donald Trump]] was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[president of the United States]], succeeding [[Barack Obama]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Trump was a businessman and [[reality television]] personality from [[New York City]] at the time of his [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]. While Trump lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes, he won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote, 304 to 227, in a presidential contest that American intelligence agencies concluded was targeted by [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|a Russian interference campaign]]. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, with political scientists and historians widely describing the phenomenon as unprecedented in modern American politics. Trump's approval rating has been stable, hovering at high-30 to mid-40 percent throughout his presidency.\n\nTrump rolled back numerous [[Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration|environmental protections]], as well as reduced enforcement of existing regulations. He ended the [[Clean Power Plan]], [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|withdrew]] from the [[Paris Agreement]] on [[climate change mitigation]], and urged for subsidies to increase fossil fuel production, calling man-made climate change a hoax. Trump failed in his efforts to repeal the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), but took numerous actions that hindered the functioning of the ACA, as well as sought to have the courts rule the entirety of the ACA unconstitutional. Despite pledges made as a candidate, President Trump sought substantial spending cuts to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]] and [[Social Security Disability Insurance]]. He enacted [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act|a partial repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act]] that had previously imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the [[2008 financial crisis]] and withdrew from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]. Trump signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which lowered corporate and estate taxes permanently, and lowered most individual income tax rates temporarily while increasing them for some. He enacted [[Trump tariffs|tariffs]] on steel and aluminum imports and other goods, triggering retaliatory tariffs from [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the [[European Union]], and [[2018 China\u2013United States trade war|a trade war with China]]. These tariffs adversely affected the U.S. economy. On the whole, the economy kept improving, following trends from the Obama presidency. However, the federal deficit soared under Trump due to spending increases and tax cuts.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" foreign policy has featured more unilateral American actions, disregarding the advice and support of many traditional allies while drawing the United States closer to others like [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Israel]]. Despite pledges to reduce the U.S. military personnel deployed overseas, the number was essentially the same three years into Trump's presidency as they were at the end of Obama's. Trump's administration [[2017 United States\u2013Saudi Arabia arms deal|agreed to sell $110 billion of arms to Saudi Arabia]], [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and issued [[Executive Order 13769|a controversial executive order]] denying entry into the U.S. to citizens from several Muslim-majority countries. His administration [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|withdrew U.S. troops]] from northern Syria, allowing [[2019 Rojava offensive|Turkey to attack American-allied Kurds]]. The Trump administration unilaterally decided to hold talks with North Korea, with Trump saying he and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un \"fell in love\". Trump [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew the United States from the Iran Deal]], and escalated the dispute with Iran by assassinating Iranian General [[Qasem Soleimani]]. [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier#Trump%20administration|Trump's demand for federal funding of a U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall]] resulted in [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019|the 2018\u20132019 government shutdown]] (the longest in American history) and followed with Trump's declaration of a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States|national emergency regarding the U.S. southern border]]. He ended the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program which had provided temporary protection for undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. as minors. The Trump administration implemented a family separation policy for migrants apprehended at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, controversially separating parents from their children, resulting in bipartisan condemnation and international outcry.\n\nAfter Trump [[Dismissal of James Comey|dismissed]] FBI Director [[James Comey]] in May 2017, a former FBI director, [[Robert Mueller]], was appointed as [[Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|special counsel]] to take over [[Operation Crossfire Hurricane|a prior FBI investigation]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 elections]] and related matters, including coordination or [[Links between Trump associates and Russian officials|links]] between the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] and the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]]. Six Trump campaign advisers and staff were indicted and five pled guilty to [[Criminal charges brought in the Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|criminal charges]]. Trump repeatedly denied [[Conspiracy|collusion]] or [[obstruction of justice]], and frequently criticized the investigation, calling it a politically motivated \"[[Witch hunt#Figurative%20use%20of%20the%20term|witch hunt]]\". Mueller concluded his investigation in March 2019, with a report of the probe showing Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's. The report concluded the prevailing evidence \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\" but documented ten actions by the Trump presidency that could be construed as obstruction of justice. The Mueller team could not indict Trump once investigators decided to abide by an [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and did not exonerate Trump on this issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] decided the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate a criminal offense of obstruction. Barr later said he had not exonerated Trump.\n\n[[United States House of Representatives|The House of Representatives]] launched [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|an impeachment inquiry]] following a September 2019 report that Trump had [[Abuse of power|abused his presidential power]] by [[Trump-Ukraine scandal|pressuring the president of Ukraine]] to undertake actions which would [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|have the effect of helping Trump's 2020 re-election campaign]]. Among other inducements, Trump ordered congressionally-mandated military aid for Ukraine to be withheld. Witnesses subsequently testified that he and his surrogates had been carrying out that pressure campaign for months. On December 18, 2019, Trump became the third president in American history to be [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached]]. The [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|trial]] took place from January 16 to February 5, 2020; he was acquitted of all charges.\n\n== Contents ==\n\n* [[Presidency of Donald

presidential primaries]], and [[2016 Republican National Convention]]\nTrump defeated Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]] in the 2016 presidential election, taking 304 of the 538 electoral votes. Five other individuals received electoral votes from [[Faithless electors in the United States presidential election, 2016|faithless electors]].\n\nOn November 9, 2016, Republicans [[Donald Trump]] of New York and Governor [[Mike Pence]] of Indiana won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], defeating Democrats former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] of New York and Senator [[Tim Kaine]] of Virginia. Trump won 304 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 227, though Clinton won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote, receiving nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump. Trump thus became the fifth person to [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|win the presidency while losing the popular vote]]. In the concurrent congressional elections, Republicans maintained majorities in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n\nTrump made false claims that massive amounts of [[Electoral fraud|voter fraud]]\u2014up to five million illegal votes\u2014in Clinton's favor occurred during the election, and he called for a major investigation after taking office. Numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\n== Transition period, inauguration and first 100 days ==\nMain articles: [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump]] and [[Inauguration of Donald Trump]]\n\nSee also: [[First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency]] and [[Timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump]]\nOutgoing President [[Barack Obama]] and President-elect Donald Trump in the [[Oval Office]] on November 10, 2016\n\nPrior to the election, Trump named [[Chris Christie]] as the leader of his [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]]. After the election, Vice President-elect Mike Pence replaced Christie as chairman of the transition team, while Christie became a vice-chairman alongside Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] of Alabama, retired Army Lt. Gen. [[Michael Flynn]], former New York City Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], former presidential candidate [[Ben Carson]], and former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]].\n\nTrump was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated]] on January 20, 2017. Accompanied by his wife, [[Melania Trump]], he was sworn in by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]]. In his seventeen-minute inaugural address, Trump made a broad condemnation of contemporary America, pledging to end \"American carnage\" and saying America's \"wealth, strength and confidence has dissipated\". He repeated the \"America First\" slogan he had used in the campaign and promised that \"[e]very decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American factories\". At the age of seventy, Trump surpassed Ronald Reagan and became the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|oldest person]] to assume the presidency, and the first without any prior government or military experience. The largest single-day protest in the history of the United States was [[Protests against Donald Trump|against Trump's Presidency]] the day after his inauguration.\n\nOne of Trump's major first year accomplishments, made as part of a \"100-day [[Promise|pledge]]\", was the confirmation of [[Neil Gorsuch]] as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. Structurally, President Trump had the advantage of a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] majority in the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]], but was unable to fulfill his major pledges in his first 100 days and had an [[United States presidential approval rating|approval rating]] of between 40 and 42 percent, \"the lowest for any first-term president at this point in his tenure\".<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> Although he tried to make progress on one of his key economic policies\u2014the dismantling of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]\u2014his failure to repeal the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) in the first 100 days was a major setback. None of the bills passed by Trump are considered to be \"major bills\"\u2014based on a \"longstanding political-science standard for 'major bills'\". Trump signed 24 [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]] in his first 100 days, the most [[List of executive actions by Donald Trump|executive orders]] of any president since [[World War II]].\n\n== Personnel ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |The Trump Cabinet\n|-\n!Office\n!Name\n!Term\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|[[President of the United States|President]]\n![[Donald Trump]]\n|2017\u2013present\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]\n![[Mike Pence]]\n|2017\u2013present\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]\n![[Rex Tillerson]]\n|2017\u20132018\n|-\n![[John J.

By the end of his first year in office, 34% of Trump's original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. As of early March 2018, 43% of senior White House positions had turned over. The administration had a higher turnover rate in the first two and a half years than the five previous presidents did over their entire terms. By October 2019, one in 14 of Trump's political appointees were former lobbyists; less than three years into his presidency, Trump had appointed more than four times as many lobbyists than Obama did over the course of his first six years in office.\n\nOn September 5, 2018, ''The New York Times'' published an article entitled \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\", written by an anonymous senior official in the Trump administration. The author asserted that \"many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.\"\n\n=== Cabinet ===\nMain article: [[Cabinet of Donald Trump]]\n\nFurther information: [[Formation of Donald Trump's cabinet]]\n\nDays after the presidential election, Trump selected RNC Chairman [[Reince Priebus]] as his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]]. Priebus and Senior Counselor [[Steve Bannon]] were named as \"equal partners\" within the [[White House]] power structure, although Bannon was not an official member of the Cabinet. On November 18, Trump announced he had chosen Alabama Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] for the position of Attorney General.\n\nIn February 2017, Trump formally announced his cabinet structure, elevating the [[Director of National Intelligence]] and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director of the CIA]] to cabinet level. The [[Council of Economic Advisers#Chairmen%20and%20members|Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers]], which had been added to the cabinet by Obama in 2009, was removed from the cabinet. Trump's cabinet now consists of 24 members, more than Barack Obama at 23 or George W. Bush at 21. His final initial Cabinet-level nominee, U.S. Trade Representative [[Robert Lighthizer]], was confirmed on May 12, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, [[John F. Kelly]], who had served as [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], replaced Priebus as Chief of Staff. Bannon was fired in August 2017, leaving Kelly as one of the most powerful individuals in the White House. In September 2017, [[Tom Price (American politician)|Tom Price]] resigned as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] amid criticism over [[Tom Price private jet scandal|his use of private charter jets]] for his personal travel. [[Don J. Wright]] replaced Price as acting Secretary of Health and Human Services. [[Kirstjen Nielsen]] succeeded Kelly as Secretary in December 2017. Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] was fired via a tweet in March 2018; Trump appointed [[Mike Pompeo]] to replace Tillerson and [[Gina Haspel]] to succeed Pompeo as the Director of the CIA. In the wake of a series of controversies, [[Scott Pruitt]] resigned as [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in July 2018. Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler is slated to serve as acting administrator beginning July 9, 2018. At the time of Pruitt's resignation, he is the fifth member of Trump's cabinet to resign or be fired since Trump took office.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has made two [[Unsuccessful nominations to the Cabinet of the United States|unsuccessful cabinet nominations]]. [[Andrew Puzder]] was nominated for the position of Secretary of Labor in 2017, while [[Ronny Jackson]], who had previously served as [[Physician to the President|the President's physician]], was nominated as Secretary of Veterans Affairs in 2018. Each withdrew their name from consideration after facing opposition in the Senate.\n\n=== Notable departures ===\nMain article: [[List of Trump administration dismissals and resignations]]\n\nIn the first 13 months of the administration of Donald Trump, the White House staff had a higher turnover than the previous four presidents had in the first two years of their respective administrations. By March 2018, White House staff turnover was estimated at 43%.\n\n==== Firing of Michael Flynn ====\nOn February 13, 2017, Trump fired Michael Flynn from the post of National Security Adviser on grounds that he had lied to Vice President Pence about his communications with the Russian Ambassador to the United States, [[Sergey Kislyak]]. Flynn was fired amidst the ongoing controversy concerning [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] and accusations that Trump's electoral team colluded with Russian agents. In May 2017, [[Sally Yates]] testified before the Senate Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism that she had told White House Counsel Don McGahn in late January 2017 Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials and warned McGahn that Flynn was potentially compromised by Russia. Flynn remained in his post for another two weeks and was fired after ''[[The Washington Post]]'' broke the story. Yates was fired by Donald Trump on January 30 because \"she defiantly refused to defend his executive order closing the nation's borders to refugees and people from predominantly Muslim countries\".\n\n==== Firing of James Comey ====\nMain article: [[Dismissal of James Comey]]\n\nTrump dismissed [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI director]] [[James Comey]] on May 9, 2017, saying he had accepted the recommendations of the Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] and Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] to dismiss Comey. Sessions' recommendation was based on Rosenstein's, while Rosenstein wrote that Comey should be dismissed for his handling of the conclusion of the FBI investigation into the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy]].\n\nOn May 10, Trump met Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] and Russian Ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]]. Based on White House notes of [[Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information|the meeting]], Trump told the Russians: \"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job ... I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.\" On May 11, Trump said in a videoed interview: \"... regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey ... in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\" On May 18, Rosenstein told members of the U.S. Senate that he recommended Comey's dismissal while knowing Trump had already decided to fire Comey. On May 31, Trump wrote on [[Twitter]]: \"I never fired James Comey because of Russia!\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Comey's firing, the events were compared with those of the \"[[Saturday Night Massacre]]\" during [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration, and there was debate over whether Trump had provoked a [[constitutional crisis]] as he had dismissed the man leading an investigation into Trump's associates.\n\nComey had previously prepared seven detailed memos, four of which contained [[Classified information in the United States|classified]] information, documenting most of his meetings and telephone conversations with President Trump. He provided some of the memos to his friend [[Daniel Richman]], who then released the substance of the memos to the press. Comey later told the Senate Intelligence Committee he created written records immediately after his conversations with Trump because he \"was honestly concerned that he [Trump] might lie about the nature of our meeting\". In his memo about a February 14, 2017, Oval Office meeting, Comey says Trump attempted to persuade him to abort the investigation into General Flynn.\n\nIn a May 2017 interview, Trump said he was thinking of \"this Russia thing\" when he decided to fire FBI Director James Comey. Trump's statement raised concerns of potential obstruction of justice. In May 2018 Trump denied firing Comey because of the Russia investigation. In August 2018 Trump tweeted \"Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia,\" followed by his attorney [[Jay Sekulow]] asserting in September 2018 that NBC had edited the Trump interview. Neither Trump nor Sekulow produced evidence that the tape had been modified.\n\n==== Resignation of Jim Mattis ====\nSecretary of Defense [[Jim Mattis]] informed Trump of his resignation following Trump's abrupt December 19, 2018, announcement that the remaining 2,000 American troops in Syria would be withdrawn, against the recommendations of his military and civilian advisors. In his resignation letter, Mattis appeared to criticize Trump's worldview, praising NATO, which Trump has often derided, as well as the Defeat-ISIS coalition Trump had just decided to abandon. Mattis' resignation became effective on February 28, 2019.\n\n== Judicial nominees ==\nFurther information: [[Donald Trump Supreme Court candidates]], [[List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump]], and [[Donald Trump judicial appointment controversies]]\n\nIn his first month in office, Trump [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] federal appellate judge [[Neil Gorsuch]] to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy which arose after the February 2016 death of [[Antonin Scalia]] and which had not been filled under the then-president Obama because of Republican obstruction. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate in a 54\u201345 vote. Prior to this nomination, the support of three-fifths of the Senate had effectively been required for the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees due to the Senate [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]]. However, the Senate's Republican majority changed the rules for the filibuster via the so-called \"[[nuclear option]]\", and the confirmation of Supreme Court justices now requires only a simple majority vote.\n\nIn June 2018, Associate Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], widely considered to be the key swing vote on the Supreme Court, announced his retirement. Trump [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Brett Kavanaugh]], a [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] judge, to fill the vacancy. During the [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|confirmation process]], Kavanaugh was accused of sexually assaulting Dr. [[Christine Blasey Ford]] while they were both in high school. The Senate voted 50\u201348 to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\nBy November 2018, Trump had appointed 29 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]], more than any modern president in the first two years of a presidential term. Compared to President Obama, Trump has nominated fewer non-white and female judges. Trump's judicial nominees tended to be young and favored by the conservative [[Federalist Society]].\n\n== Leadership style ==\nTrump reportedly eschews reading detailed briefing documents, including the [[President's Daily Brief]], in favor of receiving oral briefings. Intelligence briefers reportedly repeat the President's name and title in order to keep his attention. He is also known to acquire information by watching up to eight hours of television each day, most notably Fox News programs such as ''[[Fox & Friends]]'' and ''[[Hannity]]'', whose broadcast talking points Trump sometimes repeats in public statements, particularly in early morning tweets. Trump reportedly expresses anger if intelligence analyses contradict his beliefs or public statements, with two briefers stating they have been instructed by superiors to not provide Trump with information that contradicts his public statements.\n\nTrump has reportedly fostered chaos as a management technique, resulting in low morale and policy confusion among his staff, although he has maintained his White House runs like a \"well-oiled machine\". Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of [[organizational behavior]] at [[Stanford]], noted Trump possesses several management qualities that are prevalent among many leaders, including [[narcissism]] and dishonesty, but added, \"With a modicum of management skill he could have gotten his wall, and he would probably be on the path to re-election. But he has very few accomplishments to his credit.\" Trump proved unable to effectively compromise during the [[115th United States Congress]], which led to significant governmental [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock]] and few notable legislative accomplishments despite Republican control of both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Presidential historian [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] found Trump lacks several traits of an effective leader, including \"humility, acknowledging errors, shouldering blame and learning from mistakes, empathy, resilience, collaboration, connecting with people and controlling unproductive emotions\". ''The New York Times'' reported that \"before taking office, Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.\"\n\nIn January 2018, ''[[Axios (website)|Axios]]'' reported Trump's working hours were typically around 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (a later start and an earlier end compared to the beginning of his presidency) and that he was holding fewer meetings during his working hours, in order to accommodate Trump's desire for more unstructured free time (labelled as \"executive time\"). Later that year, [[Politico]] reported Trump's schedule for October 22\u201326 that he never started work earlier than 11:00 a.m., had large amounts of \"executive time\" and only a total of two hours of policy briefings in five days. In 2019, ''Axios'' published Trump's schedule from November 7, 2018, to February 1, 2019, and calculated that around 60% of the time between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. was \"executive time\".\n\n=== False and misleading statements ===\nMain article: [[Veracity of statements by Donald Trump]]\n\nAs president, Trump has made so many false statements in public speeches, remarks, and in [[Twitter#Tweets|tweets]], that media commentators and [[Fact-checker|fact-checkers]] have described the rate of his falsehoods as unprecedented for an American president or even unprecedented in politics. This trait of his was similarly observed when he was a presidential candidate. His falsehoods have become a distinctive part of his political identity, and they have also described as part of a [[gaslighting]] tactic. His White House has dismissed the idea of objective truth, and his campaign and presidency have been described as being \"[[post-truth]]\" and hyper-[[Orwellian]], Trump's rhetorical signature includes disregarding data from federal institutions which are incompatible to his arguments, quoting hearsay, anecdotal evidence and questionable claims in partisan media, denying reality (including his own statements), and distracting when falsehoods are exposed.\n\nDuring the first year of Trump's presidency, ''The Washington Post's'' fact-checker wrote, \"President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered ... the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.\" By August 2018, the pace of the false statements increased substantially. In June and July alone 968 new incidences had been noted, and a total of 4,229 \"false or misleading\" statements had by then been recorded in his tenure. Immigration issues led the subject list at that point, with 538 recorded mendacities.\n\nSenior administration officials have also regularly given false, misleading or tortured statements to the news media. By May 2017, ''Politico'' reported that the repeated untruths by senior officials made it difficult for the news media to take official statements seriously.\n\nTrump's presidency started out with a series of falsehoods initiated by Trump himself. The day after his inauguration, he falsely accused the news media of lying about the size of the inauguration crowd. Then he proceeded to exaggerate the size, and Press Secretary [[Sean Spicer]] backed up his claims. When Spicer was accused of intentionally misstating the figures, senior adviser [[Kellyanne Conway]], in an interview with NBC's [[Chuck Todd]], defended Spicer by saying he had merely presented \"[[alternative facts]]\". Other notable claims by Trump which [[Fact checking|fact checkers]] rated false include the claim that his electoral college victory was a \"landslide\" and that Hillary Clinton received three to five million illegal votes.\n\nIn the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections\u2014it had risen to an average of 30 per day from 4.9 during his first 100 days in office. ''The Washington Post'' found that Trump averaged 15 false statements per day during 2018. As of December 2019, Trump had made more than 15,000 false or misleading claims while in office.\n\n=== Rule of law ===\nShortly before Trump secured the 2016 Republican nomination, ''The New York Times'' reported \"legal experts across the political spectrum say\" Trump's rhetoric reflected \"a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law,\" adding \"many conservative and libertarian legal scholars warn that electing Mr. Trump is a recipe for a constitutional crisis.\" A group named \"[[Originalism|Originalists]] Against Trump\" declared in October 2016, \"Trump's long record of statements and conduct have shown him indifferent or hostile to the Constitution's basic features.\"\n\nAs the Trump presidency unfolded, numerous prominent conservative Republicans expressed similar concerns that Trump's perceived disregard for the rule of law betrayed conservative principles. ''The Times'' reported in November 2018 that more than a dozen members of the conservative-libertarian [[Federalist Society]]\u2014which had been instrumental in selecting Trump's appointments to federal courts\u2014\"are urging their fellow conservatives to speak up about what they say are the Trump administration's betrayals of bedrock legal norms\".\n\nDuring the first two years of his presidency, Trump repeatedly sought to influence the Justice Department to investigate those he saw as his political adversaries\u2014including Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, James Comey and the FBI\u2014regarding a variety of persistent allegations, at least some of which had already been investigated or debunked. In spring 2018, Trump told White House counsel [[Don McGahn]] he wanted to order the DOJ to prosecute Clinton and Comey, but McGahn advised Trump such action would constitute abuse of power and invite possible impeachment. In May 2018 Trump demanded that the DOJ investigate \"whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes\", which the DOJ referred to its inspector general. Although it is not unlawful for a president to exert influence on the DOJ to open an investigation, presidents have assiduously avoided doing so to prevent perceptions of political interference.\n\nSome of Trump's congressional allies asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel to investigate the FBI and an alleged [[Uranium One controversy]] involving Clinton; Sessions instead appointed in May 2018 federal prosecutor [[John W. Huber|John Huber]] to examine the matters and make a recommendation as to whether a special counsel was justified. Sessions otherwise resisted demands by Trump and his allies for investigations, causing Trump to repeatedly express frustration, saying at one point, \"I don't have an attorney general.\"\n\n[[Matthew Whitaker]], a Trump loyalist whom the President appointed to succeed Sessions as Acting Attorney General in November 2018, had in 2017 reportedly provided private advice to Trump on how the White House might pressure the Justice Department to investigate the President's adversaries, including appointing a special counsel to investigate the FBI and Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president, in November 2018 [[Chief Justice of the United States|Supreme Court Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded to Trump's characterization of a judge who had ruled against his policies as an \"Obama judge\", adding \"That's not law.\" Roberts wrote, \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nTrump has on multiple occasions either suggested or promoted views of extending his presidency beyond normal term limits.\n\nWhile criticizing the special counsel investigation in July 2019, Trump falsely claimed that [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]] ensures that: \"I have to the right to do whatever I want as president\". Also in July 2019, Trump said that \"free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposefully write bad ... To me that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it.\" Trump's definition contradicts the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on free speech.\n\nIn a December 2019 opinion piece, former FBI director, CIA director and federal judge [[William H. Webster|William Webster]] wrote of \"a dire threat to the rule of law in the country I love\". Webster asserted that \"the integrity of the institutions that protect our civil order are, tragically, under assault,\" writing that \"aspersions cast upon [FBI employees] by the president and my longtime friend, Attorney General William P. Barr, are troubling in the extreme.\" Since 2005, Webster had served as the chair of the [[Homeland Security Advisory Council]].\n\nTrump has frequently criticized the independence of the judiciary branch for unfairly interfering in his administration's ability to decide policy. In February 2020, Trump said Supreme Court justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]] should \"recuse themselves for anything having to do with Trump\". The duo have liberal views. Ginsburg had criticized Trump during his 2016 election campaign, while Sotomayor in February 2020 criticized the federal government for abusing emergency applications to get approvals for their policies, as well as criticizing her Supreme Court colleagues for \"recent behavior\" that constantly sided with the government on these applications. Many legal scholars supported the justices and criticized Trump.\n\n=== Relationship with the news media ===\nTrump talks to the press, March 21, 2017, before signing S.422, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act, in the Oval Office\nTrump speaks to reporters on the White House South Lawn in June 2019\n\nEarly into his presidency, Trump developed a highly contentious relationship with the news media, repeatedly referring to them as the \"[[fake news]] media\" and \"the [[enemy of the people]]\". As a candidate, Trump had refused press credentials for offending publications but said he would not do so if elected. President Trump both privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' [[White House press corps|White House press credentials]]. At the same time, the Trump White House gave temporary press passes to far-right pro-Trump fringe outlets, such as ''[[InfoWars]]'' and ''[[The Gateway Pundit]]'', which are known for publishing hoaxes and conspiracy theories.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump falsely accused journalists of understating the size of the crowd at his inauguration, and called the news media \"among the most dishonest human beings on earth\". Trump's claims were notably defended by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who claimed the inauguration crowd had been the biggest in history, a claim disproven by photographs. Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway then defended Spicer when asked about the falsehood, saying it was an \"[[alternative fact]]\", not a falsehood.\n\nOn February 16, 2017, less than a month into his presidency, Trump held a press conference during which he claimed the news media were not speaking for the people, but for \"[[Special interest|special interests]]\". He said they were dishonest, out of control and doing a disservice to the American people. The following day, Trump tweeted, \"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\" Trump did not hold another formal press conference for several years. Rather than press conferences, Trump preferred to engage with the press in informal \"gaggles\" on the White House lawn as he prepared to board his helicopter.\n\nLater in the month, the administration blocked reporters from ''The New York Times'', BuzzFeed News, CNN, ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''Politico'' from attending an off-camera briefing with Press Secretary [[Sean Spicer]]. Reporters from ''Time'' magazine and The Associated Press chose not to attend the briefing in protest at the White House's actions. ''The New York Times'' described the move as \"a highly unusual breach of relations between the White House and its press corps\", and the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] issued a statement of protest.\n\nIn March 2017, all major U.S. television networks declined to air a paid campaign ad placed by the 2020 Trump campaign which included a graphic claiming that the mainstream news media are \"fake news\". In a statement, CNN said they \"requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that the mainstream media is 'fake news'\". [[Lara Trump]], daughter-in-law to Trump and adviser for his campaign, called the rejection a \"chilling precedent against free speech rights\", and \"an unprecedented act of censorship in America that should concern every freedom-loving citizen\".\n\nThe relationship between Trump, the news media, and fake news has been studied. One study found that between October 7 and November 14, 2016, while one in four Americans visited a [[fake news website]], \"Trump supporters visited the most fake news websites, which were overwhelmingly pro-Trump\" and \"almost 6 in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10% of people with the most conservative online information diets\". [[Brendan Nyhan]], one of the authors of the study by researchers from [[Princeton University]], [[Dartmouth College]], and the [[University of Exeter]], said in an interview: \"People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites.\"\n\nIn May 2018, Trump tweeted \"91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake).\" ''The Washington Post'' described this Trump making it \"explicit\" that negative coverage on him has to be fake. Also that month, CBS journalist [[Lesley Stahl]] recounted that after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, he had told her that he kept attacking the news media to \"demean\" and \"discredit\" them \"... so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".\n\nTrump also attacked ''The New York Times'' on their coverage of a White House briefing on the [[2018 North Korea\u2013United States Singapore Summit]]. Trump claimed that the anonymous \"senior White House official\" the newspaper quoted \"doesn't exist\", instructing: \"Use real people, not phony sources\". Following Trump's claim, journalists provided audio evidence of the official being introduced as Matt Pottinger of the National Security Council, with White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah insisting that Pottinger's anonymity was required. The White House's invitation for the briefing to journalists also surfaced.\n\n''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called for a nationwide refutation of Trump's \"dirty war\" against the news media, with the hashtag #EnemyOfNone. More than 300 news outlets joined the campaign. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Trump's attacks \"dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy\" and published excerpts from dozens of further publications. ''[[The New York Post]]'' wrote, \"It may be frustrating to argue that just because we print inconvenient truths doesn't mean that we're fake news, but being a journalist isn't a popularity contest. All we can do is to keep reporting.\" ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote, \"If the press is not free from reprisal, punishment or suspicion for unpopular views or information, neither is the country. Neither are its people\"\nDuring a joint news conference, Trump said he was \"very proud\" to hear [[Brazil|Brazilian]] president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] use the term \"fake news\".\n\nOn August 16, 2018, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming that \"the press is not the enemy of the people,\" marking the second time the Senate had unanimously rebuked Trump within a month.\n\nIn October 2018, Trump praised U.S. Representative [[Greg Gianforte]] for assaulting political reporter [[Ben Jacobs (journalist)|Ben Jacobs]] in 2017. According to analysts, the incident marked the first time the President has \"openly and directly praised a violent act against a journalist on American soil\". Later that month, as [[October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts|CNN and prominent Democrats were targeted with mail bombs]], Trump initially condemned the bomb attempts but shortly thereafter blamed the \"Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News\" for causing \"a very big part of the Anger we see today in our society\".\n\nIn November 2018, following a contentious press conference, the White House revoked the press pass of [[Jim Acosta]] of [[CNN]], who had frequently clashed with Trump. White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] and other Trump administration officials falsely claimed that Acosta had touched a White House intern who tried to take away his microphone during the conference; Sanders faced criticism for promoting a doctored clip of Acosta from [[Paul Joseph Watson]] of [[Infowars]], which had been misleadingly altered to make it appear that Acosta had aggressively thrust his hand at an intern. CNN and Acosta [[CNN v. Trump|sued the Trump administration]], seeking restoration of Acosta's press pass on [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment grounds]]. On November 16, 2019, Judge [[Timothy J. Kelly]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]], a Trump appointee, ruled that the administration had violated Acosta's due process rights, and ordered the restoration of his press pass.\n\nIn June 2019, Trump said a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' journalist \"can go to prison\" if they \"use\" a photo taken of a letter Kim Jong-un had given Trump. In August 2019, Trump criticized Fox News for \"heavily promoting the Democrats\", stating: \"We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore!\"\n\n=== Use of Twitter ===\nMain article: [[Donald Trump on social media]]\n\nSee also: [[List of nicknames used by Donald Trump]]\n\nTrump continued his use of [[Twitter]] following the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Use%20of%20Twitter|presidential campaign]]. He has continued to personally tweet from @realDonaldTrump, his personal account, while his staff tweet on his behalf using the official @POTUS account. His use of Twitter has been unconventional for a president, with his tweets initiating controversy and becoming news in their own right. Some scholars have referred to his time in office as the \"first true Twitter presidency\". The Trump administration has described Trump's tweets as \"official statements by the President of the United States\". A federal judge ruled in May 2018 that Trump's blocking of other Twitter users due to opposing political views violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and he must unblock them; however, according to a plaintiff, Trump has yet to comply with the unblocking order. The administration has appealed the court's ruling.\nTwitter activity of Donald Trump from his first tweet in May 2009 to September 2017. Retweets are not included.\nHis tweets have been reported as ill-considered, impulsive, vengeful, and [[bullying]], often being made late at night or in the early hours of the morning. His tweets about a Muslim ban were successfully turned against his administration to halt two versions of travel restrictions from some Muslim-majority countries. He has used Twitter to threaten and intimidate his political opponents and potential political allies needed to pass bills.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nMany tweets appear to be based on stories Trump has seen in the media, including far-right news websites such as [[Breitbart News|Breitbart]], and television shows such as ''[[Fox & Friends]]''.\n\nTrump has used Twitter to attack [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] who have ruled against him in court cases and to criticize officials within his own administration, including then-[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]], then-[[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[H. R. McMaster]], [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[Rod Rosenstein]], and at various times [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]]. Tillerson was eventually fired via a tweet by Trump. Trump has also tweeted that his [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] is part of the [[Deep state in the United States|American \"deep state\"]]; that \"there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the [[FBI]], Justice & [[United States Department of State|State]]\" [[United States federal executive departments|Departments]]; and that the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|special counsel investigation]] is a \"[[Witch hunt|WITCH HUNT]]!\" In August 2018, Trump used Twitter to write that Attorney General Jeff Sessions \"should stop\" the special counsel investigation immediately; he also referred to it as \"rigged\" and its investigators as biased.\n\nBy late 2019, his style of communications to the public had evolved. According to a report in ''Politico'':\n\n: He prefers to issue major announcements himself over social media, whether policy moves or staff firings. He killed the daily White House briefing, preferring the messy practice of fielding reporters' shouted questions from the Oval Office or before his presidential helicopter. As Year Three of his presidency closes out, Trump has built his style of communicating around the pillars of political grievances, conspiracy theories and targeting perceived enemies. Most of all, he prefers to dictate and dominate the news cycle.\n\n=== Judicial criticism of Trump ===\nOn November 6, 2019, [[United States federal judge|Senior United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] and secretary of the [[American Law Institute]] [[Paul L. Friedman]] said Trump's rhetoric \"violates all recognized democratic norms\" and that \"We are witnessing a chief executive who criticizes virtually every judicial decision that doesn't go his way and denigrates judges who rule against him, sometimes in very personal terms. He seems to view the courts and the justice system as obstacles to be attacked and undermined, not as a coequal branch to be respected even when he disagrees with its decisions.\"\n\nIn February 2020, Trump tweeted criticism of the prosecutors' proposed sentence for Trump's former aide [[Roger Stone]]. A few hours later, the Department of Justice replaced the prosecutors' proposed sentence with a lighter proposal. This gave the appearance of presidential interference in a criminal case and caused a strongly negative reaction. All four of the original prosecutors withdrew from the case; more than a thousand former DOJ prosecutors signed a letter condemning the action; and the Federal Judges Association, which represents more than 1,100 federal judges, called an emergency meeting.\n\n== Domestic policy ==\nSee also: [[Social policy of Donald Trump]]\n\n=== Abortion and fetal tissue research ===\nFurther information: [[Social policy of Donald Trump#Abortion|Social policy of Donald Trump \u00a7 Abortion]]\n\nTrump reinstated the [[Mexico City policy]] prohibiting funding to foreign [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] that perform abortions as a method of family planning in other countries. In 2018, the U.S. was the only country to oppose a United Nations nonbinding draft resolution to combat violence against women; the administration said a reference to \"sexual and reproductive health\" could be interpreted as support for abortion rights, and that the resolution might conflate \"physical violence against women with sexual harassment\". In 2018, the administration prohibited scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from acquiring new fetal tissue for research, and a year later stopped all medical research by government scientists that used fetal tissue.\n\nThe administration geared HHS funding towards abstinence education programs for teens rather than the comprehensive sexual education programs the Obama administration funded.\n\nIn his January 2019 State of the Union Address Trump said he would push for a ban on late-term abortions, falsely asserting that a New York law would allow \"a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth\". On multiple occasions in 2019 he falsely claimed that Democrats favor allowing doctors and mothers to \"execute\" live-born babies.\n\nIn June 2019, the Trump administration was allowed by a federal court of appeals to implement, while legal appeals continue, a policy restricting taxpayer dollars given to family planning facilities through [[Title X]]. This policy requires that companies receiving Title X funding must not mention abortion to patients, provide abortion referrals, or share space with abortion providers. As a result, [[Planned Parenthood]], which provides Title X birth control services to 1.5 million women, is withdrawing from the program.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nDue to Trump's trade tariffs combined with depressed commodities prices, American farmers faced the worst crisis in decades. Trump provided farmers $12 billion in direct payments in July 2018 to mitigate the negative impacts of his [[Trump tariffs|tariffs]], increasing the payments by $14.5 billion in May 2019 after trade talks with China ended without agreement. Most of the administration's aid went to the largest farms.\n\nTrump's fiscal 2020 budget proposed a 15% funding cut for the Agriculture Department, calling farm subsidies \"overly generous\". ''Politico'' reported in May 2019 that some economists in the [[Economic Research Service]] of the Agriculture Department felt they were being punished for presenting analyses showing farmers were being harmed by Trump's trade and tax policies, with six economists having more than 50 years of combined experience at the Service resigning on the same day of April 2019.\n\n=== Consumer protections ===\nThe administration reversed a [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) rule that had made it easier for aggrieved consumers to pursue [[Class action|class actions]] against banks; the Associated Press characterized the reversal as a victory for Wall Street banks. Under Mick Mulvaney's tenure, the CFPB reduced enforcement of rules that protected consumers from predatory [[Payday loan|payday lenders]]. Trump scrapped a proposed rule from the Obama administration that airlines disclose baggage fees. Trump reduced enforcement of regulations against airlines; fines levied by the administration in 2017 were less than half of what the Obama administration did the year before.\n\n=== Criminal justice ===\nTrump signed new anti-sex-trafficking legislation on April 16, 2018.\nIn November 2017, the ''New York Times'' summarized the Trump administration's \"general approach to law enforcement\" as \"cracking down on violent crime\", \"not regulating the police departments that fight it\", and overhauling \"programs that the Obama administration used to ease tensions between communities and the police\". The administration reversed a 16-year old moratorium on federal [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] in 2019, with Attorney General Barr directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to schedule five executions.\nTrump [[Peace Officers Memorial Day|pays tribute]] to fallen police officers, May 15, 2017\n\nThe administration reinstated the use of [[asset forfeiture]]\u2014the practice of seizing the property of crime suspects who have not been charged with or convicted of a crime\u2014making it so local authorities in the states that banned asset forfeiture could engage in the practice. When a sheriff complained about a state senator who proposed legislation to end asset forfeiture, Trump responded, \"Who is the state senator? Do you want to give his name? ... We'll destroy his career.\"\n\nTrump appeared to advocate [[police brutality]] in a July 2017 speech to police officers, prompting criticism from law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn December 2018, Trump signed the [[First Step Act]], a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill which sought to rehabilitate prisoners and reduce recidivism, notably by expanding job training and early-release programs, and lowering mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Trump's proposed 2020 budget underfunded the new law; the law was intended to receive $75 million annually for five years, but Trump's budget proposed only $14 million.\n\nBeginning during his campaign and continuing into his presidency, Trump called for a sweeping investigation into alleged wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton. In November 2017, his attorney general [[Jeff Sessions]] appointed a federal attorney to review a wide array of issues, including the [[Clinton Foundation]], the [[Uranium One controversy]] and the FBI's handling of its investigation into [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|Clinton's emails]]. In January 2020 the investigation was reported to be winding down after no evidence was found to warrant the opening of a criminal investigation. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's April 2019 report documented that Trump pressured Sessions and the Justice Department to re-open the investigation into the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy]].\n\nTrump's 2019 budget plan proposed nearly 50% cuts to the [[Community Oriented Policing Services|COPS Hiring Program]] which provides funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to help hire community policing officers.\n\nThe number of prosecutions of child-sex traffickers has showed a decreasing trend under the Trump administration. 108 such prosecutions were filed<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> in the first eight months of 2019, producing an estimated 162 prosecutions in 2019 at the current rate. Under the eight-year Obama administration, the number of prosecutions rose from 85 in 2009 to around 275 in 2016. The number of prosecutions in 2017 was slightly higher than 2016's, but the number of prosecutions in 2018 was lower, at 221.\n\n==== Presidential pardons and commutations ====\nMain article: [[List of people granted executive clemency by Donald Trump]]\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardoned]]:\n\n* [[Pardon of Joe Arpaio|Joe Arpaio]], a sheriff convicted of [[contempt of court]] for failing to comply with court orders to stop racially profiling Hispanics\n* [[Kristian Saucier]], a sailor convicted for taking pictures aboard a [[nuclear submarine]]\n* [[Scooter Libby|Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby]], chief of staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury in the [[Plame affair grand jury investigation|investigation of the leak of the covert identity]] of CIA officer [[Valerie Plame|Valerie Plame Wilson]]\n* [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], a black heavyweight boxer, was posthumously pardoned for a 1913 conviction for taking his white girlfriend across state lines\n* [[Dinesh D'Souza]], conservative pundit who was convicted of illegal campaign contributions in a 2012 Senate race\n* [[Hammond arson case|Dwight and Stephen Hammond]], two Oregon ranchers who were convicted of intentionally setting fires on public land, and whose prison sentences prompted [[Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge|armed protesters]] to violently seize the [[Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]] for 41 days in 2016\n* [[Conrad Black]], British author and former owner of [[Hollinger International]], convicted of fraud in 2007; author of the 2018 book ''Donald J.

Trump granted clemency to Johnson after [[Kim Kardashian]] met Trump to lobby for her cause.\n\n''The New York Times'' remarked that Trump took no action on more than ten thousand pending applications and that he used his pardon power solely on \"public figures whose cases resonated with him given his own grievances with investigators\".\n\n==== Drug policy ====\nMain article: [[Cannabis policy of the Donald Trump administration]]\n\nIn a May 2017 departure from the Obama DOJ's policy to reduce long jail sentencing for minor drug offenses and contrary to a growing bipartisan consensus, the administration ordered federal prosecutors to seek maximum sentencing for [[Drug offence|drug offenses]]. In a January 2018 move that created uncertainty regarding the legality of recreational and medical marijuana, Sessions rescinded federal policy that had barred federal law enforcement officials from aggressively enforcing federal cannabis law in states where the drug is legal. The administration's decision contradicted then-candidate Trump's statement that marijuana legalization should be \"up to the states\". That same month, the VA said it would not research cannabis as a potential treatment against PTSD and chronic pain; veterans organizations had pushed for such a study.\n\n=== Defense ===\nDuring 2018, Trump falsely asserted he had secured the largest defense budget authorization ever, the first military pay raise in ten years, and that military spending was at least 4.0% of GDP, \"which got a lot bigger since I became your president\".\n\nAs a candidate and as president, Trump called for a major build-up of American military capabilities, including increasing the nuclear arsenal tenfold. He said he was open to allowing Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. He announced in October 2018 that America would withdraw from the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] with Russia to enable America to counter increasing Chinese intermediate nuclear missile capabilities in the Pacific. In December 2018, Trump complained about the amount America spends on an \"uncontrollable arms race\" with Russia and China. Trump said the $716 billion America is now spending on the \"arms race\" was \"Crazy!\", after praising his increased defense spending five months earlier. The total fiscal 2019 defense budget authorization was $716 billion, although missile defense and nuclear programs comprised about $10 billion of the total.\n\nA controversy arose in November 2019 after Trump pardoned or promoted three soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes, stating, \"we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!\" The most prominent case involved [[Eddie Gallagher (Navy SEAL)|Eddie Gallagher]], a Navy SEAL team chief who had been reported to Navy authorities by his own team members for an alleged pattern of unethical practices, including [[Sniper|sniping]] at an unarmed civilian girl and elderly man in a war zone. Gallagher faced [[court martial]] for the murder of a wounded terrorist suspect, among other charges, and the medic of his SEAL team was granted immunity to testify against him, but on the witness stand the medic reversed what he had previously told investigators and testified that he himself had murdered the terrorist suspect. Gallagher was subsequently acquitted of the murder charge against him, and the Navy demoted him to the lowest possible rank due to his conviction on another charge. The Navy later moved to strip Gallagher of his [[Special Warfare insignia|Trident pin]] and eject him from the Navy. Trump intervened to restore Gallagher's rank and pin. Many military officers were enraged by Trump's intervention, as they felt it disrupted principles of military discipline and justice. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Richard V. Spencer|Richard Spencer]] protested Trump's intervention and was forced to resign; in his resignation letter, he sharply rebuked Trump for his judgment in the matter. Trump told a rally audience days later, \"I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state.\"\n\n=== Economy ===\nMain article: [[Economic policy of Donald Trump]]\n\nSee also: [[2018 United States federal budget]], [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], and [[Trump tariffs]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Economic indicators and federal finances under the Obama and Trump administrations\n''$ represent U.S. trillions of [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|unadjusted]] dollars''\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Unemploy-\nment\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Real gross domestic product|RGDPGrowth]]\n| colspan=\"4\" |Fiscal data\n|-\n!Receipts\n!Outlays\n!Deficit\n!Debt\n|-\n|''ending''\n| colspan=\"3\" |''Dec 31 (calendar year)''\n| colspan=\"4\" |''Sep 30 (fiscal year)''\n|-\n!2014*\n|6.2%\n|$17.522\n|2.5%\n|$3.021\n|$3.506\n| - $0.485\n|$12.8\n|-\n!2015*\n|5.3%\n|$18.219\n|2.9%\n|$3.250\n|$3.688\n| - $0.438\n|$13.1\n|-\n!2016*\n|4.9%\n|$18.707\n|1.6%\n|$3.268\n|$3.853\n| - $0.585\n|$14.2\n|-\n!2017\n|4.4%\n|$19.485\n|2.2%\n|$3.315\n|$3.981\n| - $0.666\n|$14.7\n|-\n!2018\n|3.9%\n|$20.494\n|2.9%\n|$3.329\n|$4.108\n| - $0.799\n|$15.8\n|-\n!2019\n|3.5%\n|$21.727\n|2.1%\n|$3.464\n|$4.448\n| - $0.984\n|$16.8\n|}\nTrump's economic policies have centered on cutting taxes, deregulation, and trade protectionism. His involvement has included the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], the cancellation of [[NAFTA]] and negotiation for [[USMCA]], and tariffs on China and the European Union.\n\nIn February 2018, Trump released a $1.5 trillion federal infrastructure plan, but left the details of the plan for Congress to solve, including how to pay for it; Congress did not take up the plan. One of the administration's first actions was to indefinitely suspend a cut in fee rates for federally-insured mortgages implemented by the Obama administration. The cut in fee rates would have saved individuals with lower credit scores around $500 per year on a typical loan.\n\nIn September 2017, the DOJ announced it would not defend in courts a mandate that would have extended overtime benefits to more than four million workers.\n\nIn September 2017, the administration proposed a tax overhaul, which became the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. The proposal was to reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% (from 35%) and eliminate the estate tax. On individual tax returns it would change the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12%, 25%, and 35%; apply a 25% tax rate to business income reported on a personal tax return; eliminate the [[alternative minimum tax]]; eliminate personal exemptions; double the standard deduction; and eliminate many itemized deductions (specifically retaining the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions).\nTrump and Vice President Pence with key [[Automotive industry in the United States|automobile industry]] leaders, January 24, 2017\n\nAccording to ''The New York Times'', the plan would result in a \"huge windfall\" for the very wealthy but would not benefit those in the bottom third of the income distribution. The nonpartisan [[Tax Policy Center]] estimated that the richest 0.1% and 1% would benefit the most in raw dollar amounts and percentage terms from the tax plan, earning 10.2% and 8.5% more income after taxes respectively. Middle-class households would on average earn 1.2% more after tax, but 13.5% of middle class households would see their tax burden increase. The poorest fifth of Americans would earn 0.5% more. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued that the corporate income tax cut will benefit workers the most; however, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, Congressional Budget Office and many economists estimated that owners of capital would benefit vastly more than workers. A preliminary estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the tax plan would add more than $2 trillion over the next decade to the federal debt, while the Tax Policy Center found that it would add $2.4 trillion to the debt. A 2019 [[Congressional Research Service]] analysis found that the tax cuts had \"a relatively small (if any) first-year\" growth effect on the economy. A 2019 analysis by the [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]] concluded that Trump's policies will add $4.1 trillion to the national debt from 2017 to 2029. Around $1.8 trillion of debt is projected to eventually arise from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nDuring President Trump's first foreign trip to [[Saudi Arabia]], he announced an [[2017 United States\u2013Saudi Arabia arms deal|arms deal with Saudi Arabia]], May 2017\n\nDuring his tenure, Trump has sought to intervene in the economy to affect specific companies and industries. Trump sought to compel power grid operators to buy coal and nuclear energy, and sought tariffs on metals to protect domestic metal producers. Trump also publicly attacked Boeing and Lockheed Martin, sending their stocks tumbling. Trump repeatedly singled out Amazon for criticism and advocated steps that would harm the company, such as ending an arrangement between Amazon and the U.S. Postal Service and raising taxes on Amazon. Trump expressed opposition to the merger between Time Warner (the parent company of ''CNN'') and AT&T. After the merger was completed, Trump in June 2019 suggested boycotting AT&T to force changes at CNN.\n\nIn March 2018, Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, triggering a series of [[tit for tat]] tariffs and threatened additional tariffs from multiple nations, which by June 2018 had escalated into what some characterized as a [[trade war]] The trade dispute disrupted global commerce, with the ''New York Times'' noting that \"shipments are slowing at ports and airfreight terminals around the world. Prices for crucial raw materials are rising. At factories from Germany to Mexico, orders are being cut and investments delayed. American farmers are losing sales as trading partners hit back with duties of their own.\" By June 2018, negative effects of the Trump tariffs policy had begun to ripple through the American economy, in particular the agriculture sector. In July 2018, China retaliated with a $34 billion in tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump had signaled that he might impose an additional $200 billion in tariffs if China imposed their own tariffs, with the potential for a further $200 billion, in an escalating trade war. China and the United States entered into negotiations in the summer of 2018 to seek a comprehensive solution to their trade conflict, but the talks ended without agreement on May 10, 2019, and that day Trump carried out his earlier threat to impose additional tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Some economists estimated that the cumulative effect of the continuing trade conflict could raise costs for the average American household by several hundreds of dollars per year.\n\nUpon taking office, Trump halted trade negotiations with the European Union on the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP), which had been under way since 2013. In May 2018, Trump initiated a trade conflict with the EU by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, for which the EU retaliated in June with tariffs of their own, with Trump threatening to escalate the conflict with additional tariffs. In July 2018, Trump and the EU declared a truce of sorts, announcing they would enter into negotiations for an agreement similar to the TTIP.\n\nFrom June 2018, Trump has repeatedly and falsely characterized the economy during his presidency as the best in American history; he has made some version of this claim more than 130 times. Analysis conducted by [[Bloomberg News]] at the end of Trump's second year in office found that his economy ranked sixth among the last seven presidents, based on fourteen metrics of economic activity and financial performance. A July 2018 paper, which used the [[synthetic control method]], found no evidence Trump had an impact on the U.S. economy during his 18 months in office.\n\n''The New York Times'' reported on August 5, 2018, that two major American steel companies with close ties to senior Trump administration officials had succeeded in blocking requests from 1,600 American manufacturing companies for waivers of the steel tariffs, compelling them to purchase more expensive American steel. [[Nucor]] Corporation had financed a documentary made by [[Peter Navarro]], Trump's Director of the [[White House National Trade Council]], and [[U.S. Steel]] had previously been represented in legal matters by Trump's [[United States Trade Representative|trade representative]] [[Robert Lighthizer]] and his deputy [[Jeffrey Gerrish]].\n\nShortly after being elected, Trump cited a handful of anecdotes to assert that foreign investment had begun pouring into America because of his election. However, aggregate statistical data showed that [[foreign direct investment]]\u2014the total flow of investment capital into the United States from the rest of the world\u2014declined sharply during Trump's first two years in office, down 40% compared to the two years immediately preceding his presidency. Trump has sought to present his economic policies as successful in encouraging businesses to invest in new facilities and create jobs. In this effort, he has on several occasions taken credit for business investments that began before he became president.\n\nIn April 2019, one week after asserting, \"the economy is roaring\" and \"our country has never done better economically,\" Trump called for the [[Federal Reserve]] to cut interest rates and renew [[quantitative easing]] to stimulate economic growth. Trump has been repeatedly critical of the Fed's use of low interest rates and quantitative easing to boost the economy in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession]] during the Obama presidency.\nTrump and [[Boeing]] CEO [[Dennis Muilenburg]] at the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787-10 Dreamliner]] rollout ceremony\n\nThe Trump campaign economic policy, as expressed by [[Peter Navarro]] and [[Wilbur Ross]] in a September 2016 white paper, included a priority of \"eliminating America's chronic trade deficit\", particularly with China. However, the overall trade deficit increased in both of Trump's first two years in office, up 10% in 2017 and 13% in 2018, compared to single-digit increases during each of the preceding three years. The deficit in goods, Trump's preferred trade balance measure, increased 8% in 2017 and 10% in 2018, reaching a record high of $891 billion in 2018. The goods deficit with China reached a record high for the second consecutive year in 2018, up 12% from 2017.\n\nMultiple studies and analyses have shown that Trump's trade war harmed the U.S. economy, with U.S. consumers bearing the brunt of the cost. Analysis conducted by [[CNBC]] in May 2019 found that Trump \"enacted tariffs equivalent to one of the largest tax increases in decades\", while [[Tax Foundation]] and [[Tax Policy Center]] analyses found the tariffs could wipe out the benefits of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] for many households.\n\nThree weeks after Republican Senator [[Chuck Grassley]], chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]], wrote an April 2019 Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled \"Trump's Tariffs End or His Trade Deal Dies\", stating \"Congress won't approve [[USMCA]] while constituents pay the price for Mexican and Canadian retaliation,\" Trump lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Two weeks later, Trump unexpectedly announced he would impose a 5% tariff on all imports from Mexico on June 10, increasing to 10% on July 1, and by another 5% each month for three months, \"until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP\". Hours later, Grassley commented, \"This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent. Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump's and what could be a big victory for the country.\" That same day, the Trump administration formally initiated the process to seek congressional approval of USMCA. Trump's top trade advisor, [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|U.S. Trade Representative]] [[Robert Lighthizer]], opposed the new Mexican tariffs on concerns it would jeopardize passage of USMCA. Treasury secretary [[Steven Mnuchin]] and Trump senior advisor [[Jared Kushner]] also opposed the action. Grassley, whose committee is instrumental in passing USMCA, was not informed in advance of Trump's surprise announcement. An array of lawmakers and business groups expressed consternation about the proposed tariffs. With 2018 imports of Mexican goods totaling $346.5 billion, a 5% tariff constitutes a tax increase of more than $17 billion. On June 7, Trump announced the tariffs would be \"indefinitely suspended\" after Mexico agreed to take actions, including deploying its National Guard throughout the country and along its southern border. ''The New York Times'' reported the following day that Mexico had actually agreed to most of the actions months earlier. Also that day, Trump tweeted, \"MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!\", although the communique between the countries did not mention any such deal and Mexican officials were not aware of such discussions, while American officials declined comment.\n\nThe administration proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known as food stamps, which if implemented would lead millions to lose access to food stamps and limit the size of food stamps for those who were still eligible.\n\n=== Education ===\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos and President Trump visit Saint Andrew's Catholic School in Orlando, Florida, March 3, 2017\nTrump selected [[Betsy DeVos]] as his Secretary of Education. Her nomination was approved on a 50\u201350 vote with Vice President Pence called upon to break the tie. Democrats objected to her nomination because they felt she had a poor grasp of education policy while Republicans praised her because of her strong support of [[school choice]].\n\nIn 2017, Trump revoked an Obama administration memo which provided protections for people in default on student loans. The Education Department cancelled agreements with the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) to police student loan fraud. Seth Frotman, the CFPB student loan ombudsman, resigned, accusing the Trump administration of undermining the CFPB's work on protecting student borrowers.\n\nIn 2017 DeVos said the Obama administration's guidance for how campuses address sexual assault \"failed too many students\" and she announced that she intended to replace the current approach \"with a workable, effective and fair system\". Consequently, the administration scrapped an Obama administration guidance on how schools and universities should combat sexual harassment and sexual violence. DeVos criticized the guidance for undermining the rights of those accused of sexual harassment.\n\nDeVos marginalized an investigative unit within the Department of Education which under Obama investigated predatory activities by for-profit colleges. The unit had been scaled down from a dozen employees to three, and had been repurposed to process student loan forgiveness applications and focus on smaller compliance cases. An investigation started under Obama into the practices of DeVry Education Group, which operates for-profit colleges, was halted in early 2017, and the former dean at DeVry was made into the supervisor for the investigative unit later that summer. DeVry paid a $100 million fine in 2016 for defrauding students. The administration rescinded a regulation restricting federal funding to for-profit colleges unable to demonstrate that college graduates had a reasonable debt-to-earnings ratio after entering the job market.\n\n=== Election integrity ===\nOn the eve of the 2018 mid-term elections, ''Politico'' described the Trump administration's efforts to combat election propaganda as \"rudderless\". At the same time, U.S. intelligence agencies warned about \"on-going campaigns\" by Russia, China and Iran to influence American elections.\n\n=== Energy ===\nFurther information: [[Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump#Energy|Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump \u00a7 Energy]]\n\nThe administration's \"America First Energy Plan\" did not mention renewable energy and instead focused on fossil fuels. The administration enacted 30% tariffs on imported solar panels. The American solar energy industry is highly reliant on foreign parts (80% of parts are made abroad); as a result, the tariffs could raise the costs of solar energy, reduce innovation and reduce jobs in the industry\u2014which in 2017 employed nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry. The administration reversed standards put in place to make commonly used lightbulbs more energy-efficient.\n\nTrump rescinded a rule that required oil, gas and mining firms to disclose how much they paid foreign governments, and withdrew from the international [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] (EITI) which required disclosure of payments by oil, gas and mining companies to governments.\nTrump signs memoranda on January 24, 2017, to advance construction of the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL]] and [[Dakota Access Pipeline|Dakota Access]] pipelines\n\nIn January 2018, the administration singled out the state of Florida as an exemption from the administration's offshore drilling plan. The move stirred controversy because it came after the Governor of Florida, Republican Rick Scott (who was considering a 2018 Senate run), complained about the offshore drilling plan. The move raised ethical questions because Trump owns a resort in Florida and because Florida is a swing state Trump would like to win in the 2020 presidential election. ''NBC News'' said the decision had the appearance of \"transactional favoritism\" and that it was likely to lead to lawsuits.\n\n=== Environment ===\nMain article: [[Environmental policy of the Trump administration]]\n2017 Trump rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Trump holds a placard that reads \"TRUMP DIGS COAL\".\nBy December 2019, the administration had overturned or was in process of rolling back 78 environmental regulations. A 2018 ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'' study found that in the first six months of the administration, the EPA adopted a pro-business attitude unlike that of any previous administration, as it \"moved away from the public interest and explicitly favored the interests of the regulated industries\". ''The Washington Post'' summarized Pruitt's leadership of the EPA in 2017 as follows, \"he has moved to shrink the agency's reach, alter its focus, and pause or reverse numerous environmental rules. The effect has been to steer the EPA in the direction sought by those being regulated. Along the way, Pruitt has begun to dismantle former president Barack Obama's environmental legacy, halting the agency's efforts to combat climate change and to shift the nation away from its reliance on fossil fuels.\" Analyses of EPA enforcement data showed that the Trump administration brought fewer cases against polluters, sought a lower total of civil penalties and made fewer requests of companies to retrofit facilities to curb pollution than the Obama and Bush administrations. According to the ''New York Times'', \"confidential internal E.P.A. documents show that the enforcement slowdown coincides with major policy changes ordered by Mr. Pruitt's team after pleas from oil and gas industry executives.\" In 2018, the administration referred the lowest number of pollution cases for criminal prosecution in 30 years. Two years into Trump's presidency, ''The New York Times'' wrote he had \"unleashed a regulatory rollback, lobbied for and cheered on by industry, with little parallel in the past half-century\". In June 2018, [[David Cutler]] and [[Francesca Dominici]] of [[Harvard University]] estimated conservatively that the Trump administration's modifications to environmental rules could result in more than 80,000 additional U.S. deaths and widespread respiratory ailments. In August 2018, the administration's own analysis showed that the loosening of coal plant rules could cause up to 1,400 premature deaths and 15,000 new cases of respiratory problems. From 2016 to 2018, air pollution increased by 5.5%, reversing a seven-year trend where air pollution had declined by 25%.\n\nThe new administration removed all references to climate change on the White House website, with the sole exception of mentioning Trump's intention to eliminate the Obama administration's climate change policies. The EPA removed climate change material on its website, including detailed climate data. In June 2017, Trump announced U.S. withdrawal from the [[Paris Agreement]], a 2015 [[climate change]] accord reached by 200 nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, defying broad global backing for the plan. In December 2017, President Trump\u2014who had repeatedly called [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate]] a \"hoax\" before becoming president\u2014for the first time as president disputed climate change by falsely implying cold weather meant climate change was not occurring. Through executive order, Trump reversed multiple Obama administration policies meant to tackle climate change, such as a moratorium on federal coal leasing, the [[Presidential Climate Action Plan]], and guidance for federal agencies on taking climate change into account during [[National Environmental Policy Act]] action reviews. Trump also ordered reviews and possibly modifications to several directives, such as the [[Clean Power Plan]] (CPP), the estimate for the \"social cost of carbon\" emissions, carbon dioxide emission standards for new coal plants, [[methane emissions]] standards from [[Oil extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas]] extraction, as well as any regulations inhibiting domestic energy production. The administration rolled back regulations requiring the federal government to account for climate change and sea-level rise when building infrastructure. The EPA disbanded a 20-expert panel on pollution which advised the EPA on the appropriate threshold levels to set for air quality standards.\n\nThe new administration instituted a temporary [[media blackout]] for the EPA, saying this was to make sure the messages going out reflected the new administration's priorities, and implemented a temporary freeze on EPA contract and grant approvals. The EPA hired an opposition research firm associated with the Republican Party for $120,000 in a [[no-bid contract]] to investigate EPA employees who had expressed criticism of Pruitt's management of the EPA. In December 2018, the administration joined Russia and the gulf states of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in stopping the Katowice climate change conference from welcoming an October 2018 IPCC report on the dangers of climate change.\nOfficial portrait of Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator\nThe administration has repeatedly sought to reduce the budget for the EPA. The administration invalidated the [[Stream Protection Rule]] (which prevented coal mining debris from being dumped into streams, groundwater and surface waters), regulations which limited dumping of toxic wastewater containing metals, such as arsenic and mercury, into public waterways, regulations on [[Health effects of coal ash|coal ash]] (carcinogenic leftover waste produced by coal plants), and an Obama-era executive order on protections for oceans, coastlines and lakes which was enacted after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]. The administration rolled back major [[Clean Water Act]] protections. Studies by the Obama-era EPA suggest that up to two-thirds of California's inland freshwater streams would lose protections under the rule change. The EPA sought to repeal a regulation which required oil and gas companies to restrict emissions of [[methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]]. The EPA granted a loophole allowing a small set of trucking companies to skirt emissions rules and produce trucks that emit 40 to 55 times the air pollutants of other new trucks. The EPA rejected a ban on the toxic pesticide [[chlorpyrifos]]; a federal court ordered the EPA to ban the pesticide, because the EPA's own staff had recommended banning it due to extensive research showing adverse health effects on children. The administration scaled back the ban on the use of the solvent [[Dichloromethane|methylene chloride]], and lifted a rule requiring major farms to report pollution emitted through animal waste.\n\nThe administration suspended a number of large research programs, such as a $1 million [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) study on the public health effects of [[Mountaintop removal mining|mountaintop removal coal-mining]], a $580,000 NAS study intended to make offshore drilling safer, a multimillion-dollar program that distributed grants for research the effects of [[Toxicity|chemical exposure on children]], a project on the effects of chemicals on pregnant women, and $10-million-a-year research line for NASA's Carbon Monitoring System. The administration unsuccessfully sought to kill aspects of [[NASA Earth Science|NASA's climate science]] program.\n\nThe EPA expedited the process for approving new chemicals and made the process of evaluating the safety of those chemicals less stringent; EPA scientists expressed concerns that the agency's ability to stop hazardous chemicals was being compromised. Internal emails showed that Pruitt aides prevented the publication of a health study showing some toxic chemicals endanger humans at far lower levels than the EPA previously characterized as safe. One such chemical was present in high quantities around a number of military bases, including groundwater. The non-disclosure of the study and the delay in public knowledge of the findings may have prevented the government from updating the infrastructure at the bases and individuals who lived near the bases to avoid the tap water.\n\nThe administration weakened enforcement the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]], making it easier to start mining, drilling and construction projects in areas with endangered and threatened species. The administration has actively discouraged local governments and businesses from undertaking preservation efforts. The administration sharply reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah by approximately two million acres, making it the largest reduction of public land protections in American history. Shortly afterwards, Interior Secretary Zinke advocated for downsizing four additional national monuments and changing the way six additional monuments were managed. In 2019, the administration sped up the process for environmental reviews for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic; experts said the speeding up made reviews less comprehensive and reliable. According to ''Politico'', the administration sped up the process in the event that a Democratic administration was elected in 2020, which would have halted new oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The administration sought to open up more than 180,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the largest in the country, for logging.\n\nIn April 2018, Pruitt announced a policy change prohibiting EPA regulators from considering scientific research unless the raw data of the research was made publicly available. This would limit EPA regulators' use of much environmental research, given that participants in many such studies provide personal health information which is kept confidential. The EPA cited two bipartisan reports and various nonpartisan studies about the use of science in government to defend the decision. However, the authors of those reports dismissed that the EPA followed their instructions, with one author saying, \"They don't adopt any of our recommendations, and they go in a direction that's completely opposite, completely different. They don't adopt any of the recommendations of ''any'' of the sources they cite.\"\n\nThe administration released the [[Fourth National Climate Assessment]] (NCA4) in November 2018, a long-awaited study conducted by numerous federal agencies that found \"the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.\" [[Steven Milloy]], a climate-change denier who served on Trump's EPA transition team, called the report a product of the so-called [[deep state]], adding that the Administration chose to release it the day after Thanksgiving \"on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day's news\". In June 2019, the administration tried to prevent a State Department intelligence analyst from testifying to Congress about \"possibly catastrophic\" effects of human-caused climate change, and prevented his written testimony containing science from [[NASA]] and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] from being included in the official [[Congressional Record]] because it was not consistent with administration positions.\n\n=== Government size and regulations ===\nThe administration imposed far fewer financial penalties against banks and major companies accused of wrong-doing relative to the Obama administration.\n\nIn the first six weeks of his tenure, Trump suspended\u2014or in a few cases, revoked\u2014more than 90 regulations. In early 2017, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to slash two existing regulations for every new one (without spending on regulations going up). A September 2017 [[Bloomberg BNA]] review found that due to unclear wording in the order and the large proportion of regulations it exempts, the order had had little effect since it was signed. The Trump [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] released an analysis in February 2018 indicating the economic benefits of regulations significantly outweigh the economic costs. The administration ordered one-third of government advisory committees for federal agencies eliminated, except for committees that evaluate consumer product safety or committees that approve research grants.\n\nTrump ordered a [[2017 United States federal hiring freeze|four-month government-wide hiring freeze]] of the civilian work force (excluding staff in the military, national security, public safety and offices of new presidential appointees) at the start of his term. He said he did not intend to fill many of the governmental positions that were still vacant, as he considered them unnecessary; there were nearly 2,000 vacant government positions.\n\nThe administration ended the requirement that nonprofits, including political advocacy groups who collect so-called \"[[dark money]]\", disclose the names of large donors to the IRS; the Senate voted to overturn the administration's rule change.\n\n=== Guns ===\nTrump signed into law a [[Repeal of the Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007|repeal of an Obama-era regulation]] that barred gun ownership from approximately 75,000 individuals who received Social Security checks due to mental illness and who were deemed unfit to handle their financial affairs. The administration ended U.S. involvement in the UN [[Arms Trade Treaty]] to curb the international trade of conventional arms with countries having poor human rights records. The U.S. had been abiding by the treaty since 2014, although it had not ratified it.\n\nThe administration banned [[bump stocks]] in March 2019, after such devices were used by the gunman who perpetrated the [[2017 Las Vegas mass shooting]], in which 58 people were killed and some 500 were wounded. The nationwide bump-stock ban was implemented through an [[BATF|ATF]] regulation; the federal courts upheld the ban against subsequent challenges by bump-stock owners and gun-rights groups.\n\nIn the wake of several [[Mass shootings in the United States|mass shootings]] during the Trump administration, including [[2019 El Paso shooting|August 2019 shootings in El Paso, Texas]] and [[2019 Dayton shooting|Dayton, Ohio]], Trump called on states to implement [[Red flag law|red flag laws]] to remove guns from \"those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety\". However, Trump endorsed no particular piece of legislation, and Republican [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] said would allow gun legislation to be brought to the Senate floor only if it gained Trump's support. Gun rights groups mounted a campaign to discourage Trump from supporting red-flag laws or other gun-control measures, saying that pushing for red flag laws could cost Trump the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. In November 2019, Trump abandoned the idea of putting forth red-flag law proposals or other legislation to curtail gun violence.\n\n=== Health care ===\nFurther information: [[2017 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act replacement proposals]]\nCBO estimated in May 2017 that the Republican AHCA would reduce the number of persons with health insurance by 23 million during 2026, relative to current law.\nThe 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as \"Obamacare\" or the ACA) elicited major opposition from the Republican Party from its inception, and Trump called for a repeal of the law during the 2016 election campaign. On taking office, Trump promised to pass a healthcare bill that would cover everyone and result in better and less expensive insurance. Throughout his presidency, Trump repeatedly asserted that his administration and Republicans in Congress supported protections for individuals with preexisting conditions; however, fact-checkers noted the administration had supported attempts both in Congress and in the courts to roll back the ACA (and its protections for preexisting conditions).\nHHS Secretary [[Alex Azar]]\nCongressional Republicans made two serious efforts to repeal the ACA. First, in March 2017, Trump endorsed the [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act (AHCA)]], a Republican bill to repeal and replace the ACA. Opposition from several House Republicans, both moderate and conservative, led to the defeat of this version of the bill. At the time, Trump said the \"best thing politically is to let Obamacare explode\". Second in May 2017, the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] narrowly voted in favor of a new version of the AHCA to repeal the ACA, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation. Over the next weeks the Senate made several attempts to create a repeal bill; however, all the proposals were ultimately rejected in a series of Senate votes in late July. Trump reacted by alternately urging Congress to keep trying and threatening to \"let Obamacare implode\". The individual mandate was ultimately repealed in December 2017 by the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]]. The [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] estimated in May 2018 that repealing the individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured by eight million and that individual healthcare insurance premiums increased by 10% between 2017 and 2018.\n\nTrump repeatedly expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\", and the Trump administration has undermined Obamacare through various actions. The open enrollment period was cut from twelve weeks to six, the advertising budget for enrollment was cut by 90%, and organizations helping people shop for coverage got 39% less money. The [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] found that ACA enrollment at health care exchanges would be lower than its previous forecasts due to the Trump administration's undermining of the ACA. A 2019 study found that enrollment into the ACA during the Trump administration's first year was nearly 30% lower than during 2016. The CBO found that insurance premiums would rise sharply in 2018 due to the Trump administration's refusal to commit to continuing paying ACA subsidies, which added uncertainty to the insurance market and led insurers to raise premiums for fear they will not get subsidized. The administration sided with a lawsuit to overturn the ACA, including protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe administration ended subsidy payments to health insurance companies, in a move expected to raise premiums in 2018 for middle-class families by an average of about 20% nationwide and cost the federal government nearly $200 billion more than it saved over a ten-year period. People with lower incomes would be unaffected because the ACA provides tax credits that ensure their out-of-pocket insurance costs remain stable. The administration made it easier for businesses to use health insurance plans not covered by several of the ACA's protections, including for preexisting conditions, and allowed organizations not to cover birth control. Survey results indicated more than 10% of companies with more than 200 employees would opt out of birth control coverage if they had the option. In justifying the action, the administration said contraceptive use caused harms, such as risky sex behavior, cited the potential side effects of contraceptives, and asserted that the relationship between contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy was uncertain and complex. Indiana University professor of pediatrics Aaron E. Carroll noted \"there is ample evidence that contraception works, that reducing its expense leads to more women who use it appropriately, and that using it doesn't lead to riskier sexual behavior.\"\n\nThe administration proposed substantial spending cuts to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]] and [[Social Security Disability Insurance]]. Trump had previously vowed to protect Medicare and Medicaid. As a candidate and throughout his presidency, Trump said he would cut the costs of pharmaceuticals. During his first seven months in office, there were 96 price hikes for every drug price cut. Abandoning a promise he made as candidate, President Trump announced he would not allow Medicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate lower drug prices.\n[[Drug overdose|Drug overdoses]] killed 70,200 in the United States in 2017.\nThe administration reduced enforcement of penalties against nursing homes that harm residents.\n\n==== Opioid epidemic ====\nDonald Trump at the 15th Annual Opioid Takeback Day\nTrump nominated [[Tom Marino]] to become the nation's drug czar but the nomination was withdrawn after an investigation found he had been the chief architect of a bill that crippled the enforcement powers of the DEA and worsened the [[Opioid epidemic|opioid crisis in the United States]].\n\nKellyanne Conway led White House efforts to combat the [[opioid epidemic]]; Conway had no experience or expertise on matters of public health, substance abuse, or law enforcement. Conway sidelined drug experts and opted instead for the use of political staff. ''Politico'' wrote in 2018 that the administration's \"main response\" to the opioid crisis \"so far has been to call for a border wall and to promise a 'just say no' campaign\".\n\nIn October 2017, the administration declared a 90-day public health emergency over the [[opioid epidemic]] and pledged to urgently mobilize the federal government in response to the crisis. On January 11, 2018, twelve days before the declaration ran out, Politico noted that \"beyond drawing more attention to the crisis, virtually nothing of consequence has been done.\" The administration had not proposed any new resources or spending, had not started the promised advertising campaign to spread awareness about addiction, and had yet to fill key public health and drug positions in the administration. One of the top officials at the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is tasked with multibillion-dollar anti-drug initiatives and curbing the opioid epidemic, was a 24-year old campaign staffer from the Trump 2016 campaign who lied on his CV and whose stepfather went to jail for manufacturing illegal drugs; after the administration was contacted about the official's qualifications and CV, the administration gave him a job with different tasks.\n\n==== Public health and coronavirus pandemic ====\nIn May 2018, the administration dissolved a global health security team that was part of the National Security Council, and which had been tasked with overseeing pandemic readiness. There were bipartisan calls from lawmakers and experts to restore the White House pandemic team. When Trump was asked during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 why his administration dissolved the team, Trump said \"I don't know anything about it.\"\n\nIn September 2018, the Trump administration received detailed plans on how to mass-produce [[Protective mask|protective respirator masks]] under a program that had been launched by the Obama administration to alleviate a mask shortage for a future pandemic; the Trump administration choose not to act on those plans. Two months before the coronavirus outbreak in China, the Trump administration ended a [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] project used to track and research [[Zoonosis|diseases that move from animal to human hosts]], and train thousands of people and strengthen medical laboratories in developing countries. The program had enjoyed enthusiastic support under both Bush and Obama. On February 10, 2020, during the early stages of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], Trump's 2021 budget proposed cuts to global health programs in the magnitude of $3 billion, including substantial cuts to the CDC budget and US contributions to the WHO.\n\nOn February 24, the Trump administration asked Congress for $2.5 billion in emergency funding to combat the international coronavirus pandemic. On February 26, Trump appointed Vice President Pence to lead the [[White House Coronavirus Task Force]] to combat the coronavirus, insisting that the \"risk to the American people remains very low\". Congress appropriated $8.3 billion in emergency funding, which Trump signed into [[Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act|law]] on March 6.\n\nAlthough the U.S. government was initially quick to develop a diagnostic test for the coronavirus, American testing efforts from mid-January to late-February lost pace compared to the rest of the world. South Korea and the United States had the first confirmed case on the same day, yet by mid-March, 290,000 people had been tested in South Korea (a country of approximately 50 million) whereas only 60,000 people had been tested in the U.S. (a country of approximately 330 million). ABC News described the testing as \"shockingly slow\". When the WHO distributed 1.4 million coronavirus tests in February, the U.S. chose instead to use its own tests. At that time, the CDC had produced 160,000 coronavirus tests, but many were defective. As a result, fewer than 4,000 tests were done in the U.S. by February 27, with U.S. state laboratories conducting only about 200. In this period, academic laboratories and hospitals had developed their own tests, but were not allowed to use them until February 29, when the Food and Drug Administration issued approvals for them and private companies. Dr. [[Anthony Fauci]], the head of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]], acknowledged on March 12 that it was \"a failing\" of the U.S. system that demand for coronavirus tests were not being met; Fauci later clarified that he believed the private sector should have been brought in sooner. When President Trump was asked by the media if he would take responsibility for the lack of tests, he declared: \"No, I don't take responsibility at all\". Trump on March 16 gave his administration's overall coronavirus response a score of 10/10. A comprehensive ''New York Times'' investigation concluded that \"technical flaws, regulatory hurdles, business-as-usual bureaucracies and lack of leadership at multiple levels\" contributed to the testing failures. An Associated Press investigation found the administration made its first bulk orders for vital health care equipment, such as N95 respirator masks and ventilators, in mid-March, thus squandering two months since alarms were raised in early January.\n\nFrom January 2020 to mid-March 2020, President Trump consistently downplayed the threat posed by the coronavirus to the United States, giving many optimistic public statements, which were mainly aimed at calming stock markets. He initially said he had no worries about the coronavirus becoming a pandemic. He went on to state on multiple occasions that the situation was \"under control\", and repeatedly suggested the virus would somehow vanish one day. He accused Democrats and media outlets of exaggerating the seriousness of the situation, describing Democrats' criticism of his administration's response as a \"hoax\". Trump eventually changed his tone on March 16 to a somber one. For the first time, he acknowledged that the coronavirus was \"not under control\", the situation was \"bad\" with months of impending disruption to daily lives, and a recession might occur.\n\nDuring his oval office address on March 11, Trump announced an imminent travel ban between Europe and the United States. The announcement caused chaos in European and American airports, as Americans abroad scrambled to get flights back to the United States. The administration later had to clarify that the travel ban applied to foreigners coming from the [[Schengen Area]], and later added Ireland and the UK to the list. The flawed rollout of the travel ban led to hours-long waits and crowded lines at major airports for incoming passengers to the U.S., causing a public health hazard. Previously, in late January 2020, the administration banned travel to the US from China; prior to the decision, major U.S. carriers had already announced that they would no longer fly to and from China. On March 13, Trump designated the coronavirus pandemic as a [[national emergency]], as the number of known cases of the coronavirus in the country exceeded 1,500, while known deaths exceeded 40.\n\n=== Housing and urban policy ===\n[[Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] [[Ben Carson]], first day on the job\n\nIn December 2017, ''The Economist'' described the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD), led by [[Ben Carson]], as \"directionless\". Most of the top HUD positions were unfilled and Carson's leadership was \"inconspicuous and inscrutable\". Of the policies HUD was enacting, ''The Economist'' wrote, \"it is hard not to conclude that the governing principle at HUD is to take whatever the Obama administration was doing, and do the opposite.\" HUD scaled back the enforcement of fair housing laws, halted several fair housing investigations started by the Obama administration and removed the words \"inclusive\" and \"free from discrimination\" from its mission statement. The administration designated [[Lynne Patton]], an event planner who had worked on the Trump campaign and planned Eric Trump's wedding, to lead HUD's New York and New Jersey office (which oversees billions of federal dollars).\n\n=== Disaster relief ===\nPresident Trump signs the Hurricane Harvey relief bill at [[Camp David]], September 8, 2017\n\n==== Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria ====\nThree hurricanes hit the U.S. in August and September 2017: [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]] in southeastern Texas, [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] on the Florida Gulf coast, and [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] in Puerto Rico. Trump signed into law $15 billion in relief for Harvey and Irma, and later $18.67 billion for all three. The administration came under criticism for its delayed response to the humanitarian crisis on Puerto Rico. Politicians of both parties had called for immediate aid for Puerto Rico, and criticized Trump for focusing on a feud with the NFL instead. Trump did not comment on Puerto Rico for several days while the crisis was unfolding. According to ''The Washington Post'', the White House did not feel a sense of urgency until \"images of the utter destruction and desperation\u2014and criticism of the administration's response\u2014began to appear on television\". Trump dismissed the criticism, saying distribution of necessary supplies was \"doing well\". ''The Washington Post'' noted, \"on the ground in Puerto Rico, nothing could be further from the truth.\" Trump also criticized Puerto Rico officials. A ''BMJ'' analysis found the federal government responded much more quickly and on a larger scale to the hurricane in Texas and Florida than in Puerto Rico, despite the fact that the hurricane in Puerto Rico was more severe.\n\nAt the time of FEMA's departure from Puerto Rico, one third of Puerto Rico residents still lacked electricity and some places lacked running water. A [[New England Journal of Medicine]] study estimated the number of hurricane-related deaths during the period September 20 to December 31, 2017, to be around 4,600 (range 793\u20138,498) The official death rate due to Maria reported by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is 2,975; the figure was based on an independent investigation by [[George Washington University]] commissioned by the governor of Puerto Rico. Trump falsely claimed the official death rate was wrong, and said the Democrats were trying to make him \"look as bad as possible\".\n\n==== California wildfires ====\nIn November 2018, while California experienced [[2018 California wildfires|one of its most destructive wildfires]], Trump blamed the fires on \"gross\" and \"poor\" \"mismanagement\" of forests by California, saying there was no other reason for these wildfires. ''The New York Times'' described Trump's claims as misleading, noting that the fires in question were not \"forest fires\", that most of the forest was owned by federal agencies, and that climate change in part contributed to the fires.\n\n=== Immigration ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|This section '''may be [[Help:Section#Section%20size%20policies|too long]] and excessively detailed.''' Please consider summarizing the material while [[wikipedia:CITE|citing sources]] as needed. <small>''(July 2019)''</small>\n|}\nMain article: [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump]]\n\nSee also: [[Immigration reform]] and [[Trump wall]]\n[[Kevin McAleenan]], acting [[Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security]]\n\nTrump has repeatedly characterized [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] as criminals, although multiple studies have found they have lower crime and incarceration rates than native-born Americans. Prior to taking office, Trump promised to deport the eleven million illegal immigrants living in the United States and to build a [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier|wall]] along the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Upon taking office, Trump directed the DHS to begin work on a wall. An internal DHS report estimated Trump's wall would cost $21.6 billion and take 3.5 years to build (far higher than the Trump 2016 campaign's estimate ($12 billion) and the $15 billion estimate from Republican congressional leaders).\n\nThe transcript of a January 2017 phone call between Trump and Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was leaked; in the phone call, Trump conceded that he would fund the border wall, not by charging Mexico as he promised during the campaign, and implored the Mexican president to stop saying publicly the Mexican government would not pay for the border wall. In January 2018, the administration proposed spending $18 billion over the next ten years on the wall, more than half of the $33 billion spending blueprint for border security. Trump's plan would reduce funding for border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and customs agents; experts and officials say these are more effective at curbing illegal immigration and preventing terrorism and smuggling than a border wall.\n\nThe administration embraced the 2017 [[RAISE Act]] which sought to reduce legal immigration levels to the U.S. by 50% by halving the number of [[Permanent residence (United States)|green cards]] issued, capping [[refugee]] admissions at 50,000 a year and ending the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa|visa diversity lottery]].\n\nThe administration terminated a program that granted temporary legal residence to unaccompanied Central American minors. 2,714 individuals would need to renew their legal residence status through other more difficult immigrant channels. The administration revoked the [[Temporary Protected Status]] (TPS) granted to 60,000 Haitians (following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]), and 200,000 Salvadorans (following a series of devastating earthquakes in 2001). The Salvadorans are parents to an estimated 190,000 U.S.-born children. A federal judge blocked the administration's attempt to deport the TPS recipients, citing what the judge said was Trump's racial \"animus against non-white, non-European immigrants\".\n\nAn analysis released by Trump's [[Department of Health and Human Services]] in September 2017 was found to have removed earlier findings that refugees entering America had a $63 billion net positive effect on tax revenues between 2005 and 2014, with the final report counting only the costs refugees incur. In July 2018, Sessions rescinded a DOJ guidance on refugees and asylum seekers' right to work, thus prohibiting them from working in the United States.\n\nIn October 2017, Secretary of Defense Mattis added additional background checks for non-citizens who served in the military and extended the time they had to serve before they could receive necessary paperwork to pursue U.S. citizenship. As a result of these changes, the number of service members who applied for citizenship through their service declined by 65% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\n\nIn December 2017, the administration announced that it would make it illegal for spouses of [[H-1B visa]] holders to work in the United States.\n\nIn January 2018, Trump was widely criticized after referring to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations in general as \"shithole countries\" at a bipartisan meeting on immigration. Multiple international leaders condemned his remarks as racist.\n\nBy February 2018, arrests of undocumented immigrants by ICE increased by 40% during Trump's tenure. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants were twice as high as during Obama's final year in office. Arrests of undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions increased only slightly.\n\nIn March 2018, the Commerce Department announced it would add a citizenship question to the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]]. Experts noted that the inclusion of such a question would likely result in severe undercounting of the population and faulty data, as undocumented immigrants would be less likely to respond to the census. [[Blue states]], especially California, are therefore likely to get less congressional apportionment and fund apportionment than they would otherwise get, because they have larger undocumented populations. In response, [[Xavier Becerra]], California's attorney general, announced his attention to sue the administration over the decision. Similar suits were filed in New York, Washington D.C., and several cities. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and immigrants' rights organizations sued in June 2018. [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Federal District Court]] judge [[Jesse M. Furman|Jesse Furman]] blocked the administration plan on January 15, 2019. Documents released in May 2019 showed [[Thomas B. Hofeller]], an architect of Republican gerrymandering, had found adding the census question would help to gerrymander maps that \"would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites\". Hofeller later wrote the DOJ letter which justified the policy by claiming it was needed to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nIn July 2018, experts noted that due to the administration's strict border security policy, there was an increase in criminality and lawlessness along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. There was a strengthening of ties between human smugglers, organized crime and corrupt local law enforcement, and organized crime groups were preying on asylum seekers who were prevented by U.S. authorities from filing for asylum.\n\nDuring the 2018 mid-term election campaign, Trump sent nearly 5,600 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border for the stated purpose of protecting the United States against a caravan of Central American migrants. The Pentagon had previously concluded the caravan posed no threat to the U.S. The border deployment was estimated to cost as much as $220 million by the end of the year. With daily warnings from Trump about the dangers of the caravan during the mid-terms, the frequency and intensity of the caravan rhetoric nearly stopped after election day.\n\nOn September 26, 2019, The [[Trump administration]] announced it plans to allow only 18,000 refugees to resettle in the United States in the 2020 fiscal year, its lowest level since the modern program began in 1980.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Period\n!Refugee Program\n|-\n|2018\n|45,000\n|-\n|2019\n|30,000\n|-\n|2020\n|18,000\n|}\n\n==== Family separation policy ====\nMain article: [[Trump administration family separation policy]]\n\nSee also: [[Protests against Trump administration family separation policy]]\nJune 2018 protest against the [[Trump administration family separation policy]], in Chicago, Illinois\n\nIn May 2018, the administration announced it would separate children from parents caught unlawfully crossing the southern border into the United States. Parents were routinely charged with a [[misdemeanor]] and jailed; their children were placed in separate detention centers with no established procedure to track them or reunite them with their parent after they had served time for their offence, generally only a few hours or days. Later that month, Trump falsely accused Democrats of creating that policy, despite it originating from his own administration, and urged Congress to \"get together\" and pass an immigration bill. Members of Congress from both parties condemned the practice and pointed out that the White House could end the separations on its own; Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said, \"President Trump could stop this policy with a phone call.\" ''[[The Washington Post]]'' quoted a White House official as saying Trump's decision to separate migrant families was to gain political leverage to force Democrats and moderate Republicans to accept hardline immigration legislation.\n\nSix weeks into the implementation of the \"zero tolerance\" policy, at least 2,300 migrant children had been separated from their families. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American College of Physicians]] and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] condemned the policy, with the American Academy of Pediatrics saying the policy was causing \"irreparable harm\" to the children. The policy was extremely unpopular, more so than any major piece of legislation in recent memory. Images of children held in cage-like detention centers, interviews of sobbing mothers who had no idea where their children were and had not heard from them for weeks and months, and an audio of sobbing children resulted in an outrage calling the practice \"inhumane\", \"cruel\" and \"evil\". On June 30, [[Protests against Trump administration family separation policy|a national protest]] drew hundreds of thousands of protesters from all 50 states to demonstrate in more than 600 towns and cities. All four living former [[First Ladies of the United States]]\u2014[[Rosalynn Carter]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Laura Bush]], and [[Michelle Obama]]\u2014condemned the policy of separating children from their parents. Amidst the growing outrage, [[Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] secretary [[Kirstjen Nielsen]] falsely claimed, \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\"\n\nOn June 20, 2018, amid worldwide outrage and enormous political pressure to roll back his policy, Trump signed an executive order to end family separations at the U.S. border, unilaterally reversing his policy. He had earlier said, \"You can't do it through an executive order.\" As the result of a class-action lawsuit filed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], on June 26, U.S. District Judge [[Dana Sabraw]] issued a nationwide [[preliminary injunction]] against the family-separation policy, and required the government to reunite separated families within 30 days. On July 26, the administration said 1,442 children had been reunited with their parents while 711 remain in government shelters because their cases are still under review, their parents have criminal records, or they are no longer in the U.S. Administration officials state that 431 parents of those children have already been deported without their children. Officials said they will work with the court to return the remaining children, including the children whose parents have been deported.\n\n==== Travel bans ====\nSee also: [[Executive Order 13769]], [[Executive Order 13780]], and s:Proclamation 9645\nTrump signs [[Executive Order 13769]] at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. Vice President [[Mike Pence]] (left) and Secretary of Defense [[James Mattis]] look on, January 27, 2017.\n\nIn January 2017, Trump signed an [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] which indefinitely suspended admission of asylum seekers fleeing the [[Syrian Civil War]], suspended admission of all other refugees for 120 days, and denied entry to citizens of [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]] for 90 days. The order also established a religious test for refugees from Muslim nations by giving priority to refugees of other religions over Muslim refugees. Later, the administration seemed to reverse a portion of part of the order, effectively exempting visitors with a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. After the order was challenged in the federal courts, several federal judges issued rulings [[Injunction|enjoining]] the government from enforcing the order. Trump [[Dismissals of Sally Yates and Daniel Ragsdale|fired]] acting Attorney General [[Sally Yates]] after she said she would not defend the order in court; Yates was replaced by [[Dana Boente]], who said the DOJ would defend the order.\n\nA [[Executive Order 13780|new executive order]] was signed in March which limited travel to the U.S. from six different countries for 90 days, and by all refugees who do not possess either a visa or valid travel documents for 120 days. The new executive order revoked and replaced the executive order issued in January.\n\nIn June, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] partially [[Stay of execution|stayed]] certain injunctions that were put on the order by two federal appeals courts earlier, allowing the executive order to mostly go into effect. In October, the Court dismissed the case, saying the orders had been replaced by a new proclamation, so challenges to the previous executive orders are moot.\n\nIn September, Trump signed a proclamation placing limits on the six countries in the second executive order and added [[Chad]], [[North Korea]], and [[Venezuela]]. In October 2017, Judge [[Derrick Watson]], of the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii|U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii]] issued another temporary [[restraining order]]. In December 2017, the Supreme Court allowed the September 2017 travel restrictions to go into effect while legal challenges in Hawaii and Maryland are heard. The decision effectively barred most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea from entry into the United States along with some government officials from Venezuela and their families.\n\nIn January 2020, President Trump added [[Nigeria]], [[Myanmar]], [[Eritrea]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tanzania]] to the visa ban list. \n\nAmid the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|pandemic]] of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], President Trump further restricted travel from Iran on February 29, 2020, and advised American citizens not to travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea in response to the coronavirus. In March 2020, the Trump administration later issued a ban on entrants from all [[Schengen Area]] countries, although [[Ireland]] and former EU member the [[United Kingdom]] were initially absent from the ban; the ban was later extended to the latter two countries.\n\n==== 2018\u20132019 federal government shutdown ====\nMain article: [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019]]\n\nThe federal government was partially shut down from December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, (the longest shutdown in U.S. history) over Trump's demand that Congress provide $5.7 billion in federal funds for a [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier#Trump%20administration|U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall]]. The House and Senate lacked votes necessary to support his funding demand and to overcome Trump's refusal to sign the appropriations last passed by Congress into law. In negotiations with Democratic leaders leading up to the shutdown, Trump commented he would be \"proud to shut down the government for border security\". By mid-January 2019, the White House [[Council of Economic Advisors]] estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nMain article: [[Social policy of Donald Trump#LGBT%20issues|Social policy of Donald Trump \u00a7 LGBT issues]]\n\nSee also: [[LGBT rights in the United States]]\n\nThe administration rolled back numerous LGBT protections, in particular those implemented during the Obama administration, covering issues such as health care, education, employment, housing, military, and criminal justice, as well as foster care and adoption. The administration sought to rescind rules prohibiting adoption and foster care agencies funded by the government from discriminating against LGBT adoption and foster parents. The DOJ reversed its position on whether the Civil Rights Act's workplace protections covered LGBT individuals, and the DOJ argued in state and federal courts for a constitutional right for businesses to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The administration exempted government contractors from following federal workplace discrimination rules, as long as they could cite religious reasons for doing so.\n\nThe administration rescinded a directive that public schools treat students according to their gender identity. The administration rescinded a federal policy that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity, and dropped a lawsuit against North Carolina's \"bathroom bill\". The administration rescinded rules that prohibited discrimination against LGBT patients by health care providers. Rules were rescinded to give transgender homeless people equal access to homeless shelters, and to house transgender prison inmates according to their gender identity \"when appropriate\". HHS stopped collecting information on LGBT participants in its national survey of older adults, and the [[Census Bureau]] removed \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" as proposed subjects for possible inclusion on the [[2020 United States Census|Decennial Census]] and/or [[American Community Survey]]. The DOJ and the [[United States Labor Department|Labor Department]] cancelled quarterly conference calls with LGBT organizations.\n\nTrump said he would not allow \"[[Transgender personnel in the United States military|transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military]]\", citing disruptions and medical costs. In March 2018, President Trump signed a [[Presidential Memorandum on Military Service by Transgender Individuals by Donald Trump (March 23, 2018)|Presidential Memorandum]] to prohibit transgender persons, whether transitioned or not, with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria from military service, except for individuals who have had 36 consecutive months of stability \"in their biological sex prior to accession\" and currently serving transgender persons in military service. Studies of countries that had allowed transgender individuals to serve in the military found \"little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness\", and studies showed that the medical costs for transgender service members would be \"minimal\".\n\nThe [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]] imposed sanctions on Chechen President [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] and a Chechen law enforcement official, citing [[anti-gay purges in Chechnya]]. In February 2019, the administration launched a global campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality, an initiative pushed by Richard Grenell, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Asked about the administration's campaign, Trump appeared to be unaware of it. Trump has nominated two LGBT persons to the federal judiciary ([[Mary M. Rowland]] and [[Patrick J. Bumatay]]). Other high-profile appointments of LGBT persons made by Trump are [[Richard Grenell]], [[James T. Abbott]], and [[David Glawe]].\n\n=== Science ===\nThe administration marginalized the role of science in policymaking, halted numerous research projects, and saw the departure of scientists who said their work was marginalized or suppressed. It was the first administration since 1941 not to name a [[Science Advisor to the President]]. While preparing for talks with [[Kim Jong-un]], the White House did not do so with the assistance of a White House science adviser or senior counselor trained in [[nuclear physics]]. The position of chief scientist in the State Department or the Department of Agriculture was not filled. The administration nominated [[Sam Clovis]] to be chief scientist in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], but he had no scientific background and the White House later withdrew the nomination. The administration successfully nominated [[Jim Bridenstine]], who had no background in science and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, to lead [[NASA]]. The [[United States Department of the Interior]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] disbanded advisory committees.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] prohibited the use of the term \"[[climate change]]\". The administration reportedly sent a list to the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] on words that the agency was prohibited from using in its official communications, including \"[[transgender]]\", \"[[fetus]]\", \"[[Evidence-based research|evidence-based]]\", \"science-based\", \"[[Vulnerability|vulnerable]]\", \"[[entitlement]]\", and \"[[Diversity (politics)|diversity]]\". The Director of the CDC denied these reports.\n\nIn March 2020 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that an official at the Interior Department has repeatedly inserted climate change-denying language into the agency's scientific reports, such as those that affect water and mineral rights.\n\n=== Surveillance ===\nIn 2019, Trump signed into law a six-year extension of Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA), allowing the NSA to conduct searches of foreigners' communications without any warrant. The process incidentally collects information from Americans.\n\n=== Veterans affairs ===\nPrior to [[David Shulkin]]'s firing in April 2018, ''The New York Times'' described the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) as a \"rare spot of calm in the Trump administration\". Shulkin built upon changes started under the Obama administration to do a long-term overhaul of the VA system. In May 2018, legislation to increase veterans' access to private care was stalled, as was a VA overhaul which sought to synchronize medical records. In May 2018, there were reports of a large number of resignations of senior staffers and a major re-shuffling.\n\nIn August 2018, ''ProPublica'' reported a group of three wealthy Mar-a-Lago patrons, who had no experience in the military or the government, formed an \"informal council\" that strongly shaped VA decision-making, including involving a $10 billion contract to modernize veterans' health records. The trio, which VA staff referred to as \"the [[Mar-a-Lago Crowd]]\", spoke to VA staff daily, and provided instructions on policy and personnel decisions at the agency. [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] announced in November 2018 that it would investigate the matter.\n\n=== Voting rights ===\nUnder the first 18 months of the administration, the DOJ \"launched no new efforts to roll back state restrictions on the ability to vote, and instead often sides with them\".\n\nTrump repeatedly, without evidence, alleged there was widespread voter fraud. The administration created a [[Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity|commission]] with the stated purpose to review the extent of voter fraud in the wake of Trump's false claim that millions of unauthorized votes cost him the popular vote in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. It was chaired by Vice President Pence, while the day-to-day administrator was [[Kris Kobach]], best known for promoting restrictions on access to voting. The commission began its work by requesting each state to turn over detailed information about all registered voters in their database. Most states rejected the request, citing privacy concerns or state laws. Multiple lawsuits were filed against the commission. [[Maine Secretary of State]] [[Matthew Dunlap]] said Kobach was refusing to share working documents and scheduling information with him and the other Democrats on the commission. A federal judge ordered the commission to hand over the documents. Shortly thereafter, Trump disbanded the commission, and informed Dunlap that it would not obey the court order to provide the documents because the commission no longer existed. Election integrity experts argued that the commission was disbanded because of the lawsuits, which would have led to greater transparency and accountability and thus prevented the Republican members of the commission from producing a sham report to justify restrictions on voting rights. It was later revealed the Commission had, in its requests for Texas voter data, specifically asked for data that identifies voters with Hispanic surnames.\n\n=== White nationalists and Charlottesville rally ===\nSee also: [[Unite the Right rally]]\n[[Protests against Donald Trump|Anti-Trump protest]] in Greensboro by the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups [[Democratic Socialists of America]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World]]\n\nOn August 13, 2017, Trump condemned violence \"on many sides\" after [[2017 Unite the Right rally|a gathering]] of hundreds of [[White nationalism|white nationalists]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], the previous day (August 12) turned deadly. A white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. According to Sessions, that action met the definition of domestic terrorism. During the rally there had been other violence, as some counter-protesters charged at the white nationalists with swinging clubs and mace, throwing bottles, rocks, and paint. Trump did not expressly mention Neo-Nazis, [[White supremacy|white supremacists]], or the [[alt-right]] movement in his remarks on August 13, but the following day (August 14) he did denounce white supremacists. He condemned \"the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups\". Then the next day (August 15), he again blamed \"both sides\".\n\nMany Republican and Democratic elected officials condemned the violence and hatred of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists. Trump came under criticism from world leaders and politicians, as well as a variety of religious groups and anti-hate organizations for his remarks, which were seen as muted and equivocal. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported Trump \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'\", and said Trump had \"buoyed the white nationalist movement on Tuesday as no president has done in generations\".\n\n== Foreign policy ==\nMain article: [[Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration]]\n\nSee also: [[List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump]]\nTrump and [[Vietnam]]'s [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] leader [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng]] in front of a statue of [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Hanoi, February 27, 2019\n\nThe stated aims of the foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration include a focus on security, by fighting terrorists abroad and strengthening border defenses and immigration controls; an expansion of the U.S. military; an \"America First\" approach to trade; and diplomacy whereby \"old enemies become friends\". The [[Foreign policy of Donald Trump|foreign policy positions expressed by Trump during his presidential campaign]] changed frequently, so it was \"difficult to glean a political agenda, or even a set of clear, core policy values ahead of his presidency\". Despite pledges to reduce the number of active duty U.S. military personnel deployed overseas, the number was essentially the same three years into Trump's presidency as they were at the end of Obama's.\n\nTrump has repeatedly praised [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] such as [[China]]'s president [[Xi Jinping]], [[Philippines]] president [[Rodrigo Duterte]], [[Egypt|Egyptian]] president [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], [[Turkey]]'s president [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]], Italy's prime minister [[Giuseppe Conte]], Brazil's president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] and Hungarian prime minister [[Viktor Orban]]. Trump also praised [[Poland]] under the EU-skeptic, anti-immigrant [[Law and Justice]] party (PiS) as a defender of Western civilization.\n\n''The New York Times'' reported on January 14, 2019, that on several occasions during 2018 Trump had privately said he wanted America to withdraw from [[NATO]]. Top defense and national security officials such as [[Jim Mattis]] and [[John R. Bolton]] reportedly \"scrambled to keep American strategy on track without mention of a withdrawal that would drastically reduce Washington's influence in Europe and could embolden Russia for decades\".\n\nA January 2019 intelligence community assessment found that Iran was not pursuing nuclear weapons and North Korea was unlikely to relinquish its nuclear arsenal. Both assessments directly contradicted core tenets of Trump's stated foreign policy. The [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] also assessed that Trump's trade policies and unilateralism had damaged traditional alliances and induced foreign partners to seek new relationships. The day after the heads of the intelligence community presented their findings in public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Trump referred to them as \"extremely passive and naive\" and \"wrong\" in their assessments. The following day, Trump asserted the press had misquoted the intelligence chiefs' testimony to fabricate a conflict, claiming he and the intelligence community were \"on the same page!\" In a subsequent interview with ''The New York Times'', Trump falsely asserted that the intelligence community had characterized Iran as \"essentially, a wonderful place\".\nOn February 18, 2019, Trump appealed to the Venezuelan military to back opposition leader [[Juan Guaid\u00f3]].\n\nOn February 5, 2019, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to rebuke Trump for his decisions to [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War#December%202018|withdraw troops from Syria]] and Afghanistan. Drafted by majority leader [[Mitch McConnell]], the measure was supported by nearly all Republicans and was the second time in two months that the Republican-controlled Senate criticized the President's foreign policy.\n\nAfter initially adopting a verbally hostile posture toward North Korea and its leader, [[Kim Jong-un]], Trump quickly pivoted to embrace the regime, saying he and Kim \"fell in love\". Trump engaged Kim by meeting him at two summits, in June 2018 and February 2019, an unprecedented move by an American president, as previous policy had been that a president's simply meeting with the North Korean leader would legitimize the regime on the world stage. During the June 2018 summit, the leaders signed a vague agreement to pursue denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, with Trump immediately declaring \"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.\" Little progress was made toward that goal during the months before the February 2019 summit, which ended abruptly without an agreement, hours after the White House announced a signing ceremony was imminent. During the months between the summits, a growing body of evidence indicated North Korea was continuing its nuclear fuel, bomb and missile development, including by redeveloping an [[ICBM]] site it was previously appearing to dismantle\u2014even while the second summit was underway. In the aftermath of the February 2019 failed summit, the Treasury department imposed additional sanctions on North Korea. The following day, Trump tweeted, \"It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!\" On December 31, 2019, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] announced that Kim had abandoned his moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, quoting Kim as saying, \"the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future.\"\n\nDuring a June 2019 visit to South Korea, Trump visited the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] and invited North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to meet him there, which he did, and Trump became the first sitting president to step inside North Korea. Trump later falsely asserted, \"President Obama wanted to meet and chairman Kim would not meet him. The Obama administration was begging for a meeting.\"\nPresident Trump with Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] in the Oval Office of the White House, November 13, 2019\n\nIn October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], the White House acknowledged that Turkey would be carrying out a planned military offensive into northern Syria; as such, [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|U.S. troops in northern Syria]] were withdrawn from the area to avoid interference with that operation. The statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIS fighters to Turkey. Congress members of both parties denounced the move, including Republican allies of Trump like Senator [[Lindsey Graham]]. They argued that the move betrayed the American-allied Kurds, and would benefit ISIS, Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime. Trump defended the move, citing the high cost of supporting the Kurds, and the lack of support from the Kurds in past U.S. wars. Within a week of the U.S. pullout, [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria|Turkey proceeded to attack Kurdish-controlled areas in northeast Syria]]. Kurdish forces then announced an alliance with the Syrian government and its Russian allies, in a united effort to repel Turkey.\n\nOn 27 October 2019, ISIS leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] killed himself and three children by detonating a [[suicide vest]] during the [[Barisha raid]] conducted by the U.S. [[Delta Force]] in Syria's northwestern [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib Province]].\n\nThe United States for decades considered the [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlements]] in the occupied [[West Bank]] to be \"illegitimate\" until the Trump Administration in November 2019 shifted its position declaring \"the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not ''per se'' inconsistent with international law.\"\n\n== Russia and related investigations ==\nSee also: [[Links between Trump associates and Russian officials]], [[Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia]], [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], [[Operation Crossfire Hurricane]], [[Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)]], and [[Mueller Report]]\nRobert Mueller in the Oval Office\nAmerican intelligence sources have said with \"high confidence\" the Russian government [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|attempted to intervene]] in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump, and that members of Trump's campaign were in contact with Russian government officials both before and after the election. In May 2017, the [[United States Department of Justice]] appointed [[Robert Mueller]] as special counsel to [[Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|investigate]] \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\". Because of the Russian interference and subsequent investigation, many members of Trump's administration have come under special scrutiny regarding past ties to Russia or actions during the campaign. Several of Trump's top advisers, including [[Paul Manafort]] and [[Michael T. Flynn]], who had official positions before Trump replaced them, have strong ties to Russia. Several others had meetings with Russians during the campaign which they did not initially disclose.\n\nTrump himself hosted the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, in partnership with Russian-Azerbaijani billionaire [[Aras Agalarov]]. On many occasions since 1987, Trump and his children and other associates have traveled to Moscow to explore potential business opportunities, such as a failed attempt to build a Trump Tower Moscow. Between 1996 and 2008 Trump's company submitted at least eight trademark applications for potential real estate development deals in Russia. However, as of 2017 he has no known investments or businesses in Russia. Trump said in 2017, \"I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia.\" In 2008, his son Donald Trump Jr. said \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets\" and \"we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia\".\n\nDuring his January 2017 confirmation hearings as the attorney general nominee before the Senate, then-Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) was asked by Senator Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT) if he had been \"in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\" Sessions' single word response was \"No\", which raised questions about what appeared to be deliberate omission of two meetings he had in 2016 with Russian Ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]]. Sessions later amended his testimony saying he \"never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign\". He said that in March 2016, he had twice met with Ambassador Kislyak, and \"stood by his earlier remarks as an honest and correct answer to a question\". Officials with the DOJ said when Sessions met with Kislyak it was not as a Trump campaign surrogate, rather it was \"in his capacity as a member of the armed services panel\". Following his amended statement, Sessions recused himself from any investigation regarding connections between Trump and Russia.\n\nIn May 2017, [[Donald Trump]] discussed [[Donald Trump revelation of classified information to Russia|highly classified intelligence]] in an [[Oval Office]] meeting with the Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] and ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]], providing details that could expose the source of the information and the manner in which it was collected. A Middle Eastern ally provided the intelligence which had the highest level of classification and was not intended to be shared widely. ''The New York Times'' reported, \"Trump's disclosure does not appear to have been illegal\u2014the president has the power to declassify almost anything. But sharing the information without the express permission of the ally who provided it was a major breach of espionage etiquette, and could jeopardize a crucial [[Intelligence sharing|intelligence-sharing]] relationship.\" The White House, through [[National Security Advisor]] [[H. R. McMaster]], issued a limited denial, saying the story \"as reported\" was incorrect and that no \"intelligence sources or methods\" were discussed. McMaster did not deny that information had been disclosed. The following day Trump said on Twitter that Russia is an important ally against terrorism and that he had an \"absolute right\" to share classified information with Russia. Soon after the meeting, American intelligence extracted a high-level covert source from within the Russian government, on concerns the individual could be at risk due, in part, to Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandling classified intelligence.\n\nIn October 2017, former Trump campaign advisor [[George Papadopoulos]] pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI regarding his contacts with Russian agents. During the campaign he had tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to set up meetings in Russia between Trump campaign representatives and Russian officials. The guilty plea was part of a plea bargain whereby Papadopoulos cooperates with the Mueller investigation.\n\nIn February 2018, when Special Counsel Mueller indicted more than a dozen Russians and three entities for interference in the 2016 election, Trump's response was to assert that the indictment was proof his campaign did not collude with the Russians. ''The New York Times'' noted Trump \"voiced no concern that a foreign power had been trying for nearly four years to upend American democracy, much less resolve to stop it from continuing to do so this year\". A day after the indictment, Trump used the FBI's alleged failure to stop the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|Stoneman Douglas High School shooter]] to call for the end to investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn July 2018, the special counsel's office indicted twelve Russian intelligence operatives and accused them of conspiring to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, by hacking servers and emails of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The indictments were made before Trump's meeting with Putin in Helsinki, in which Trump supported Putin's denial that Russia was involved and criticized American law enforcement and intelligence community (subsequently Trump partially walked back some of his comments). A few days later, it was reported that Trump had actually been briefed on the veracity and extent of Russian cyber-attacks two weeks before his inauguration, back in December 2016, including the fact that these were ordered by Putin himself. The evidence presented to him at the time included text and email conversations between Russian military officers as well as information from a source close to Putin. According to the report, at the time, in the classified meeting, Trump \"sounded grudgingly convinced\".\n\n''The Washington Post'' reported on January 12, 2019, that Trump had gone to \"extraordinary lengths\" to keep details of his private conversations with Russian president Putin secret, including in one case by retaining his interpreter's notes and instructing the linguist to not share the contents of the discussions with anyone in the administration. As a result, there were no detailed records, even in classified files, of Trump's conversations with Putin on five occasions. According to [[The Financial Times]], there were no American aides present when Trump met privately with Putin at the [[2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit]] in November 2018.\n\nOf Trump's campaign advisors and staff, six of them were indicted by the special counsel's office; five of them (Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos) pleaded guilty, while one has pleaded not guilty (Roger Stone).\n\n=== Special Counsel's report ===\nOn March 22, 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller submitted the final report to Attorney General William Barr. On March 24, 2019, Attorney General Barr sent Congress a [[Barr letter|four-page letter]], describing what he said were the special counsel's principal conclusions in the Mueller Report. Barr added that since the special counsel \"did not draw a conclusion\" on obstruction, this \"leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime\". Barr continued: \"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"\n\nOn April 18, 2019, a two-volume [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] version of the Special Counsel's report titled ''[[Report on the Investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential Election|Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election]]'' was released to Congress and to the public. About one-eighth of the lines in the public version were redacted.\n\n[[Mueller Report#Volume%20I|Volume I]] discusses about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, concluding that interference occurred \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" and \"violated U.S. criminal law\". The report detailed activities by the [[Internet Research Agency]], a Kremlin-linked Russian troll farm, to create a \"social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\", and to \"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\". The report also described how the Russian intelligence service, the [[GRU (G.U.)|GRU]], performed [[computer hacking]] and strategic releasing of damaging material from the Clinton campaign and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] organizations. To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators used the legal standard for criminal [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] rather than the popular concept of \"collusion\", because a crime of \"collusion\" is not found in criminal law or the [[United States Code]].\n\nAccording to the report, the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", and found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" However, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony (exercising the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]), as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications. As such, the Mueller Report \"cannot rule out the possibility\" that information then unavailable to investigators would have presented different findings.\n\n[[Mueller Report#Volume%20II|Volume II]] covered obstruction of justice. The report described [[Mueller Report#Episodes%20of%20alleged%20obstruction|ten episodes]] where Trump may have obstructed justice as president, plus one instance before he was elected. The report said that in addition to Trump's public attacks on the investigation and its subjects, he had also privately tried to \"control the investigation\" in multiple ways, but mostly failed to influence it because his subordinates or associates refused to carry out his instructions. For that reason, no charges against the Trump's aides and associates were recommended \"beyond those already filed\". The Special Counsel could not charge Trump himself once investigators decided to abide by an [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and they feared charges would affect Trump's governing and possibly preempt his [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]]. In addition, investigators felt it would be unfair to accuse Trump of a crime without charges and without a trial in which he could clear his name, hence investigators \"determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\".\n\nSince the Special Counsel's office had decided \"not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether to \"initiate or decline a prosecution\", they \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct\". The report \"does not conclude that the president committed a crime\", but specifically did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, because investigators were not confident that Trump was innocent after examining his intent and actions. The report concluded \"that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice\" and \"that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law\".\n\nOn May 1, 2019, following publication of the Special Counsel's report, Barr testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], during which Barr said he \"didn't exonerate\" Trump on obstruction as that was not the role of the Justice Department. He declined to testify before the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] the following day because he objected to the committee's plan to use staff lawyers during questioning. Barr also repeatedly failed to give the unredacted Special Counsel's report to the Judiciary Committee by its deadline of May 6, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the committee voted to hold Barr in [[contempt of Congress]], which refers the matter to entire House for resolution. Concurrently, Trump asserted [[executive privilege]] via the Department of Justice in an effort to prevent the redacted portions of the Special Counsel's report and the underlying evidence from being disclosed. Committee chairman [[Jerry Nadler]] said the U.S. is in a [[constitutional crisis]], \"because the President is disobeying the law, is refusing all information to Congress\". Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] agreed with Nadler's characterization and told fellow Democrats Trump was \"self-impeaching\" by stonewalling Congress, with some Democrats and analysts noting that refusing to comply with subpoenas was the third article of [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment]] for [[Richard Nixon]].\n\nFollowing release of the Mueller Report, Trump and his allies turned their attention toward \"investigating the investigators\". On May 23, 2019, Trump ordered the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] to cooperate with Barr's investigation of the origins of the investigation, granting Barr full authority to declassify any intelligence information related to the matter. Some analysts expressed concerns that the order could create a conflict between the Justice Department and the intelligence community over closely guarded intelligence sources and methods, as well as open the possibility Barr could cherrypick intelligence for public release to help Trump.\n\nUpon announcing the formal closure of the investigation and his resignation from the Justice Department on May 29, Mueller said, \"If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.\" During his testimony to Congress on July 24, 2019, Mueller answered Republican Representative [[Ken Buck]] that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after the president left office.\n\n== Ethics ==\nSee also: [[Lobbying in the United States]], [[List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump]], [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal]], and [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations]]\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to \"[[drain the swamp]]\"\u2014a phrase that usually refers to entrenched corruption and lobbying in Washington, D.C.\u2014and he proposed a series of ethics reforms. However, according to federal records and interviews, there has been a dramatic increase in lobbying by corporations and hired interests during Trump's tenure, particularly through the office of Vice-President Mike Pence. About twice as many lobbying firms contacted Pence, compared to previous presidencies, among them representatives of major energy firms and drug companies. In many cases, the lobbyists have charged their clients millions of dollars for access to the vice president, and then have turned around and donated the money to Pence's political causes.\n\nAmong his proposals was a five-year ban on serving as a lobbyist after working in the executive branch. Trump's transition team also announced that registered lobbyists would be barred from serving in the Trump administration. However, an Obama era ban on lobbyists taking administrative jobs was lifted and at least nine transition officials became lobbyists within the first 100 days.\n\nOne of Trump's campaign promises was that he would not accept a presidential salary. In keeping with this pledge, Trump donated the entirety of his first two quarterly salaries as president to government agencies.\n\n=== Potential conflicts of interest ===\n[[Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], then the prime minister of Turkey, attended the opening of the [[Trump Towers Istanbul]] AVM in 2012.\n\nTrump's presidency has been marked by significant public concern about [[conflict of interest]] stemming from his diverse business ventures. In the lead up to his inauguration, Trump promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses. Trump placed his sons [[Eric Trump]] and [[Donald Trump Jr.]] at the head of his businesses claiming they would not communicate with him regarding his interests. However, critics noted that this would not prevent him from having input into his businesses and knowing how to benefit himself, and Trump continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses. As his presidency progressed, he failed to take steps or show interest in further distancing himself from his business interests resulting in numerous potential conflicts.\n\nMany ethics experts found Trump's plan to address conflicts of interest between his position as president and his private business interests to be entirely inadequate; [[Norman L. Eisen]] and [[Richard Painter]], who served as the chief White House ethics lawyers for Barack Obama and [[George W. Bush]] respectively, said the plan \"falls short in every respect\". Unlike every other president in the last 40 years, Trump did not put his business interests in a [[blind trust]] or equivalent arrangement \"to cleanly sever himself from his business interests\". Eisen said Trump's case is \"an even more problematic situation because he's receiving foreign government payments and other benefits and things of value that's expressly prohibited by the Constitution\" in the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]].\n\nIn January 2018, a year into his presidency, a survey found that he \"continues to own stakes in hundreds of businesses, both in this country and abroad\".\n\nAfter Trump took office, the [[watchdog group]] [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]], represented by a number of constitutional scholars, sued him for violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause (a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] provision that bars the president or any other federal official from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments), because his hotels and other businesses accept payment from foreign governments. CREW separately filed a complaint with the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) over [[Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C.]]; the 2013 lease that Trump and the GSA signed \"explicitly forbids any elected government official from holding the lease or benefiting from it\". The GSA said it was \"reviewing the situation\". By May 2017, the ''[[CREW v. Trump]]'' lawsuit had grown with additional plaintiffs and alleged violations of the [[Domestic Emoluments Clause]]. In June 2017, attorneys from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right to sue and that the described conduct was not illegal. Also in June 2017, two more lawsuits were filed based on the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]]: ''[[D.C. and Maryland v. Trump]]'', and ''[[Blumenthal v. Trump]]'', which was signed by more than one-third of the voting members of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. [[United States District Judge]] [[George B. Daniels]] dismissed the CREW case on December 21, 2017, holding that plaintiffs lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]]. ''D.C. and Maryland v. Trump'' cleared three judicial hurdles to proceed to the [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] phase during 2018, with prosecutors issuing 38 subpoenas to Trump's businesses and cabinet departments in December before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] issued a [[Stay of proceedings|stay]] days later at the behest of the Justice Department, pending hearings in March 2019. NBC News reported that by June 2019 representatives of 22 governments had spent money at Trump properties.\n\nIn February 2017, Trump senior advisor [[Kellyanne Conway]] promoted the clothing line of [[Ivanka Trump]] in a TV appearance from the White House briefing room. [[Office of Government Ethics]] director [[Walter Shaub]] requested disciplinary action in a letter to the [[White House Counsel]]'s office. Under federal ethics regulations, federal employees are barred from using their public office to endorse products.\n\nAs of August 2019, the House Oversight Committee is investigating why the Air National Guard made a pit stop to stay at Trump's [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry resort]] in Scotland, instead of a U.S. military base as done on previous trips. Vice President Mike Pence is also under investigation for staying at the [[Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland]] despite it being located hundreds of miles away from his meeting place.\n\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\nSee also: [[Saudi Arabia lobby in the United States]] and [[2017 United States\u2013Saudi Arabia arms deal]]\nPresident Trump with Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]], Washington, D.C., March 14, 2017\n\nIn March 2018, ''The New York Times'' reported that [[George Nader (businessman)|George Nader]] had turned Trump's major fundraiser [[Elliott Broidy]] \"into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ... High on the agenda of the two men ... was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson|Rex W. Tillerson]]\", a top defender of the [[Iran nuclear deal framework|Iran nuclear deal]] in Donald Trump's administration, and \"backing confrontational approaches to Iran and Qatar\".\n\nTrump actively supported the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Houthis]]. Trump also praised his relationship with [[Saudi Arabia]]'s powerful Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]]. On May 20, 2017, Trump and [[Saudi Arabia]]'s [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] signed a series of letters of intent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from the United States totaling $110 billion immediately, and $350 billion over ten years. The transfer was widely seen as a counterbalance against the influence of Iran in the region and a \"significant\" and \"historic\" expansion of [[United States relations with Saudi Arabia]]. By July 2019, two of Trump's three vetoes were to overturn bipartisan congressional action related to Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn October 2018, amid widespread condemnation of Saudi Arabia for the murder of prominent Saudi journalist and dissident [[Jamal Khashoggi]], the Trump administration pushed back on the condemnation. After the CIA assessed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman ordered the murder of Khashoggi, Trump rejected the assessment and said the CIA only had \"feelings\" on the matter.\n\n=== Transparency and data availability ===\n''The Washington Post'' reported in May 2017, \"a wide variety of information that until recently was provided to the public, limiting access, for instance, to disclosures about workplace violations, energy efficiency, and animal welfare abuses\" had been removed or tucked away. The Obama administration had used the publication of enforcement actions taken by federal agencies against companies as a way to name and shame companies that engaged in unethical and illegal behaviors.\n\nThe Trump administration stopped the Obama administration policy of logging visitors to the White House, making it difficult to tell who has visited the White House. Nathan Cortez of the [[Southern Methodist University]]'s [[Dedman School of Law]], who studies the handling of public data, said the Trump administration, unlike the Obama administration, was taking transparency \"in the opposite direction\".\n\n=== Cost of trips ===\nAccording to several reports, Trump's and his family's trips in the first month of his presidency cost U.S. taxpayers nearly as much as former president Obama's travel expenses for an entire year. When Obama was president, Trump frequently criticized him for taking vacations which were paid for with public funds. ''The Washington Post'' reported that Trump's atypically lavish lifestyle is far more expensive to the taxpayers than what was typical of former presidents and could end up in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the whole of Trump's term.\n\nA June 2019 analysis by the ''Washington Post'' found that federal officials and GOP campaigns had spent at least $1.6 million at businesses owned by Trump during his presidency. This was an undercount, as most of the data on spending by government officials covered only the first few months of Trump's presidency.\n\n=== Security clearances ===\nIn March 2019, [[Tricia Newbold]], a White House employee working on security clearances, spoke privately to the [[House Oversight Committee]], claiming that at least 25 [[Trump administration]] officials had been granted security clearances over the objections of career staffers. Newbold also asserted that some of these officials had previously had their applications rejected for \"disqualifying issues\", only for those rejections to be overturned with inadequate explanation.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee subpoenaed [[Carl Kline (White House official)|Carl Kline]], the former head of White House security clearances to testify on April 23. However White House deputy counsel Michael Purpura instructed Kline not to appear at the deposition, citing constitutional concerns. Kline eventually appeared before the committee on May 1.\n\n=== Accepting political information from foreign powers ===\nOn June 12, 2019, Trump asserted he saw nothing wrong in accepting intelligence on his political adversaries from foreign powers, such as Russia, and he could see no reason to contact the FBI about it. Responding to a reporter who told him FBI director [[Christopher A. Wray|Christopher Wray]] had said such activities should be reported to the FBI, Trump said, \"the FBI director is wrong.\" Trump elaborated, \"there's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, 'we have information on your opponent'\u2014oh, I think I'd want to hear it.\" Both Democrats and Republicans repudiated the remarks.\n\n=== Impeachment inquiry ===\nMain article: [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump]]\n\nSee also: [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal]]\n\nOn August 12, 2019, an unnamed intelligence official privately filed a whistleblower complaint with [[Michael Atkinson (Inspector General)|Michael Atkinson]], the [[Inspector General of the Intelligence Community]] (ICIG), under the provisions of the [[Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act]] (ICWPA). The whistleblower alleged that President Trump had abused his office in soliciting foreign interference to improve his own electoral chances in 2020. The complaint reports that in a July 2019 call, Trump had asked Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] to investigate potential 2020 rival presidential candidate [[Joe Biden]] and his son [[Hunter Biden]], as well as matters pertaining to whether Russian interference occurred in the 2016 U.S. election with regard to Democratic National Committee servers and the company Crowdstrike. Trump allegedly nominated his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to work with Ukraine on these matters. Additionally, the whistleblower alleged that the White House attempted to \"lock down\" the call records in a cover-up, and that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the Trump administration to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The whistleblower posits that the pressure campaign may have included Trump cancelling Vice President Mike Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip, and Trump withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019.\n\nInspector General Atkinson found the whistleblower's complaint both urgent and credible, so he transmitted the complaint on August 26 to [[Joseph Maguire]], the acting [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI). Under the law, Maguire was supposed to forward the complaint to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees within a week. Maguire refused, so Atkinson informed the congressional committees of the existence of the complaint, but not its content. The general counsel for Maguire's office said that since the complaint was not about someone in the intelligence community, it was not an \"urgent concern\" and thus there was no need to pass it to Congress. Later testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on September 26, Maguire said he had consulted with the White House Counsel and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, of which the latter office gave him the rationale to withhold the complaint. Maguire also testified: \"I think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way.\"\n\nOn September 22, Trump confirmed that he had discussed with Zelensky how \"we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine\". Trump also confirmed that he had indeed temporarily withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradicting reasons for his decision on September 23 and 24.\n\nOn September 24, House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] announced the start of a formal [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|impeachment inquiry]]. On September 25, the White House released a non-verbatim transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky; while the members and staff of congressional intelligence committees were allowed to read whistleblower complaint. On September 26, the White House declassified the whistleblower's complaint, so Schiff released the complaint to the public. The non-verbatim transcript corroborated the main allegations of the whistleblower's report about the Trump\u2013Zelensky call. The non-verbatim transcript stated that after Zelensky discussed the possibility of buying American anti-tank missiles to defend Ukraine, Trump instead asked for a favor, suggesting an investigation of the company Crowdstrike, while later in the call he also called for an investigation of the Bidens, and cooperation with Giuliani and Barr. On September 27, the White House confirmed the whistleblower's allegation that the Trump administration had stored the Trump\u2013Zelensky transcript in a highly classified system.\n\nFollowing these revelations, members of congress largely divided along party lines, with Democrats generally in favor of impeachment proceedings and Republicans defending the president. Ukraine envoy [[Kurt Volker]] resigned and three House committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to schedule depositions for Volker and four other State Department employees, and to compel the release of documents. Attention to the issue also led to further revelations by anonymous sources. These included the misuse of classification systems to hide records of conversations with Ukrainian, Russian and Saudi Arabian leaders, and statements made to [[Sergei Lavrov]] and [[Sergey Kislyak]] in May 2017 expressing disconcern about Russian interference in U.S. elections.\n\n=== Other allegations ===\n''Bloomberg News'' reported in October 2019 that during a 2017 Oval Office meeting, Trump had asked secretary of state Rex Tillerson to pressure the Justice Department to drop a criminal investigation of [[Reza Zarrab]], an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of Trump associate [[Rudy Giuliani]]. Tillerson reportedly refused.\n\n== Elections during the Trump presidency ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[Party divisions of United States Congresses|Republican seats in Congress]]\n!Congress\n!Senate\n!House\n|-\n![[115th United States Congress|115th]]\n|'''52'''\n|'''241'''\n|-\n![[116th United States Congress|116th]]\n|'''53'''\n|200\n|}\n\n=== 2018 mid-term elections ===\nMain article: [[2018 United States elections]]\n\nIn the 2018 mid-term elections, Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, while Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate.\n\n=== 2020 re-election campaign ===\nMain article: [[2020 United States presidential election]]\n\nFurther information: [[2020 United States elections]], [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign]], [[2020 Republican Party presidential primaries]], and [[2020 Republican National Convention]]\n\nOn June 18, 2019, Trump announced that he would seek [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|re-election]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. Trump did not face any significant rivals for the 2020 Republican nomination. Trump's Democratic opponent in the general election will be former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] of Delaware.\n\n== Historical evaluations and public opinion ==\nMain article: [[Opinion polling on the Donald Trump administration]]\n\nSee also: [[United States presidential approval rating]]\n\n=== Popular polling ===\nGallup approval polling, covering February 2017-September 2019\n\u00a0Disapprove\n\n\u00a0Unsure\n\n\u00a0Approve\n\nAt the time of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], polls by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] found Trump had a favorable rating around 35% and an unfavorable rating around 60%, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton held a favorable rating of 40% and an unfavorable rating of 57%. 2016 was the first election cycle in modern presidential polling in which both major-party candidates were viewed so unfavorably.\n\nBy January 20, 2017, [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]], Trump's approval rating average was 42%, the lowest rating average for an incoming president in the history of modern polling. Trump's approval rating during his first term has been \"incredibly stable (and also historically low)\" within a band from about 36% to 44%.\n\n=== Historians and political scientists ===\nPolitical scientist [[Norman Ornstein]] says many writers have tried to put Trump in perspective:\n\n: Among President Trump's major accomplishments is the booming industry in books about him, his administration, the state of democracy in America, the rise of autocracy in America and abroad, the reasons for his rise, the bases of his support, the state of the Republican Party, the state of his mental health or lack thereof, the chaos in his White House and so on.\n: Not all are strictly about Trump\u2014the fact is the conditions and dynamics that brought us Trump long preceded him, and the changes in the fabric of our Republic are paralleled by changes in other longstanding democracies around the globe.\n\n==== Democratic backsliding ====\nMain article: [[Democratic backsliding]]\n\nSince the beginning of the presidency of Donald Trump, ratings of the well-functioning of U.S. democracy sharply plunged.\n\nAccording to the 2018 ''[[V-DEM|Varieties of Democracy]]'' Annual Democracy Report, there has been \"a significant [[democratic backsliding]] in the United States [since the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump]]] ... attributable to weakening constraints on the executive\". Independent assessments by ''[[Freedom House]]'' and ''[[Bright Line Watch]]'' found a similar significant decline in overall democratic functioning.\n\n==== Historical rankings ====\nMain article: [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]]\n\n[[BBC News]] wrote, in January 2019:<blockquote>At the midpoint of Trump's first term, historians have struggled to detect the kind of virtues that offset his predecessors' vices: the infectious optimism of Reagan; the inspirational rhetoric of JFK; the legislative smarts of LBJ; or the governing pragmatism of Nixon. So rather than being viewed as the reincarnation of [[Ronald Reagan]] or [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], Trump gets cast as a modern-day [[James Buchanan]], [[Franklin Pierce]] or [[William Henry Harrison|William Harrison]]. Last year, a poll of nearly 200 political science scholars, which has routinely placed Republicans higher than Democrats, ranked him 44th out of the 44 men who have occupied the post.</blockquote>The 2018 poll\u2014as referenced, in 2019, by the BBC\u2014was administered by the [[American Political Science Association]] (APSA) among political scientists specializing in the American presidency, and had ranked Trump in last place. Republican survey respondents rated him 40th out of 44th, Independents/Other respondents rated him 43rd out of 44th, while Democratic historians rated him 44th out of 44th. [[Siena College Research Institute]]'s 6th presidential expert poll, released in February 2019, placed Donald Trump 42nd out of 44th\u2014ahead of [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[James Buchanan]].\n\n== See also ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to '''''Presidency of Donald Trump'''''.\n|}\n\n* [[Bibliography of Donald Trump]]\n* [[Efforts to impeach Donald Trump]]\n* [[List of executive actions by Donald Trump]]\n* [[Make America Great Again]]\u20142016 campaign slogan\n* [[Political positions of Donald Trump]]\n* [[Protests against Donald Trump]]\n* [[Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]\n* [[Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections (July 2016\u2013election day)]]\n* [[Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n# '''[[Presidency of Donald Trump#ref%20timeline|^]]''' A small portion (January 3\u201319, 2017) of the 115th Congress took place under President Obama.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Fus\u00e9e sur tapisserie.png|thumb|Space launch vehicle imagined on a [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]] [[tapestry]], ordered by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] and drawn by [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], 1664.]]\nSpace travel has long been a significant ambition in [[French culture]].

This should not be confused with [[semantics]]. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are described in the publication ''Science and Sanity'', published in 1933. In 1938 Korzybski founded the [[Institute of General Semantics]] in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/about-us/history/ |title=The Institute of General Semantics \u00bb History |website=Generalsemantics.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-28}}</ref> The post-World War II housing shortage in Chicago cost him the Institute's building lease, so in 1946 he moved the Institute to [[Lakeville (Salisbury, Connecticut)|Lakeville, Connecticut]], U.S., where he directed it until his death in 1950.\n\nKorzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the [[structure]] of their languages. Humans cannot experience the world directly, but only through their \"abstractions\" (nonverbal impressions or \"gleanings\" derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). These sometimes mislead us about what is the truth. Our understanding sometimes lacks ''similarity of structure'' with what is actually happening.\n\nHe sought to train our awareness of abstracting, using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, \"consciousness of abstracting\". His system included the promotion of attitudes such as \"I don't know; let's see,\" in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science. Another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience he termed, \"silence on the objective levels\".\n\n==\"To be\"==\nMany devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form \"is\" of the general verb \"to be.\"<ref>Alfred Korzybski, ''Selections from Science and Sanity'', 2010.</ref> His system, however, is based primarily on such terminology as the different \"orders of abstraction,\" and formulations such as \"consciousness of abstracting.\" The contention that Korzybski ''opposed'' the use of the verb \"to be\" would be a profound exaggeration.\n\nHe thought that ''certain uses'' of the verb \"to be\", called the \"is of identity\" and the \"is of [[E-Prime#Different functions of \"to be\"|predication]]\", were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as, \"Elizabeth is a fool\" (said of a person named \"Elizabeth\" who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system, one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to ''deny'' identity; in this example, to be aware continually that \"Elizabeth\" is ''not'' what we ''call'' her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain (the two, he said, amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise, \"[[Map\u2013territory relation|the map is not the territory]]\". Note that this premise uses the phrase \"is not\", a form of \"to be\"; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon \"to be\" as such. In fact, he said explicitly{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} that there were no structural problems with the verb \"to be\" when used as an [[E-prime#The different functions of 'to be'|auxiliary verb]] or when used to state existence or location. It was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb \"to be,\" as long as one was aware of their structural limitations.\n\n==Anecdotes==\nOne day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. \"Nice biscuit, don't you think,\" said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words \"Dog Cookies.\" The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. \"You see,\" Korzybski remarked, \"I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.\"<ref>R.

Lee insists on being the one to tell Joe's teenage son, Patrick, about his father's death. While making funeral arrangements, they learn that Joe's body cannot be buried until spring when the ground thaws. Lee opts to remain in [[Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts]] until the delayed burial.\n\nLee meets with his brother's attorney and is shocked to discover that his brother named him Patrick's [[legal guardian]]. A flashback reveals that Lee once lived in Manchester with his then-wife Randi and their three small children. His negligence while intoxicated led to a house fire that killed the children. No criminal charges were filed against him but after being questioned at the police station, Lee grabbed a gun from an officer's holster and attempted suicide. He and his wife divorced and Lee left the town. In light of these events, Lee is reluctant to commit to the guardianship and unwilling to move back to Manchester, where the locals treat him as an outcast because of the loss of his family. \n\nHe begins planning for Patrick to move to Boston with him, but Patrick is deeply rooted in the Manchester community and strongly objects to the idea. Lee commits to staying only until the end of the school year. Over time, Patrick and Lee re-establish their bond, despite conflicts about Joe's boat, Patrick's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements. \n\nThrough flashbacks, Patrick's mother Elise is shown to have had substance abuse problems and abandoned the family, so Lee is opposed to Patrick reconnecting with her. Patrick emails Elise about Joe's death, and she invites him to have lunch with her. She has committed to Christianity and sobriety with her fianc\u00e9, Jeffrey, but during an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds himself unable to connect with her. He is unsettled further when Jeffrey emails him, insisting on being an intermediary in any future communication between Patrick and his mother. Lee's subsequent positive comments about Elise's sobriety lead Patrick to believe his uncle is trying to get rid of him, assertions Lee denies.  In response to this strain in their relationship, Lee takes steps to possibly extend his stay in Manchester, and begins to seek ways to spend more time with Patrick.\n\nLee runs into his ex-wife Randi and her newborn, Dylan. A sobbing Randi expresses remorse for her treatment of Lee during their divorce and asks him to have lunch. Lee deflects her apology, feeling that he does not deserve it. When she insists that they reconnect and pleads with him not to \"just die,\" he leaves before he can become emotional. Distraught, a drunk Lee picks a fight with strangers at a bar and is knocked out. He awakens in the living room of family friend George and breaks down in tears. At home, Patrick shows his uncle deference after observing his battered state and seeing pictures of the deceased children in Lee's bedroom.\n\nLee arranges for George and his wife to adopt Patrick, so the teen can remain in Manchester while Lee takes a job in Boston. When Patrick asks Lee why staying is not an option, Lee admits that he \"can't beat it.\" During a walk after Joe's [[Funeral#Burial service|burial service]], Lee tells Patrick that he is searching for a residence in Boston with an extra room so that Patrick can visit whenever he wants. In the final scene, Lee and Patrick go fishing on Joe's refurnished boat, which Patrick has inherited.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken loner, Randi's ex-husband, Joe's brother and Patrick's uncle.\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Patrick Chandler, 16-year-old son of Joe and Elise and Lee and Randi's nephew.\n** Ben O'Brien as young Patrick\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Randi, Lee's ex-wife and Patrick's ex-aunt by marriage.\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Chandler, Lee's brother, Elise's husband and Patrick's father.\n* [[C.

In an essay in ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'', Colin Fleming writes that \"the question Lonergan invites us to ask ourselves is how on earth would we be able to carry on after an event so tragically full of loss and guilt.\"<ref>Fleming, Colin (Spring 2017), \"Manchester by the Sea.\" ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''. '''42''' (2):51\u201353</ref> Speaking to the persistence of grief, ''[[Film Comment]]'' magazine says that \"Lonergan is telling us that Lee's grief cannot be contained or subdued because his past lives on wherever he goes.\"<ref name=KORESKY>Koresky, Michael (November/December 2016), \"The World is Full of Weeping.\" ''[[Film Comment]]''. '''52''' (6):48\u201352</ref> Remarking on the way flash-backs appear suddenly during the movie, critic Anthony Lane says that Lonergan \"proceeds on the assumption that things are hard, some irreparably so, and that it's the job of a film not to smooth them over.\"<ref name=demons/> He also noted that juxtaposed with the tragedy is \"the harsh comedy that colors much of the dialogue, and the near-farcical frequency with which things go wrong.\"<ref name=lane/>  Along those same lines, critic Steven Mears called the film \"a study of grief and reticence that finds droll humor in those very sources,\"<ref name=Mears>Mears, Steven (January/February 2017), \"Manchester by the Sea.\" ''Film Comment''. '''53''' (1):47\u201349</ref> and Richard Alleva says the loving but tense relationship between Lee and Patrick \"keeps the story nicely balanced between rough hewn comedy and delicate pathos.\"<ref name=Alleva>Alleva, Richard (February 10, 2017), \"Character Studies\". ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]''. '''144''' (3):21\u201322</ref> Explaining his objective, Lonergan said, \"I don't like the fact that, nowadays, it feels like it's not permissible to leave something unresolved ... Some people live with their trauma for years. I'm not interested in rubbing people's faces in suffering ... But I don't like this lie that everybody gets over things that easily. Some people can't get over something major that's happened to them at all; why can\u2019t they have a movie too?\"<ref name=fear/>\n\nThe film's events take place through the cultural filter of a [[blue-collar]], [[Culture of New England|New England]] community. [[John Krasinski]] and [[Matt Damon]] initially approached Lonergan about developing the story in New England.<ref name=SMART>Smart, Jack (November 24, 2016), \"Kenneth Lonergan, 'Manchester by the Sea'\". ''Back Stage''. '''57''' (47):16</ref> As Lonergan researched the areas surrounding Manchester-by-the-Sea, he sought to include details specific to the area, such as its distance from Quincy, the delayed burial because of the frozen ground in a historical cemetery, and the realities of fishing life.<ref name=SMART/> Critic [[Sam Lansky]] remarked that the lead character's New England roots make him \"disinclined to emote,\"<ref name=Lansky/> and [[Tom Shone]] said that Lonergan's dialog forces \"the story\u2019s heartbreak to peep from behind these tough, [[wikt:flinty|flinty]] New England exteriors.\"<ref name=SHONE>Shone, Tom (December 16, 2016), \"Drowning, Not Waving.\" ''Newsweek Global''.

Critics particularly complimented the performances of Affleck, Williams, and Hedges, as well as Lonergan's screenplay and direction. At the [[89th Academy Awards]], the film won awards for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Affleck and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], with additional nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Hedges), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Williams).

Lee insists on being the one to tell Joe's teenage son, Patrick, about his father's death. While making funeral arrangements, they learn that Joe's body cannot be buried until spring when the ground thaws. Lee opts to remain in [[Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts]] until the delayed burial.\n\nLee meets with his brother's attorney and is shocked to discover that his brother named him Patrick's [[legal guardian]]. A flashback reveals that Lee once lived in Manchester with his then-wife Randi and their three small children. His negligence while intoxicated led to a house fire that killed the children. No criminal charges were filed against him but after being questioned at the police station, Lee grabbed a gun from an officer's holster and attempted suicide. He and his wife divorced and Lee left the town. In light of these events, Lee is reluctant to commit to the guardianship and unwilling to move back to Manchester, where the locals treat him as an outcast because of the loss of his family. \n\nHe begins planning for Patrick to move to Boston with him, but Patrick is deeply rooted in the Manchester community and strongly objects to the idea. Lee commits to staying only until the end of the school year. Over time, Patrick and Lee re-establish their bond, despite conflicts about Joe's boat, Patrick's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements. \n\nThrough flashbacks, Patrick's mother Elise is shown to have had substance abuse problems and abandoned the family, so Lee is opposed to Patrick reconnecting with her. Patrick emails Elise about Joe's death, and she invites him to have lunch with her. She has committed to Christianity and sobriety with her fianc\u00e9, Jeffrey, but during an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds himself unable to connect with her. He is unsettled further when Jeffrey emails him, insisting on being an intermediary in any future communication between Patrick and his mother. Lee's subsequent positive comments about Elise's sobriety lead Patrick to believe his uncle is trying to get rid of him, assertions Lee denies.  In response to this strain in their relationship, Lee takes steps to possibly extend his stay in Manchester, and begins to seek ways to spend more time with Patrick.\n\nLee runs into his ex-wife Randi and her newborn, Dylan. A sobbing Randi expresses remorse for her treatment of Lee during their divorce and asks him to have lunch. Lee deflects her apology, feeling that he does not deserve it. When she insists that they reconnect and pleads with him not to \"just die,\" he leaves before he can become emotional. Distraught, a drunk Lee picks a fight with strangers at a bar and is knocked out. He awakens in the living room of family friend George and breaks down in tears. At home, Patrick shows his uncle deference after observing his battered state and seeing pictures of the deceased children in Lee's bedroom.\n\nLee arranges for George and his wife to adopt Patrick, so the teen can remain in Manchester while Lee takes a job in Boston. When Patrick asks Lee why staying is not an option, Lee admits that he \"can't beat it.\" During a walk after Joe's [[Funeral#Burial service|burial service]], Lee tells Patrick that he is searching for a residence in Boston with an extra room so that Patrick can visit whenever he wants. In the final scene, Lee and Patrick go fishing on Joe's refurnished boat, which Patrick has inherited.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken loner, Randi's ex-husband, Joe's brother and Patrick's uncle.\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Patrick Chandler, 16-year-old son of Joe and Elise and Lee and Randi's nephew.\n** Ben O'Brien as young Patrick\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Randi, Lee's ex-wife and Patrick's ex-aunt by marriage.\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Chandler, Lee's brother, Elise's husband and Patrick's father.\n* [[C.

In an essay in ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'', Colin Fleming writes that \"the question Lonergan invites us to ask ourselves is how on earth would we be able to carry on after an event so tragically full of loss and guilt.\"<ref>Fleming, Colin (Spring 2017), \"Manchester by the Sea.\" ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''.

'''52''' (6):48\u201352</ref> Remarking on the way flash-backs appear suddenly during the movie, critic Anthony Lane says that Lonergan \"proceeds on the assumption that things are hard, some irreparably so, and that it's the job of a film not to smooth them over.\"<ref name=demons/> He also noted that juxtaposed with the tragedy is \"the harsh comedy that colors much of the dialogue, and the near-farcical frequency with which things go wrong.\"<ref name=lane/>  Along those same lines, critic Steven Mears called the film \"a study of grief and reticence that finds droll humor in those very sources,\"<ref name=Mears>Mears, Steven (January/February 2017), \"Manchester by the Sea.\" ''Film Comment''. '''53''' (1):47\u201349</ref> and Richard Alleva says the loving but tense relationship between Lee and Patrick \"keeps the story nicely balanced between rough hewn comedy and delicate pathos.\"<ref name=Alleva>Alleva, Richard (February 10, 2017), \"Character Studies\". ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]''. '''144''' (3):21\u201322</ref> Explaining his objective, Lonergan said, \"I don't like the fact that, nowadays, it feels like it's not permissible to leave something unresolved ... Some people live with their trauma for years. I'm not interested in rubbing people's faces in suffering ... But I don't like this lie that everybody gets over things that easily. Some people can't get over something major that's happened to them at all; why can\u2019t they have a movie too?\"<ref name=fear/>\n\nThe film's events take place through the cultural filter of a [[blue-collar]], [[Culture of New England|New England]] community. [[John Krasinski]] and [[Matt Damon]] initially approached Lonergan about developing the story in New England.<ref name=SMART>Smart, Jack (November 24, 2016), \"Kenneth Lonergan, 'Manchester by the Sea'\".

Previously, until the end of 2016, drummer Alejandro Posada had been in the band, but the percussionist had to leave the project, who was replaced by Mart\u00edn Vargas.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe members of Morat have known each other since they were five years old.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2017-11-23/musica-morat-pelotazo-pop_1479418/ |title=Morat, el pelotazo que vuelve locas a tus hijas |first=V\u00edctor |last=Lenore |date=23 November 2017 |access-date=14 April 2019 |newspaper=[[El Confidencial]] |language=es |publisher=Titania Compa\u00f1\u00eda Editorial, S.L.}}</ref> They all studied together at the La Monta\u00f1a Gymnasium in Bogot\u00e1, and some of them at [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)|University of Los Andes]].

Some of their musical influences are Joaqu\u00edn Sabina, Eric Clapton and Bacilos.\n\nThe band's original name was \"Malta\". The name was inspired by a pet owned by Isaza. They switched to \"Morat\" because it was the surname of an ancestor of Alejandro Posada, former member of the band.

The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label [[Sub Pop]] and the region's [[underground music]] scene.

Like these genres, grunge typically uses [[electric guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drums]] and [[vocals]]. Grunge also incorporates influences from [[indie rock]] bands such as [[Sonic Youth]]. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as [[social alienation]], [[doubt|self-doubt]], [[abuse]], [[neglect]], [[betrayal]], [[social isolation|social]] and [[emotional isolation]], [[psychological trauma]] and a desire for [[Liberty|freedom]].<ref name=4volumes>{{cite book|author=James E.

During the {{nowrap|mid-to-late 1990s}}, many grunge bands broke up or became less visible.

Evergreen is a progressive college which does not use a conventional grading system and has its own radio station, [[KAOS (FM)|KAOS]]. Seattle's remoteness from Los Angeles led to a perceived purity of its music.

By this time their music had become slow and sludgy, less like the [[Sex Pistols]] and more like [[Black Sabbath]]. [[Krist Novoselic]] (later the bass player with Nirvana) recalls going along with the [[Melvins]] to see one of these shows, after which the Melvins front man [[Buzz Osborne]] began writing \"slow and heavy riffs\" to form a [[dirge]]-like music that was the beginning of northwest grunge.<ref name=novoselic2004/> The Melvins were the most influential of the early grunge bands.<ref name=anderson2007C1/> Sub Pop producer Jack Endino described grunge as \"seventies-influenced, slowed-down punk music\".<ref name=kallen2012/><ref name=azerrad1992/>\n\nLeighton Beezer, who played with [[Mark Arm]] and [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]] in The Thrown Ups, states that when he first heard Green River play ''Come On Down'', he realized that they were playing punk rock backwards. Additionally, he noted that the [[augmented fifth]] note was used by Black Sabbath to produce an ominous feeling but it is not used in punk rock. In the 1996 grunge film documentary [[Hype!]], Beezer demonstrated on guitar the difference between punk and grunge. First he played the riff from ''Rockaway Beach'' by [[The Ramones]] that ascends the neck of the guitar, then ''Come On Down'' by [[Green River (band)|Green River]] that descends the neck. The two pieces are only a few notes apart but sound completely unalike.<ref name=cameron2014/><ref name=true2006/> He took the same rhythm with the same chord, however descending the neck made it sound darker, and therefore grunge.<ref name=unterberger1999/> Early grunge bands would also copy a riff from metal and slow it down, play it backwards, distort it and bury it in feedback, then shout lyrics with little melody over the top of it.<ref name=anderson2007C2/>\n\nGrunge fuses elements of [[punk rock]] (specifically American [[hardcore punk]] such as Black Flag) and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (especially traditional, earlier heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath), although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other.<ref name=\"allmusic grunge\" /> Alex DiBlasi feels that [[indie rock]] was a third key source, with the most important influence coming from [[Sonic Youth]]'s \"free-form\" noise.<ref name=\"DiBlasi, Alex 2013. p. 520\"/> Grunge shares with punk a raw, [[Lo-fi music|lo fi]] sound and similar lyrical concerns,<ref name=\"allmusic grunge\" /> and it also used punk's haphazard and untrained approach to playing and performing.

''Participatory Creativity: Introducing Access and Equity to the Creative Classroom''.

An example of the lower cost production approach is [[Mudhoney]]; even after the band signed to [[Warner Music]], \"[t]rue to [the band's] indie roots ... [they are] ... probably one of the few bands that would have to fight [their label] to record for a lower budget rather than a higher one.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad\" />\n\n[[Steve Albini]] was another important influence on the grunge sound. Albini prefers to be called a \"recording engineer\", because he believes that putting [[record producer]]s in charge of recording sessions often destroys the band's real sound, while the role of the recording engineer is to capture the actual sound of the musicians, not to threaten the artists' control over their creative product.<ref>MTSU-lecture-2004</ref> Albini's recordings have been analyzed by writers such as [[Michael Azerrad]], who stated that Albini's \"recordings were both very basic and very exacting: like Endino, Albini used few [[Effects unit|special effects]]; got an aggressive, often violent [[guitar]] sound; and made sure the [[rhythm section]] slammed as one.\"<ref>Azerrad, Michael (2001).

Retrieved January 11, 2014. p. 344</ref>\n\nNirvana's ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' is a typical example of Albini's recording approach. He preferred to have the entire band play live in the studio, rather than use mainstream rock's approach of recording each instrument on a separate track at different times, and then mixing them using [[multi-track recording]]. While multitracking results in a more polished product, it does not capture the \"live\" sound of the band playing together. Albini used a range of different microphones for the vocals and instruments. Like most metal and punk recording engineers, he mics the guitar amp speakers and bass amp speakers to capture each performer's unique tone.\n\n== Concerts ==\n[[File:Pearl Jam Philadelphia 2016 01.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A male bassist, Jeff Ament, playing upright bass in a concert.

Grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music. Stage acting and \"onstage theatrics\" were generally avoided.<ref name=\"Gina Misiroglu 2015. p. 343\" />\n\nInstead the bands presented themselves as no different from minor local bands. Jack Endino said in the 1996 documentary ''Hype!'' that Seattle bands were inconsistent live performers, since their primary objective was not to be entertainers, but simply to \"rock out\".<ref name=\"Hype\" /> Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as \"a symbolic weapon\" for releasing \"pent-up aggression\" ([[Dave Grohl]] was particularly noted for his \"head flips\").<ref name=\"Fournier, Karen 2015. p. 44\">Fournier, Karen.

The artists had \"a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore\". The recording process was low-budget; each band was given four hours of studio time. As Jack Endino recalled, \"People just said, 'Well, what kind of music is this?

The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label [[Sub Pop]] and the region's [[underground music]] scene.

Like these genres, grunge typically uses [[electric guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drums]] and [[vocals]]. Grunge also incorporates influences from [[indie rock]] bands such as [[Sonic Youth]].

By this time their music had become slow and sludgy, less like the [[Sex Pistols]] and more like [[Black Sabbath]]. [[Krist Novoselic]] (later the bass player with Nirvana) recalls going along with the [[Melvins]] to see one of these shows, after which the Melvins front man [[Buzz Osborne]] began writing \"slow and heavy riffs\" to form a [[dirge]]-like music that was the beginning of northwest grunge.<ref name=novoselic2004/> The Melvins were the most influential of the early grunge bands.<ref name=anderson2007C1/> Sub Pop producer Jack Endino described grunge as \"seventies-influenced, slowed-down punk music\".<ref name=kallen2012/><ref name=azerrad1992/>\n\nLeighton Beezer, who played with [[Mark Arm]] and [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]] in The Thrown Ups, states that when he first heard Green River play ''Come On Down'', he realized that they were playing punk rock backwards. Additionally, he noted that the [[augmented fifth]] note was used by Black Sabbath to produce an ominous feeling but it is not used in punk rock. In the 1996 grunge film documentary [[Hype!]], Beezer demonstrated on guitar the difference between punk and grunge. First he played the riff from ''Rockaway Beach'' by [[The Ramones]] that ascends the neck of the guitar, then ''Come On Down'' by [[Green River (band)|Green River]] that descends the neck. The two pieces are only a few notes apart but sound completely unalike.<ref name=cameron2014/><ref name=true2006/> He took the same rhythm with the same chord, however descending the neck made it sound darker, and therefore grunge.<ref name=unterberger1999/> Early grunge bands would also copy a riff from metal and slow it down, play it backwards, distort it and bury it in feedback, then shout lyrics with little melody over the top of it.<ref name=anderson2007C2/>\n\nGrunge fuses elements of [[punk rock]] (specifically American [[hardcore punk]] such as Black Flag) and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (especially traditional, earlier heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath), although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other.<ref name=\"allmusic grunge\" /> Alex DiBlasi feels that [[indie rock]] was a third key source, with the most important influence coming from [[Sonic Youth]]'s \"free-form\" noise.<ref name=\"DiBlasi, Alex 2013. p. 520\"/> Grunge shares with punk a raw, [[Lo-fi music|lo fi]] sound and similar lyrical concerns,<ref name=\"allmusic grunge\" /> and it also used punk's haphazard and untrained approach to playing and performing. However, grunge was \"deeper and darker\"-sounding than punk rock and it decreased the \"adrenaline\"-fueled tempos of punk to a slow, \"sludgy\" speed,<ref name=\"Felix-Jager, Steven 2017. p. 135\" /> and used more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] harmonies.

''Participatory Creativity: Introducing Access and Equity to the Creative Classroom''. Routledge, 2016.</ref> Endino is known for his stripped-down recording practices and his dislike of 'over-producing' music with [[effects units|effects]] and [[audio mastering|remastering]]. His work on Soundgarden's ''[[Screaming Life]]'' and Nirvana's ''Bleach'' as well as for the bands [[Green River (band)|Green River]], [[Screaming Trees]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[The Gits]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[7 Year Bitch]], and [[Tad (band)|TAD]] helped to define the grunge sound. An example of the lower cost production approach is [[Mudhoney]]; even after the band signed to [[Warner Music]], \"[t]rue to [the band's] indie roots ... [they are] ... probably one of the few bands that would have to fight [their label] to record for a lower budget rather than a higher one.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad\" />\n\n[[Steve Albini]] was another important influence on the grunge sound. Albini prefers to be called a \"recording engineer\", because he believes that putting [[record producer]]s in charge of recording sessions often destroys the band's real sound, while the role of the recording engineer is to capture the actual sound of the musicians, not to threaten the artists' control over their creative product.<ref>MTSU-lecture-2004</ref> Albini's recordings have been analyzed by writers such as [[Michael Azerrad]], who stated that Albini's \"recordings were both very basic and very exacting: like Endino, Albini used few [[Effects unit|special effects]]; got an aggressive, often violent [[guitar]] sound; and made sure the [[rhythm section]] slammed as one.\"<ref>Azerrad, Michael (2001).

Retrieved January 11, 2014. p. 344</ref>\n\nNirvana's ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' is a typical example of Albini's recording approach. He preferred to have the entire band play live in the studio, rather than use mainstream rock's approach of recording each instrument on a separate track at different times, and then mixing them using [[multi-track recording]]. While multitracking results in a more polished product, it does not capture the \"live\" sound of the band playing together. Albini used a range of different microphones for the vocals and instruments. Like most metal and punk recording engineers, he mics the guitar amp speakers and bass amp speakers to capture each performer's unique tone.\n\n== Concerts ==\n[[File:Pearl Jam Philadelphia 2016 01.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A male bassist, Jeff Ament, playing upright bass in a concert.

Grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music. Stage acting and \"onstage theatrics\" were generally avoided.<ref name=\"Gina Misiroglu 2015. p. 343\" />\n\nInstead the bands presented themselves as no different from minor local bands. Jack Endino said in the 1996 documentary ''Hype!'' that Seattle bands were inconsistent live performers, since their primary objective was not to be entertainers, but simply to \"rock out\".<ref name=\"Hype\" /> Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as \"a symbolic weapon\" for releasing \"pent-up aggression\" ([[Dave Grohl]] was particularly noted for his \"head flips\").<ref name=\"Fournier, Karen 2015. p. 44\">Fournier, Karen.

The artists had \"a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore\". The recording process was low-budget; each band was given four hours of studio time. As Jack Endino recalled, \"People just said, 'Well, what kind of music is this?

The sons of world-renowned animal collector John Hunt, Hal and Roger have grown up alongside exotic and dangerous wildlife. In ''[[Amazon Adventure]]'', the boys' literary debut, Hal is 19 years old and Roger is 13 years old.\n\nThe boys have taken a year off school to help capture animals for their father's collection on Long Island, after which the captive specimens are sold to zoos, circuses and nature parks. Their father's wildlife business, ''\"John Hunt- Wildlife\"'' was renamed ''\"John Hunt and Sons\"'' after the boys proved themselves once again in ''[[Gorilla Adventure]]''.\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Hal Hunt ===\n\nHal Hunt is the typical hero: tall, handsome and muscular, but still fast on his feet despite his broad build. He has survived an attack by a [[Portuguese man o' war]] and fought and defeated a [[Leopard|panther]] unarmed and single-handedly. With remarkably little practice, he learns to hold his breath underwater for more than a minute while diving for pearls in the South Seas.<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\">''[[South Sea Adventure]]'' (1952)</ref> He also has a scar on his shoulder blade caused by a spear, courtesy of Merlin Kaggs. He's the older and more mature of the two brothers, and is often left in charge of the mission when their father is absent.\n\nHal is also very caring and trusting. During his travels in the South Seas he became blood brothers with a [[Pohnpei|Ponapean]] called Omo and this bond was so strong Omo once took a bullet for him.<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\"/> He also reformed a character called Vic Stone in ''[[Tiger Adventure]]'' after saving his life. Hal also considers it his responsibility to look after his younger brother.\n\nHal possesses a near limitless store of knowledge about virtually any subject or animal species they encounter, as well as being a skilled doctor. This is because he often takes the role of narrator for the parts of the book where vast volumes of explanations are needed for what is occurring. Despite being a genius, he has a poor grasp of human nature that borders on naivet\u00e9 which was best demonstrated in ''[[Cannibal Adventure]]'', where he could not understand why Merlin Kaggs - whom he had imprisoned for life - would want to kill him.\n\n=== Roger Hunt ===\n\nRoger is the archetypical little brother as he often argues with, and yet admires, Hal. Although he does not have the build of his brother, being shorter as well as more slim and wiry rather than muscular, he's strong enough to survive a direct hit from an adult silverback [[gorilla]],<ref name=\"GorillaAdventure\">''[[Gorilla Adventure]]'' (1969)</ref> temporary blinding from a spitting [[cobra]],<ref name=\"GorillaAdventure\"/> a fight with an [[octopus]]<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\"/> and a near drowning from a [[salt water crocodile]].<ref name=\"CannibalAdventure\">''[[Cannibal Adventure]]'' (1972)</ref>\n\nRoger is a diligent practical joker who is always playing pranks on his brother Hal, many of which, like the one he played in ''[[Amazon Adventure]]'', got out of hand and almost killed someone. Despite this Roger is not evil, just young and mischievous, with an insatiable thirst to prove his own worth.\n\nRoger has, on four occasions, proved his manhood to his overprotective brother. The first was in ''[[African Adventure]]'' where he captures a [[bison|buffalo]], in ''[[Whale Adventure]]'' where he is forced to fend off a pod of [[killer whale]]s, in ''[[Diving Adventure]]'' where he defeats a [[Mako shark]] and rescues a beautiful maiden in the process and in ''[[Lion Adventure]]'' where he kills a [[lion]] with nothing more than a wooden spear.\n\nRoger has the power to attract and tame virtually any animal. This is sometimes played for laughs, such as when was attacked by [[ants]] in ''[[Amazon Adventure]],'' or seriously when he has to take care of a valuable animal. The most prominent examples of his ability is when he tames a furious man-eating [[lion]] in ''[[Lion Adventure]]'' with a few softly-spoken words. He has also tamed [[crocodile]]s,<ref name=\"CannibalAdventure\"/> infant [[gorilla]]s,<ref name=\"GorillaAdventure\"/> [[polar bear]]s<ref name=\"ArcticAdventure\">''[[Arctic Adventure]]'' (1980)</ref> and a [[killer whale]] and an elephant, to name a few, during the course of their adventures.\n\n== The Adventures of Hal and Roger ==\n{{main|The Adventure Series (Willard Price)}}\n* ''[[Amazon Adventure]]'' (1949)\n* ''[[South Sea Adventure]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Underwater Adventure]]'' (1954)\n* ''[[Volcano Adventure]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Whale Adventure]]'' (1960)\n* ''[[African Adventure]]'' (1963)\n* ''[[Elephant Adventure]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Safari Adventure]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Lion Adventure]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Gorilla Adventure]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Diving Adventure]]'' (1970)\n* ''[[Cannibal Adventure]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Tiger Adventure]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Arctic Adventure]]'' (1980)\n\n== Allies ==\nAlthough the boys meet new friends in every novel, only a select few make repeat appearances. These include Captain Ike, the old [[World War II]] captain currently in command of the ship ''Lively Lady'', and his first mate, Omo, who followed and aided the boys during their adventures across the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]].<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\"/><ref name=\"UnderwaterAdventure\">''[[Underwater Adventure]]'' (1954)</ref><ref name=\"VolcanoAdventure\">''[[Volcano Adventure]]'' (1956)</ref>\n\nOther allies given considerable mention include the team of big game hunters, initially employed by their father, who then accompanied the boys on their African adventures. One of these is Joro the chief tracker who was originally conscripted by the evil [[Leopard Society]] to kill Hal, Roger and their father but had a change of heart and joined them in the fight against the Leopard Men. Two other members of the team who are often given passing mention include Toto, Hal's gun bearer with a ''\"grin a yard wide,\"''{{hsp}}<ref name=\"LionAdventure\">''[[Lion Adventure]]'' (1967)</ref> and the brave Mali, who also owns a magnificent [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]] dog named Zulu.\n\n== Enemies ==\n{{main|List of villains in Willard Price's Adventure series}}\nDuring the course of their adventures, Hal and Roger have made many enemies. These include Hal's embittered ex-school friend, Sylvester K. Inkham (nicknamed \"Skink\")<ref name=\"UnderwaterAdventure\"/> and an angry witch doctor with no scruples.<ref name=\"CannibalAdventure\"/> Some, through their interactions with Hal and Roger, are led to redeem their past misdeeds, while others simply suffer the consequences of their actions. Of these enemies, only one, the \"Reverend\" Merlin Kaggs, has made more than one appearance as a villain.<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\"/><ref name=\"CannibalAdventure\"/><ref name=\"Diving Adventure\">''[[Diving Adventure]]'' (1970)</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{AdventureSeries}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hal and Roger Hunt}}\n[[Category:Fictional explorers]]\n[[Category:Fictional hunters]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Willard Price]]\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature]]\n[[Category:Literary duos]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1949]]\n", "text_old": "{{in-universe|date=March 2019}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em; width:21em; clear:right;\"\n|-\n|colspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | '''''[[Literary]]'' characters'''\n|-\n|'''Names:''' ||Hal Hunt and Roger Hunt.\n|-\n|'''Home:''' || [[Long Island]].  \n|-\n|'''Gender:''' || Male. \n|-\n|'''Height:''' ||'''Hal:''' 6'3.

He has survived an attack by a [[Portuguese man o' war]] and fought and defeated a [[Leopard|panther]] unarmed and single-handedly. With remarkably little practice, he learns to hold his breath underwater for more than a minute while diving for pearls in the South Seas.<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\">''[[South Sea Adventure]]'' (1952)</ref> He also has a scar on his shoulder blade caused by a spear, courtesy of Merlin Kaggs. He's the older and more mature of the two brothers, and is often left in charge of the mission when their father is absent.\n\nHal is also very caring and trusting. During his travels in the South Seas he became blood brothers with a [[Pohnpei|Ponapean]] called Omo and this bond was so strong Omo once took a bullet for him.<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\"/> He also reformed a character called Vic Stone in ''[[Tiger Adventure]]'' after saving his life. Hal also considers it his responsibility to look after his younger brother.\n\nHal possesses a near limitless store of knowledge about virtually any subject or animal species they encounter, as well as being a skilled doctor. This is because he often takes the role of narrator for the parts of the book where vast volumes of explanations are needed for what is occurring. Despite being a genius, he has a poor grasp of human nature that borders on naivet\u00e9 which was best demonstrated in ''[[Cannibal Adventure]]'', where he could not understand why Merlin Kaggs - whom he had imprisoned for life - would want to kill him.\n\n=== Roger Hunt ===\n\nRoger is the archetypical little brother as he often argues with, and yet admires, Hal. Although he does not have the build of his brother, being shorter as well as more slim and wiry rather than muscular, he's strong enough to survive a direct hit from an adult silverback [[gorilla]],<ref name=\"GorillaAdventure\">''[[Gorilla Adventure]]'' (1969)</ref> temporary blinding from a spitting [[cobra]],<ref name=\"GorillaAdventure\"/> a fight with an [[octopus]]<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\"/> and a near drowning from a [[salt water crocodile]].<ref name=\"CannibalAdventure\">''[[Cannibal Adventure]]'' (1972)</ref>\n\nRoger is a diligent practical joker who is always playing pranks on his brother Hal, many of which, like the one he played in ''[[Amazon Adventure]]'', got out of hand and almost killed someone. Despite this Roger is not evil, just young and mischievous, with an insatiable thirst to prove his own worth.\n\nRoger has, on four occasions, proved his manhood to his overprotective brother. The first was in ''[[African Adventure]]'' where he captures a [[bison|buffalo]], in ''[[Whale Adventure]]'' where he is forced to fend off a pod of [[killer whale]]s, in ''[[Diving Adventure]]'' where he defeats a [[Mako shark]] and rescues a beautiful maiden in the process and in ''[[Lion Adventure]]'' where he kills a [[lion]] with nothing more than a wooden spear.\n\nRoger has the power to attract and tame virtually any animal. This is sometimes played for laughs, such as when was attacked by [[ants]] in ''[[Amazon Adventure]],'' or seriously when he has to take care of a valuable animal. The most prominent examples of his ability is when he tames a furious man-eating [[lion]] in ''[[Lion Adventure]]'' with a few softly-spoken words. He has also tamed [[crocodile]]s,<ref name=\"CannibalAdventure\"/> infant [[gorilla]]s,<ref name=\"GorillaAdventure\"/> [[polar bear]]s<ref name=\"ArcticAdventure\">''[[Arctic Adventure]]'' (1980)</ref> and a [[killer whale]] and an elephant, to name a few, during the course of their adventures.\n\n== The Adventures of Hal and Roger ==\n{{main|The Adventure Series (Willard Price)}}\n* ''[[Amazon Adventure]]'' (1949)\n* ''[[South Sea Adventure]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Underwater Adventure]]'' (1954)\n* ''[[Volcano Adventure]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Whale Adventure]]'' (1960)\n* ''[[African Adventure]]'' (1963)\n* ''[[Elephant Adventure]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Safari Adventure]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Lion Adventure]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Gorilla Adventure]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Diving Adventure]]'' (1970)\n* ''[[Cannibal Adventure]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Tiger Adventure]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Arctic Adventure]]'' (1980)\n\n== Allies ==\nAlthough the boys meet new friends in every novel, only a select few make repeat appearances. These include Captain Ike, the old [[World War II]] captain currently in command of the ship ''Lively Lady'', and his first mate, Omo, who followed and aided the boys during their adventures across the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]].<ref name=\"SouthSeaAdventure\"/><ref name=\"UnderwaterAdventure\">''[[Underwater Adventure]]'' (1954)</ref><ref name=\"VolcanoAdventure\">''[[Volcano Adventure]]'' (1956)</ref>\n\nOther allies given considerable mention include the team of big game hunters, initially employed by their father, who then accompanied the boys on their African adventures. One of these is Joro the chief tracker who was originally conscripted by the evil [[Leopard Society]] to kill Hal, Roger and their father but had a change of heart and joined them in the fight against the Leopard Men. Two other members of the team who are often given passing mention include Toto, Hal's gun bearer with a ''\"grin a yard wide,\"''{{hsp}}<ref name=\"LionAdventure\">''[[Lion Adventure]]'' (1967)</ref> and the brave Mali, who also owns a magnificent [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]] dog named Zulu.\n\n== Enemies ==\n{{main|List of villains in Willard Price's Adventure series}}\nDuring the course of their adventures, Hal and Roger have made many enemies. These include Hal's embittered ex-school friend, Sylvester K. Inkham (nicknamed \"Skink\")<ref name=\"UnderwaterAdventure\"/> and an angry witch doctor with no scruples.<ref name=\"CannibalAdventure\"/> Some, through their interactions with Hal and Roger, are led to redeem their past misdeeds, while others simply suffer the consequences of their actions.

That is, it is a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some [[integer]] {{math|''n''}}.  They are named after [[Marin Mersenne]], a French [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], who studied them in the early 17th century.\n\nThe [[exponentiation|exponents]] {{math|''n''}} which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31,&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000043}} and the resulting Mersenne primes are [[3 (number)|3]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[127 (number)|127]], 8191, 131071, 524287, [[2147483647]],&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000668}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n''}} is a [[composite number]] then so is {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}}. ({{math|2<sup>''ab''</sup> \u2212 1}} is divisible by both {{math|2<sup>''a''</sup> \u2212 1}} and {{math|2<sup>''b''</sup> \u2212 1}}.) This definition is therefore equivalent to the definition as a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some prime {{math|''p''}}.\n\nMore generally, numbers of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} without the primality requirement may be called '''Mersenne numbers'''.  Sometimes, however, Mersenne numbers are defined to have the additional requirement that {{math|''n''}} be prime.\nThe smallest composite Mersenne number with prime exponent ''n'' is {{nowrap|2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their [[#Perfect numbers|connection to perfect numbers]].\n\n{{As of|2020|2|url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=4}}, 51 Mersenne primes are known. The [[largest known prime number]], {{nowrap|2<sup>82,589,933</sup> \u2212 1}}, is a Mersenne prime.<ref name=\"GIMPS-2018\">{{cite web |title=GIMPS Project Discovers Largest Known Prime Number: 2<sup>82,589,933</sup>-1 |url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M82589933.html |date=21 December 2018 |work=Mersenne Research, Inc. |accessdate=21 December 2018 }}</ref> Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS), a [[distributed computing]] project on the Internet.\n\n==About Mersenne primes==\n{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes?}}\nMany fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The [[Lenstra\u2013Pomerance\u2013Wagstaff conjecture]] asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their [[asymptotic analysis|order of growth]]. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are [[composite number|composite]], although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of [[Sophie Germain prime]]s [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 3 ([[Modular arithmetic|mod 4]]). For these primes {{mvar|p}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} (which is also prime) will divide {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}, for example, {{math|23&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>11</sub>}}, {{math|47&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>23</sub>}}, {{math|167&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>83</sub>}}, {{math|263&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>131</sub>}}, {{math|359&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>179</sub>}}, {{math|383&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>191</sub>}}, {{math|479&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>239</sub>}}, and {{math|503&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>251</sub>}} {{OEIS|id=A002515}}. Since for these primes {{math|''p''}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} is congruent to 7 mod 8, so 2 is a [[quadratic residue]] mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}}, and the [[multiplicative order]] of 2 mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}} must divide <math>\\frac{(2p+1)-1}{2}</math> = {{mvar|p}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is a prime, it must be {{mvar|p}} or 1. However, it cannot be 1 since <math>\\Phi_1(2)=1</math> and 1 has no [[prime factor]]s, so it must be {{mvar|p}}. Hence, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides <math>\\Phi_p(2)=2^p-1</math> and <math>2^p-1=M_p</math> cannot be prime.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes are {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 3}}, {{math|''M''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} 7}}, {{math|''M''<sub>5</sub> {{=}} 31}} and {{math|''M''<sub>7</sub> {{=}} 127}} and because the first Mersenne prime starts at {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub>}}, all Mersenne primes are congruent to 3 (mod 4). Other than {{math|''M''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''M''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 1}}, all other Mersenne numbers are also congruent to 3 (mod 4). Consequently, in the [[prime factorization]] of a Mersenne number (&nbsp;{{math|&ge;&nbsp;''M''<sub>2</sub>}}&nbsp;) there must be at least one prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4).\n\nA basic [[theorem]] about Mersenne numbers states that if {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime, then the exponent {{math|''p''}} must also be prime. This follows from the identity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}2^{ab}-1&=(2^a-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\\right)\\\\&=(2^b-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\\right). \\end{align}</math>\nThis rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as {{math|''M''<sub>4</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>4</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 15 {{=}} 3 \u00d7 5 {{=}} (2<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1) \u00d7 (1 + 2<sup>2</sup>)}}.\n\nThough the above examples might suggest that {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for all primes {{mvar|p}}, this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number\n\n: {{math|''M''<sub>11</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected odd integer of similar size.<ref name=\"Wagstaff\" /> Nonetheless, prime values of {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} appear to grow increasingly sparse as {{mvar|p}} increases. For example, eight of the first 11 primes {{mvar|p}} give rise to a Mersenne prime {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} (the correct terms on Mersenne's original list), while {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for only 43 of the first two million prime numbers (up to 32,452,843).\n\nThe lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]] (LLT) is an efficient [[primality test]] that greatly aids this task, making it much easier to test the primality of Mersenne numbers than that of most other numbers of the same size. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a [[cult following]]. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using [[distributed computing]].\n\nArithmetic modulo a Mersenne number is particularly efficient on a [[Binary number|binary computer]], making them popular choices when a prime modulus is desired, such as the [[Park\u2013Miller random number generator]].  To find a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] of Mersenne number order requires knowing the factorization of that number, so Mersenne primes allow one to find to primitive polynomials of very high order.  Such [[primitive polynomial (field theory)#Primitive trinomials|primitive trinomials]] are used in [[pseudorandom number generator]]s with very large periods such as the [[Mersenne twister]], generalized shift register and [[Lagged Fibonacci generator]]s.\n\n==Perfect numbers==\n{{main|Euclid\u2013Euler theorem}}\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their connection with [[perfect number]]s. In the 4th century BC, [[Euclid]] proved that if {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime, then {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>(2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as {{math|{{sfrac|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>(''M<sub>p</sub>'' + 1)|2}}}}, is the {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}th [[triangular number]] and the {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}th [[hexagonal number]]. In the 18th century, [[Leonhard Euler]] proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.<ref>Chris K. Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists]</ref> This is known as the [[Euclid\u2013Euler theorem]].

The exponents listed by Mersenne were as follows:\n\n::2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.\n\nHis list replicated the known primes of his time with exponents up to 19. His next entry, 31, was correct, but the list then became largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>257</sub>}} (which are composite) and omitted {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}}, and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}} (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.<ref>The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=MersennesConjecture Mersenne's conjecture].</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9douard Lucas]] proved in 1876 that {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}} is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.  {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} was determined to be prime in 1883 by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]], though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by [[Frank Nelson Cole]] in 1903.<ref>{{citation|last=Cole|first= F. N.\n|title=On the factoring of large numbers|jfm= 34.0216.04|journal=Bull. Amer. Math.

The fifth, {{math|''M''<sub>13</sub> {{=}} 8191}}, was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ({{math|''M''<sub>17</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>19</sub>}}) were found by [[Pietro Cataldi]] in 1588. After nearly two centuries, {{math|''M''<sub>31</sub>}} was verified to be prime by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}}, found by [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] in 1876, then {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]] in 1883. Two more ({{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}}) were found early in the 20th century, by [[R. E. Powers]] in 1911 and 1914, respectively.\n\nThe best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]]. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime {{math|''p'' > 2}}, {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime [[if and only if]] {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}} divides {{math|''S''<sub>''p'' \u2212 2</sub>}}, where {{math|''S''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 4}} and {{math|''S<sub>k</sub>'' {{=}} (''S''<sub>''k'' \u2212 1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} for {{math|''k'' > 0}}.\n\nDuring the era of manual calculation, all the exponents up to and including 257 were tested with the Lucas\u2013Lehmer test and found to be composite. A notable contribution was made by retired Yale physics professor Horace Scudder Uhler, who did the calculations for exponents 157, 167, 193, 199, 227, and 229.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Scripta Mathematica |volume= 18 |year=1952 |pp=122\u2013131 |title=A Brief History of the Investigations on Mersenne Numbers and the Latest Immense Primes |author=Horace S.

[[Alan Turing]] searched for them on the [[Manchester Mark 1]] in 1949,<ref>Brian Napper, [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/maths.html The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1].</ref> but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, {{math|''M''<sub>521</sub>}}, by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]] [[SWAC (computer)|Western Automatic Computer (SWAC)]] at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], under the direction of [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|Lehmer]], with a computer search program written and run by Prof. [[Raphael M.

Since {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}, for all positive integers {{math|''c''}} we have that {{mvar|q}} is also a factor of {{math|2<sup>''pc''</sup> \u2212 1}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is prime and {{mvar|q}} is not a factor of {{nowrap|2<sup>1</sup> \u2212 1}}, {{mvar|p}} is also the smallest positive integer {{mvar|x}} such that {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''x''</sup> \u2212 1}}. As a result, for all positive integers {{mvar|x}}, we have that {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''x''</sup> \u2212 1}} if and only if {{mvar|p}} is a factor of {{mvar|x}}. Therefore, since {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''q''\u22121</sup> \u2212 1}}, {{mvar|p}} is a factor of {{math|''q'' \u2212 1}} so {{math|''q'' \u2261 1 (mod ''p'')}}. Furthermore, since {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}, which is odd, {{mvar|q}} is odd. Therefore, {{math|''q'' \u2261 1 (mod 2''p'')}}.\n#* This fact leads to a proof of [[Euclid's theorem]], which asserts the infinitude of primes, distinct from the proof written by Euclid: for every odd prime {{mvar|p}}, all primes dividing {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} are larger than {{mvar|p}}; thus there are always larger primes than any particular prime.\n#* It follows from this fact that for every prime {{math|''p'' > 2}}, there is at least one prime of the form {{math|2''kp''+1}} less than or equal to {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}, for some integer {{mvar|k}}.\n# If {{mvar|p}} is an odd prime, then every prime {{mvar|q}} that divides {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is congruent to {{nowrap|\u00b11 (mod 8)}}.\n#* '''Proof''': {{math|2<sup>''p''+1</sup> \u2261 2 (mod ''q'')}}, so {{math|2<sup>{{sfrac|1|2}}(p+1)</sup>}} is a square root of {{math|2 mod ''q''}}.  By [[quadratic reciprocity]], every prime modulus in which the number 2 has a square root is congruent to {{nowrap|\u00b11 (mod 8)}}.\n# A Mersenne prime cannot be a [[Wieferich prime]].\n#* '''Proof''': We show if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1}} is a Mersenne prime, then the congruence {{math|2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup> \u2261 1 (mod ''p''<sup>2</sup>)}} does not hold. By Fermat's little theorem, {{math|''m'' {{!}} ''p'' \u2212 1}}.  Therefore, one can write {{math|''p'' \u2212 1 {{=}} ''m\u03bb''}}. If the given congruence is satisfied, then {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup> {{!}} 2<sup>''m\u03bb''</sup> \u2212 1}}, therefore {{math|0 \u2261 {{sfrac|2<sup>''m\u03bb''</sup> \u2212 1|2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1}}}} {{math|{{=}} 1 + 2<sup>''m''</sup> + 2<sup>2''m''</sup> + ... + 2<sup>(''\u03bb'' \u2212 1)''m''</sup>}} {{math|\u2261 \u2212''\u03bb'' mod (2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1)}}.

In his ''Theology of Arithmetic'' in the chapter ''On the Decad'', Iamblichus writes: \"Speusippus, the son of Plato's sister Potone, and head of the Academy before Xenocrates, compiled a polished little book from the Pythagorean writings which were particularly valued at any time, and especially from the writings of Philolaus; he entitled the book ''On Pythagorean Numbers''.

See [[integer factorization records]] for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor.

That is, it is a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some [[integer]] {{math|''n''}}.  They are named after [[Marin Mersenne]], a French [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], who studied them in the early 17th century.\n\nThe [[exponentiation|exponents]] {{math|''n''}} which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31,&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000043}} and the resulting Mersenne primes are [[3 (number)|3]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[127 (number)|127]], 8191, 131071, 524287, [[2147483647]],&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000668}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n''}} is a [[composite number]] then so is {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}}. ({{math|2<sup>''ab''</sup> \u2212 1}} is divisible by both {{math|2<sup>''a''</sup> \u2212 1}} and {{math|2<sup>''b''</sup> \u2212 1}}.) This definition is therefore equivalent to the definition as a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some prime {{math|''p''}}.\n\nMore generally, numbers of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} without the primality requirement may be called '''Mersenne numbers'''.  Sometimes, however, Mersenne numbers are defined to have the additional requirement that {{math|''n''}} be prime.\nThe smallest composite Mersenne number with prime exponent ''n'' is {{nowrap|2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their [[#Perfect numbers|connection to perfect numbers]].\n\n{{As of|2020|2|url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=4}}, 51 Mersenne primes are known. The [[largest known prime number]], {{nowrap|2<sup>82,589,933</sup> \u2212 1}}, is a Mersenne prime.<ref name=\"GIMPS-2018\">{{cite web |title=GIMPS Project Discovers Largest Known Prime Number: 2<sup>82,589,933</sup>-1 |url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M82589933.html |date=21 December 2018 |work=Mersenne Research, Inc. |accessdate=21 December 2018 }}</ref> Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS), a [[distributed computing]] project on the Internet.\n\n==About Mersenne primes==\n{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes?}}\nMany fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The [[Lenstra\u2013Pomerance\u2013Wagstaff conjecture]] asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their [[asymptotic analysis|order of growth]]. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are [[composite number|composite]], although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of [[Sophie Germain prime]]s [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 3 ([[Modular arithmetic|mod 4]]). For these primes {{mvar|p}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} (which is also prime) will divide {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}, for example, {{math|23&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>11</sub>}}, {{math|47&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>23</sub>}}, {{math|167&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>83</sub>}}, {{math|263&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>131</sub>}}, {{math|359&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>179</sub>}}, {{math|383&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>191</sub>}}, {{math|479&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>239</sub>}}, and {{math|503&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>251</sub>}} {{OEIS|id=A002515}}. Since for these primes {{math|''p''}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} is congruent to 7 mod 8, so 2 is a [[quadratic residue]] mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}}, and the [[multiplicative order]] of 2 mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}} must divide <math>\\frac{(2p+1)-1}{2}</math> = {{mvar|p}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is a prime, it must be {{mvar|p}} or 1. However, it cannot be 1 since <math>\\Phi_1(2)=1</math> and 1 has no [[prime factor]]s, so it must be {{mvar|p}}. Hence, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides <math>\\Phi_p(2)=2^p-1</math> and <math>2^p-1=M_p</math> cannot be prime.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes are {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 3}}, {{math|''M''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} 7}}, {{math|''M''<sub>5</sub> {{=}} 31}} and {{math|''M''<sub>7</sub> {{=}} 127}} and because the first Mersenne prime starts at {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub>}}, all Mersenne primes are congruent to 3 (mod 4). Other than {{math|''M''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''M''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 1}}, all other Mersenne numbers are also congruent to 3 (mod 4). Consequently, in the [[prime factorization]] of a Mersenne number (&nbsp;{{math|&ge;&nbsp;''M''<sub>2</sub>}}&nbsp;) there must be at least one prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4).\n\nA basic [[theorem]] about Mersenne numbers states that if {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime, then the exponent {{math|''p''}} must also be prime. This follows from the identity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}2^{ab}-1&=(2^a-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\\right)\\\\&=(2^b-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\\right). \\end{align}</math>\nThis rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as {{math|''M''<sub>4</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>4</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 15 {{=}} 3 \u00d7 5 {{=}} (2<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1) \u00d7 (1 + 2<sup>2</sup>)}}.\n\nThough the above examples might suggest that {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for all primes {{mvar|p}}, this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number\n\n: {{math|''M''<sub>11</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected odd integer of similar size.<ref name=\"Wagstaff\" /> Nonetheless, prime values of {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} appear to grow increasingly sparse as {{mvar|p}} increases. For example, eight of the first 11 primes {{mvar|p}} give rise to a Mersenne prime {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} (the correct terms on Mersenne's original list), while {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for only 43 of the first two million prime numbers (up to 32,452,843).\n\nThe lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]] (LLT) is an efficient [[primality test]] that greatly aids this task, making it much easier to test the primality of Mersenne numbers than that of most other numbers of the same size. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a [[cult following]]. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using [[distributed computing]].\n\nArithmetic modulo a Mersenne number is particularly efficient on a [[Binary number|binary computer]], making them popular choices when a prime modulus is desired, such as the [[Park\u2013Miller random number generator]].  To find a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] of Mersenne number order requires knowing the factorization of that number, so Mersenne primes allow one to find to primitive polynomials of very high order.  Such [[primitive polynomial (field theory)#Primitive trinomials|primitive trinomials]] are used in [[pseudorandom number generator]]s with very large periods such as the [[Mersenne twister]], generalized shift register and [[Lagged Fibonacci generator]]s.\n\n==Perfect numbers==\n{{main|Euclid\u2013Euler theorem}}\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their connection with [[perfect number]]s. In the 4th century BC, [[Euclid]] proved that if {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime, then {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>(2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as {{math|{{sfrac|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>(''M<sub>p</sub>'' + 1)|2}}}}, is the {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}th [[triangular number]] and the {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}th [[hexagonal number]]. In the 18th century, [[Leonhard Euler]] proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.<ref>Chris K. Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists]</ref> This is known as the [[Euclid\u2013Euler theorem]].

The exponents listed by Mersenne were as follows:\n\n::2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.\n\nHis list replicated the known primes of his time with exponents up to 19. His next entry, 31, was correct, but the list then became largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>257</sub>}} (which are composite) and omitted {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}}, and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}} (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.<ref>The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=MersennesConjecture Mersenne's conjecture].</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9douard Lucas]] proved in 1876 that {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}} is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.  {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} was determined to be prime in 1883 by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]], though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by [[Frank Nelson Cole]] in 1903.<ref>{{citation|last=Cole|first= F. N.\n|title=On the factoring of large numbers|jfm= 34.0216.04|journal=Bull. Amer. Math.

The fifth, {{math|''M''<sub>13</sub> {{=}} 8191}}, was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ({{math|''M''<sub>17</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>19</sub>}}) were found by [[Pietro Cataldi]] in 1588. After nearly two centuries, {{math|''M''<sub>31</sub>}} was verified to be prime by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}}, found by [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] in 1876, then {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]] in 1883. Two more ({{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}}) were found early in the 20th century, by [[R. E. Powers]] in 1911 and 1914, respectively.\n\nThe best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]]. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime {{math|''p'' > 2}}, {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime [[if and only if]] {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}} divides {{math|''S''<sub>''p'' \u2212 2</sub>}}, where {{math|''S''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 4}} and {{math|''S<sub>k</sub>'' {{=}} (''S''<sub>''k'' \u2212 1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} for {{math|''k'' > 0}}.\n\nDuring the era of manual calculation, all the exponents up to and including 257 were tested with the Lucas\u2013Lehmer test and found to be composite. A notable contribution was made by retired Yale physics professor Horace Scudder Uhler, who did the calculations for exponents 157, 167, 193, 199, 227, and 229.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Scripta Mathematica |volume= 18 |year=1952 |pp=122\u2013131 |title=A Brief History of the Investigations on Mersenne Numbers and the Latest Immense Primes |author=Horace S.

[[Alan Turing]] searched for them on the [[Manchester Mark 1]] in 1949,<ref>Brian Napper, [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/maths.html The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1].</ref> but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, {{math|''M''<sub>521</sub>}}, by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]] [[SWAC (computer)|Western Automatic Computer (SWAC)]] at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], under the direction of [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|Lehmer]], with a computer search program written and run by Prof. [[Raphael M. Robinson|R. M. Robinson]]. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, {{math|''M''<sub>607</sub>}}, was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more&nbsp;\u2014 {{math|''M''<sub>1279</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>2203</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>2281</sub>}}&nbsp;\u2014 were found by the same program in the next several months. {{math|''M''<sub>4253</sub>}} is the first Mersenne prime that is [[titanic prime|titanic]], {{math|''M''<sub>44,497</sub>}} is the first [[gigantic prime|gigantic]], and {{math|''M''<sub>6,972,593</sub>}} was the first [[megaprime]] to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.<ref>The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Megaprime The Prime Glossary: megaprime].</ref> All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size.

However, since {{mvar|p}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, {{mvar|q}} is congruent to {{nowrap|7 (mod 8)}} and therefore 2 is a quadratic residue mod {{mvar|q}}. Also since {{mvar|q}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, \u22121 is a quadratic nonresidue mod {{mvar|q}}, so \u22122 is the product of a residue and a nonresidue and hence it is a nonresidue, which is a contradiction. Hence, the former congruence must be true and {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}.\n# All composite divisors of prime-exponent Mersenne numbers are [[strong pseudoprime]]s to the base 2.\n# With the exception of 1, a Mersenne number cannot be a perfect power. In other words, and in accordance with [[Catalan's conjecture|Mih\u0103ilescu's theorem]], the equation {{math|2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} ''n<sup>k</sup>''}} has no solutions where {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}, and {{mvar|k}} are integers with {{math|''m'' > 1}} and {{math|''k'' > 1}}.\n\n==List of known Mersenne primes==\nThe table below lists all known Mersenne primes (sequence {{OEIS link|id=A000043}} ({{math|''p''}}) and {{OEIS link|id=A000668}} ({{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}) in [[OEIS]]):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n! {{math|''p''}}\n! {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}\n! {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}} digits\n!

In the [[Rhind papyrus]] (1650 BC) the Egyptian fraction expansions have fairly different forms for primes and composites, so it may be argued that they knew about prime numbers. \"The Egyptians used ($) in the table above for the first primes {{math|''r''}} = 3, 5, 7, or 11 (also for {{math|''r''}} = 23). Here is another intriguing observation: That the Egyptians stopped the use of ($) at 11 suggests they understood (at least some parts of) Eratosthenes's Sieve 2000 years before Eratosthenes 'discovered' it.\" [http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptroll2-n.html The Rhind 2/{{math|''n''}} Table] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].\n\nIn the school of [[Pythagoras]] (b. about 570 \u2013 d. about 495 BC) and the [[Pythagoreans]], we find the first sure observations of prime numbers. Hence the first two Mersenne primes, 3 and 7, were known to and may even be said to have been discovered by them. There is no reference, though, to their special form 2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and 2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 as such.\n\nThe sources to the knowledge of prime numbers among the Pythagoreans are late. The Neoplatonic philosopher [[Iamblichus]], AD c. 245\u2013c. 325, states that the Greek Platonic philosopher [[Speusippus]], c. 408 \u2013 339/8 BC, wrote a book named ''On Pythagorean Numbers''. According to Iamblichus this book was based on the works of the Pythagorean [[Philolaus]], c. 470\u2013c. 385 BC, who lived a century after [[Pythagoras]], 570 \u2013 c. 495 BC. In his ''Theology of Arithmetic'' in the chapter ''On the Decad'', Iamblichus writes: \"Speusippus, the son of Plato's sister Potone, and head of the Academy before Xenocrates, compiled a polished little book from the Pythagorean writings which were particularly valued at any time, and especially from the writings of Philolaus; he entitled the book ''On Pythagorean Numbers''. In the first half of the book, he elegantly expounds linear numbers [that is, prime numbers], polygonal numbers and all sorts of plane numbers, solid numbers and the five figures which are assigned to the elements of the universe, discussing both their individual attributes and their shared features, and their proportionality and reciprocity.\" [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38568451/Theologoumena-Arithmeticae#page=112 ''Iamblichus'' The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 112f.] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].\n\n[[Iamblichus]] also gives us a direct quote from [[Speusippus]]' book where [[Speusippus]] among other things writes: \"Secondly, it is necessary for a perfect number [the concept \"perfect number\" is not used here in a modern sense] to contain an equal amount of prime and incomposite numbers, and secondary and composite numbers.\" [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38568451/Theologoumena-Arithmeticae#page=113 ''Iamblichus'' The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 113.] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].

However, not all Mersenne numbers are Mersenne primes, and the composite Mersenne numbers may be factored non-trivially.  Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the [[special number field sieve]] algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number.  {{As of|2019|6}}, 2{{sup|1,193}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is the record-holder,<ref>[[Thorsten Kleinjung]], [[Joppe Bos]], [[Arjen Lenstra]] \"Mersenne Factorization Factory\" http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653.pdf</ref> having been factored with a variant of the special number field sieve that allows the factorization of several numbers at once.  See [[integer factorization records]] for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a [[primality test]] on the cofactor. {{As of|2019|6}}, the largest factorization with [[probable prime]] factors allowed is {{nowrap|2<sup>7,313,983</sup> &minus; 1 {{=}} 305,492,080,276,193 \u00d7 {{math|''q''}}}}, where {{math|''q''}} is a 2,201,714-digit probable prime.

Raised in [[Stockton, California]], by working-class parents, Leigh was discovered at 18 by actress [[Norma Shearer]], who helped her secure a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Leigh had her first formal foray into acting appearing in radio programs before making her film debut in ''[[The Romance of Rosy Ridge]]'' (1947).\n\n This American Actress was actually the daughter of Aphrodite and got her voice and looks from her. Since she was a demi god, she had many special powers, one of them was to kill anything instantly she didn't like. She was an amazing Actress with a secret.Early in her career, she appeared in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including ''[[Act of Violence]]'' (1948), ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'' (1949), ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'' (1951), ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952), ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), and ''[[Living It Up]]'' (1954). Leigh played mostly dramatic roles during the latter half of the 1950s, in such films as ''[[Safari (1956 film)|Safari]]'' (1956) and [[Orson Welles]]'s film noir ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), but achieved her most lasting recognition as the doomed [[Marion Crane]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), which earned her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nHer highly publicized marriage to actor [[Tony Curtis]] ended in divorce in 1962, and after starring in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' that same year, Leigh scaled back her career. Intermittently, she continued to appear in films, including ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1963), ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' (1966), ''[[Night of the Lepus]]'' (1972), and ''[[Boardwalk (film)|Boardwalk]]'' (1979). In late 1975, she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in a production of ''Murder Among Friends''. She would also go on to appear in two horror films with her daughter, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]: ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980) and ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998).\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Leigh also wrote four books between 1984 and 2002, two of which were novels. She died in October 2004 at age 77, following a year-long battle with [[vasculitis]], an inflammation of the blood vessels.\n\n== Early life ==\nThe only child of Helen Lita (n\u00e9e Westergaard) and Frederick Robert Morrison, Leigh was born '''Jeanette Helen Morrison''' on July 6, 1927, in [[Merced, California]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=4}} Her maternal grandparents were immigrants from [[Denmark]],{{sfn|Leigh|1984|p=6}} and her father had [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] and [[German American|German]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/CA/german.html|title=German ancestry Politicians in California|website=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}</ref> Shortly after Leigh's birth, the family relocated to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], where she spent her early life.{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=4\u20136, 8}} She was brought up in poverty, as her father struggled to support the family with his factory employment, and he took various additional jobs after the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=5\u20137}}\n\nLeigh was raised [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and sang in the local church choir throughout her childhood.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=8}} In 1941, when her paternal grandfather became terminally ill, the family relocated to Merced where they moved into her grandparents' home.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}} She attended Weber Grammar School in Stockton,{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=7}} and later [[Stockton High School (California)|Stockton High School]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}} Leigh excelled in academics and graduated from high school at age sixteen.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}}\n\nIn September 1943, she enrolled at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|College of the Pacific]] (now [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]), where she majored in music and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=146}} While in college, she joined the Alpha Theta Tau sorority,{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=9\u201310}} and also sang with the college's [[a cappella]] choir.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}} In order to help support her family, she spent Christmas and summer vacations working at retail shops and [[variety store|dime store]]s, as well as working at the college's information desk during her studies.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}}\n\n==Career==\n===Discovery and radio appearances===\n[[File:Janet Leigh c. 1945.png|thumb|220px|upright|Leigh pictured at age eighteen; actress [[Norma Shearer]] helped facilitate her contract with MGM based on this photo]]\nIn the winter of 1945\u20136, actress [[Norma Shearer]] was vacationing at [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort|Sugar Bowl]], a ski resort in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains where Leigh's parents were working at the time.<ref name=laobit/>{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=12}} In the resort lobby, Shearer noticed a photograph of Leigh taken by the ski club photographer over the Christmas holiday, which he had printed and placed in a photo album available for guests to browse.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}}\n\nUpon returning to Los Angeles, Shearer showed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) talent agent [[Lew Wasserman]] the photograph of the then-eighteen-year-old Leigh (Shearer's late husband [[Irving Thalberg]] had been a senior executive at MGM). She would later recall that \"that smile made it the most fascinating face I had seen in years. I felt I had to show that face to somebody at the studio.\"<ref>\"'Luckiest' Photograph Changed Whole Life for a College Girl\", ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', August 16, 1947, p. 1</ref>\n\nThrough her association with MGM, Shearer was able to facilitate screen tests for Leigh with [[Selena Royle]],{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=13}} after which Wasserman negotiated a contract for her, despite her having no acting experience.{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=17\u201322}} Leigh dropped out of college that year, and was soon placed under the tutelage of drama coach Lillian Burns.<ref name=\"fairy\">\"A Fairy Tale That Came True\" by Victor Gunson, ''The Daily Times'', October 3, 1946, p. 14</ref>\n\nPrior to beginning her film career, Leigh was a guest star on the radio [[Radio drama|dramatic]] anthology ''[[The Cresta Blanca Hollywood Players]]''.

Another film that Leigh was set to star in, before being replaced, was ''[[Alias a Gentleman]]'', in which she was cast in April 1947.<ref>\"Screen and Stage News\" by [[Hedda Hopper]], ''[[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]]'', April 15, 1947</ref>\n\nBy late 1947, Leigh was occupied with the shooting of the [[Lassie]] film ''[[Hills of Home (film)|Hills of Home]]'' (1948), her third movie and the first in which she received star billing.<ref>\"Janet Leigh Wins Star Billing\", ''[[Deseret News]]'', January 26, 1948, p. 14</ref> She had a cameo as herself in MGM's all-star musical, ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948).\n\nIn late 1948, Leigh was hailed the \"No. 1 glamour girl\" of Hollywood, although known for her polite, generous and down-to-earth persona.<ref>\"MGM Convinces All Except Janet Leigh Of Her Glamor\" by Virginia MacPherson, ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'', November 22, 1948, p. 20</ref>\n\nLeigh appeared in the thriller, ''[[Act of Violence (1949 film)|Act of Violence]]'' (1949), with Van Heflin and Robert Ryan, directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]]. It lost money although was well received.\n\nLeigh had a big hit with MGM's version of ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'' (1949), based on the novel by [[Louisa May Alcott]], playing Meg, alongside [[June Allyson]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. She was then in the anti-communist drama ''[[The Red Danube]]'' (1949), which earned her critical acclaim.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=155}}\n\nLeigh was [[Glenn Ford]]'s love interest in ''[[The Doctor and the Girl]]'' (1949), and was June Forsyte in ''[[That Forsyte Woman]]'' (1949) with [[Greer Garson]] and [[Errol Flynn]].\n\nRKO borrowed her to play [[Robert Mitchum]]'s leading lady in ''[[Holiday Affair]]'' (1949). She stayed at that studio to appear opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Jet Pilot (film)|Jet Pilot]]'', which was not released until 1957.\n\n===Tony Curtis===\nLeigh's fame shot up when she married Tony Curtis, a romance much covered in the fan magazines at the time. From 1951 to 1954 Leigh and Curtis appeared in numerous home movies directed by their friend [[Jerry Lewis]].

Raised in [[Stockton, California]], by working-class parents, Leigh was discovered at 18 by actress [[Norma Shearer]], who helped her secure a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Leigh had her first formal foray into acting appearing in radio programs before making her film debut in ''[[The Romance of Rosy Ridge]]'' (1947).\n\nEarly in her career, she appeared in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including ''[[Act of Violence]]'' (1948), ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'' (1949), ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'' (1951), ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952), ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), and ''[[Living It Up]]'' (1954). Leigh played mostly dramatic roles during the latter half of the 1950s, in such films as ''[[Safari (1956 film)|Safari]]'' (1956) and [[Orson Welles]]'s film noir ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), but achieved her most lasting recognition as the doomed [[Marion Crane]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), which earned her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nHer highly publicized marriage to actor [[Tony Curtis]] ended in divorce in 1962, and after starring in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' that same year, Leigh scaled back her career. Intermittently, she continued to appear in films, including ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1963), ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' (1966), ''[[Night of the Lepus]]'' (1972), and ''[[Boardwalk (film)|Boardwalk]]'' (1979). In late 1975, she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in a production of ''Murder Among Friends''. She would also go on to appear in two horror films with her daughter, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]: ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980) and ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998).\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Leigh also wrote four books between 1984 and 2002, two of which were novels. She died in October 2004 at age 77, following a year-long battle with [[vasculitis]], an inflammation of the blood vessels.\n\n== Early life ==\nThe only child of Helen Lita (n\u00e9e Westergaard) and Frederick Robert Morrison, Leigh was born '''Jeanette Helen Morrison''' on July 6, 1927, in [[Merced, California]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=4}} Her maternal grandparents were immigrants from [[Denmark]],{{sfn|Leigh|1984|p=6}} and her father had [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] and [[German American|German]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/CA/german.html|title=German ancestry Politicians in California|website=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}</ref> Shortly after Leigh's birth, the family relocated to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], where she spent her early life.{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=4\u20136, 8}} She was brought up in poverty, as her father struggled to support the family with his factory employment, and he took various additional jobs after the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=5\u20137}}\n\nLeigh was raised [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and sang in the local church choir throughout her childhood.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=8}} In 1941, when her paternal grandfather became terminally ill, the family relocated to Merced where they moved into her grandparents' home.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}} She attended Weber Grammar School in Stockton,{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=7}} and later [[Stockton High School (California)|Stockton High School]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}} Leigh excelled in academics and graduated from high school at age sixteen.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}}\n\nIn September 1943, she enrolled at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|College of the Pacific]] (now [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]), where she majored in music and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=146}} While in college, she joined the Alpha Theta Tau sorority,{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=9\u201310}} and also sang with the college's [[a cappella]] choir.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}} In order to help support her family, she spent Christmas and summer vacations working at retail shops and [[variety store|dime store]]s, as well as working at the college's information desk during her studies.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}}\n\n==Career==\n===Discovery and radio appearances===\n[[File:Janet Leigh c. 1945.png|thumb|220px|upright|Leigh pictured at age eighteen; actress [[Norma Shearer]] helped facilitate her contract with MGM based on this photo]]\nIn the winter of 1945\u20136, actress [[Norma Shearer]] was vacationing at [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort|Sugar Bowl]], a ski resort in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains where Leigh's parents were working at the time.<ref name=laobit/>{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=12}} In the resort lobby, Shearer noticed a photograph of Leigh taken by the ski club photographer over the Christmas holiday, which he had printed and placed in a photo album available for guests to browse.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}}\n\nUpon returning to Los Angeles, Shearer showed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) talent agent [[Lew Wasserman]] the photograph of the then-eighteen-year-old Leigh (Shearer's late husband [[Irving Thalberg]] had been a senior executive at MGM). She would later recall that \"that smile made it the most fascinating face I had seen in years. I felt I had to show that face to somebody at the studio.\"<ref>\"'Luckiest' Photograph Changed Whole Life for a College Girl\", ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', August 16, 1947, p. 1</ref>\n\nThrough her association with MGM, Shearer was able to facilitate screen tests for Leigh with [[Selena Royle]],{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=13}} after which Wasserman negotiated a contract for her, despite her having no acting experience.{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=17\u201322}} Leigh dropped out of college that year, and was soon placed under the tutelage of drama coach Lillian Burns.<ref name=\"fairy\">\"A Fairy Tale That Came True\" by Victor Gunson, ''The Daily Times'', October 3, 1946, p. 14</ref>\n\nPrior to beginning her film career, Leigh was a guest star on the radio [[Radio drama|dramatic]] anthology ''[[The Cresta Blanca Hollywood Players]]''.
