He has also played for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in the English [[County Championship]] in 2005. He regards [[Terry Alderman]] as one of his mentors. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==International career==\n===2002\u20132009===\nWatson was selected for his first Australian team in early 2002, being selected to tour [[South Africa]] with the Test team after topping the [[Pura Cup]] wicket-taking charts for [[Tasmania]], as well as steady middle-order batting performances. Watson did make his ODI debut on tour, replacing [[Steve Waugh]], who was sacked after the team failed to make the ODI finals in the preceding Australian summer. Watson continued as a regular member of the ODI team until he suffered three stress fractures in his back,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} at the start of 2003, missing the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. He was replaced by his Queensland teammate [[Andrew Symonds]], who proceeded to establish his position as the all rounder after scoring 143* and 91* during the tournament.\n\nWatson returned to regular ODI duty in the 2004\u201305 season, as a bowling all rounder. He also made his test debut in the Third Test against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] as the fifth bowler, in order to allow Australia to play two spinners and three pace bowlers on a dry [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] pitch.\n\nAustralian selectors included Watson as the fifth bowler and all rounder in all Test matches following the [[2005 Ashes series]]. Watson played against the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the role, but he dislocated his shoulder in just his second Test in that designated role against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], after diving to field a ball. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Watson was again replaced by Symonds and was unable to represent Australia for the remainder of the summer.\n\n[[File:Shane Watson 2009 fielding.jpg|thumb|Shane Watson in 2009]]\nThis changed when Watson opened the batting for Australia at the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]], alongside wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist, instead of [[Simon Katich]].  After failing in the first two matches against the [[West Indies]] and [[England]], Watson made a 50 in Australia's victory over [[India]], which sealed their place in the semi-finals, he then took 2 wickets and scored 57 not out in the finals to seal the win. In the [[2009 ICC Champions Trophy]] held in [[South Africa]], Watson again played a prominent role, making two consecutive 100s against [[England]] and [[New Zealand]] in semi-final and final, helping [[Australia]] to defend their title.\n\nWatson was named in the squad for the [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]] against England. However, he came off the ground in a one-day domestic game the week before the first Test with a suspected hamstring tear,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} which ruled him out for the first three Tests. [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] was called up in Watson's place, and responded with a half-century, and then a century to cement Clarke's place in the team.\n\nWatson was expected to be fit for the fourth Test on Boxing Day and the [[MCG]] in Melbourne, and because of [[Damien Martyn]]'s unexpected retirement, it looked likely that Watson would be included in the side. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, another injury setback in a match for Queensland ruled Watson out for the rest of the Ashes series. Watson eventually returned in February to the ODI side, replacing [[Cameron White]] in the all rounder position, However he again broke down with injury during the 29th match of [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] and missed two matches of the Super 8's before returning in fine style scoring an unbeaten 65 off 32 balls against New Zealand. Injury again struck Watson in the early stages of the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] as he missed most of the tournament due to [[hamstring]] strain. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} He was then out of action for the 2007\u201308 Australian season.\n\nAfter Symonds was omitted from the Australian team for disciplinary reasons, and Watson took the all rounder's position for the tour of India in late 2008, batting at No. 6. During the Third Test in Delhi, he was involved in a series of confrontations with Indian opener [[Gautam Gambhir]], who scored a double century and reached his century by lofting Watson over midwicket for six. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAfter returning to Australia, Symonds was recalled to the Test team and both all rounders played in the First Test against New Zealand in Brisbane. As the pitch was a green, rain-affected moist surface expected to favour seamers, spinner [[Jason Krejza]] was dropped to accommodate two seam bowling all rounders. After the match, which Australia won, Watson was dropped as spinner [[Nathan Hauritz]] was included and Symonds retained. Symonds continued to perform poorly, and there were calls for Watson to take his place,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} but both men then fell injured at the end of the year, Watson with a stress fracture. Watson returned to international duty in the ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE, scoring a century.\n[[File:Shane Watson 2013.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Shane Watson plays a cut shot.]]\n\nHe returned to the Australian Test side for the 3rd Ashes Test match at Edgbaston on 30 July 2009 as an opener. In a rain interrupted match he made 62 and 53 batting alongside [[Simon Katich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/engine/current/match/345972.html|title=Scorecard: England v Australia, 3rd Test at Edgbaston, 30 July\u20133 August 2009|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>  He scored his second highest Test score of 96 against the West Indies in the Second Test in Adelaide in December 2009. He and Katich put on a century stand and he had reached 96 at stumps, only to inside edge his first ball of the next morning onto his stumps while attempting to hit a boundary to reach his century. In the Third Test, he made 89 in another century stand with Katich. In the second innings, he removed opposition captain Chris Gayle and then charged towards him, screaming in celebration directly in front of him. This earned him a fine from the match referee, and considerable criticism from much of the Australian public. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn the First Test against Pakistan, he made 93 runs on Boxing Day and featured in his third century stand in as many matches with Katich, but was run out after a mix-up with Katich in which both players ended up running towards the same end, again falling short of his debut Test hundred. On Day four, Watson finally made his first Test hundred, which came in interesting style, by hitting the ball hard to the fielder at point who put the catch down. When Ponting declared, he remained not out on 120.  Watson was awarded man of the match on 30 December for his role in Australia's Test victory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn the second innings of the Second Test at the SCG, Watson fell short of another century, dismissed for 97.

He has also played for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in the English [[County Championship]] in 2005. He regards [[Terry Alderman]] as one of his mentors. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==International career==\n===2002\u20132009===\nWatson was selected for his first Australian team in early 2002, being selected to tour [[South Africa]] with the Test team after topping the [[Pura Cup]] wicket-taking charts for [[Tasmania]], as well as steady middle-order batting performances. Watson did make his ODI debut on tour, replacing [[Steve Waugh]], who was sacked after the team failed to make the ODI finals in the preceding Australian summer. Watson continued as a regular member of the ODI team until he suffered three stress fractures in his back,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} at the start of 2003, missing the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. He was replaced by his Queensland teammate [[Andrew Symonds]], who proceeded to establish his position as the all rounder after scoring 143* and 91* during the tournament.\n\nWatson returned to regular ODI duty in the 2004\u201305 season, as a bowling all rounder. He also made his test debut in the Third Test against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] as the fifth bowler, in order to allow Australia to play two spinners and three pace bowlers on a dry [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] pitch.\n\nAustralian selectors included Watson as the fifth bowler and all rounder in all Test matches following the [[2005 Ashes series]]. Watson played against the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the role, but he dislocated his shoulder in just his second Test in that designated role against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], after diving to field a ball. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Watson was again replaced by Symonds and was unable to represent Australia for the remainder of the summer.\n\n[[File:Shane Watson 2009 fielding.jpg|thumb|Shane Watson in 2009]]\nThis changed when Watson opened the batting for Australia at the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]], alongside wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist, instead of [[Simon Katich]].  After failing in the first two matches against the [[West Indies]] and [[England]], Watson made a 50 in Australia's victory over [[India]], which sealed their place in the semi-finals, he then took 2 wickets and scored 57 not out in the finals to seal the win. In the [[2009 ICC Champions Trophy]] held in [[South Africa]], Watson again played a prominent role, making two consecutive 100s against [[England]] and [[New Zealand]] in semi-final and final, helping [[Australia]] to defend their title.\n\nWatson was named in the squad for the [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]] against England. However, he came off the ground in a one-day domestic game the week before the first Test with a suspected hamstring tear,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} which ruled him out for the first three Tests. [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] was called up in Watson's place, and responded with a half-century, and then a century to cement Clarke's place in the team.\n\nWatson was expected to be fit for the fourth Test on Boxing Day and the [[MCG]] in Melbourne, and because of [[Damien Martyn]]'s unexpected retirement, it looked likely that Watson would be included in the side. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, another injury setback in a match for Queensland ruled Watson out for the rest of the Ashes series. Watson eventually returned in February to the ODI side, replacing [[Cameron White]] in the all rounder position, However he again broke down with injury during the 29th match of [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] and missed two matches of the Super 8's before returning in fine style scoring an unbeaten 65 off 32 balls against New Zealand. Injury again struck Watson in the early stages of the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] as he missed most of the tournament due to [[hamstring]] strain. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} He was then out of action for the 2007\u201308 Australian season.\n\nAfter Symonds was omitted from the Australian team for disciplinary reasons, and Watson took the all rounder's position for the tour of India in late 2008, batting at No. 6. During the Third Test in Delhi, he was involved in a series of confrontations with Indian opener [[Gautam Gambhir]], who scored a double century and reached his century by lofting Watson over midwicket for six. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAfter returning to Australia, Symonds was recalled to the Test team and both all rounders played in the First Test against New Zealand in Brisbane. As the pitch was a green, rain-affected moist surface expected to favour seamers, spinner [[Jason Krejza]] was dropped to accommodate two seam bowling all rounders. After the match, which Australia won, Watson was dropped as spinner [[Nathan Hauritz]] was included and Symonds retained. Symonds continued to perform poorly, and there were calls for Watson to take his place,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} but both men then fell injured at the end of the year, Watson with a stress fracture. Watson returned to international duty in the ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE, scoring a century.\n[[File:Shane Watson 2013.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Shane Watson plays a cut shot.]]\n\nHe returned to the Australian Test side for the 3rd Ashes Test match at Edgbaston on 30 July 2009 as an opener. In a rain interrupted match he made 62 and 53 batting alongside [[Simon Katich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/engine/current/match/345972.html|title=Scorecard: England v Australia, 3rd Test at Edgbaston, 30 July\u20133 August 2009|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>  He scored his second highest Test score of 96 against the West Indies in the Second Test in Adelaide in December 2009. He and Katich put on a century stand and he had reached 96 at stumps, only to inside edge his first ball of the next morning onto his stumps while attempting to hit a boundary to reach his century. In the Third Test, he made 89 in another century stand with Katich. In the second innings, he removed opposition captain Chris Gayle and then charged towards him, screaming in celebration directly in front of him. This earned him a fine from the match referee, and considerable criticism from much of the Australian public. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn the First Test against Pakistan, he made 93 runs on Boxing Day and featured in his third century stand in as many matches with Katich, but was run out after a mix-up with Katich in which both players ended up running towards the same end, again falling short of his debut Test hundred. On Day four, Watson finally made his first Test hundred, which came in interesting style, by hitting the ball hard to the fielder at point who put the catch down. When Ponting declared, he remained not out on 120.  Watson was awarded man of the match on 30 December for his role in Australia's Test victory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn the second innings of the Second Test at the SCG, Watson fell short of another century, dismissed for 97. During this Test, the Australian Cricket Media Association presented Watson with Australian Cricketer of the Year Award.<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/01/10/watson-named-australias-best-by-the-media/ Watson named Australia's best by the media], The Roar, Retrieved on 11 January 2010</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132019===\nIn the first test of Australia's 2010 tour of India, Watson opened his account with his second test century \u2013 an attritional 126 runs off 338 balls on a slow, low Mohali pitch.

As narrated by [[Don Pardo]] (the announcer):\n<blockquote>... the Land Shark is considered the cleverest of all sharks. Unlike the [[Great White shark]], which tends to inhabit the waters and harbors of recreational beach areas, the Land Shark may strike at any place, any time. It is capable of disguising its voice, and generally preys on young, single women.</blockquote>\n\nThe sketch depicted the Land Shark (voiced by [[Chevy Chase]]) attacking several people after knocking on their doors, pretending to be repairmen, door-to-door salesmen, and the like. Once the intended victim opens the door, the Land Shark quickly enters and swallows them. The sketch is typified by the following exchange:<ref>[http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75djaws2.phtml ''SNL'' transcripts, Season 1, Episode 4]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[Scene: Interior.

In it, Miranda is an officer of the pro-human group Cerberus, first appearing in the 2009 iOS game ''[[Mass Effect Galaxy]]'',  and then serving as a squadmate in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' comic series, in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' (provided the player does not import a save where she dies), and in issues 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the ''Mass Effect: Foundation'' comic series.

However, various sources criticized the game's numerous camera shots of her buttocks, something BioWare marketing director, David Silverman has defended as an integral part of her character. \n\n==Character overview==\nIn ''Mass Effect 2'', Miranda Lawson is revealed to be a high-ranking operative of the pro-human organization Cerberus, and has been genetically designed for superior intelligence and physical traits. She is shown to be a capable leader, exemplified with her being one of the few members of the squad who can successfully lead a [[fireteam]] in the final mission without anyone dying, despite feeling she does not [[charisma|command respect]] like Shepard does. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving [[Commander Shepard]]. Aboard the ''Normandy'', the player's spaceship, she is Shepard's second-in-command and [[Executive Officer]], and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man.\n\nMiranda was the [[Genetically modified organism|artificially created daughter]] of Henry Lawson, a rich and powerful businessman from Earth. Rather than give her a human mother to randomize her genetic code, Henry took his own [[DNA]] and doubled his [[X chromosome]], hoping to create a dynasty. Unhappy with his attempts to exert control over her life, Miranda joined Cerberus and secretly sent her sister, who was created in the same way she was, into hiding to protect her from their father. Provided the player completes a mission to prevent her sister's abduction, she ultimately becomes loyal to Shepard. In one of the story's possible endings, she proves her loyalty when the Illusive Man gives her an order to prevent Shepard from destroying the Collectors' Space Station by refusing and announcing her resignation before ending the communication abruptly.\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:Yvonne strahovski (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Yvonne Strahovski]] at [[WonderCon]] 2009.]]\n\nHumanity's iteration in ''Mass Effect'' is meant to be only fairly far in the future enough to be \"new but not unrecognisable\".<ref name=\"Bonus\"/> Through standardizing the different concept art for their clothes, a \"common visual language\" was found for them.<ref name=\"Artbook\"/> Early concept art for Miranda focused on balancing her sex appeal with a uniform suitable for her position as a Cerberus officer.<ref name=\"Artbook\"/> Originally conceived as blonde, after her uniform was designed, it was decided black hair would fit better with her \"[[femme fatale]]\" look.<ref name=\"Digital Art\">''Mass Effect 2'' Digital Art Book.</ref> [[Casey Hudson]] has said her uniform was made tight due to her being designed to be \"perfect\" and \"beautiful\".<ref name=\"Behind\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5511913/the-thoughts-behind-mirandas-behind-in-mass-effect-2 |title=The Thoughts Behind Miranda's Behind in Mass Effect 2 |last=John |first=Tracey |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref> For her role as Miranda Lawson, [[Yvonne Strahovski]] spoke in her natural speaking voice and native [[Australian accent]].<ref name=\"Celebrities\"/>\n\nMiranda is an example of a character who is defined by their attractiveness. In ''Mass Effect 2'', camera angles and shots such as a close-up of her buttocks were employed to focus on \"her curves and sexuality\", identified as key parts of her character, her being someone genetically engineered to be \"perfect\".<ref name=\"Behind\"/><ref name=\"Sexuality\"/> David Kates composed Miranda's musical theme, intending to \"demonstrate her strength, but also her vulnerable side, and a sadness that is deep inside her\".<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===Mass Effect 2===\nMiranda is one of Shepard's squad members in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. She's one of the top agents of the pro-human organization Cerberus, assigned to supervise the \"Lazarus Project\", which was the project that brought Shepard back to life. When Shepard's sent by Cerberus' leader, the Illusive Man, to stop the main antagonists, the Collectors, Miranda joins as the new ''Normandy''{{'}}s executive officer, giving mission reports to the Illusive Man. Through conversations with her, Shepard learns of Miranda's background. She tells Shepard that she was genetically \"created\" by her father, Henry Lawson, who is one of the wealthiest humans in the galaxy. She tells Shepard that she was created to be the genetically \"perfect\" human, able to heal from injuries more quickly, and with more powerful biotic abilities<ref name=\"Biotics\"/>, as well as exceptional schooling, all as part of her father's desire to have a \"dynasty\" to follow him. Her father's persistence in making Miranda as \"perfect\" as possible resulted in her not having a normal childhood, forbidden from having any friends or relations with anybody else, and forced to enhance her abilities constantly. At an old enough age, Miranda was able to escape from her father, hinting that \"shots were fired\", and fled to Cerberus, who she had learned her father was an investor to. Cerberus gave her asylum, and her father cut off his support of Cerberus.\n\nLater on in the game, Miranda asks Shepard for help to save her sister. She reveals that her father, after Miranda had escaped from him, created another daughter, Miranda's genetic twin sister, Oriana. Miranda was able to rescue Oriana, taking her from her father and giving her to another family to have a normal life. She tells Shepard that her father has been able to track Oriana down and has hired mercenaries to apprehend her. Miranda has arranged for Cerberus to safely move Oriana and her family away but needs Shepard's help. If Shepard helps, Miranda learns that the only friend she ever had or trusted, Niket, had betrayed her and is working with the mercenaries to take Oriana away. The following confrontation leaves the captain of the mercenaries dead as well as Niket, who, depending on Shepard's actions, is killed either by Miranda herself or by the mercenary captain. Afterward, Miranda sees Oriana with her family, and if Shepard convinces her, goes and meets Oriana, introducing herself to her.\n\nAfterward, if Shepard converses with Miranda more, she admits to Shepard that even though she's supposed to be perfect, she feels that everything she had done is the result of her father genetic tailoring of her, not because of her actions. Shepard can convince her that she gives her father too much credit, saying that while he did give Miranda her abilities and gifts, everything she has accomplished is the result of her using those abilities that she had been given. This seems to reassure Miranda and she thanks Shepard for it.\n\nDuring the \"Suicide Mission\", Miranda can survive or die depending on the player's choices in the mission and also if they do Miranda's loyalty mission. If the player uses a male Shepard character, they can pursue Miranda as a possible romance.<ref name=\"ME2 Romance\"/>\n\n===Mass Effect 3===\nMiranda returns in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' if she survived the events of the suicide mission in ''Mass Effect 2''. After defeating the Collectors, she has left Cerberus. Given she was a high-ranking Cerberus officer, she indicated the Illusive Man ordered a hit on her, causing her to go on the run. Shepard meets Miranda on the Citadel, where she expresses her concerns that Oriana was found by her father. After a brief contact with Miranda, where she expresses concern that her father is working with the Illusive Man, she asks Shepard to meet her on the Citadel, where she asks Shepard for access to Alliance resources, though she won't say why even if Shepard presses her. If Shepard refuses her access, she accepts Shepard's choice and leaves. If Shepard grants her access, she then confesses that when she had headed the Lazarus Project to revive Shepard, she wanted to put a control chip in Shepard's brain, to ensure Shepard wouldn't go rogue, but the Illusive Man, not wanting to take away who Shepard was, ordered her not to. Miranda admits that she was hypocritical in this since she had been doing everything she could to keep her father from controlling her life and Oriana's. Shepard can forgive her, saying that the main point is that she brought him back.\n\nLater, Shepard finds Miranda in a Cerberus lab disguised as a refugee camp, Sanctuary, where her father had been running experiments on the refugees, as well as her father and Oriana. If Shepard is able to negotiate with Henry to let Oriana go, Miranda then kills him with a biotic attack. If Shepard is unable to negotiate, Miranda will still attack her father to save Oriana, and while she will kill him, he will fatally shoot her in the process. Miranda's fate also depends on if Shepard had warned her earlier on about the Cerberus assassin Kai Leng, who Miranda encounters on Sanctuary. If Shepard didn't warn her, or refused her access to Alliance resources, or didn't do her loyalty mission in ''Mass Effect 2'', Miranda will die. She'll also die if she was romanced by a male Shepard in ''Mass Effect 2'', but then breaks up with her in ''Mass Effect 3''. If Shepard had completed Miranda's loyalty mission, as well as warned her of Kai Leng, Miranda survives and, after taking Oriana to safety, assists in the war effort.\n\nLike other past and present surviving squad members, Miranda makes an appearance in the ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel]]''  downloadable content pack, which adds character moments which will vary in content depending on dialogue and event choices or whether Shepard is in a romance with her. Miranda is also available as a temporary squadmate in the Armax Arsenal Arena combat simulator.\n\n===In other media===\nMiranda first appeared in the [[iOS]] game ''[[Mass Effect Galaxy]]'', released in 2009. In ''Galaxy'', Miranda communicates with Jacob Taylor as a hologram and is his main informant on how to stop the batarian threat\n\nMiranda returns in the 2009 comic book series ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'', where she first encounters Liara T'Soni and Feron on Omega, offering to help them recover the lost Commander Shepard. After meeting Liara with the Illusive Man, she then takes Liara and Feron back to Omega, telling them that Shepard's body is still on the station and instructs them to recover it, with Cerberus reimbursing them for their efforts. Later, when the Shadow Broker's agent Tazzik makes off with Shepard's body to sell to the Collectors, Miranda asks the Illusive Man for permission to stop him, but the Illusive Man tells her to wait, saying that they need to find out why the Collectors are interested in Shepard. Miranda then notices Feron and Liara giving pursuit and asks to follow them, but the Illusive Man once again tells her to wait. At the end of the series, when Liara rescues Shepard's body and brings it to a Cerberus facility, Miranda tells Liara that she has doubts on whether or not Shepard can be revived, but assures her that if it's possible to bring Shepard back, Cerberus will do all they can.\n\nMiranda is also a major supporting character in the ''Mass Effect: Foundation'' comic series, a prequel to the original ''Mass Effect'' trilogy and stars the main antagonist of the ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel]]'' DLC Maya Brooks as a [[Narration#Narrative_point_of_view|point of view character]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Miranda Lawson butt shot.png|thumb|An example shot when Shepard (''right'') talks to Miranda, which criticism fell on. Marketing director David Silverman defended the shots, believing \"her curves and sexuality\" to be key aspects of her character.<ref name=\"Sexuality\"/>]]\n\nMiranda received a mostly positive reception. BioWare revealed that Miranda's loyalty mission, which had a more \"a touchy-feely\" plot, was completed more than [[List_of_Mass_Effect_characters#Grunt|Grunt's]] on PC, but in the case of [[Xbox 360]] players it was the opposite.<ref name=\"360 Grunt\"/> Strahovski was nominated for \"Best Performance by a Human Female\" in the [[Spike Video Game Awards]].<ref name=\"Spike\"/> Upon hearing news for a potential ''Mass Effect'' film, Dan Ryckert of ''[[Game Informer]]'' looked at the different characters and felt Strahovski should reprise the role, calling her the \"obvious choice\".<ref name=\"Casting Call\"/>  A reader's poll published by ''PC Gamer'' in 2015 revealed that Miranda is the second most popular love interest for Shepard after [[Liara T'Soni]] in the ''Mass Effect'' series.<ref name=\"Poll2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ranking-the-best-and-worst-of-the-mass-effect-games/|title=Ranking the best and worst of the Mass Effect games |author=Tyler Wilde|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>In a 2016 article, ''PC Gamer'' ranked Miranda the eighth best companion of the ''Mass Effect'' series.

However, various sources criticized the game's numerous camera shots of her buttocks, something BioWare marketing director, David Silverman has defended as an integral part of her character. \n\n==Character overview==\nIn ''Mass Effect 2'', Miranda Lawson is revealed to be a high-ranking operative of the pro-human organization Cerberus, and has been genetically designed for superior intelligence and physical traits. She is shown to be a capable leader, exemplified with her being one of the few members of the squad who can successfully lead a [[fireteam]] in the final mission without anyone dying, despite feeling she does not [[charisma|command respect]] like Shepard does. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving [[Commander Shepard]]. Aboard the ''Normandy'', the player's spaceship, she is Shepard's second-in-command and [[Executive Officer]], and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man.\n\nMiranda was the [[Genetically modified organism|artificially created daughter]] of Henry Lawson, a rich and powerful businessman from Earth. Rather than give her a human mother to randomize her genetic code, Henry took his own [[DNA]] and doubled his [[X chromosome]], hoping to create a dynasty. Unhappy with his attempts to exert control over her life, Miranda joined Cerberus and secretly sent her sister, who was created in the same way she was, into hiding to protect her from their father. Provided the player completes a mission to prevent her sister's abduction, she ultimately becomes loyal to Shepard. In one of the story's possible endings, she proves her loyalty when the Illusive Man gives her an order to prevent Shepard from destroying the Collectors' Space Station by refusing and announcing her resignation before ending the communication abruptly.\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:Yvonne strahovski (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Yvonne Strahovski]] at [[WonderCon]] 2009.]]\n\nHumanity's iteration in ''Mass Effect'' is meant to be only fairly far in the future enough to be \"new but not unrecognisable\".<ref name=\"Bonus\"/> Through standardizing the different concept art for their clothes, a \"common visual language\" was found for them.<ref name=\"Artbook\"/> Early concept art for Miranda focused on balancing her sex appeal with a uniform suitable for her position as a Cerberus officer.<ref name=\"Artbook\"/> Originally conceived as blonde, after her uniform was designed, it was decided black hair would fit better with her \"[[femme fatale]]\" look.<ref name=\"Digital Art\">''Mass Effect 2'' Digital Art Book.</ref> [[Casey Hudson]] has said her uniform was made tight due to her being designed to be \"perfect\" and \"beautiful\".<ref name=\"Behind\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5511913/the-thoughts-behind-mirandas-behind-in-mass-effect-2 |title=The Thoughts Behind Miranda's Behind in Mass Effect 2 |last=John |first=Tracey |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref> For her role as Miranda Lawson, [[Yvonne Strahovski]] spoke in her natural speaking voice and native [[Australian accent]].<ref name=\"Celebrities\"/>\n\nMiranda is an example of a character who is defined by their attractiveness. In ''Mass Effect 2'', camera angles and shots such as a close-up of her buttocks were employed to focus on \"her curves and sexuality\", identified as key parts of her character, her being someone genetically engineered to be \"perfect\".<ref name=\"Behind\"/><ref name=\"Sexuality\"/> David Kates composed Miranda's musical theme, intending to \"demonstrate her strength, but also her vulnerable side, and a sadness that is deep inside her\".<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===Mass Effect 2===\nMiranda is one of Shepard's squad members in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. She's one of the top agents of the pro-human organization Cerberus, assigned to supervise the \"Lazarus Project\", which was the project that brought Shepard back to life. When Shepard's sent by Cerberus' leader, the Illusive Man, to stop the main antagonists, the Collectors, Miranda joins as the new ''Normandy''{{'}}s executive officer, giving mission reports to the Illusive Man. Through conversations with her, Shepard learns of Miranda's background. She tells Shepard that she was genetically \"created\" by her father, Henry Lawson, who is one of the wealthiest humans in the galaxy. She tells Shepard that she was created to be the genetically \"perfect\" human, able to heal from injuries more quickly, and with more powerful biotic abilities<ref name=\"Biotics\"/>, as well as exceptional schooling, all as part of her father's desire to have a \"dynasty\" to follow him. Her father's persistence in making Miranda as \"perfect\" as possible resulted in her not having a normal childhood, forbidden from having any friends or relations with anybody else, and forced to enhance her abilities constantly. At an old enough age, Miranda was able to escape from her father, hinting that \"shots were fired\", and fled to Cerberus, who she had learned her father was an investor to. Cerberus gave her asylum, and her father cut off his support of Cerberus.\n\nLater on in the game, Miranda asks Shepard for help to save her sister. She reveals that her father, after Miranda had escaped from him, created another daughter, Miranda's genetic twin sister, Oriana. Miranda was able to rescue Oriana, taking her from her father and giving her to another family to have a normal life. She tells Shepard that her father has been able to track Oriana down and has hired mercenaries to apprehend her. Miranda has arranged for Cerberus to safely move Oriana and her family away but needs Shepard's help. If Shepard helps, Miranda learns that the only friend she ever had or trusted, Niket, had betrayed her and is working with the mercenaries to take Oriana away. The following confrontation leaves the captain of the mercenaries dead as well as Niket, who, depending on Shepard's actions, is killed either by Miranda herself or by the mercenary captain. Afterward, Miranda sees Oriana with her family, and if Shepard convinces her, goes and meets Oriana, introducing herself to her.\n\nAfterward, if Shepard converses with Miranda more, she admits to Shepard that even though she's supposed to be perfect, she feels that everything she had done is the result of her father genetic tailoring of her, not because of her actions. Shepard can convince her that she gives her father too much credit, saying that while he did give Miranda her abilities and gifts, everything she has accomplished is the result of her using those abilities that she had been given. This seems to reassure Miranda and she thanks Shepard for it.\n\nDuring the \"Suicide Mission\", Miranda can survive or die depending on the player's choices in the mission and also if they do Miranda's loyalty mission. If the player uses a male Shepard character, they can pursue Miranda as a possible romance.<ref name=\"ME2 Romance\"/>\n\n===Mass Effect 3===\nMiranda returns in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' if she survived the events of the suicide mission in ''Mass Effect 2''. After defeating the Collectors, she has left Cerberus. Given she was a high-ranking Cerberus officer, she indicated the Illusive Man ordered a hit on her, causing her to go on the run. Shepard meets Miranda on the Citadel, where she expresses her concerns that Oriana was found by her father. After a brief contact with Miranda, where she expresses concern that her father is working with the Illusive Man, she asks Shepard to meet her on the Citadel, where she asks Shepard for access to Alliance resources, though she won't say why even if Shepard presses her. If Shepard refuses her access, she accepts Shepard's choice and leaves. If Shepard grants her access, she then confesses that when she had headed the Lazarus Project to revive Shepard, she wanted to put a control chip in Shepard's brain, to ensure Shepard wouldn't go rogue, but the Illusive Man, not wanting to take away who Shepard was, ordered her not to. Miranda admits that she was hypocritical in this since she had been doing everything she could to keep her father from controlling her life and Oriana's. Shepard can forgive her, saying that the main point is that she brought him back.\n\nLater, Shepard finds Miranda in a Cerberus lab disguised as a refugee camp, Sanctuary, where her father had been running experiments on the refugees, as well as her father and Oriana. If Shepard is able to negotiate with Henry to let Oriana go, Miranda then kills him with a biotic attack. If Shepard is unable to negotiate, Miranda will still attack her father to save Oriana, and while she will kill him, he will fatally shoot her in the process. Miranda's fate also depends on if Shepard had warned her earlier on about the Cerberus assassin Kai Leng, who Miranda encounters on Sanctuary. If Shepard didn't warn her, or refused her access to Alliance resources, or didn't do her loyalty mission in ''Mass Effect 2'', Miranda will die. She'll also die if she was romanced by a male Shepard in ''Mass Effect 2'', but then breaks up with her in ''Mass Effect 3''. If Shepard had completed Miranda's loyalty mission, as well as warned her of Kai Leng, Miranda survives and, after taking Oriana to safety, assists in the war effort.\n\nLike other past and present surviving squad members, Miranda makes an appearance in the ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel]]''  downloadable content pack, which adds character moments which will vary in content depending on dialogue and event choices or whether Shepard is in a romance with her. Miranda is also available as a temporary squadmate in the Armax Arsenal Arena combat simulator.\n\n===In other media===\nMiranda first appeared in the [[iOS]] game ''[[Mass Effect Galaxy]]'', released in 2009. In ''Galaxy'', Miranda communicates with Jacob Taylor as a hologram and is his main informant on how to stop the batarian threat\n\nMiranda returns in the 2009 comic book series ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'', where she first encounters Liara T'Soni and Feron on Omega, offering to help them recover the lost Commander Shepard. After meeting Liara with the Illusive Man, she then takes Liara and Feron back to Omega, telling them that Shepard's body is still on the station and instructs them to recover it, with Cerberus reimbursing them for their efforts. Later, when the Shadow Broker's agent Tazzik makes off with Shepard's body to sell to the Collectors, Miranda asks the Illusive Man for permission to stop him, but the Illusive Man tells her to wait, saying that they need to find out why the Collectors are interested in Shepard. Miranda then notices Feron and Liara giving pursuit and asks to follow them, but the Illusive Man once again tells her to wait. At the end of the series, when Liara rescues Shepard's body and brings it to a Cerberus facility, Miranda tells Liara that she has doubts on whether or not Shepard can be revived, but assures her that if it's possible to bring Shepard back, Cerberus will do all they can.\n\nMiranda is also a major supporting character in the ''Mass Effect: Foundation'' comic series, a prequel to the original ''Mass Effect'' trilogy and stars the main antagonist of the ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel]]'' DLC Maya Brooks as a [[Narration#Narrative_point_of_view|point of view character]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Miranda Lawson butt shot.png|thumb|An example shot when Shepard (''right'') talks to Miranda, which criticism fell on. Marketing director David Silverman defended the shots, believing \"her curves and sexuality\" to be key aspects of her character.<ref name=\"Sexuality\"/>]]\n\nMiranda received a mostly positive reception. BioWare revealed that Miranda's loyalty mission, which had a more \"a touchy-feely\" plot, was completed more than [[List_of_Mass_Effect_characters#Grunt|Grunt's]] on PC, but in the case of [[Xbox 360]] players it was the opposite.<ref name=\"360 Grunt\"/> Strahovski was nominated for \"Best Performance by a Human Female\" in the [[Spike Video Game Awards]].<ref name=\"Spike\"/> Upon hearing news for a potential ''Mass Effect'' film, Dan Ryckert of ''[[Game Informer]]'' looked at the different characters and felt Strahovski should reprise the role, calling her the \"obvious choice\".<ref name=\"Casting Call\"/>  A reader's poll published by ''PC Gamer'' in 2015 revealed that Miranda is the second most popular love interest for Shepard after [[Liara T'Soni]] in the ''Mass Effect'' series.<ref name=\"Poll2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ranking-the-best-and-worst-of-the-mass-effect-games/|title=Ranking the best and worst of the Mass Effect games |author=Tyler Wilde|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>In a 2016 article, ''PC Gamer'' ranked Miranda the eighth best companion of the ''Mass Effect'' series.

His interest in following his father's career were thwarted by the latter, who sent him to [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]] in 1776, then placed him in a London apprenticeship with a linen draper, but young John ran away at the age of eighteen and joined Charles Mates' theatrical company at [[Margate]].  Appearing under the name of Foote, he debuted as Courtall in ''[[The Belle's Stratagem]]''.  He then went to Tunbridge Wells, billed under his own name, and was recommended to [[Tate Wilkinson]], whose York company Fawcett then joined, first appearing 24 May 1787.  Though viewed as having promise, he proved a minor disappointment in dramatic roles but found success in comedic parts.  On 5 May 1788, he married actress Susan Moore, who had previously been in a long-term relationship with recently-deceased fellow company member, John Mills, by whom she had several children including actress Rosamund Charles Mills, later wife of violinist [[John David Loder]].\n\nIn 1791, he left the York circuit for [[Covent Garden]], first appearing as Caleb in ''He Wou'd Be a Soldier'' in September, becoming a London mainstay, also appearing at [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]] from 1794.  There, manager [[George Colman the younger|George Colman]] wrote roles specifically for him, and named him stage manager in 1799 before a dispute caused his departure in 1802, but he returned again six years later.  He also had disputes with Covent Garden manager [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]].  During off-seasons he also appeared with provincial theatres, including at Ashburne, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Richmond.\n\nHis wife Susan died in 1797, and though a rumoured engagement in 1799 to actress Biggs came to nought, he married in 1806 to another actress, Anne Gaudry, daughter of actor Joseph Gaudry.  He served as stage manager at Covent Garden from about 1818 but after the 1828 season was removed, and shortly thereafter announced his intention to leave the stage, which he did in 1830.  He retired to Botley, Hampshire, where he spearheaded a campaign to build a new church, in which he would be the first buried following his death, 13 March 1837, his will leaving his property to his widow Anne and son.  He had several children by Anne Gaudry, including Rev. John Turner Colman Fawcett (1804-1867), and Robert Henry Harris Fawcett (1805-1859) of the 18th Regiment and the Bengal Civil Service.\n\nAs his career progressed Fawcett became effective in playing a range of characters, being particularly remembered as Dr. Pangloss in ''[[The Heir at Law]]'' (1797) and Dr. Ollapod in ''The Poor Gentleman'' (1798).  He also authored several pantomimes.\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|noprescript=1|wstitle=Fawcett, John|volume=10|page=217}}\n*Highfill, Philip H., Burnim, Kalman A., and Langhans, Edward A., eds.

His interest in following his father's career were thwarted by the latter, who sent him to [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]] in 1776, then placed him in a London apprenticeship with a linen draper, but young John ran away at the age of eighteen and joined Charles Mates' theatrical company at [[Margate]].  Appearing under the name of Foote, he debuted as Courtall in ''[[The Belle's Stratagem]]''.  He then went to Tunbridge Wells, billed under his own name, and was recommended to [[Tate Wilkinson]], whose York company Fawcett then joined, first appearing 24 May 1787.  Though viewed as having promise, he proved a minor disappointment in dramatic roles but found success in comedic parts.  On 5 May 1788, he married actress Susan Moore, who had previously been in a long-term relationship with recently-deceased fellow company member, John Mills, by whom she had several children including actress Rosamund Charles Mills, later wife of violinist [[John David Loder]].\n\nIn 1791, he left the York circuit for [[Covent Garden]], first appearing as Caleb in ''He Wou'd Be a Soldier'' in September, becoming a London mainstay, also appearing at [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]] from 1794.  There, manager [[George Colman the younger|George Colman]] wrote roles specifically for him, and named him stage manager in 1799 before a dispute caused his departure in 1802, but he returned again six years later.  He also had disputes with Covent Garden manager [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]].  During off-seasons he also appeared with provincial theatres, including at Ashburne, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Richmond.  \n\nHis wife Susan died in 1797, and though a rumoured engagement in 1799 to actress Biggs came to nought, he married in 1806 to another actress, Anne Gaudry, daughter of actor Joseph Gaudry.  He served as stage manager at Covent Garden from about 1818 but after the 1828 season was removed, and shortly thereafter announced his intention to leave the stage, which he did in 1830.  He retired to Botley, Hampshire, where he spearheaded a campaign to build a new church, in which he would be the first buried following his death, 13 March 1837, his will leaving his property to his widow Anne and son.  He had several children by Anne Gaudry, including Rev. John Turner Colman Fawcett (1804-1867), and Robert Henry Harris Fawcett (1805-1859) of the 18th Regiment and the Bengal Civil Service.\n\nAs his career progressed Fawcett became effective in playing a range of characters, being particularly remembered as Dr. Pangloss in ''[[The Heir at Law]]'' (1797) and Dr. Ollapod in ''The Poor Gentleman'' (1798).  He also authored several pantomimes.\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|noprescript=1|wstitle=Fawcett, John|volume=10|page=217}}\n*Highfill, Philip H., Burnim, Kalman A., and Langhans, Edward A., eds.

(The A65 also starts in Leeds and runs parallel to, and south of, the A660.  It continues to [[Ilkley]], [[Skipton]], [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]] and [[Kendal]] as a main trans-[[Pennines|Pennine]] route.) The A660 is approximately {{Convert|10|mi|km|0}} long, and crosses the watershed from [[Airedale]] to lower [[Wharfedale]].  For most of its length the road is in the [[metropolitan district]] of the [[City of Leeds]];  the last {{convert|0.4|mi|km|1}} is in [[City of Bradford]] district.\n\n==Leeds city centre to Leeds Ring Road==\n\nThe A660 starts in [[Leeds city centre]], officially at the junction of Woodhouse Lane and Claypit Lane. The northbound carriageway passes [[Leeds Metropolitan University]]'s \"civic quarter\" campus, crosses the A58(M) ([[Leeds Inner Ring Road]]), which is in a cutting, and passes the [[University of Leeds]] with its landmark tower. The southbound carriageway is separated, at one stage by several terraced streets.  The carriageways combine before crossing [[Woodhouse Moor]] to [[Hyde Park, Leeds|Hyde Park]]. The road passes the buildings of [[Leeds Girls' High School]] and climbs to [[Headingley]], passing [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Headingley|St Michael's Church]] and many shops and bars including the [[Arndale Centres|Arndale Centre]]. Shortly after the church, a plaque shows the site of the original [[oak]] tree which gave its name to the [[Hundred (county subdivision)#Other terms|wapentake]] of [[Skyrack]] (\"Shire oak\"): this is reflected in two pub names and nearby ''Shire Oak Road''. The road continues through [[Far Headingley]] and [[West Park, Leeds|West Park]].\n\nThis stretch of the A660 was the route of the first [[Transport in Leeds#Former system|tram]] service in Leeds (to Far Headingley) and is still a major bus corridor, with several peak hour [[bus lane]]s. It suffers from high congestion, and there were historic plans to create a ''Headingley bypass''.

At [[Golden Acre Park]] the road crosses the [[Leeds Country Way]] footpath, which uses the underpass taking pedestrians from the car park to the park.  The road passes east of the main part of [[Bramhope]] village, and the next major intersection is the [[A658 road|A658]] [[Bradford]] to [[Harrogate]] road: ''Pool Bank'' is a steep hill leading north-east from this junction down to [[Pool-in-Wharfedale]].  The road skirts the northern slopes of [[The Chevin]] before bypassing [[Otley]] to the south along the line of the former ''Otley and Ilkley Joint Railway'' (opened 1865, closed 1967). At the end of the Otley bypass the road crosses the [[A6038 road|A6038]] (Otley to [[Bradford]]), and then follows the [[River Wharfe]] before joining the [[A65 road|A65]] at the roundabout at the start of the [[Burley-in-Wharfedale]] bypass.\n\nAbout {{convert|0.4|mi|km|1}} before its end, the road crosses into [[City of Bradford]] [[metropolitan district]], having been in the [[City of Leeds]] district for the rest of its length.

The Leeds-Otley Turnpike Trust was established in 1755, and improved the road from Leeds to Headingley and thence to Cookridge to join the existing road. There were toll bars in Woodhouse Lane and at Otley, and in 1775 a third toll house was built in Headingley village. In 1836 the trustees commissioned George Hayward to design a new route to bypass the steep slopes of The Chevin. The necessary Act of Parliament was passed in 1837, and the new stretch of road was opened in 1842, following today's route along the north side of the hill.
