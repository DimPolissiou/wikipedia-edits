If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that \"brand\" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people (e.g. [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Katy Perry]]). Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice.\n\nIn the modern era, the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the [[marketing]] and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand's identity, personality, product design, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |first=Bhimrao M|last=Ghodeswar|title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product & Brand Management |publisher=Emerald Publishing|location=Bingely, West Yorkshire, England|volume=17 |pages=4\u201312 |date=2008|doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 }}</ref> Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, hence branding is among a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].<ref>ranchhod, 2004</ref>\n\n[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|first=Kevin Lane|last=Keller|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|journal=Journal of Marketing|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|volume=57|issue=1|date=January 1, 1993|pages=1\u201322|jstor=1252054|doi=10.2307/1252054}}</ref> As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is built by the deployment of  marketing techniques to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.<ref name=\":0\"/> A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.<ref name=\":0\"/> When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors, a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.<ref name=\":1\"/> Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value.  [[Brand valuation]] is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.\n\nThe word \u2018brand\u2019 is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''[[commodity brand]]'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|date=1983|location=Springfield, Massachusetts}}</ref> Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock.

Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realize that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands.<ref>Arnold E. J. and Thompson C. J., \"Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research,\" Journal of Consumer Research,'' vol. 31, 2005, pp 868\u2013882</ref> By the 1880s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] with [[personality]] traits such as youthfulness, fun, sex appeal, luxury or the \"cool\" factor. This began the modern practice now known as ''branding'', where the consumers buy ''the brand'' instead of the product and rely on the brand name instead of a retailer's recommendation.\n\nThe process of giving a brand \"human\" characteristics represented, at least in part, a response to consumer concerns about mass-produced goods.<ref>Haig, M., ''Brand Failures: The truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time,'' London, Kogan-Page, 2005, p.3</ref> The [[Quaker Oats Company]] began using the image of the ''[[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker man]]'' in place of a trademark from the late 1870s, with great success.<ref>Petty, R.D., \"A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing,\" in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G.

A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a \"memory heuristic\": a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296</ref> For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.\n\nIt appears that a brand name and the relationship the consumer keep with the brand as a whole has evolved. From the simple product recognition process a brand name now holds a symbolic and social identification spectrum. [fournier 1998] For example, one can buy Nike because they want to be associated with the kind of people who wear Nike and with the values and attributes of that brand. More than a product it\u2019s a statement that one should seek to purchase by proxy of the brand [Belk 1988].\n\n===Corporate brand identity===\nThe brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}</ref><ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1 = Franzen\n| first1 = Giep\n| last2 = Moriarty\n| first2 = Sandra E.\n| orig-year = 2009\n| chapter = 1: The Brand as a System\n| title = The Science and Art of Branding\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mWSmBgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2015\n| page = 19\n| isbn = 9781317454670\n| access-date = 2016-08-16\n| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''.

(2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:\n\n# attributes\n# benefits\n# values\n# personality\n\nA brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.<ref name=\":2\" /> These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.<ref name=\":2\" /> If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a \"just do it\" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value. Even more extensive than its perceived values is a brand's '''personality'''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Quite literally, one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person.<ref name=\":2\" /> This form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining long-lasting relationships with consumers, as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand <ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639213 |title=INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATION (IMC) AND BRAND IDENTITY AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF BRAND EQUITY STRATEGY: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=34 |issue=4 |page=69 |year=2005 |last1=Madhavaram |first1=Sreedhar |last2=Badrinarayanan |first2=Vishag |last3=McDonald |first3=Robert E }}</ref> Collectively, all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish, and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Brand personality===\n\n'''Brand personality''' refers to \u201cthe set of human personality traits that are both applicable to and relevant for brands.\u201d <ref>Azoulay, A and  Kapferer, J.N., \"Do Brand Personality Scales Really Measure Brand Personality?\" ''Journal of Brand Management,'' Vol. 11, No. 2, 2003 p. 151</ref> Marketers and consumer researchers often argue that brands can be imbued with human-like characteristics which resonate with potential consumers.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610421011033467 |title=Impact of brand personality on three major relational consequences (trust, attachment, and commitment to the brand) |journal=Journal of Product & Brand Management |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=114 |year=2010 |last1=Louis |first1=Didier |last2=Lombart |first2=Cindy }}</ref> Such personality traits can assist marketers to create unique, brands that are differentiated from rival brands.

Marketers tend to treat brands as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price; rather brands represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer and are often treated as the total investment in brand building activities including marketing communications.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, pp  295\u201397</ref>\n\nConsumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic (see also [[#Brand promise|brand promise]]). From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.\n\n===Brand awareness===\n\n{{Main|Brand awareness}}\n[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos, and branded advertising. Brands help customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers & potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.\n\nBrand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing.

Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMarketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').<ref>Belch, G. E., & Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref> These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.\n\n* Most companies aim for \"'''Top-of-Mind'''\" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, \"Kleenex\", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.\n* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category\n* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.\n* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.\n\n===Brand recognition===\n\n'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.<ref name=\":5\" /> Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as a toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.<ref name=\":1\" /> Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5\u201315 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}</ref>\n\nBrand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology & Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263\u2013274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}</ref> In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.\n\nBrand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}</ref> For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's \"signature\" [[logo]]), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].\n\n=== Brand recall===\n\nUnlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.<ref name=\":5\" /> This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market. Thus, brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding [[touchpoint]]s have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Marketing mix modeling|Marketing-mix modeling]] can help [[marketing leader]]s optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales.

Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate \u2013 defines a touch point. According to Dahlen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the \"\u2026potential to add positive \u2013 or suppress negative \u2013 associations to the brand's equity\" <ref name=\":8\" /> Thus, a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.<ref name=\":9\" /> For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilizing the best communication channel is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].<ref name=\":2\" /> As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nBrand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Ebru|last1=Uzuno\u011flu |first2=Sema|last2=Misci Kip|title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |page=592 |date=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 }}</ref> One method of brand communication that companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM).

In this context, a \"brand name\" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through [[trademark registration]] \u2013 such trademarks are called \"Registered Trademarks\". Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].\n\n====Types of brand names====\nBrand names come in many styles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}</ref>\nA few include:\n* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as \"UPS\" or \"IBM\"\n* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as \"Whole Foods\" or \"Toys R' Us\"\n* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as \"Reese's Pieces\" or \"[[Dunkin' Donuts]]\"\n* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as \"Amazon\" or \"Crest\"\n* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as \"[[Wii]]\" or \"[[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]]\"\n* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as \"[[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]\" or \"[[Samsung]]\"\n* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as \"[[Hewlett-Packard]]\", \"[[Dell]]\", \"[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]\", \"Stussy\" or \"Mars\"\n* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as \"[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]\" or \"[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]\"\n* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|\"Nike\"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as \"[[Betty Crocker]]\"\n* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as \"[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]\", \"Wok on Water\" or \"Eggs Eggscetera\"\n*'''[[portmanteau]]''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as \"[[Microsoft]]\" (\"microcomputer\" and \"software\"), \"[[Comcast]]\" (\"communications\" and \"broadcast\"), \"[[Evernote]]\" (\"forever\" and \"note\"), \"[[Vodafone]]\" (\"voice\", \"data\", \"telephone\")\n\nThe act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]\u2014which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word \"copy\".\n\n===Brand line===\nA brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].\n\n[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group <ref>{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}</ref> of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.\n\n===Brand identity===\n{{Main|Corporate identity}}\nThe expression of a brand \u2013 including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance \u2013 is brand identity.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\">{{cite book|first=Marty|last=Neumeier|title=The Dictionary of Brand|publisher=AIGA Center for Brand Experience |location=New York City|date=2004|isbn=978-1-884081-06-4|page=20}}</ref> Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand \u2013 and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\" /> The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.\n\nBrand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications, an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.\n\nThe brand identity works as a guideline, as the frame in which a brand will evolve and define itself, or in the words of David Aaker, \u201c\u2026a unique set of brand associations that the brand strategist aspires to create or maintain.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kapferer (2007), there are 6 facets to a brand\u2019s identity:\n\n* Physique: The physical characteristics and iconography of your brand ( such as the Nike swoosh or the orange pantone of easyJet).\n* Personality: The persona, how a brand communicates with their audience, which is expressed through its tone of voice, design assets and then integrates this into communication touchpoints in a coherent way.\n* Culture: The values,the principles on which a brand bases its behaviour. For example, Google flexible office hours and fun environment so the employees feel happy and creative at work.\n* Reflection: The \u201cstereotypical user\u201d of the brand. A brand is likely to be purchased by several buyer\u2019s profiles but they will have a go-to person that they use in their campaigns. For example Lou Yetu and the Parisian chic profile.\n* Relationship: The bond between a brand and its customers, and the customer expectations of the brand (the experience beyond the tangible product). Such as warranties or services during and after purchase help maintain a sustainable relationship and keep the consumer trust.\n\nSelf-image: How does one brand-customer portrays their ideal self \u2013 how they want to look and behave; what they aspire to \u2013 brands can target their messaging accordingly and make the brand\u2019s aspirations reflect theirs.\n\n====Visual brand identity====\n[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]\n\nA brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement \u2013 simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of \"Less is more\") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [[Paul Rand]] and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.\n\nColor is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Zena|last=O'Connor |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research & Application |volume=36 |date=December 10, 2010|doi=10.1002/col.20594|pages=55\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Brand trust===\nBrand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Journal of Brand Management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201358 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |url=https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/content_policy.pdf }}</ref> This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.\n\n''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of the action, behavior, communication, and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. The action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in transferring the trust experience to audiences who have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.\n\n===Brand parity===\nBrand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Paul S. |last1=Richardson|first2=Alan S. |last2=Dick |first3=Arun K.|last3=Jain |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |page=28 |date=October 1994 |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 }}</ref> This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.\n\n==Expanding role of brands==\nThe original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.\n\nToday, brands play a much bigger role. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shayna|last=Smilovitz|url= https://instapage.com/blog/emotional-marketing|title=Emotional Marketing Examples Scientifically Proven To Sway Buyers|website=Instapage|date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate= February 9, 2019 }}</ref> Cultural conflict over a brand's meaning has also influences the diffusion of an innovation.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Markus|last=Giesler|title=How Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=76|issue=6|pages=55\u201368|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=November 2012|doi=10.1509/jm.10.0406}}</ref>\n\n==Branding strategies==\n{{See|Brand management}}\n\n===Company name===\nOften, especially in the industrial sector, [[brand engineer]]s will promote a company's name.

A change in corporate naming may also have a role in seeking to shed an undesirable image: for example, [[Werner Erhard and Associates]] re-branded its activities as [[Landmark Education]] in 1991 at a time when publicity in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigative-report broadcast cast the [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] and [[Werner Erhard]] brands in a negative light,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= https://boingboing.net/2009/08/31/suppressed-60-minute.html\n |url-access=\n |title= Wikileaks re-publishes 60 Minutes piece on est/Landmark cult leader Werner Erhard\n |last= Jardin\n |first= Xeni\n |author-link= Xeni Jardin\n |date= 31 Aug 2009\n |publisher= Boing Boing\n |access-date= 28 Apr 2019\n |quote= Wikileaks has published the video and transcript of an investigative report into \"est\" (Erhard Seminars Training) guru and Landmark Education Forum godfather Werner Erhard by CBS News, originally broadcast on the program 60 Minutes on March 3, 1991. \n}}\n</ref>\nand [[Union Carbide India Limited]] became [[Eveready Industries India]] in 1994 subsequent to the [[Bhopal disaster]] of 1984\n\n===Individual branding===\n{{Main|Individual branding}}\nEach brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]])), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).\n\n===Challenger brands===\n{{main|Challenger brand}}\nA challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader nor a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset that sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.\n\n===Multiproduct branding strategy===\nMultiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all its products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  \nOther examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church & Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk-inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church & Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm & Hammer (brand)|Arm & Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. A multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.\n\n====Product line extension====\n{{main|Product line extension}}\nA product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.\n\n====Subbranding====\n{{main|Subbranding}}\nSubbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].\n\n====Brand extension====\n{{main|Brand extension}}\nBrand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.\n\n====Co-branding====\n{{main|Co-branding}}\nCo-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.\n\n===Multibranding strategy===\nMultibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head & Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].\n\nThis approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.\n\n====Fighting brands====\n{{main|Fighter brand}}\nThe main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.\n\n===Private branding strategy===\n\n{{main|Store brand}}\nPrivate branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.\n\n===Mixed branding strategy===\nMixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. \nFor example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the \"skin simple\" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.\n\n===Attitude branding and iconic brands===\nAttitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 1999 book ''[[No Logo]]'', [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a \"fetish strategy\".<ref name=\"nologo\">{{cite book|first=Naomi|last=Klein|authorlink=Naomi Klein|title=No Logo|publisher=Knopf Canada |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=1999|isbn=978-0-676-97282-5|page=141|title-link=No Logo}}</ref> Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben & Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' \u2013 brands that are able to gain and retain \"meaning beyond the material.\"<ref name=\"uber=brands\">{{cite book|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer|first2=JP|last2=Kuehlwein|title=Rethinking Prestige Branding \u2013 Secrets of the Ueber-Brands|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date= 2015|isbn=9780749470036|page=17}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A great brand raises the bar \u2013 it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. \u2013 [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:English & Hebrew Coke labels.jpg|thumb|alt=Bottles of Coca-Cola with labels printed in English and Hebrew|The color, letter font and style of the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke|Diet Coca-Cola]] [[logo]]s in [[English language|English]] were copied into matching [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] logos to maintain brand identity in Israel.]]\n\nIconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be \"identity brands\". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them \"iconic brands\". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.\n\nThere are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):\n# \"Necessary conditions\" \u2013 The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.\n# \"Myth-making\" \u2013 A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.\n# \"Cultural contradictions\" \u2013 Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.\n# \"The cultural brand management process\" \u2013 Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.\n\nSchaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:<ref name=\"uber=brands\"/>\n# \"Mission Incomparable\" \u2013 Having a differentiated and meaningful brand purpose beyond 'making money.'<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer |first2=J.|last2=Kuehlwein |title=Ueber-Branding: How modern prestige brands create meaning through mission and myth \u2013 Part 1 |journal=Journal of Brand Strategy |publisher=Henry Stewart Publications|location=London, England|volume=5 |issue=4 |date=26 June 2016|pages=395\u2013409 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/jbs/2017/00000005/00000004/art00006 }}</ref>  Setting rules that follow this purpose \u2013 even when it violates the mass marketing mantra of \"Consumer is always Boss/right\".\n# \"Longing versus Belonging\" \u2013 Playing with the opposing desires of people for Inclusion on the one hand and Exclusivity on the other. \n# \"Un-Selling\" \u2013 First and foremost seeking to seduce through pride and provocation, rather than to sell through arguments.<ref>Kuehlwein, JP.

Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means \"No label\" in English (from \u7121\u5370\u826f\u54c1 \u2013 \"Mujirushi Ryohin\" \u2013 literally, \"No brand quality goods\"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no-name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Heig, Matt.

It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.\n\n==={{anchor|derivative}} Derived brands<!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] -->===\n\n{{See|Derived demand}}\nIn this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) \"[[Intel Inside]]\".\n\n===Brand extension and brand dilution===\n\n{{See|brand extension}}\nThe existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;\nfor example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.\n\nMars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.\n\nThere is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.\nWhen [[Coca-Cola]] launched \"Diet Coke\" and \"Cherry Coke\", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.\n\nThe risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Social media brands===\nIn ''The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy'' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. \"We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us \u2013 but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see.\"<ref name=\"Media Democracy\">{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Pont|title=The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date=2013|isbn=978-0749466213}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-brands===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\nAlternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the shares of the market which will, in any case, go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as a multi-brand strategy.\n\nIndividual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what\nbusiness the company is in or diluting higher quality products.\n\n[[Procter & Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of \"facings\" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate\u2014from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).\n\n[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.\n\n===Private labels===\n\n{{See|Private label}}\n[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks & Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this \"own brand\" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.\n\n'''Designer Private Labels'''\n\nA relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer's budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.\n\nIn Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and \u2018L\u2019 for Lisa Ho.<ref>Schetzer, A., \"Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html</ref> Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers \u2018Collette\u2019 for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.<ref>Roy Morgan Research,\"Private Label Could be the New Black\" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337</ref> Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her \u201cPetites\u2019 range.<ref>Roy Morgan Research, \"Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion,\" Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520</ref> Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frame designed by Peter Morrissey.\n\n===Individual and organizational brands===\nWith the development of the brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.<ref name=\"The Wall Street Journal\">{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}</ref> There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is to leave a social impact so their brand becomes associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims.

Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people.

Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state \"and the successful transference of this image to its exports \u2013 is just as important as what they actually produce and sell.\"\n\n===Destination branding===\n\nDestination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations. The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization.\n\n==Doppelg\u00e4nger brand image (DBI)==\n{{Main|Doppelg\u00e4nger brand image}}\nA [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] brand image or \"DBI\"  is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture. DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands. The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.<ref name=\"Thompson 50\u201364\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50\u201364 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}</ref>\n\nThe term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''g\u00e4nger'' (walker).\n\nDoppelg\u00e4nger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.\n\nDue to the ability of Doppelg\u00e4nger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand.

If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that \"brand\" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people (e.g. [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Katy Perry]]). Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice.\n\nIn the modern era, the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the [[marketing]] and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand's identity, personality, product design, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |first=Bhimrao M|last=Ghodeswar|title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product & Brand Management |publisher=Emerald Publishing|location=Bingely, West Yorkshire, England|volume=17 |pages=4\u201312 |date=2008|doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 }}</ref> Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, hence branding is among a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].<ref>ranchhod, 2004</ref>\n\n[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|first=Kevin Lane|last=Keller|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|journal=Journal of Marketing|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|volume=57|issue=1|date=January 1, 1993|pages=1\u201322|jstor=1252054|doi=10.2307/1252054}}</ref> As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is built by the deployment of  marketing techniques to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.<ref name=\":0\"/> A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.<ref name=\":0\"/> When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors, a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.<ref name=\":1\"/> Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value.  [[Brand valuation]] is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.\n\nThe word \u2018brand\u2019 is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''[[commodity brand]]'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|date=1983|location=Springfield, Massachusetts}}</ref> Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock.

Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realize that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands.<ref>Arnold E. J. and Thompson C. J., \"Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research,\" Journal of Consumer Research,'' vol. 31, 2005, pp 868\u2013882</ref> By the 1880s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] with [[personality]] traits such as youthfulness, fun, sex appeal, luxury or the \"cool\" factor.

A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a \"memory heuristic\": a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296</ref> For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.\n\nIt appears that a brand name and the relationship the consumer keep with the brand as a whole has evolved. From the simple product recognition process a brand name now holds a symbolic and social identification spectrum. [fournier 1998] For example, one can buy Nike because they want to be associated with the kind of people who wear Nike and with the values and attributes of that brand. More than a product it\u2019s a statement that one should seek to purchase by proxy of the brand [Belk 1988].\n\n===Corporate brand identity===\nThe brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}</ref><ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1 = Franzen\n| first1 = Giep\n| last2 = Moriarty\n| first2 = Sandra E.\n| orig-year = 2009\n| chapter = 1: The Brand as a System\n| title = The Science and Art of Branding\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mWSmBgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2015\n| page = 19\n| isbn = 9781317454670\n| access-date = 2016-08-16\n| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''.

(2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:\n\n# attributes\n# benefits\n# values\n# personality\n\nA brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.<ref name=\":2\" /> These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.<ref name=\":2\" /> If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a \"just do it\" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value.

From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.\n\n===Brand awareness===\n\n{{Main|Brand awareness}}\n[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos, and branded advertising. Brands help customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers & potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.\n\nBrand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing.

Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMarketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').<ref>Belch, G. E., & Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref> These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.\n\n* Most companies aim for \"'''Top-of-Mind'''\" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, \"Kleenex\", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.\n* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category\n* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.\n* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.\n\n===Brand recognition===\n\n'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.<ref name=\":5\" /> Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as a toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.<ref name=\":1\" /> Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5\u201315 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}</ref>\n\nBrand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology & Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263\u2013274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}</ref> In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.\n\nBrand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}</ref> For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's \"signature\" [[logo]]), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].\n\n=== Brand recall===\n\nUnlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.<ref name=\":5\" /> This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market.

Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate \u2013 defines a touch point. According to Dahlen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the \"\u2026potential to add positive \u2013 or suppress negative \u2013 associations to the brand's equity\" <ref name=\":8\" /> Thus, a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.<ref name=\":9\" /> For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilizing the best communication channel is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].<ref name=\":2\" /> As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nBrand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Ebru|last1=Uzuno\u011flu |first2=Sema|last2=Misci Kip|title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |page=592 |date=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 }}</ref> One method of brand communication that companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM).

In this context, a \"brand name\" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through [[trademark registration]] \u2013 such trademarks are called \"Registered Trademarks\". Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].\n\n====Types of brand names====\nBrand names come in many styles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}</ref>\nA few include:\n* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as \"UPS\" or \"IBM\"\n* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as \"Whole Foods\" or \"Toys R' Us\"\n* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as \"Reese's Pieces\" or \"[[Dunkin' Donuts]]\"\n* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as \"Amazon\" or \"Crest\"\n* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as \"[[Wii]]\" or \"[[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]]\"\n* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as \"[[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]\" or \"[[Samsung]]\"\n* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as \"[[Hewlett-Packard]]\", \"[[Dell]]\", \"[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]\", \"Stussy\" or \"Mars\"\n* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as \"[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]\" or \"[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]\"\n* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|\"Nike\"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as \"[[Betty Crocker]]\"\n* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as \"[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]\", \"Wok on Water\" or \"Eggs Eggscetera\"\n*'''[[portmanteau]]''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as \"[[Microsoft]]\" (\"microcomputer\" and \"software\"), \"[[Comcast]]\" (\"communications\" and \"broadcast\"), \"[[Evernote]]\" (\"forever\" and \"note\"), \"[[Vodafone]]\" (\"voice\", \"data\", \"telephone\")\n\nThe act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]\u2014which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word \"copy\".\n\n===Brand line===\nA brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].\n\n[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group <ref>{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}</ref> of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.\n\n===Brand identity===\n{{Main|Corporate identity}}\nThe expression of a brand \u2013 including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance \u2013 is brand identity.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\">{{cite book|first=Marty|last=Neumeier|title=The Dictionary of Brand|publisher=AIGA Center for Brand Experience |location=New York City|date=2004|isbn=978-1-884081-06-4|page=20}}</ref> Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand \u2013 and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\" /> The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.\n\nBrand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications, an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.\n\nThe brand identity works as a guideline, as the frame in which a brand will evolve and define itself, or in the words of David Aaker, \u201c\u2026a unique set of brand associations that the brand strategist aspires to create or maintain.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kapferer (2007), there are 6 facets to a brand\u2019s identity:\n\n* Physique: The physical characteristics and iconography of your brand ( such as the Nike swoosh or the orange pantone of easyJet).\n* Personality: The persona, how a brand communicates with their audience, which is expressed through its tone of voice, design assets and then integrates this into communication touchpoints in a coherent way.\n* Culture: The values,the principles on which a brand bases its behaviour. For example, Google flexible office hours and fun environment so the employees feel happy and creative at work.\n* Reflection: The \u201cstereotypical user\u201d of the brand. A brand is likely to be purchased by several buyer\u2019s profiles but they will have a go-to person that they use in their campaigns. For example Lou Yetu and the Parisian chic profile.\n* Relationship: The bond between a brand and its customers, and the customer expectations of the brand (the experience beyond the tangible product). Such as warranties or services during and after purchase help maintain a sustainable relationship and keep the consumer trust.\n\nSelf-image: How does one brand-customer portrays their ideal self \u2013 how they want to look and behave; what they aspire to \u2013 brands can target their messaging accordingly and make the brand\u2019s aspirations reflect theirs.\n\n====Visual brand identity====\n[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]\n\nA brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement \u2013 simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of \"Less is more\") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [[Paul Rand]] and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.\n\nColor is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Zena|last=O'Connor |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research & Application |volume=36 |date=December 10, 2010|doi=10.1002/col.20594|pages=55\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Brand trust===\nBrand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Journal of Brand Management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201358 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |url=https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/content_policy.pdf }}</ref> This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.\n\n''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of the action, behavior, communication, and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. The action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in transferring the trust experience to audiences who have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.\n\n===Brand parity===\nBrand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Paul S. |last1=Richardson|first2=Alan S. |last2=Dick |first3=Arun K.|last3=Jain |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |page=28 |date=October 1994 |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 }}</ref> This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.\n\n==Expanding role of brands==\nThe original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.\n\nToday, brands play a much bigger role. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shayna|last=Smilovitz|url= https://instapage.com/blog/emotional-marketing|title=Emotional Marketing Examples Scientifically Proven To Sway Buyers|website=Instapage|date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate= February 9, 2019 }}</ref> Cultural conflict over a brand's meaning has also influences the diffusion of an innovation.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Markus|last=Giesler|title=How Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=76|issue=6|pages=55\u201368|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=November 2012|doi=10.1509/jm.10.0406}}</ref>\n\n==Branding strategies==\n{{See|Brand management}}\n\n===Company name===\nOften, especially in the industrial sector, [[brand engineer]]s will promote a company's name.

A change in corporate naming may also have a role in seeking to shed an undesirable image: for example, [[Werner Erhard and Associates]] re-branded its activities as [[Landmark Education]] in 1991 at a time when publicity in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigative-report broadcast cast the [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] and [[Werner Erhard]] brands in a negative light,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= https://boingboing.net/2009/08/31/suppressed-60-minute.html\n |url-access=\n |title= Wikileaks re-publishes 60 Minutes piece on est/Landmark cult leader Werner Erhard\n |last= Jardin\n |first= Xeni\n |author-link= Xeni Jardin\n |date= 31 Aug 2009\n |publisher= Boing Boing\n |access-date= 28 Apr 2019\n |quote= Wikileaks has published the video and transcript of an investigative report into \"est\" (Erhard Seminars Training) guru and Landmark Education Forum godfather Werner Erhard by CBS News, originally broadcast on the program 60 Minutes on March 3, 1991. \n}}\n</ref>\nand [[Union Carbide India Limited]] became [[Eveready Industries India]] in 1994 subsequent to the [[Bhopal disaster]] of 1984\n\n===Individual branding===\n{{Main|Individual branding}}\nEach brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]])), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).\n\n===Challenger brands===\n{{main|Challenger brand}}\nA challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader nor a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset that sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.\n\n===Multiproduct branding strategy===\nMultiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all its products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  \nOther examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church & Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk-inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church & Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm & Hammer (brand)|Arm & Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. A multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.\n\n====Product line extension====\n{{main|Product line extension}}\nA product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.\n\n====Subbranding====\n{{main|Subbranding}}\nSubbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].\n\n====Brand extension====\n{{main|Brand extension}}\nBrand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.\n\n====Co-branding====\n{{main|Co-branding}}\nCo-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.\n\n===Multibranding strategy===\nMultibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head & Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].\n\nThis approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.\n\n====Fighting brands====\n{{main|Fighter brand}}\nThe main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.\n\n===Private branding strategy===\n\n{{main|Store brand}}\nPrivate branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.\n\n===Mixed branding strategy===\nMixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. \nFor example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the \"skin simple\" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.\n\n===Attitude branding and iconic brands===\nAttitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 1999 book ''[[No Logo]]'', [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a \"fetish strategy\".<ref name=\"nologo\">{{cite book|first=Naomi|last=Klein|authorlink=Naomi Klein|title=No Logo|publisher=Knopf Canada |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=1999|isbn=978-0-676-97282-5|page=141|title-link=No Logo}}</ref> Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben & Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' \u2013 brands that are able to gain and retain \"meaning beyond the material.\"<ref name=\"uber=brands\">{{cite book|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer|first2=JP|last2=Kuehlwein|title=Rethinking Prestige Branding \u2013 Secrets of the Ueber-Brands|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date= 2015|isbn=9780749470036|page=17}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A great brand raises the bar \u2013 it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. \u2013 [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:English & Hebrew Coke labels.jpg|thumb|alt=Bottles of Coca-Cola with labels printed in English and Hebrew|The color, letter font and style of the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke|Diet Coca-Cola]] [[logo]]s in [[English language|English]] were copied into matching [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] logos to maintain brand identity in Israel.]]\n\nIconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be \"identity brands\". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them \"iconic brands\". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.\n\nThere are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):\n# \"Necessary conditions\" \u2013 The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.\n# \"Myth-making\" \u2013 A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.\n# \"Cultural contradictions\" \u2013 Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.\n# \"The cultural brand management process\" \u2013 Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.\n\nSchaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:<ref name=\"uber=brands\"/>\n# \"Mission Incomparable\" \u2013 Having a differentiated and meaningful brand purpose beyond 'making money.'<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer |first2=J.|last2=Kuehlwein |title=Ueber-Branding: How modern prestige brands create meaning through mission and myth \u2013 Part 1 |journal=Journal of Brand Strategy |publisher=Henry Stewart Publications|location=London, England|volume=5 |issue=4 |date=26 June 2016|pages=395\u2013409 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/jbs/2017/00000005/00000004/art00006 }}</ref>  Setting rules that follow this purpose \u2013 even when it violates the mass marketing mantra of \"Consumer is always Boss/right\".\n# \"Longing versus Belonging\" \u2013 Playing with the opposing desires of people for Inclusion on the one hand and Exclusivity on the other. \n# \"Un-Selling\" \u2013 First and foremost seeking to seduce through pride and provocation, rather than to sell through arguments.<ref>Kuehlwein, JP.

Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means \"No label\" in English (from \u7121\u5370\u826f\u54c1 \u2013 \"Mujirushi Ryohin\" \u2013 literally, \"No brand quality goods\"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no-name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Heig, Matt.

It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.\n\n==={{anchor|derivative}} Derived brands<!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] -->===\n\n{{See|Derived demand}}\nIn this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) \"[[Intel Inside]]\".\n\n===Brand extension and brand dilution===\n\n{{See|brand extension}}\nThe existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;\nfor example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.\n\nMars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.\n\nThere is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.\nWhen [[Coca-Cola]] launched \"Diet Coke\" and \"Cherry Coke\", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.\n\nThe risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Social media brands===\nIn ''The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy'' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. \"We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us \u2013 but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see.\"<ref name=\"Media Democracy\">{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Pont|title=The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date=2013|isbn=978-0749466213}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-brands===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\nAlternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the shares of the market which will, in any case, go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as a multi-brand strategy.\n\nIndividual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what\nbusiness the company is in or diluting higher quality products.\n\n[[Procter & Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of \"facings\" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate\u2014from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).\n\n[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.\n\n===Private labels===\n\n{{See|Private label}}\n[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks & Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this \"own brand\" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.\n\n'''Designer Private Labels'''\n\nA relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer's budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.\n\nIn Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and \u2018L\u2019 for Lisa Ho.<ref>Schetzer, A., \"Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html</ref> Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers \u2018Collette\u2019 for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.<ref>Roy Morgan Research,\"Private Label Could be the New Black\" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337</ref> Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her \u201cPetites\u2019 range.<ref>Roy Morgan Research, \"Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion,\" Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520</ref> Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frame designed by Peter Morrissey.\n\n===Individual and organizational brands===\nWith the development of the brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.<ref name=\"The Wall Street Journal\">{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}</ref> There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is to leave a social impact so their brand becomes associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims.

Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people.

Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state \"and the successful transference of this image to its exports \u2013 is just as important as what they actually produce and sell.\"\n\n===Destination branding===\n\nDestination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations.

The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.<ref name=\"Thompson 50\u201364\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50\u201364 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}</ref>\n\nThe term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''g\u00e4nger'' (walker).\n\nDoppelg\u00e4nger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.\n\nDue to the ability of Doppelg\u00e4nger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand. Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re-position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism.\n\nExamples include:\n* '''Joe Chemo''' campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Chemo: A Camel Who Wishes He'd Never Smoked|url=http://www.joechemo.org/|website = www.joechemo.org|accessdate=2015-09-10}}</ref>\n* Parody of the '''Pepsi logo as an obese man''' to highlight the relationship between soft drink consumption and obesity.<ref>{{cite web|title = Designer Makes Fun Of Pepsi, Turns Its Logo Into A Fat Man - DesignTAXI.com|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/360382/Designer-Makes-Fun-Of-Pepsi-Turns-Its-Logo-Into-A-Fat-Man/|website=designtaxi.com|accessdate=2015-09-10}}</ref>\n* The '''FUH2 campaign''' protesting the Hummer SUV as a symbol of corporate and consumer irresponsibility toward public safety and the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title = FUH2 {{!}} Fuck You And Your H2|url = http://www.fuh2.com |website = www.fuh2.com|accessdate = 2015-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319105357/http://www.fuh2.com/|archivedate=2016-03-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nIn the 2006 article \"Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Image\", Thompson, Rindfleisch, and Arsel suggest that a doppelg\u00e4nger brand image can be a benefit to a brand if taken as an early warning sign that the brand is losing emotional authenticity with its market.<ref name=\"Thompson 50\u201364\"/>\n\n==International Standards==\nThe [[ISO]] branding standards developed by the Committee [[ISO/TC 289]] are:\n* '' '[[ISO 10668]]:2010' '' '' Brand valuation - Requirements for monetary brand valuation '', \n* '' '[[ISO 20671]]:2019' '' '' Brand evaluation - Principles and fundamentals ''.\n\nTwo other ISO standards are being developed by ISO/TC289:\n* [[ISO/AWI 23353]] Brand evaluation - Guidelines for brands relating to geographical indications <ref> https://www.iso.org/standard/75306.html </ref>\n* [[ISO/AWI 24051]] Brand evaluation - Guide for the annual brand evaluation. <ref> https://www.iso.org/standard/77636.html?browse=tc </ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!--NOTE: This list needs to be reduced by incorporating listed items into the body of the article, per \"Wikipedia:See also\".

The model 92 was designed in 1975 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today.\n\nThe [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] replaced the [[M1911A1]] [[.45 ACP]] pistol in 1985 with the Beretta 92FS, designated as the [[Beretta M9|'''M9''']].\n\n==History==\nThe Beretta 92 pistol evolved from earlier Beretta designs, most notably the [[Beretta M1923|M1923]] and [[Beretta M1951|M1951]]. From the M1923 comes the open [[Pistol slide|slide]] design, while the alloy [[Receiver (firearms)|frame]] and locking block [[gun barrel|barrel]], originally from [[Walther P38]], were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92's two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 .380 caliber [[Beretta Cheetah|Model 84]]. These improvements both involved the magazine, which featured direct feed; that is, there was no feed ramp between the magazine and the chamber (a Beretta innovation in pistols). In addition, the magazine was a \"double-stacked\" design, a feature originally introduced in 1935 on the [[Browning Hi-Power]].<ref>Gangarosa, Gene Jr., \"Modern Beretta Firearms\", Stoeger Publishing (1994)</ref>\n\nCarlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti and Vittorio Valle, all experienced firearms designers, contributed to the final design in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|title=Beretta Web - 92FS 15 years of evolution and success|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808040443/http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|archive-date=8 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n\n====92====\nProduction began in May 1976, and ended in February 1983.

This resulted in the '''92S''', which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units.  The magazine release button is at the bottom of the grip as is customary in Europe. This model was produced from 1978 - 1982.\n\n====92SB (92S-1)====\nThe 92SB, initially called '''92S-1''', was specifically designed for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] trials (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the '''92SB'''. Features added include a [[firing pin block]] (thus the addition of the \"B\" to the name), ambidextrous safety levers, [[Iron sights#Contrast enhancements|3-dot sights]], and relocated the magazine release catch from the bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard. The later relocation of the magazine release button means preceding models (92 & 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in both areas.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Gun Digest Book of Beretta Pistols: Function / Accuracy / Performance |year=2011 |publisher=Gun Digest Books |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=1-4402-2424-2 |pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nA compact version with a shortened barrel and slide and 13-round magazine capacity known as the '''92SB Compact''' was manufactured from 1981 to 1991.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\"/>\n\n====92F (92SB-F)====\nBeretta modified the model 92SB slightly to create the 92SB-F (the \"F\" added to denote entry of the model in U.S. Government federal testing) by making the following changes:\n\n* Design of all the parts to make them 100% interchangeable to simplify maintenance for large government organizations.\n* Squared off the front of the trigger guard so that one could use finger support for easier aiming.\n* Recurved the forward base of the grip to aid aiming.\n* [[Hard chromed]] the bore to protect it from corrosion and to reduce wear.\n* New surface coating on the slide called ''Bruniton'', which allegedly provides better corrosion resistance than the previous plain [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] finish.<ref name=\"Thompson2012\"/>{{rp|16}}\n\n[[File:Beretta92FS vector.svg|thumb|right|Vector-graphic of model 92FS]]\n[[File:Beretta 92FS (right).jpg|thumb|right|A Beretta 92FS Inox with the slide retracted, showing the exposed ejection port and barrel mechanism.]]\n[[File:Beretta 92FS left.jpg|thumb|A Beretta 92FS Inox stainless steel pistol.]]\n\nThe French military adopted a modified version of the 92F with a decocking-only lever as the '''PAMAS G1'''. These pistols have [[tellurium]] in the [[pistol slide|slide]], making the steel brittle and as such only have a service life of approximately 6,000 rounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|title=PAMAS G1 pistol - ARRSEpedia|website=www.arrse.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063000/https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|archive-date=2018-02-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====92FS====\n{{see also|Beretta M9}}\n\nThe FS has an enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. The main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. military testing.<ref name=\"LawrencePannone2015\">{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=Erik |last2=Pannone |first2=Mike |title=Beretta 92FS/M9 Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcG7BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT10|date=19 February 2015 |publisher=Erik Lawrence Publications |isbn=978-1-941998-55-7 |page=10}}</ref>\nThe 92FS also came in a Centurion model which featured a shorter barrel that just clears it's full size frame.\n\n==Design==\n\nThe Beretta 92's open slide design ensures smooth feeding and ejection of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors due to the in-line travel of the barrel. This is in contrast to the complex travel of [[John Browning|Browning]] designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.\n\nIncreasingly, it has become popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as increase corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod (which is now also fluted), magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.<ref name=\"Ayoob2007\">{{cite book|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|title=The Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunnery|date=28 September 2007|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1825-0|page=218}}</ref>\n\n===Magazines===\nTo keep in line with the introduction of laws in some locations restricting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, Beretta now manufactures magazines that hold fewer than the factory standard 15 rounds. These magazines have heavier crimping (deeper indentations in the side) to reduce the available space while still keeping the same external dimensions and ensuring that these magazines can be used on existing firearms. Beretta also produces 15 round \"Sand Resistant\" magazines to resolve issues encountered with contractor made magazines, and 17 round magazines included with the A1 models. Both magazines function in earlier 92 series and M9 model pistols.\n\nItalian magazine manufacturer Mec-Gar now produces magazines in blue and nickel finishes with an 18-round capacity, which fit flush in the magazine well on the 92 series. Mec-Gar also produces an extended 20-round blued magazine that protrudes below the frame by {{convert|3/4|in}}. These magazines provide users in unrestricted states with a larger capacity magazine.\n\n==Variants==\n\nThe Beretta 92 is available in many configurations and models:\n\n[[File:DCB-Shooting MAS G1S.jpg|thumb|right|The French-made PAMAS G1 variant.]]\n\n===Models===\n;92D : The 92D is a double action only variant of the 92FS with no safety or decocking lever. \n\n[[File:Beretta 92 Compact L PDRM.jpg|thumb|right|Beretta 92 Compact L owned by the Royal Malaysia Police.]]\n\n;Vertec : (2001-2007, 2014-2018) \n:The Vertec is a variant of the 92-series with a recountoured, straight backstrap, removable sights, 1-slot accessory rail, flared magwell, and 4.7 inch barrel\n\n;[[Beretta 90two|90Two]] : (2006-2012) \n:The 90two is a 9mm/.40 variant of the 92-series with a redesigned, thicker slide and frame to accommodate an accessory rail, fully [[dovetail]]ed front sight and .40 S&W pressures.

The 92x Performance however includes a red fiberoptic front sight, adjustable rear sight, front and rear slide serrations, skeletonized hammer, competition hammer spring, steel spring recoil rod, extended beavertail, front and rear frame checkering, oversized magazine release, and match take down lever. The Vertec frame is made of steel rather than alloy, increasing the weight to 48 ounces. The 92x Performance utilizes a frame mounted safety compared to the slide mounted safety of the standard 92x.

The model 92 was designed in 1975 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today.\n\nThe [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] replaced the [[M1911A1]] [[.45 ACP]] pistol in 1985 with the Beretta 92FS, designated as the [[Beretta M9|'''M9''']].\n\n==History==\nThe Beretta 92 pistol evolved from earlier Beretta designs, most notably the [[Beretta M1923|M1923]] and [[Beretta M1951|M1951]]. From the M1923 comes the open [[Pistol slide|slide]] design, while the alloy [[Receiver (firearms)|frame]] and locking block [[gun barrel|barrel]], originally from [[Walther P38]], were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92's two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 .380 caliber [[Beretta Cheetah|Model 84]]. These improvements both involved the magazine, which featured direct feed; that is, there was no feed ramp between the magazine and the chamber (a Beretta innovation in pistols). In addition, the magazine was a \"double-stacked\" design, a feature originally introduced in 1935 on the [[Browning Hi-Power]].<ref>Gangarosa, Gene Jr., \"Modern Beretta Firearms\", Stoeger Publishing (1994)</ref>\n\nCarlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti and Vittorio Valle, all experienced firearms designers, contributed to the final design in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|title=Beretta Web - 92FS 15 years of evolution and success|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808040443/http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|archive-date=8 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n\n====92====\nProduction began in May 1976, and ended in February 1983. Approximately 7,000 units were of the first \"step slide\" design and 45,000 were of the second \"straight slide\" type.<ref name=\"Wilson2000\">{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert Lawrence|title=The World of Beretta: An International Legend|year=2000|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-375-50149-4|pages=207, 234}}</ref>\n\n====92S====\nIn order to meet requirements of some law enforcement agencies, Beretta modified the Beretta 92 by adding a slide-mounted combined safety and decocking lever, replacing the frame mounted manual thumb safety. This resulted in the '''92S''', which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units.  The magazine release button is at the bottom of the grip as is customary in Europe. This model was produced from 1978 - 1982.\n\n====92SB (92S-1)====\nThe 92SB, initially called '''92S-1''', was specifically designed for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] trials (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the '''92SB'''. Features added include a [[firing pin block]] (thus the addition of the \"B\" to the name), ambidextrous safety levers, [[Iron sights#Contrast enhancements|3-dot sights]], and relocated the magazine release catch from the bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard. The later relocation of the magazine release button means preceding models (92 & 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in both areas.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Gun Digest Book of Beretta Pistols: Function / Accuracy / Performance |year=2011 |publisher=Gun Digest Books |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=1-4402-2424-2 |pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nA compact version with a shortened barrel and slide and 13-round magazine capacity known as the '''92SB Compact''' was manufactured from 1981 to 1991.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\"/>\n\n====92F (92SB-F)====\nBeretta modified the model 92SB slightly to create the 92SB-F (the \"F\" added to denote entry of the model in U.S. Government federal testing) by making the following changes:\n\n* Design of all the parts to make them 100% interchangeable to simplify maintenance for large government organizations.\n* Squared off the front of the trigger guard so that one could use finger support for easier aiming.\n* Recurved the forward base of the grip to aid aiming.\n* [[Hard chromed]] the bore to protect it from corrosion and to reduce wear.\n* New surface coating on the slide called ''Bruniton'', which allegedly provides better corrosion resistance than the previous plain [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] finish.<ref name=\"Thompson2012\"/>{{rp|16}}\n\n[[File:Beretta92FS vector.svg|thumb|right|Vector-graphic of model 92FS]]\n[[File:Beretta 92FS (right).jpg|thumb|right|A Beretta 92FS Inox with the slide retracted, showing the exposed ejection port and barrel mechanism.]]\n[[File:Beretta 92FS left.jpg|thumb|A Beretta 92FS Inox stainless steel pistol.]]\n\nThe French military adopted a modified version of the 92F with a decocking-only lever as the '''PAMAS G1'''. These pistols have [[tellurium]] in the [[pistol slide|slide]], making the steel brittle and as such only have a service life of approximately 6,000 rounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|title=PAMAS G1 pistol - ARRSEpedia|website=www.arrse.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063000/https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|archive-date=2018-02-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====92FS====\n{{see also|Beretta M9}}\n\nThe FS has an enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. The main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. military testing.<ref name=\"LawrencePannone2015\">{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=Erik |last2=Pannone |first2=Mike |title=Beretta 92FS/M9 Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcG7BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT10|date=19 February 2015 |publisher=Erik Lawrence Publications |isbn=978-1-941998-55-7 |page=10}}</ref>\nThe 92FS also came in a Centurion model which featured a shorter barrel that just clears it's full size frame.\n\n==Design==\n\nThe Beretta 92's open slide design ensures smooth feeding and ejection of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors due to the in-line travel of the barrel. This is in contrast to the complex travel of [[John Browning|Browning]] designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.\n\nIncreasingly, it has become popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as increase corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod (which is now also fluted), magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.<ref name=\"Ayoob2007\">{{cite book|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|title=The Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunnery|date=28 September 2007|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1825-0|page=218}}</ref>\n\n===Magazines===\nTo keep in line with the introduction of laws in some locations restricting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, Beretta now manufactures magazines that hold fewer than the factory standard 15 rounds. These magazines have heavier crimping (deeper indentations in the side) to reduce the available space while still keeping the same external dimensions and ensuring that these magazines can be used on existing firearms. Beretta also produces 15 round \"Sand Resistant\" magazines to resolve issues encountered with contractor made magazines, and 17 round magazines included with the A1 models. Both magazines function in earlier 92 series and M9 model pistols.\n\nItalian magazine manufacturer Mec-Gar now produces magazines in blue and nickel finishes with an 18-round capacity, which fit flush in the magazine well on the 92 series. Mec-Gar also produces an extended 20-round blued magazine that protrudes below the frame by {{convert|3/4|in}}. These magazines provide users in unrestricted states with a larger capacity magazine.\n\n==Variants==\n\nThe Beretta 92 is available in many configurations and models:\n\n[[File:DCB-Shooting MAS G1S.jpg|thumb|right|The French-made PAMAS G1 variant.]]\n\n===Models===\n;92D : The 92D is a double action only variant of the 92FS with no safety or decocking lever. \n\n[[File:Beretta 92 Compact L PDRM.jpg|thumb|right|Beretta 92 Compact L owned by the Royal Malaysia Police.]]\n\n;Vertec : (2001-2007, 2014-2018) \n:The Vertec is a variant of the 92-series with a recountoured, straight backstrap, removable sights, 1-slot accessory rail, flared magwell, and 4.7 inch barrel\n\n;[[Beretta 90two|90Two]] : (2006-2012) \n:The 90two is a 9mm/.40 variant of the 92-series with a redesigned, thicker slide and frame to accommodate an accessory rail, fully [[dovetail]]ed front sight and .40 S&W pressures.

Similar to the 92x, it features a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner vertical grip, removable wrap-around grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and 'old' M9 style, dovetailed sights. The 92x Performance however includes a red fiberoptic front sight, adjustable rear sight, front and rear slide serrations, skeletonized hammer, competition hammer spring, steel spring recoil rod, extended beavertail, front and rear frame checkering, oversized magazine release, and match take down lever. The Vertec frame is made of steel rather than alloy, increasing the weight to 48 ounces. The 92x Performance utilizes a frame mounted safety compared to the slide mounted safety of the standard 92x. The Extreme-S trigger mechanism is utilized in the handgun, reducing trigger reset by 40%.

For histories of those hamlets see their separate articles: [[Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel]], [[Altensalzkoth]] and [[Kohlenbach]].\n\n=== Prehistoric and early historic occupation ===\nThe earliest archaeological discoveries from Eversen date to the end of the [[Old Stone Age]]. Finds of [[flint]] tools, as well as the remains of fireplaces, are evidence of at least periodic settlement by itinerant hunter-gatherer cultures. Numerous finds from the [[Middle Stone Age]] testify to a dense settlement of the [[sand dunes]] lying east of the river [[\u00d6rtze]] in the area of the present-day village of Sandberg. In the [[New Stone Age]] and the transition from an appropriative to a productive way of life, the sand dunes proved unsuitable for agriculture and were largely abandoned as places of settlement. Only on the so-called ''Kolk'' and on the ''Lerchberg'' is there evidence of settlers during that period. There, access to water and the relatively better quality of soil in comparison with the other sites nearby provided the essential requirements for arable farming. There are no traces of settlement in the area of the village from the [[Ice Age]], i.e. the time from about 800 BC to 400 AD.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p.14ff {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Emergence of the village of Eversen ===\nThe emergence of the farming village of Eversen cannot be precisely dated, but it can be deduced, firstly, from the long, narrow, parallel strips of arable land (''Langstreifenfeldern'') that predominate here and, secondly, from the evolution of the village name, that Eversen appeared in the 9th century at the latest.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.51 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref> At that time Eversen belonged to the [[Duchy of Saxony|old Saxon]] district of [[Leinegau|Loingau]]. The village was not, however, mentioned in the records until 1330 where it is recorded in a deed of [[enfeoffment]] (''Lehnsurkunde'') under the name of ''Euersten''.<ref>In a deed of [[enfeoffment]] a certain ''Werner bere'' (amongst others) was enfeoffed with a farm in ''euersten''. The deed may be found in the L\u00fcneburg Register of Enfeoffments No. 56.</ref>\n\n=== Estates ===\n[[File:RittergutIb.jpg|thumb|right|The manor house of the ''Rittergutes I'' estate built in 1792]]\nIn Eversen there are three manorial estates (''Ritterg\u00fcter'') to which the local farms used to belong. These farms had to pay various obligatory contributions and services to the lords of the manor (''Gutsherren'').\n\nThe first estate, ''Gut I'', the so-called ''Sedelhof'', lies east of the village street. It is bordered to the north and east by mill ditches, to the west by the millpond and to the south by the river [[\u00d6rtze]]. It is thus entirely surrounded by water and only accessible over a wooden bridge. Due to its good location it is thought to be one on the oldest estates in Eversen.<ref>Pr\u00f6ve, H. (1929). ''Dorf und Gut im alten Herzogtum L\u00fcneburg''. G\u00f6ttingen 1929, p. 46</ref> The estate was first mentioned in the records in 1424. In a deed of [[enfeoffment]] by the Duke of L\u00fcneburg, a certain Carsten von Harling, amongst others, was [[enfeoffed]] a farm in Eversen. Because the enfeoffment was \"from time immemorial\" (''von alters hero gehabt'')<ref name=\"Rathmann98\">Rathmann, Franz. ''Dorfbuch Eversen'', p. 98ff</ref> it can be assumed that ''Gut I'' had been in the possession of the Harling family from the end of the 14th century. The estate was one of the few in the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg]] that was furnished with a [[keep]] (''Bergfried''), or fortified tower. The present building dates from the year 1792, when the [[King's Council]], Carl August von Harling, had a new manor house and stables built in [[timber framing|timber-framed style]].\n\n''Gut II'', known as the ''Majorshof'', lies at the southern end of the Old Village, west of the village street. Until the 15th century it was owned by the [[Hodenberg|von Hodenberg]] family who had allocated it as a [[mesne]] fief (''[[Afterlehen]]'') to the Tiebermann family. In 1495 the estate was first enfeoffed to the von Harling family. The estate remained in the possession of the Tiebermann family as before, who were therefore the sub-[[vassal]]s (''Aftervasallen'') of the von Harlings. When the Tiebermanns died out in the 17th century the estate was not reallocated but went to Major Anton Johann von Harling. He had the manor house built which was completed in 1686. The ''Majorshof'' (\"Major's Farm\") was named after him. His son inherited ''Gut II'' as well as ''Gut I'' from his uncle, so that the two estates were once again owned by one person.<ref name=\"Rathmann98\" />\n\n''Gut III'', the ''Beckerhof'', lies in the centre of the Old Village, west of the village street. It was originally an ordinary farm that paid manorial contributions and did not achieve the status of a manorial estate until the beginning of the 17th century. As a result of a distribution of inheritance, the older line of the von Harling family, which had its seat at ''Gut I'', relinquished the estate to the so-called younger line of the family, who were thereupon incorporated into the [[enfeoffment]]. The current structure, a timber-framed manor house, was built in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Rathmann98\" />\n\n=== The farming village of Eversen ===\nIn 1378 a Celle tax register named three full-time farmers (''Vollbauern'') as taxpayers to the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|Duke of Celle]].<ref>Sudendorf - ''Urkundenbuch  zur Geschichte der Herz\u00f6ge von Braunschweig und L\u00fcneburg und ihrer Lande'', Vol. V. Hanover, 1865</ref> Because the register only lists those farms belonging to the duke under the manorial system, it cannot be ascertained whether, at that time, other farms already existed.<ref name=\"G\u00e4dcke132\">G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.132 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref> Shortly thereaftere there was a division of the three farms that were subservient to the duke into three [[Cotter (farmer)|cotter]] farms. In the Celle revenue record of 1381, five farms are recorded as being obligated to the Duke of Celle. In addition there was a farm belonging to Eversen's ''Gut II'', so that at that time it can be reckoned that there were 6 manorial farms under the Duke.<ref name=\"G\u00e4dcke132\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century the village was further extended. The enfeoffed occupants of the Eversen estates used their land to create other farms subordinate to them. In a treasury register (''Schatzregister'') from 1438 as many as twelve people are listed as paying tribute (''Schatz'').<ref>Grieser, R. (1934). ''Das Schatzregister der Grossvogtei Celle von 1438 und andere Quellen zur Bev\u00f6lkerungsgeschichte der Kreise Celle, Fallingbostel, Soltau und Burgdorf zwischen 1428 und 1442.'' Hildesheim, 1934, p. 21</ref> From the tax records it can be ascertained that, at that time, there were 3 estates (''Vollh\u00f6fen'') and 9 cotters (''K\u00f6tner'').<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.149 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries the village continued to expand. Growth halted temporarily, however, after the establishment of a cotter farm obligated to ''Gut I'' in 1692.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.197 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref> At that stage, Eversen consisted of 22 manorial farms, a community ''Hirtenhaus'' and the three manorial estates of the von Harling family. In addition there were the houses of the small farmers and [[hireling]]s. Because they only had small holdings of land and no grazing rights on the [[common land|commons]], their occupants earned their living by working on the estates or as salt drivers for the [[S\u00fclze Saltworks]].\n\nUnlike most of the other heath villages in the southern [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]], Eversen was spared from the ravages of war and pillaging or burning by hostile troops during its history.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.138 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}} G\u00e4dcke is referring here particularly to the years of the [[L\u00fcneburg War of Succession]]</ref> The surrounding [[bog]]s provided a natural defence for the village. However the contributions required from the farmers as a consequence of the [[Thirty Years War]] were a heavy burden that hindered village expansion for decades and led to the abandonment of many farms.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.196 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref>\n\nTwo epidemics of the [[Black Death]] in 1581 and 1642 caused many deaths and the extinction of several family lines.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p. 188ff {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th century was characterised by extensive [[agricultural reform]]s. Fundamental to subsequent reforms was the general division (''Generalteilung'') of land at the beginning of the 19th century, whereby the villages were given fixed boundaries and every piece of land was allocated to a municipality (''[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]]''). The amount of land around the individual villages which was allocated to them was based on the grazing rights they had held in the past.\n\nThis was followed during the period 1838 to 1858 by the division of common land (''Gemeinheitsteilungen''). [[Common land]], i.e. those areas which had hitherto been shared by the community, was now transferred to the individual farms as freehold property based on their existing rights to the common land.<ref name=\"Hindersmann\" />\n\nOn the basis of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]'s 1833 redemption law, the obligations on farms under the [[manorial system]] were repealed. Farms to which the so-called [[manorial rights]] applied had been hitherto obliged to give numerous services and make frequent payments to the manor. That was now repealed on payment of 25 times the annual dues and the land was then granted under [[:wikt:freehold|freehold]] into the farmers' ownership.<ref name=\"Hindersmann\">Hindersmann, Ulrike. ''Der ritterschaftliche Adel im K\u00f6nigreich Hannover 1814-1866''  {{ISBN|3-7752-6003-X}}</ref>\n\nThese reforms led to an agricultural boom, the evidence of which can still be seen today in the numerous farmhouses that were built at that time. Another consequence of the repealing of manorial obligations was that property could be now freely sold.<ref>The manorial system, to which the farms had hitherto been tied, greatly restricted the ability to distribute real estate.</ref> That created the conditions for the establishment of new farms. In the 2nd half of the 19th century a large number of new houses appeared on the so-called ''Sandberg'' (\"Sand Hill\"), the part of Eversen east of the \u00d6rtze, and the population of the village grew markedly.<ref name=\"Website\" />\n\nNinety-nine men from Eversen took part in the [[First World War]], 29 of whom were killed.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998).

One year later this was disbanded and, for the next 6 months, two night watchmen were employed.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p.204 {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Administrative history ===\nFrom the 14th century Bergen was recorded as having a [[vogt|vogtei's]] office, the lowest level of administration and justice, which was presided over by a ducal [[vogt]]. Subordinated to it since the 15th century was the administrative post in [[S\u00fclze (Bergen)|S\u00fclze]], which was responsible for the church parish of S\u00fclze to which Eversen belonged.<ref>Krieg, Martin. ''Die Entstehung und Entwicklung der Amtsbezirke im ehemaligen F\u00fcrstentum L\u00fcneburg'' {{ISBN|3-87898-089-2}}</ref> Matters of importance that only affected Eversen were discussed and decided by the ''Realgemeinde'', i.e. the farm owners who had [[common land]] rights. The political reforms of the 19th century brought about a fundamental change from which the political municipality of S\u00fclze arose. Participation in the resolution of village affairs was no longer dependent on ownership of property or land; instead every male villager over 25 had the right to vote.\n\n=== Religion ===\nUntil the 16th century Eversen belonged to the [[St. Lambert's Church, Bergen|parish of St. Lambert]] in [[Bergen (Landkreis Celle)|Bergen]]. Because the distance of {{convert|9|km|mi}} made regular church attendance difficult or, in bad weather on the muddy paths, impossible, a chapel was built in 1475 at the neighbouring village of [[S\u00fclze (Bergen)|S\u00fclze]], which was overseen by the pastor at Bergen. In 1502 an endowment was given by the owner of Eversen's ''Gut I'', which gave Eversen its own [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectorate]]. Since then Eversen has belonged to the [[Church of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian, S\u00fclze|parish of S\u00fclze]].<ref>*Kirchengemeinde S\u00fclze - Festschrift zum Jubil\u00e4umsjahr 2004</ref>\n\n=== Eversen since 1929 ===\nIn the course of a municipal reform in 1929 the hitherto independent villages of [[Altensalzkoth]] and [[Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel]] and the farmstead of [[Kohlenbach]] were incorporated into the parish of Eversen.\n\nIn 1934 with the change of office, Albert Buhr became the first [[Nazi]] ''[[B\u00fcrgermeister]]''. In the elections to the German [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] 30% of the votes went to the [[NSDAP]]; in 1933 this had risen to 60%.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p.207 {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\nEversen was unaffected by the hostilities [[Second World War]], although a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] crashed into the garden of an Eversen farmer during an air battle in the area of [[Hanover]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]. One of the two pilots died in the crash, the other was able to save himself by [[parachuting]] out. A total of 182 Eversen villagers took part in the war, 84 of whom died.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen.

In 1945 and 1946 the so-called logging [[War reparations|reparations]] resulted in about 120,000 - 150,000 cubic metres of wood being felled in the parish of Eversen.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p. 207 {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}} The figures relate to Eversen including the hamlet of Altensalzkoth</ref>\n\nThe years after the [[Second World War]] were characterised by an influx of refugees. In the years that followed, many new houses were built on the ''Sandberg''  and the number of inhabitants rose sharply. Whilst this growth resulted in a very different appearance in the surrounding villages, the 'old village' (''alte Dorf'') largely retained its character and appearance and, even today, is dominated by timber-framed houses.\n\nAs part of the Lower Saxon regional and administrative reforms in 1973, Eversen lost its independence and, since then, has been a municipality within the borough of [[Bergen (Landkreis Celle)|Bergen]].\n\nIn 1972 Hurricane [[Cyclone Quimburga|Quimburga]], which destroyed 10% of the woodland area in [[Lower Saxony]], also caused considerable damage in the municipality of Eversen. The [[fire on the L\u00fcneburg Heath]] in 1975 destroyed large areas of woodland in the Kohlenbach, which belongs to Eversen, as well as on ''Eversen Mathheide'' heath.  In 1997 another [[storm]] caused massive damage, during which most of the ''Gehege'', a wood adjacent to ''Gut I'' was blown down.\n\n[[File:EversenDtschHs.jpg|thumb|The ''Gasthaus Niedersachsen'', scene of the 1988 TV series, Petticoat]]\nIn 1988 a television team was looking for a Lower Saxon village that had survived in its original state, with cobblestones, old farmhouses and a [[corner shop]]. In Eversen they discovered all of these things. They wanted to film village life in the 1950s. Under the direction of Wigbert Wicker many of the scenes were filmed in the ''Gasthaus Niedersachsen'' (\"Lower Saxony Inn\"), a [[Lower Saxon house]] still largely preserved in its original state. The planned conversion of a shop in the village, which was also the location of many scenes, was delayed whilst filming took place. Well-known German actors and actresses such as Timothy Peach,  Ulrich Pleitgen, Konstantin Graudus, Ferdinand Dux and Doris Kunstmann starred. Six episodes were filmed.

Eversen is represented by a local council (''Ortsrat'') and a council chairman (''Ortsb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is empowered, ''inter alia'', to make decisions about public services in the village, is responsible for maintaining the appearance of the village and for overseeing its clubs and societies, and has to be consulted by the town of Bergen on all important matters affecting the village.<ref>[http://cdl.niedersachsen.de/blob/images/C39734080_L20.pdf Information about the Lower Saxony Community Constitution]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It consists of five elected representatives who, together with the chairman, sit on the Bergen borough council.

Its task was the management of those woodlands that remained in the ownership of the village council. Its members continued to be those who were entitled to be on the council, i.e. the owners of the 21 farms and the three manorial estates.

''Dorfbuch Eversen'', p. 411ff  {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 the Eversen Angling Club (''Fischerei-Verein Eversen'') was founded; today it has over 70 members. In addition to managing a 3.5&nbsp;km long section of the river \u00d6rtze, the club has rented a gravel pond in Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel. On both water bodies there are regular fishing competitions. In addition the club looks after the ''Bruchbach'' in Eversen. In the \u00d6rtze attempts have been made in recent years to re-introduce the long-extinct [[salmon]] into the local rivers again.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\nThe Eversen Male Voice Choir (''M\u00e4nnergesangverein Eversen von 1888'') was founded in 1888 and re-activated in 2006. MGV Eversen has about 25 male singers.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\nThe amateur dramatic society founded in the 1950s and known as the ''Dorfb\u00fchne Eversen'' (Eversen Village Stage) has to date put on a play of up to 3 acts every year. The society comprises a large number of amateur actors who put a lot of effort into their hobby and persuade many Eversen villagers, including numerous young people, to go to the ''Gasthaus Niedersachsen'' every year.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\nSince 1962 there has been a group of first-aid workers, who train in civil protection, provide first-aid at events and run blood-donation clinics. Together with the Junior Red Cross they collect and sell paper for recycling from the villagers.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\n== Economy and Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:Hofotte1.jpg|thumb|right|Walter Otte Farm - the last arable full-time farm in Eversen]]\nToday agriculture has largely lost its former importance. Apart from a few businesses which are involved in agriculture as a sideline, there is only one full-time farm left.\n\nImportant economic drivers today are Landhandel Otte, an agricultural wholesalers, and the Heinrich Harling sawmill.  Other medium-sized businesses in Eversen include the Klaus Otte garage, Thomas Dienelt the wrought ironmonger, Dieter Rossmann the joiner,  Reinhard Peisker the timber-framing specialists, Ulrike Preusse the hairdressing salon and Norbert Herrmann the villager bakery.\n\nIn recent years tourism has also become increasingly important. Within the municipality of Eversen, the village of Altensalzkoth is home to the ''Hotel Helm'', Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel has a country caf\u00e9, the ''Mielmannshof'', and Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel Manor House rents holiday apartments.<ref>[http://www.feuerschuetzenbostel.de Website of the Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel Manor House]</ref>\n\n=== Transport ===\nEversen lies on state road (''Landesstra\u00dfe'') L 240 which runs from Celle to Hermannsburg. From 1902 to 1975 Eversen Station was part of a minor railway line (''[[Kleinbahn]]'') that linked the village with the town of Bergen and, following an upgrade of the line in later years, also with [[Hermannsburg]] and [[Celle]]. Buses on the [[Celle]] - [[Fa\u00dfberg]] route operated by [[CeBus]] stop several times a day in Eversen and link the place with the surrounding villages.<ref>[http://www.cebus-celle.de/pdfs/Linienplannetzplan_Landkreis_03_2008.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} CeBus Celle's bus route network</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:Grundschule-Eversen.jpg|thumb|right|Eversen Primary School]]\nThe first indications of a [[school]] in Eversen date to the year 1673 when the [[schoolmaster]], Friedrich Bussmann, was mentioned in a historical record. Teaching took place in the teacher's private residence who lived in the ''Hirtenhaus'' belonging to the village community. Not until 1820 did Eversen get its own school building, but this had to be demolished only 67 years later due to its dilapidated state. Its successor, completed in 1884, was used as a school until 1950. But when school numbers increased, particularly as a result of the influx of [[refugees]], a new building needed. Since then this has housed the Eversen [[Primary School]] (''Grundschule''), where 4 teachers educate an average of 80 children.<ref name=\"Rathmann249\">Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen'', p. 249ff  {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Kindergarten ===\nPrior to the 1990s the [[kindergarten]] in S\u00fclze and a children's play group run by the German Red Cross in Sandbergsfeld were responsible for children in Eversen. The increasing number of children would have entailed an expansion of the S\u00fclze facility; instead it was decided to build a new kindergarten in Eversen in the 1990s. The new kindergarten is in the middle of the village and has places for about 50 children, looked after by 2 child care workers and 2 nursery nurses. On 1 February 1995 the facility was opened.<ref name=\"Rathmann249\" />\n\n=== Sewage works ===\nUntil the 1960s individual farms were responsible for their own [[waste disposal]]. As part of the expansion of the road network in the early 1960s, however, work began on a [[sewage system]] that enabled centralised waste disposal for the first time. In 1965 the municipalities of Eversen and S\u00fclze agreed to establish a [[sewage farm]], which went into operation in 1973. In the course of the years the neighbouring villages of Diesten, Huxahl, Offen, Altensalzkoth and Hassel were also added to the sewage system.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998).

The village is on the edge of the [[S\u00fcdheide Nature Park]] and was an independent municipality until it was incorporated into the borough of Bergen in 1973. It has an area of {{Convert|3328|ha|acre}} and a population of 1,426 inhabitants.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Geographical location ===\nEversen is located on the boundary of the [[S\u00fcdheide Nature Park]] about {{Convert|16|km|mi}} north of the town of [[Celle]] and about {{Convert|10|km|mi}} southwest of [[Hermannsburg]] on the L 240 state road that runs from Celle to Hermannsburg.

The ''Bruchbach'' acts as a drainage ditch but, in recent years, has also been used by the Eversen fishing club for breeding salmon.<ref name=\"Rathmann359\">Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p.359ff. {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Alter Dorf'' or \"Old Village\" there is a millpond belonging to the manor, ''Rittergut I'', which was created in 1638.<ref name=\"Rathmann359\" /> It had an original area of just under {{Convert|0.75|ha|acre}}, but was expanded in the 2nd half of the 20th century through the incorporation of other areas to {{Convert|1.5|ha|acre}}. Until the beginning of the 20th century it fed the mill owned by the manor; it was subsequently used in the 1970s and 1980s for fish farming.\n\nOther water features include: a branch of the \u00d6rtze, the so-called ''[[Kolk (bog)|Kolk]]''; several fish ponds in the village of Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel; and, in the ''Schummelsbruch'', a wood east of the village centre, bodies of water that were established for the long-term storage of logs following a storm in 1972.<ref name=\"Rathmann359\" />\n\n== History ==\nThis section deals solely with the history of Eversen and does not cover the neighbouring hamlets incorporated into its municipal area in 1929. For histories of those hamlets see their separate articles: [[Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel]], [[Altensalzkoth]] and [[Kohlenbach]].\n\n=== Prehistoric and early historic occupation ===\nThe earliest archaeological discoveries from Eversen date to the end of the [[Old Stone Age]]. Finds of [[flint]] tools, as well as the remains of fireplaces, are evidence of at least periodic settlement by itinerant hunter-gatherer cultures. Numerous finds from the [[Middle Stone Age]] testify to a dense settlement of the [[sand dunes]] lying east of the river [[\u00d6rtze]] in the area of the present-day village of Sandberg. In the [[New Stone Age]] and the transition from an appropriative to a productive way of life, the sand dunes proved unsuitable for agriculture and were largely abandoned as places of settlement. Only on the so-called ''Kolk'' and on the ''Lerchberg'' is there evidence of settlers during that period. There, access to water and the relatively better quality of soil in comparison with the other sites nearby provided the essential requirements for arable farming. There are no traces of settlement in the area of the village from the [[Ice Age]], i.e. the time from about 800 BC to 400 AD.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p.14ff {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Emergence of the village of Eversen ===\nThe emergence of the farming village of Eversen cannot be precisely dated, but it can be deduced, firstly, from the long, narrow, parallel strips of arable land (''Langstreifenfeldern'') that predominate here and, secondly, from the evolution of the village name, that Eversen appeared in the 9th century at the latest.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.51 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref> At that time Eversen belonged to the [[Duchy of Saxony|old Saxon]] district of [[Leinegau|Loingau]]. The village was not, however, mentioned in the records until 1330 where it is recorded in a deed of [[enfeoffment]] (''Lehnsurkunde'') under the name of ''Euersten''.<ref>In a deed of [[enfeoffment]] a certain ''Werner bere'' (amongst others) was enfeoffed with a farm in ''euersten''. The deed may be found in the L\u00fcneburg Register of Enfeoffments No. 56.</ref>\n\n=== Estates ===\n[[File:RittergutIb.jpg|thumb|right|The manor house of the ''Rittergutes I'' estate built in 1792]]\nIn Eversen there are three manorial estates (''Ritterg\u00fcter'') to which the local farms used to belong. These farms had to pay various obligatory contributions and services to the lords of the manor (''Gutsherren'').\n\nThe first estate, ''Gut I'', the so-called ''Sedelhof'', lies east of the village street. It is bordered to the north and east by mill ditches, to the west by the millpond and to the south by the river [[\u00d6rtze]]. It is thus entirely surrounded by water and only accessible over a wooden bridge. Due to its good location it is thought to be one on the oldest estates in Eversen.<ref>Pr\u00f6ve, H. (1929). ''Dorf und Gut im alten Herzogtum L\u00fcneburg''. G\u00f6ttingen 1929, p. 46</ref> The estate was first mentioned in the records in 1424. In a deed of [[enfeoffment]] by the Duke of L\u00fcneburg, a certain Carsten von Harling, amongst others, was [[enfeoffed]] a farm in Eversen. Because the enfeoffment was \"from time immemorial\" (''von alters hero gehabt'')<ref name=\"Rathmann98\">Rathmann, Franz. ''Dorfbuch Eversen'', p. 98ff</ref> it can be assumed that ''Gut I'' had been in the possession of the Harling family from the end of the 14th century. The estate was one of the few in the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg]] that was furnished with a [[keep]] (''Bergfried''), or fortified tower. The present building dates from the year 1792, when the [[King's Council]], Carl August von Harling, had a new manor house and stables built in [[timber framing|timber-framed style]].\n\n''Gut II'', known as the ''Majorshof'', lies at the southern end of the Old Village, west of the village street. Until the 15th century it was owned by the [[Hodenberg|von Hodenberg]] family who had allocated it as a [[mesne]] fief (''[[Afterlehen]]'') to the Tiebermann family. In 1495 the estate was first enfeoffed to the von Harling family. The estate remained in the possession of the Tiebermann family as before, who were therefore the sub-[[vassal]]s (''Aftervasallen'') of the von Harlings. When the Tiebermanns died out in the 17th century the estate was not reallocated but went to Major Anton Johann von Harling. He had the manor house built which was completed in 1686. The ''Majorshof'' (\"Major's Farm\") was named after him. His son inherited ''Gut II'' as well as ''Gut I'' from his uncle, so that the two estates were once again owned by one person.<ref name=\"Rathmann98\" />\n\n''Gut III'', the ''Beckerhof'', lies in the centre of the Old Village, west of the village street. It was originally an ordinary farm that paid manorial contributions and did not achieve the status of a manorial estate until the beginning of the 17th century. As a result of a distribution of inheritance, the older line of the von Harling family, which had its seat at ''Gut I'', relinquished the estate to the so-called younger line of the family, who were thereupon incorporated into the [[enfeoffment]]. The current structure, a timber-framed manor house, was built in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Rathmann98\" />\n\n=== The farming village of Eversen ===\nIn 1378 a Celle tax register named three full-time farmers (''Vollbauern'') as taxpayers to the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|Duke of Celle]].<ref>Sudendorf - ''Urkundenbuch  zur Geschichte der Herz\u00f6ge von Braunschweig und L\u00fcneburg und ihrer Lande'', Vol. V. Hanover, 1865</ref> Because the register only lists those farms belonging to the duke under the manorial system, it cannot be ascertained whether, at that time, other farms already existed.<ref name=\"G\u00e4dcke132\">G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.132 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref> Shortly thereaftere there was a division of the three farms that were subservient to the duke into three [[Cotter (farmer)|cotter]] farms. In the Celle revenue record of 1381, five farms are recorded as being obligated to the Duke of Celle. In addition there was a farm belonging to Eversen's ''Gut II'', so that at that time it can be reckoned that there were 6 manorial farms under the Duke.<ref name=\"G\u00e4dcke132\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century the village was further extended. The enfeoffed occupants of the Eversen estates used their land to create other farms subordinate to them. In a treasury register (''Schatzregister'') from 1438 as many as twelve people are listed as paying tribute (''Schatz'').<ref>Grieser, R. (1934). ''Das Schatzregister der Grossvogtei Celle von 1438 und andere Quellen zur Bev\u00f6lkerungsgeschichte der Kreise Celle, Fallingbostel, Soltau und Burgdorf zwischen 1428 und 1442.'' Hildesheim, 1934, p. 21</ref> From the tax records it can be ascertained that, at that time, there were 3 estates (''Vollh\u00f6fen'') and 9 cotters (''K\u00f6tner'').<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.149 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries the village continued to expand. Growth halted temporarily, however, after the establishment of a cotter farm obligated to ''Gut I'' in 1692.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.197 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref> At that stage, Eversen consisted of 22 manorial farms, a community ''Hirtenhaus'' and the three manorial estates of the von Harling family. In addition there were the houses of the small farmers and [[hireling]]s. Because they only had small holdings of land and no grazing rights on the [[common land|commons]], their occupants earned their living by working on the estates or as salt drivers for the [[S\u00fclze Saltworks]].\n\nUnlike most of the other heath villages in the southern [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]], Eversen was spared from the ravages of war and pillaging or burning by hostile troops during its history.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.138 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}} G\u00e4dcke is referring here particularly to the years of the [[L\u00fcneburg War of Succession]]</ref> The surrounding [[bog]]s provided a natural defence for the village. However the contributions required from the farmers as a consequence of the [[Thirty Years War]] were a heavy burden that hindered village expansion for decades and led to the abandonment of many farms.<ref>G\u00e4dcke, Horst (1994). ''Eversen. Ein altes Dorf im Celler Land'', 1994. p.196 {{ISBN|3-930374-02-1}}</ref>\n\nTwo epidemics of the [[Black Death]] in 1581 and 1642 caused many deaths and the extinction of several family lines.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p. 188ff {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th century was characterised by extensive [[agricultural reform]]s. Fundamental to subsequent reforms was the general division (''Generalteilung'') of land at the beginning of the 19th century, whereby the villages were given fixed boundaries and every piece of land was allocated to a municipality (''[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]]''). The amount of land around the individual villages which was allocated to them was based on the grazing rights they had held in the past.\n\nThis was followed during the period 1838 to 1858 by the division of common land (''Gemeinheitsteilungen''). [[Common land]], i.e. those areas which had hitherto been shared by the community, was now transferred to the individual farms as freehold property based on their existing rights to the common land.<ref name=\"Hindersmann\" />\n\nOn the basis of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]'s 1833 redemption law, the obligations on farms under the [[manorial system]] were repealed. Farms to which the so-called [[manorial rights]] applied had been hitherto obliged to give numerous services and make frequent payments to the manor. That was now repealed on payment of 25 times the annual dues and the land was then granted under [[:wikt:freehold|freehold]] into the farmers' ownership.<ref name=\"Hindersmann\">Hindersmann, Ulrike. ''Der ritterschaftliche Adel im K\u00f6nigreich Hannover 1814-1866''  {{ISBN|3-7752-6003-X}}</ref>\n\nThese reforms led to an agricultural boom, the evidence of which can still be seen today in the numerous farmhouses that were built at that time. Another consequence of the repealing of manorial obligations was that property could be now freely sold.<ref>The manorial system, to which the farms had hitherto been tied, greatly restricted the ability to distribute real estate.</ref> That created the conditions for the establishment of new farms. In the 2nd half of the 19th century a large number of new houses appeared on the so-called ''Sandberg'' (\"Sand Hill\"), the part of Eversen east of the \u00d6rtze, and the population of the village grew markedly.<ref name=\"Website\" />\n\nNinety-nine men from Eversen took part in the [[First World War]], 29 of whom were killed.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998).

Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p.204 {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Administrative history ===\nFrom the 14th century Bergen was recorded as having a [[vogt|vogtei's]] office, the lowest level of administration and justice, which was presided over by a ducal [[vogt]]. Subordinated to it since the 15th century was the administrative post in [[S\u00fclze (Bergen)|S\u00fclze]], which was responsible for the church parish of S\u00fclze to which Eversen belonged.<ref>Krieg, Martin. ''Die Entstehung und Entwicklung der Amtsbezirke im ehemaligen F\u00fcrstentum L\u00fcneburg'' {{ISBN|3-87898-089-2}}</ref> Matters of importance that only affected Eversen were discussed and decided by the ''Realgemeinde'', i.e. the farm owners who had [[common land]] rights. The political reforms of the 19th century brought about a fundamental change from which the political municipality of S\u00fclze arose. Participation in the resolution of village affairs was no longer dependent on ownership of property or land; instead every male villager over 25 had the right to vote.\n\n=== Religion ===\nUntil the 16th century Eversen belonged to the [[St. Lambert's Church, Bergen|parish of St. Lambert]] in [[Bergen (Landkreis Celle)|Bergen]]. Because the distance of {{convert|9|km|mi}} made regular church attendance difficult or, in bad weather on the muddy paths, impossible, a chapel was built in 1475 at the neighbouring village of [[S\u00fclze (Bergen)|S\u00fclze]], which was overseen by the pastor at Bergen. In 1502 an endowment was given by the owner of Eversen's ''Gut I'', which gave Eversen its own [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectorate]]. Since then Eversen has belonged to the [[Church of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian, S\u00fclze|parish of S\u00fclze]].<ref>*Kirchengemeinde S\u00fclze - Festschrift zum Jubil\u00e4umsjahr 2004</ref>\n\n=== Eversen since 1929 ===\nIn the course of a municipal reform in 1929 the hitherto independent villages of [[Altensalzkoth]] and [[Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel]] and the farmstead of [[Kohlenbach]] were incorporated into the parish of Eversen.\n\nIn 1934 with the change of office, Albert Buhr became the first [[Nazi]] ''[[B\u00fcrgermeister]]''. In the elections to the German [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] 30% of the votes went to the [[NSDAP]]; in 1933 this had risen to 60%.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen. Ein Haus- und Lesebuch'', 1998. p.207 {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\nEversen was unaffected by the hostilities [[Second World War]], although a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] crashed into the garden of an Eversen farmer during an air battle in the area of [[Hanover]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]. One of the two pilots died in the crash, the other was able to save himself by [[parachuting]] out. A total of 182 Eversen villagers took part in the war, 84 of whom died.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998).

In 1945 and 1946 the so-called logging [[War reparations|reparations]] resulted in about 120,000 - 150,000 cubic metres of wood being felled in the parish of Eversen.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998).

In the years that followed, many new houses were built on the ''Sandberg''  and the number of inhabitants rose sharply. Whilst this growth resulted in a very different appearance in the surrounding villages, the 'old village' (''alte Dorf'') largely retained its character and appearance and, even today, is dominated by timber-framed houses.\n\nAs part of the Lower Saxon regional and administrative reforms in 1973, Eversen lost its independence and, since then, has been a municipality within the borough of [[Bergen (Landkreis Celle)|Bergen]].\n\nIn 1972 Hurricane [[Cyclone Quimburga|Quimburga]], which destroyed 10% of the woodland area in [[Lower Saxony]], also caused considerable damage in the municipality of Eversen. The [[fire on the L\u00fcneburg Heath]] in 1975 destroyed large areas of woodland in the Kohlenbach, which belongs to Eversen, as well as on ''Eversen Mathheide'' heath.  In 1997 another [[storm]] caused massive damage, during which most of the ''Gehege'', a wood adjacent to ''Gut I'' was blown down.\n\n[[File:EversenDtschHs.jpg|thumb|The ''Gasthaus Niedersachsen'', scene of the 1988 TV series, Petticoat]]\nIn 1988 a television team was looking for a Lower Saxon village that had survived in its original state, with cobblestones, old farmhouses and a [[corner shop]]. In Eversen they discovered all of these things. They wanted to film village life in the 1950s. Under the direction of Wigbert Wicker many of the scenes were filmed in the ''Gasthaus Niedersachsen'' (\"Lower Saxony Inn\"), a [[Lower Saxon house]] still largely preserved in its original state. The planned conversion of a shop in the village, which was also the location of many scenes, was delayed whilst filming took place. Well-known German actors and actresses such as Timothy Peach,  Ulrich Pleitgen, Konstantin Graudus, Ferdinand Dux and Doris Kunstmann starred. Six episodes were filmed. The first broadcast under the name of ''Petticoat'' took place on 9 November 1989 on [[Das Erste]].<ref>http://www.fernsehserien.de/index.php?serie=2342 Information on the series, ''Petticoat''</ref>\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 2000 Eversen had 1,426 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Website\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bergen-online.de/Geschichte/Orte/Eversen.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531202641/http://www.bergen-online.de/Geschichte/Orte/Eversen.htm |archive-date=2007-05-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 1821 regular censuses have been carried out that give a clear picture of the pattern of population in Eversen.

Since the end of the [[Second World War]], however, [[High German]] has largely superseded it. However, Low German continues to be used colloquially especially amongst the older members of the village.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe majority of the Eversen population is [[Protestant|Protestant evangelical]] and the parish responsible for the village is the Church of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian in S\u00fclze. In 1993 only 90 inhabitants belonged to the [[Roman Catholic]] parish in Bergen, which is responsible for Eversen.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen.

Eversen is represented by a local council (''Ortsrat'') and a council chairman (''Ortsb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is empowered, ''inter alia'', to make decisions about public services in the village, is responsible for maintaining the appearance of the village and for overseeing its clubs and societies, and has to be consulted by the town of Bergen on all important matters affecting the village.<ref>[http://cdl.niedersachsen.de/blob/images/C39734080_L20.pdf Information about the Lower Saxony Community Constitution]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It consists of five elected representatives who, together with the chairman, sit on the Bergen borough council. The village council elects its own chair. The current incumbent is Gerd Friedrich (CDU).<ref name=\"Website\" />\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n[[File:Gasthausniedersachsen.jpg|thumb|right|A timber-framed house (''[[Fachhallenhaus]]'') in Eversen built in 1877.]]\nIn the ''alten Dorf'' part of Eversen along the village street there are numerous [[Vierst\u00e4nderhaus|four-post, timber-framed houses]] from the 19th century and which are [[listed building]]s today. Opposite the ''M\u00fchlenteich'' (\"Millpond\") is ''Peets Schmidt Kote'', a [[Zweist\u00e4nderhaus|two-post house]] dating to 1754, one of the oldest, surviving farmhouses in the region.\n\nThe three manor houses, with buildings from the 17th (''Gut&nbsp;II'') and 18th (''Gut&nbsp;I'' and ''Gut&nbsp;III)'' centuries are also protected.<ref>Die Kunstdenkmale des Landkreis Celle, Part 1, p. 127 ff.</ref>\n\nIn the municipality of Eversen are several natural monuments including the entire group of trees at ''Gut I'' known as the ''Eichenhof'' (\"Oak Grove\") as well as an ancient oak, over 400 years old, on the edge of the ''Gehege''.\n\n=== Realgemeinde Eversen ===\nUntil the agrarian reforms of the 19th century and the associated division of land that had previously been owned in common, those with grazing rights on these common areas were the decision makers in village affairs. In the 19th century, therefore, the ''Realgemeinde'' suffered a major loss of influence and importance, but was reformed in 1892 as a [[public body]]. Its task was the management of those woodlands that remained in the ownership of the village council. Its members continued to be those who were entitled to be on the council, i.e. the owners of the 21 farms and the three manorial estates. In 1974 the remaining woods were divided among the members, only one in the parish of [[S\u00fclze (Bergen)|S\u00fclze]], with an area of 72 'morgen' was left under the jurisdiction of the ''Realgemeinde''.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen'', p. 288ff  {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Societies ===\nThe Eversen Shooting Club of 1745 (''Sch\u00fctzenverein Eversen von 1745'') plays an important role in the village life of Eversen. It has over 470 village members and lays on numerous club events as well as the annual 'shooting festival' or ''Sch\u00fctzenfest''. Eversen Shooting Club also has a marching band which arranges a large number of trips and performs several marching displays every year.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\">Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen'', p. 411ff  {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 the Eversen Angling Club (''Fischerei-Verein Eversen'') was founded; today it has over 70 members. In addition to managing a 3.5&nbsp;km long section of the river \u00d6rtze, the club has rented a gravel pond in Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel. On both water bodies there are regular fishing competitions. In addition the club looks after the ''Bruchbach'' in Eversen. In the \u00d6rtze attempts have been made in recent years to re-introduce the long-extinct [[salmon]] into the local rivers again.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\nThe Eversen Male Voice Choir (''M\u00e4nnergesangverein Eversen von 1888'') was founded in 1888 and re-activated in 2006. MGV Eversen has about 25 male singers.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\nThe amateur dramatic society founded in the 1950s and known as the ''Dorfb\u00fchne Eversen'' (Eversen Village Stage) has to date put on a play of up to 3 acts every year. The society comprises a large number of amateur actors who put a lot of effort into their hobby and persuade many Eversen villagers, including numerous young people, to go to the ''Gasthaus Niedersachsen'' every year.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\nSince 1962 there has been a group of first-aid workers, who train in civil protection, provide first-aid at events and run blood-donation clinics. Together with the Junior Red Cross they collect and sell paper for recycling from the villagers.<ref name=\"Rathmann411\" />\n\n== Economy and Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:Hofotte1.jpg|thumb|right|Walter Otte Farm - the last arable full-time farm in Eversen]]\nToday agriculture has largely lost its former importance. Apart from a few businesses which are involved in agriculture as a sideline, there is only one full-time farm left.\n\nImportant economic drivers today are Landhandel Otte, an agricultural wholesalers, and the Heinrich Harling sawmill.  Other medium-sized businesses in Eversen include the Klaus Otte garage, Thomas Dienelt the wrought ironmonger, Dieter Rossmann the joiner,  Reinhard Peisker the timber-framing specialists, Ulrike Preusse the hairdressing salon and Norbert Herrmann the villager bakery.\n\nIn recent years tourism has also become increasingly important. Within the municipality of Eversen, the village of Altensalzkoth is home to the ''Hotel Helm'', Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel has a country caf\u00e9, the ''Mielmannshof'', and Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel Manor House rents holiday apartments.<ref>[http://www.feuerschuetzenbostel.de Website of the Feuersch\u00fctzenbostel Manor House]</ref>\n\n=== Transport ===\nEversen lies on state road (''Landesstra\u00dfe'') L 240 which runs from Celle to Hermannsburg. From 1902 to 1975 Eversen Station was part of a minor railway line (''[[Kleinbahn]]'') that linked the village with the town of Bergen and, following an upgrade of the line in later years, also with [[Hermannsburg]] and [[Celle]]. Buses on the [[Celle]] - [[Fa\u00dfberg]] route operated by [[CeBus]] stop several times a day in Eversen and link the place with the surrounding villages.<ref>[http://www.cebus-celle.de/pdfs/Linienplannetzplan_Landkreis_03_2008.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} CeBus Celle's bus route network</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:Grundschule-Eversen.jpg|thumb|right|Eversen Primary School]]\nThe first indications of a [[school]] in Eversen date to the year 1673 when the [[schoolmaster]], Friedrich Bussmann, was mentioned in a historical record. Teaching took place in the teacher's private residence who lived in the ''Hirtenhaus'' belonging to the village community. Not until 1820 did Eversen get its own school building, but this had to be demolished only 67 years later due to its dilapidated state. Its successor, completed in 1884, was used as a school until 1950. But when school numbers increased, particularly as a result of the influx of [[refugees]], a new building needed. Since then this has housed the Eversen [[Primary School]] (''Grundschule''), where 4 teachers educate an average of 80 children.<ref name=\"Rathmann249\">Rathmann, Franz (1998). ''Dorfbuch Eversen'', p. 249ff  {{ISBN|3-921744-09-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Kindergarten ===\nPrior to the 1990s the [[kindergarten]] in S\u00fclze and a children's play group run by the German Red Cross in Sandbergsfeld were responsible for children in Eversen. The increasing number of children would have entailed an expansion of the S\u00fclze facility; instead it was decided to build a new kindergarten in Eversen in the 1990s. The new kindergarten is in the middle of the village and has places for about 50 children, looked after by 2 child care workers and 2 nursery nurses. On 1 February 1995 the facility was opened.<ref name=\"Rathmann249\" />\n\n=== Sewage works ===\nUntil the 1960s individual farms were responsible for their own [[waste disposal]]. As part of the expansion of the road network in the early 1960s, however, work began on a [[sewage system]] that enabled centralised waste disposal for the first time. In 1965 the municipalities of Eversen and S\u00fclze agreed to establish a [[sewage farm]], which went into operation in 1973. In the course of the years the neighbouring villages of Diesten, Huxahl, Offen, Altensalzkoth and Hassel were also added to the sewage system.<ref>Rathmann, Franz (1998).

The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new [[Scottish Professional Football League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22864944 |title=Scottish Football League clubs vote in favour of a proposed merger with the Scottish Premier League. |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref> with its top division being known as the [[Scottish Premiership]]. A total of [[List of Scottish Premier League clubs|19 clubs]] competed in the SPL, but only the [[Old Firm]] clubs, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] won the league championship.\n\n==Background==\nFor most of its history, the [[Scottish Football League]] had a two divisional structure (Divisions One and Two) between which clubs were [[promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]] at the end of each season. However, by the mid-1970s, this organisation was perceived to be stagnant, and it was decided to split into a three divisional structure: [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] (formerly Division One), [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] (formerly Division Two) and a newly added [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This system came into force for the [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376 season]]. This setup continued until the [[1994\u201395 in Scottish football|1994\u201395 season]], when a four divisional structure was introduced. This involved the creation of a [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], with all four divisions consisting of ten clubs.\n\nOn 8 September 1997, the clubs in the Premier Division decided to split from the Scottish Football League and form a Scottish Premier League. This followed [[Premier League#Foundation|an earlier example in England]], which came into force during the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. This decision was fuelled by a desire by the top clubs in Scotland to retain more of the revenue generated by the game. Originally, league sponsorship money was divided proportionally between clubs in all four divisions. After the SPL was formed, its clubs retained all of its commercial revenues except for an annual payment to the SFL and a parachute payment to recently relegated clubs.\n\n==Competition format==\n[[File:Edinburgh Derby 2006.jpg|thumb|Hearts take on Hibernian in an [[Edinburgh Derby]] played at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]] in December 2006]]\nTeams received three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points were awarded for a loss. Teams were ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points was crowned [[list of Scottish football champions|league champion]]. If points were equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner.\n\n===Split===\nOriginally the SPL contained 10 clubs, but it subsequently enlarged to 12 for the [[2000\u201301 in Scottish football|2000\u201301 season]] and retained this structure until 2013. The increase from 10 clubs to 12 was part of the deal offered to obtain approval from SFL member clubs. After the expansion to 12 clubs, the SPL operated a \"split\" format. This was done to prevent the need for a 44-match schedule, based on playing each other four times. That format had been used in the Scottish Premier Division but was considered to be too high a number of matches in a league season.\n\nA season, which runs from August (except in [[2011\u201312 in Scottish football|2011\u201312]], when that season began in July) until May, was divided into two phases. During the first phase, each club played three matches against every other team, either once at home and twice away, or ''vice versa''. After this first phase of matches, by which time all clubs had played 33 matches, the league split into a \"top six\"  and a \"bottom six\". Each club then played a further five matches against the other five teams in their own section. Points achieved during the first phase of 33 matches were carried forward to the second phase, but the teams competed only within their own sections during the second phase. After the first phase was completed, clubs could not move out of their own section in the league, even if they achieved more or fewer points than a higher or lower ranked team, respectively.\n\nAt the beginning of each season, the SPL \"predicted\" the likely positions of each club in order to produce a fixture schedule that ensured the best possible chance of all clubs playing each other twice at home and twice away. This was known as the league seeding and was based on clubs' performance in previous years.<ref name=\"SPL stand by their split decision\">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_19990808/ai_n13940102/pg_1|work=[[Sunday Herald]]|title=SPL stand by their split decision|date=8 August 1999|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> If a club did not finish in the half where it was predicted to finish, it faced the possibility of playing an unequal number of home and away matches.

These promotion criteria sometimes caused controversy. In 2003, the chairmen of the member clubs voted against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]'s proposed ground share with [[Airdrieonians F.C.|Airdrie United]] and stopped the club from having the 10,000 capacity stadium it required, therefore saving [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] from relegation.<ref name=\"Falkirk lose out as SPL closes ranks and denies them place\">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/spl/Falkirk-lose-out-as-SPL.2430042.jp|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|title=Falkirk lose out as SPL closes ranks and denies them place|author=Jonathan Coates|date=24 May 2003|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe same situation nearly materialised in 2004.

No team outside the Old Firm has won the [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championship]] since 1985. Until Rangers were ejected from the SPL due to [[administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc|their liquidation]], there was only one SPL season ([[2005\u201306 in Scottish football|2005\u201306]]) where both clubs failed to occupy first and second positions, with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] finishing second behind Celtic.<ref name = \"low in att\">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/top-football-stories/low-in-attendance-low-in-achievement-the-spl-s-dismal-legacy-of-failure-1-2409692|title=Low in attendance, low in achievement  \u2013 the SPL\u2019s dismal legacy of failure|work=sport.scotsman.com|publisher=Johnston Press|first=Ewing|last=Grahame|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> While other European leagues were dominated by a few clubs in the 2000s, the Old Firm dominance in Scotland dated back to the beginning of Scottish league football, with a few exceptional periods. The average home attendances of both clubs is significantly higher than the other Scottish clubs, which resulted in the Old Firm having far greater revenues and therefore more money to spend on players. Both clubs also received significant revenues from participation in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nDespite having more resources than other Scottish clubs, the Old Firm experienced difficulty in competing with big clubs from other leagues in terms of transfer fees and player wages due to the SPL's relatively low television revenue. A recurring theme during the existence of the SPL was the prospect of the two clubs leaving the Scottish football set-up to join the [[English football league system]], an [[Atlantic League (football)|Atlantic League]] with clubs from countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, or forming a new [[European Super League (association football)|European Super League]].<ref name=\"Dutch resurrect Atlantic League\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/1947226.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Dutch resurrect Atlantic League|date=24 April 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"strachan\"/> While some observers believed the departure of the Old Firm from the Scottish football setup would be detrimental to Scottish football as a whole,<ref name=\"Blatter opposes Old Firm switch\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/7284560.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Blatter opposes Old Firm switch|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Old Firm urged to talk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1983550.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Old Firm urged to talk|date=12 May 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> others, such as [[Craig Levein]], believed it would benefit Scottish football due to increased competition among the remaining clubs for the SPL title.<ref name=\"Levein wants Old Firm kicked out\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/1916159.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Levein wants Old Firm kicked out|date=7 April 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> World football's governing body [[FIFA]] ruled out the prospect of any Old Firm move to the English set-up.<ref name=\"Fifa writes off Old Firm hopes\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1465004.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Fifa writes off Old Firm hopes|date=30 July 2001|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> The duopoly was effectively broken when Rangers entered [[administration (British football)|administration]] in 2012 and was liquidated after it failed to reach an agreement with creditors.

This rule stated that each club must include at least three players under the age of 21 in its matchday squad. Opinions on this rule were divided among SPL managers.

The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new [[Scottish Professional Football League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22864944 |title=Scottish Football League clubs vote in favour of a proposed merger with the Scottish Premier League. |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref> with its top division being known as the [[Scottish Premiership]]. A total of [[List of Scottish Premier League clubs|19 clubs]] competed in the SPL, but only the [[Old Firm]] clubs, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] won the league championship.\n\n==Background==\nFor most of its history, the [[Scottish Football League]] had a two divisional structure (Divisions One and Two) between which clubs were [[promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]] at the end of each season. However, by the mid-1970s, this organisation was perceived to be stagnant, and it was decided to split into a three divisional structure: [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] (formerly Division One), [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] (formerly Division Two) and a newly added [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This system came into force for the [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376 season]]. This setup continued until the [[1994\u201395 in Scottish football|1994\u201395 season]], when a four divisional structure was introduced. This involved the creation of a [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], with all four divisions consisting of ten clubs.\n\nOn 8 September 1997, the clubs in the Premier Division decided to split from the Scottish Football League and form a Scottish Premier League. This followed [[Premier League#Foundation|an earlier example in England]], which came into force during the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. This decision was fuelled by a desire by the top clubs in Scotland to retain more of the revenue generated by the game. Originally, league sponsorship money was divided proportionally between clubs in all four divisions. After the SPL was formed, its clubs retained all of its commercial revenues except for an annual payment to the SFL and a parachute payment to recently relegated clubs.\n\n==Competition format==\n[[File:Edinburgh Derby 2006.jpg|thumb|Hearts take on Hibernian in an [[Edinburgh Derby]] played at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]] in December 2006]]\nTeams received three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points were awarded for a loss. Teams were ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points was crowned [[list of Scottish football champions|league champion]]. If points were equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner.\n\n===Split===\nOriginally the SPL contained 10 clubs, but it subsequently enlarged to 12 for the [[2000\u201301 in Scottish football|2000\u201301 season]] and retained this structure until 2013. The increase from 10 clubs to 12 was part of the deal offered to obtain approval from SFL member clubs. After the expansion to 12 clubs, the SPL operated a \"split\" format. This was done to prevent the need for a 44-match schedule, based on playing each other four times. That format had been used in the Scottish Premier Division but was considered to be too high a number of matches in a league season.\n\nA season, which runs from August (except in [[2011\u201312 in Scottish football|2011\u201312]], when that season began in July) until May, was divided into two phases. During the first phase, each club played three matches against every other team, either once at home and twice away, or ''vice versa''. After this first phase of matches, by which time all clubs had played 33 matches, the league split into a \"top six\"  and a \"bottom six\". Each club then played a further five matches against the other five teams in their own section. Points achieved during the first phase of 33 matches were carried forward to the second phase, but the teams competed only within their own sections during the second phase. After the first phase was completed, clubs could not move out of their own section in the league, even if they achieved more or fewer points than a higher or lower ranked team, respectively.\n\nAt the beginning of each season, the SPL \"predicted\" the likely positions of each club in order to produce a fixture schedule that ensured the best possible chance of all clubs playing each other twice at home and twice away. This was known as the league seeding and was based on clubs' performance in previous years.<ref name=\"SPL stand by their split decision\">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_19990808/ai_n13940102/pg_1|work=[[Sunday Herald]]|title=SPL stand by their split decision|date=8 August 1999|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> If a club did not finish in the half where it was predicted to finish, it faced the possibility of playing an unequal number of home and away matches.

In April 2007, [[Craig Levein]] labelled it as \"rubbish\" and a \"nonsense\", claiming it resulted in lost revenue for clubs and put more pressure on managers,<ref name=\"Levein SPL Split\">{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-161704189 |work=Daily Mail |location=UK|title=The SPL split makes no sense, insists Levein SPL split is a nonsense, insists Craig|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> while Rangers manager [[Walter Smith]] branded the format as \"unfair\" and called for an 18-team league to be considered.<ref name=\"Smith SPL Split\">{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-162408933 |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |title=Smith in blast at SPL split decision|date=21 April 2007|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> However, the SPL defended the split format, dismissing the possibility of expanding the league due to a lack of strong enough clubs within the [[Scottish Football League]].<ref name=\"SPL stand by their split decision\"/> In March 2008, Kilmarnock manager [[Jim Jefferies (footballer)|Jim Jefferies]] was the latest to call for a league revamp, claiming the potential for four matches per season against the same opponent was too many.<ref name=\"Jefferies league revamp\">{{cite news |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/scottishpremier/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/08/03/20/SOCCER_Kilmarnock_Nightlead.html&TEAMHD=scotspremiership|publisher=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]|title=Jefferies wants a new-look league|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nThe bottom placed SPL club at the end of the season was relegated, and swapped places with the winner of the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]], provided that the winner satisfied the SPL entry criteria. These promotion criteria sometimes caused controversy. In 2003, the chairmen of the member clubs voted against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]'s proposed ground share with [[Airdrieonians F.C.|Airdrie United]] and stopped the club from having the 10,000 capacity stadium it required, therefore saving [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] from relegation.<ref name=\"Falkirk lose out as SPL closes ranks and denies them place\">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/spl/Falkirk-lose-out-as-SPL.2430042.jp|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|title=Falkirk lose out as SPL closes ranks and denies them place|author=Jonathan Coates|date=24 May 2003|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe same situation nearly materialised in 2004. After several votes and discussion, including threats of court cases from [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], the team threatened with relegation, [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] were promoted on the basis that they would ground share with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]].<ref name=\"Inverness win SPL vote\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/3828873.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Inverness win SPL vote|date=22 June 2004|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> In 2005, the stadium size criterion for entry to the SPL was reduced to 6,000,<ref name=\"Inverness are homeward bound\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/4076125.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Inverness are homeward bound|date=7 June 2004|accessdate=25 March 2008}}</ref> thereby allowing Inverness Caledonian Thistle to return to their home stadium during the [[2005\u201306 Scottish Premier League|2005\u201306 season]].<ref name=\"Inverness are homeward bound\"/>\n\n===Old Firm dominance===\n[[Image:Oldfirm.jpg|thumb|Both sets of fans at an [[Old Firm]] match at [[Celtic Park]]]]\nOne of the main criticisms of the SPL was the dominance of the two [[Old Firm]] clubs, Celtic and Rangers. No team outside the Old Firm has won the [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championship]] since 1985. Until Rangers were ejected from the SPL due to [[administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc|their liquidation]], there was only one SPL season ([[2005\u201306 in Scottish football|2005\u201306]]) where both clubs failed to occupy first and second positions, with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] finishing second behind Celtic.<ref name = \"low in att\">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/top-football-stories/low-in-attendance-low-in-achievement-the-spl-s-dismal-legacy-of-failure-1-2409692|title=Low in attendance, low in achievement  \u2013 the SPL\u2019s dismal legacy of failure|work=sport.scotsman.com|publisher=Johnston Press|first=Ewing|last=Grahame|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> While other European leagues were dominated by a few clubs in the 2000s, the Old Firm dominance in Scotland dated back to the beginning of Scottish league football, with a few exceptional periods. The average home attendances of both clubs is significantly higher than the other Scottish clubs, which resulted in the Old Firm having far greater revenues and therefore more money to spend on players. Both clubs also received significant revenues from participation in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nDespite having more resources than other Scottish clubs, the Old Firm experienced difficulty in competing with big clubs from other leagues in terms of transfer fees and player wages due to the SPL's relatively low television revenue. A recurring theme during the existence of the SPL was the prospect of the two clubs leaving the Scottish football set-up to join the [[English football league system]], an [[Atlantic League (football)|Atlantic League]] with clubs from countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, or forming a new [[European Super League (association football)|European Super League]].<ref name=\"Dutch resurrect Atlantic League\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/1947226.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Dutch resurrect Atlantic League|date=24 April 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"strachan\"/> While some observers believed the departure of the Old Firm from the Scottish football setup would be detrimental to Scottish football as a whole,<ref name=\"Blatter opposes Old Firm switch\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/7284560.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Blatter opposes Old Firm switch|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Old Firm urged to talk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1983550.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Old Firm urged to talk|date=12 May 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> others, such as [[Craig Levein]], believed it would benefit Scottish football due to increased competition among the remaining clubs for the SPL title.<ref name=\"Levein wants Old Firm kicked out\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/1916159.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Levein wants Old Firm kicked out|date=7 April 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> World football's governing body [[FIFA]] ruled out the prospect of any Old Firm move to the English set-up.<ref name=\"Fifa writes off Old Firm hopes\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1465004.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Fifa writes off Old Firm hopes|date=30 July 2001|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> The duopoly was effectively broken when Rangers entered [[administration (British football)|administration]] in 2012 and was liquidated after it failed to reach an agreement with creditors.

All players with EU nationality, including those able to claim an EU passport through a parent or grandparent, were eligible to play, and top players from outside the EU were able to obtain UK work permits.\n\nThe only restriction on selection was the \"Under-21 rule\". This rule stated that each club must include at least three players under the age of 21 in its matchday squad. Opinions on this rule were divided among SPL managers.

This battle was part of the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. \nThe attempt by the [[Boxers (group)|Boxers]] to eradicate this presence, as well as [[Chinese christian|Chinese Christian]] converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight [[Eight-Nation Alliance|foreign powers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref> During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the [[Hanlin Academy]] and the (new) [[Summer Palace]].\nA [[peace agreement]] was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government [[Li Hongzhang|Li Hung-chang]] and [[Yikuang|Prince Ching]] on 7 September 1901.  The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of $335 million (over $4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years.  Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China.

Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially [[Yanqing County]] and [[Huairou District]], are dominated by the [[Jundu Mountains]], while the western part is framed by ''Xishan'' or the [[Western Hills]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. [[Mount Ling (Beijing)|Mount Dongling]], in the Western Hills and on the border with [[Hebei]], is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|2303|m}}.\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the [[Chaobai River|Chaobai]], [[Yongding River|Yongding]], [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], are all tributaries in the [[Hai River]] system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] to [[Hangzhou]], which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]], constructed in the past decade to bring water from the [[Yangtze River]] basin.\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}, occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]].  The [[Second Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]] traces the [[Beijing city wall|old city walls]] and the [[Sixth Ring Road]] connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. [[Tian'anmen]] and [[Tian'anmen Square]] are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the [[Forbidden City]], the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of China's current leaders. [[Chang'an Avenue]], which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east\u2013west axis.\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n{{wide image|The Forbidden City - View from Coal Hill.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|A panorama of the [[Forbidden City]], viewed from the [[Jingshan Park]]}}\n\n{{Wide image|File:Beijing skyline from northeast 4th ring road.jpg|800px|The skyline of eastern Beijing, including [[Beijing CBD]], [[Chaoyang Park]], and East [[5th Ring Road]] at dusk}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Beijing}}\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive [[Tian'anmen]] (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] and the [[Temple of Heaven]]. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Business Buide to Beijing and North-East China |edition=2006\u20132007 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M2TvFN9DmqkC&pg=PA108&dq=%22sino-sov%22+%2Barchitecture |page=108 |isbn=978-988-98673-3-1 |year=2006 |publisher=China Briefing Media |location=Hong Kong |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the [[Beijing CBD]] in east Beijing such as the new [[CCTV Headquarters]], in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the [[Beijing National Stadium]] and [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)|National Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the [[CTBUH Skyscraper Award]] for best overall tall building twice, for the [[Linked Hybrid]] building in 2009 and the [[CCTV Headquarters]] in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and [[neofuturistic]] style of architecture can be seen at the [[798 Art Zone]], which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's current completed tallest building is the 330-meter [[China World Trade Center Tower III]], but will be surpassed by the 528-meter [[China Zun]] in 2018 when it is completed. Both buildings are in the [[Beijing CBD]].\n\n[[File:Doujiao Hutong.jpg|thumb|The sign of Doujiao [[Hutong]], one of the many traditional alleyways in the inner city]]\nBeijing is famous for its ''[[siheyuan]]s'', a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the [[Prince Gong Mansion]] and [[Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling (Beijing)|Residence of Soong Ching-ling]]. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called ''[[hutong]]s''. The ''hutongs'' are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good [[Feng Shui]].

The Beijing Buddhist Association along with the Buddhist Choir and Orchestra are based in the [[Guanghua Temple (Beijing)|Guanghua Temple]], which dates to the Yuan dynasty over 700 years ago. The Buddhist Academy of China and its library are housed in the [[Fayuan Temple]] near Caishikou. The Fayuan Temple, which dates to the Tang dynasty 1300 years ago, is the oldest temple in urban Beijing. The Tongjiao Temple inside Dongzhimen is the city's only Buddhist nunnery.\n\nThe West Yellow Temple originally dates to the Liao dynasty.

Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially [[Yanqing County]] and [[Huairou District]], are dominated by the [[Jundu Mountains]], while the western part is framed by ''Xishan'' or the [[Western Hills]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. [[Mount Ling (Beijing)|Mount Dongling]], in the Western Hills and on the border with [[Hebei]], is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|2303|m}}.\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the [[Chaobai River|Chaobai]], [[Yongding River|Yongding]], [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], are all tributaries in the [[Hai River]] system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] to [[Hangzhou]], which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]], constructed in the past decade to bring water from the [[Yangtze River]] basin.\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}, occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]].  The [[Second Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]] traces the [[Beijing city wall|old city walls]] and the [[Sixth Ring Road]] connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. [[Tian'anmen]] and [[Tian'anmen Square]] are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the [[Forbidden City]], the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of China's current leaders. [[Chang'an Avenue]], which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east\u2013west axis.\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n{{wide image|The Forbidden City - View from Coal Hill.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|A panorama of the [[Forbidden City]], viewed from the [[Jingshan Park]]}}\n\n{{Wide image|File:Beijing skyline from northeast 4th ring road.jpg|800px|The skyline of eastern Beijing, including [[Beijing CBD]], [[Chaoyang Park]], and East [[5th Ring Road]] at dusk}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Beijing}}\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive [[Tian'anmen]] (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] and the [[Temple of Heaven]]. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Business Buide to Beijing and North-East China |edition=2006\u20132007 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M2TvFN9DmqkC&pg=PA108&dq=%22sino-sov%22+%2Barchitecture |page=108 |isbn=978-988-98673-3-1 |year=2006 |publisher=China Briefing Media |location=Hong Kong |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the [[Beijing CBD]] in east Beijing such as the new [[CCTV Headquarters]], in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the [[Beijing National Stadium]] and [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)|National Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the [[CTBUH Skyscraper Award]] for best overall tall building twice, for the [[Linked Hybrid]] building in 2009 and the [[CCTV Headquarters]] in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and [[neofuturistic]] style of architecture can be seen at the [[798 Art Zone]], which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's current completed tallest building is the 330-meter [[China World Trade Center Tower III]], but will be surpassed by the 528-meter [[China Zun]] in 2018 when it is completed. Both buildings are in the [[Beijing CBD]].\n\n[[File:Doujiao Hutong.jpg|thumb|The sign of Doujiao [[Hutong]], one of the many traditional alleyways in the inner city]]\nBeijing is famous for its ''[[siheyuan]]s'', a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the [[Prince Gong Mansion]] and [[Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling (Beijing)|Residence of Soong Ching-ling]]. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called ''[[hutong]]s''. The ''hutongs'' are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good [[Feng Shui]].

Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: [[Beijing-Shanghai Railway|Shanghai (Jinghu Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway|Guangzhou (Jingguang Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway|Kowloon (Jingjiu Line)]], [[Beijing-Harbin Railway|Harbin (Jingha Line)]], [[Beijing-Baotou Railway|Baotou (Jingbao Line)]], [[Beijing-Qinhuangdao Railway|Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Chengde Railway|Chengde (Jingcheng Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Tongliao Railway|Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Yuanping Railway|Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line)]] and [[Fengtai\u2013Shacheng Railway|Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line)]]. In addition, the [[Datong\u2013Qinhuangdao Railway]] passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\nBeijing also has three [[high-speed rail]] lines: the [[Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway]], which opened in 2008; the [[Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2011; and the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong High-Speed Railway|Beijing\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2012.\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the [[Beijing railway station]], which opened in 1959; the [[Beijing West railway station]], which opened in 1996; and the [[Beijing South railway station]], which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008. {{as of|2010|July|1}}, Beijing railway station had 173 trains arriving daily, Beijing West had 232 trains and Beijing South had 163. The [[Beijing North railway station]], first built in 1909 and expanded in 2009, had 22 trains.\n\nSmaller stations in the city including [[Beijing East railway station]] handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. The [[Fengtai railway station]] has been closed for renovation. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330191134/http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 March 2006 |script-title=zh:\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u706b\u8f66\u7ad9\u5927\u5168 |website=oklx.com |accessdate=8 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nFrom Beijing, [[Passenger rail transport in China|direct passenger train service]] is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to [[Mongolia]], Russia, [[Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]]. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their [[railroad direction|direction]] in relation to Beijing.\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\n{{further|Expressways of Beijing|China National Highways of Beijing}}\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Nine [[expressways of China]] serve Beijing, as do eleven [[China National Highway]]s. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the five \"[[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]]\" that concentrically surround the city, with the [[Forbidden City]] area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The [[2nd Ring Road]] is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] progressively as they extend outwards, with the [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] outward. A final outer orbital, the [[G95 Capital Area Loop Expressway|Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95)]], was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring [[Tianjin]] and [[Hebei]].\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.<ref>\n{{cite news |title=Beijingers spend lives on road as traffic congestion worsens |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |work=China Daily |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=6 October 2003 |accessdate=22 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724004854/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |archive-date=24 July 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour.
