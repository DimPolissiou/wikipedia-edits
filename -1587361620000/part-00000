It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8 billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.   Combined, these volunteer activities will be the largest volunteer event in history. <ref>[https://www.earthday.org/campaigns/greatglobalcleanup/ Great Global CleanUp]</ref><ref>[https://www.earthday.org/earthday/countdown-to-2020 Earth Day 50th Anniversary]</ref><ref>[https://real-leaders.com/earth-day-take-part-in-the-biggest-volunteer-event-in-history/ Earth Day: Take Part in the Biggest Volunteer Event in History]</ref>\n* Education: Earth Day is building environmental and climate literacy worldwide. EDN will continue to work with teachers, students, innovators and thought leaders to educate and activate a new generation of environmental leaders around the world. \n* Events: Earth Day is now recognized worldwide as the planet's most significant civic engagement event each year. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked by tens of thousands of rallies and community events in every country in the world, and large-scale signature events to take place in Washington, D.C., and other global capitals.\n* Artists for the Earth: As Earth Day reaches its milestone 50th Anniversary in April 2020, nature and the environment are faced with enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change. Art must join with science to personalize climate change and disseminate it to a wider audience.<ref>[https://www.earthday.org/earthday/countdown-to-2020/ Earth Day 50th Anniversary]</ref>\n\n==The Earth Day name==\nAccording to Nelson, the moniker \"Earth Day\" was \"an obvious and logical name\" suggested by a lot of other people in the fall of 1969, including, he writes, both \"a friend of mine who had been in the field of public relations\" and \"a New York advertising executive,\" [[Julian Koenig]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gaylord Nelson Papers, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Box 231, Folder 43.</ref> Koenig, who had been on Nelson's organizing committee in 1969, has said that the idea came to him by the coincidence of his birthday with the day selected, April 22; \"Earth Day\" rhyming with \"birthday,\" the connection seemed natural.<ref name=\"tal\">{{Cite episode |title=Origin Story |url=http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |series=This American Life |airdate=June 19, 2009 |number=383 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624012919/http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nci.org/06nci/06/NCI25thAnniversary.htm |title=Statement by Paul Leventhal on the 25th Anniversary of the Nuclear Control Institute |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> Other names circulated during preparations\u2014Nelson himself continued to call it the National Environment Teach-In, but national coordinator Denis Hayes used the term Earth Day in his communications and press coverage of the event was \"practically unanimous\" in its use of \"Earth Day,\" so the name stuck.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The introduction of the name \"Earth Day\" was also claimed by John McConnell (see \"Equinox Earth Day,\" below).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://environment.about.com/od/earthday/f/who-invented-earth-day.htm |title=Who invented Earth Day? |date=|accessdate=March 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Earth Day Canada==\n[[File:Paul Tinari Officially Launching the Canadian First Earth Day on September 11, 1980.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Paul Tinari officially launched the first Canadian Earth Day on September 11, 1980 \u2013 included are [[Flora MacDonald (politician)|Flora MacDonald MP]], Ken Keyes and Dr. Ronald Watts]]\nThe first Canadian Earth Day was held on Thursday, September 11, 1980, and was organized by Paul D.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8 billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another.
