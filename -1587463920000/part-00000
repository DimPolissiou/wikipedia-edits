Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.

ultimate power of the state that makes the constitution and basic laws, and supervise and elects all following organs;\n# [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC): the permanent legislative organ which makes most laws, interprets the constitution and laws, conducts [[constitutional review]], and supervise all following organs;\n# [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], act as a ceremonial [[head of state]] in compliance with decisions made by the NPCSC, but exercises an independent power to nominate the Premier of the State Council; and the [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|Vice-President]], who has no power itself, but assist the President.\n# [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (synonymous with \"Central People's Government\"): the executive branch, whose [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] is the [[head of government]];\n# [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC): the military branch, whose [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the national armed forces including the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]];\n# [[National Supervisory Commission]] (NSC): the supervisory branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Court]] (SPC): the judicial branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] (SPP): the prosecutorial branch.\n\nThe legal power of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] is guaranteed by [[Constitution of China|the PRC Constitution]] and its position as the supreme political authority in the PRC is realised through its comprehensive control of the state, military, and media.<ref>Ralph H. Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.

The NPC and the National Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC), a consultative body whose members represent various social groups, are the main deliberative bodies of China, and are often referred to as the [[Lianghui]] (Two Assemblies).<ref>{{cite web |title = State Structure of the People's Republic of China |url = http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/stateStructure/node_3826.htm |website = \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5927\u7f51 |publisher=The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China |access-date = 2016-09-29 }}</ref>\n\nThe NPC is elected for a term of five years. It holds annual sessions every spring, usually lasting from 10 to 14 days, in the [[Great Hall of the People]] on the west side of [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing.

The line which ran through the nearby villages and seaside towns of [[Mablethorpe]], [[Sutton-on-Sea]], [[Grimoldby]], [[Saltfleetby]], [[Theddlethorpe]], [[Mumby]] and [[Willoughby, Lincolnshire|Willoughby]]. The station was the terminus on the [[Louth to Bardney Line]] which opened in 1876 but closed in 1951 to passengers and to freight traffic in 1960. Bardney was the terminus of the branch line and was on the [[Lincolnshire Loop Line]]\n\nThe station closed to passengers in 1970 along with the Mablethorpe Loop Line and the section from [[Firsby railway station|Firsby]] to Louth of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The section to Grimsby remained in use for freight traffic until December 1980 when it closed and was later removed.\n\nThe station building and Louth North Signal Box remain in situ to this day as private dwellings. All of the station site has been built on by residential and commercial outlets.\n\nThere are plans to eventually have Louth as the southern terminus of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds Railway]] which would utilise the trackbed from Louth to Holton-Le-Clay, although it will be to the north of Louth due to the station building now being occupied and the station site around it built over. This would mean Louth would have a rail connection for the first time in almost 50 years, since the closure to passengers in 1970, but at a new station site.\n\nA canal was built between 1765 and 1770 to connect Louth to the sea at Tetney. It was formally abandoned in 1924.\nA fuller account is at [[Louth Canal]].\n\nThere are regular buses connecting Louth with the nearby Grimsby, Skegness, Mablethorpe and Lincoln. There is also a direct service once a month to [[York]] and National Express coaches call at Louth bus station. All services are operated by different companies but the main one is [[Stagecoach]]. However, unlike other towns.

The line which ran through the nearby villages and seaside towns of [[Mablethorpe]], [[Sutton-on-Sea]], [[Grimoldby]], [[Saltfleetby]], [[Theddlethorpe]], [[Mumby]] and [[Willoughby, Lincolnshire|Willoughby]]. The station was the terminus on the [[Louth to Bardney Line]] which opened in 1876 but closed in 1951 to passengers and to freight traffic in 1960. Bardney was the terminus of the branch line and was on the [[Lincolnshire Loop Line]]\n\nThe station closed to passengers in 1970 along with the Mablethorpe Loop Line and the section from [[Firsby railway station|Firsby]] to Louth of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The section to Grimsby remained in use for freight traffic until December 1980 when it closed and was later removed.\n\nThe station building and Louth North Signal Box remain in situ to this day as private dwellings. All of the station site has been built on by residential and commercial outlets.\n\nThere are plans to eventually have Louth as the southern terminus of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds Railway]] which would utilise the trackbed from Louth to Holton-Le-Clay, although it will be to the north of Louth due to the station building now being occupied and the station site around it built over. This would mean Louth would have a rail connection for the first time in almost 50 years, since the closure to passengers in 1970, but at a new station site.\n\nA canal was built between 1765 and 1770 to connect Louth to the sea at Tetney. It was formally abandoned in 1924.\nA fuller account is at [[Louth Canal]].\n\nThere are regular buses connecting Louth with the nearby Grimsby, Skegness, Mablethorpe and Lincoln. There is also a direct service once a month to [[York]] and National Express coaches call at Louth bus station. All services are operated by different companies but the main one is [[Stagecoach]]. However, unlike other towns.

TRAK was a finalist for the 2011 IET Innovation Awards.<ref>IET Innovation Awards 2001 - Finalists http://conferences.theiet.org/innovation/finalists/index.cfm</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n;Architecture Description Tuple\n:An architectural description element with a named type which has a named relationship to either the same or another architecture description element e.g. <<Organisation>> A 'has part' <<Job>> B. It follows the natural language construct of Subject - [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|Predicate]] - Object - also used in [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. See [[Tuple]]. TRAK requires each tuple to be explicit.\n\n;Master Architecture View\n:Each TRAK metamodel stereotype has a master architecture view type. Within an architecture description or model each element has to be declared or shown on its master architecture view type before it can be used on any other view type.\n\n;Perspective\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 refers to an Architectural Perspective as 'Sharing of architectural models also facilitates an \"aspect-oriented\" style of architectural description'<ref>[http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/ ANSI/IEEE Std 1471 :: ISO/IEC 42010 Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems]</ref> A grouping of related and overlapping architectural views.\n\n;View\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]] refers to an architecture view as 'work product expressing the architecture of a system from the perspective of specific system concerns'. A TRAK view is defined as an Architecture Product in the TRAK metamodel. A TRAK view presents a set of Architecture Description Tuples in accordance with its governing viewpoint.\n\n;Viewpoint\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 - A viewpoint defines a set of conventions (notations, languages and model types) for constructing a certain kind of view. In TRAK a viewpoint is a specification for a single TRAK view.\n\n==TRAK Structure==\nTRAK is defined in a logical way - that is to say free of any notion of how TRAK is implemented in any tool or any architecture description language.\n\nTRAK has 24 [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoints]] which are grouped into 5 perspectives. Each viewpoint belongs to a single perspective and specifies a single [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model Architecture View|view]] (type). Each viewpoint specifies what sets of types of architectural description element and relationships (tuples) can appear. The architectural description element types and relationships are specified by the TRAK metamodel.\n\nThe logical definition of TRAK consists of 3 documents, each of which is an open source project on [[Sourceforge]]:\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document.<ref name=\"trak\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework]</ref> This controls TRAK as a whole. It defines the TRAK Architecture Perspectives, colours, bye laws (rules affecting the design of TRAK, architecture views and architecture descriptions, minimal modelling process.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Viewpoints document.<ref name=\"viewpoints\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakviewpoints TRAK00001 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Viewpoints]</ref> This defines the TRAK architecture viewpoints.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Metamodel document.<ref name=\"metamodel\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakmetamodel TRAK00002 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Metamodel]</ref> This defines the architecture description elements that can appear in a viewpoint definition.\n\n==TRAK Architecture Perspectives==\nTRAK has 5 architecture perspectives,<ref name=\"trak\"/> each of which groups together architecture viewpoints and views of an overlapping subject area:\n* Enterprise Perspective\n* Concept Perspective\n* Procurement Perspective\n* Solution Perspective\n* Management Perspective\n\n===Enterprise Perspective===\nThis perspective covers the enduring capabilities that are needed as part of the bigger enterprise.These are high level needs that everything else contributes to and form part of the long term strategic objectives that need to be managed.\n\n===Concept Perspective===\nThe concept perspective covers the logical view of what is needed in response to the capabilities required by the enterprise in the enterprise perspective. It covers the logical connection of nodes, for example a service control centre, to other nodes with no recognition of how this might be realised either by organisation or technology. It also implies no particular part of a life cycle \u2013 it covers everything from concept to disposal (\"lust to dust\"!).\n\n===Procurement Perspective===\nThe procurement perspective provides a top level view of the solution to the enterprise capability needs outlined in the enterprise perspective and developed in the concept perspective. It provides a way of showing how projects deliver the solutions described in the solution perspective to provide capability. It provides a way of showing time dependency between projects and is an essential for investigating capability gaps.\n\n===Solution Perspective===\nThe solution perspective provides views about the solution \u2013 whether proposed or realised. It covers the parts of \u2018systems\u2019 whether human or machine, their exchanges and protocols. The solution perspective describes how organisations and equipment are organised and governed. The solution perspective describes how the logical requirements outlined in the concept perspective are realised and shows how the solution(s) realise the capability needed by the enterprise and described in the enterprise perspective.\n\n===Management Perspective===\nThe management perspective provides views that describe the architectural task and those relationships that are common across other perspectives. It provides ways of defining the scope and findings of the architectural task - structuring the approach and modelling.\n\nThe management perspective provides ways of describing the normative standards that apply. It contains views that provide supporting information to aid the portability and understanding of the model(s).\n\n==TRAK Architecture Viewpoints & Views==\nEach [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model - Architecture View|architecture view]] in TRAK is specified by a corresponding [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoint]]. The viewpoint is designated using a 'p' in the numbering e.g. a CVp-01 is the architecture viewpoint that specifies a CV-01 architecture view.\n\nIn general use if there is a risk of confusion with a similarly-numbered view in another framework such as [[DODAF]] or [[MODAF]] then a namespace prefix is used e.g. TRAK::SV-01\n\nTRAK defines 24 architecture viewpoints<ref name=\"viewpoints\"/> (by comparison DODAF 2.0 has 52 views/models, MODAF 1.2.004 has 47 views and NAF 3.1 has 49 subviews <ref>Trak-community.org::Wiki::Architecture Framework Comparison http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/Architecture_Framework_Comparison</ref>)\n* Enterprise Perspective\n** EVp-01 Enterprise Goals\n** EVp-02 Capability Hierarchy\n** EVp-03 Capability Phasing\n* Concept Perspective\n** CVp-01 Concept Need\n** CVp-03 Concept Item Exchange\n** CVp-04 Concept Activity to Capability Mapping\n** CVp-05 Concept Activity\n** CVp-06 Concept Sequence\n* Procurement Perspective\n** PrVp-01 Procurement Structure\n** PrVp-02 Procurement Timeline\n** PrVp-03 Procurement Responsibility\n* Solution Perspective\n** SVp-01 Solution Structure\n** SVp-02 Solution Resource Interaction\n** SVp-03 Solution Resource Interaction to Function Mapping\n** SVp-04 Solution Function\n** SVp-05 Solution Function to Concept Activity Mapping\n** SVp-06 Solution Competence\n** SVp-07 Solution Sequence\n** SVp-11 Solution Event Causes\n** SVp-13 Solution Risk\n* Management Perspective\n** MVp-01 Architecture Description Dictionary\n** MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record\n** MVp-03 Requirements & Standards\n** MVp-04 Assurance\n\nThese defined in the TRAK Viewpoints specification.

Describes the management perspective elements and their relationships (tuples).]]\n\nThe TRAK Metamodel<ref name=\"metamodel\"/> both simplifies and extends the basic concepts within the MODAF 1.2 metamodel. It has removed and redefined stereotypes and any defence-specific constructs have been removed. The TRAK Metamodel specification contains a comparison of the TRAK metamodel at initial release against MODAF 1.2.003. This is also outlined separately.<ref>http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/TRAK:Initial_TRAK_Baseline_vs_MODAF_-_Stereotypes</ref>\n\nThe TRAK metamodel is shown below. ''Note that this is not a controlled copy''.\n\nSignificant changes vs MODAF include:\n* the TRAK metamodel is aimed at users (the MODAF M3 is an abstract UML profile intended as a specification for tool vendors to implement MODAF - there is no metamodel for users only fragments of 'simplified metamodel' which aim to represent the more complicated M3). In TRAK the metamodel shown is the master one.\n* System is central to TRAK and can represent [[hard systems]] and [[soft systems]] (in MODAF 1.2.003 System is an artefact<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/38715/20100426MODAFSVViewpointV1_2_004U.pdf MODAF Metamodel 1.2.004 MODAF version 1.2.004]</ref> and part of the Physical Architecture and cannot include non physical parts<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/38715/20100426MODAFSVViewpointV1_2_004U.pdf The MODAF System Viewpoint(SV) 26 April 2010]</ref> )\n* TRAK can represent any type of interface exchange / flow - information, energy or resource\n* TRAK can represent exchange characteristics associated with human resources - Organisations, Jobs and Roles\n* TRAK includes means to represent requirements through the Standard (document/collection) and Requirement (atomic) metamodel elements and enforced by Contract\n* TRAK includes the means to plan and describe the architecture task and architecture description and its organisation as a view (MV-02 Architecture Description Design Record)\n* other types of dependency and associations can be represented - physical, membership, responsibility extent\n* TRAK includes the means to describe assurance cases (including design verification) using the Claim - Argument - Evidence construct\n* TRAK includes the means to describe safety / security - threats/hazards, vulnerabilities, mitigations and risk and causes / impacts\n* addition of ISO/IEC 42010 concepts to represent the architectural task, architecture description and architecture views - to allow a description of the task scope, purpose, findings\n* addition of consistency rules for content that apply to the entire collection of views and context to improve navigation and visibility of content\n* rules that constrain how and in what order relationships can be made to improve the consistency of the set of views that forms the architecture description\n\nStructurally there are other changes:\n* TRAK has 24 viewpoints (vs c 47 views in MODAF)\n* the each viewpoint content is defined in terms of tuples (a node - relationship - node element construct i.e. a triple or 1,[[Tuple|tuple]] ) and has allowed and minimum acceptable content and correspondence rules with respect to other views within the architecture description because this is needed to specify a uniquely addressable path in a metamodel (specifying a block metamodel element is not sufficient on its own where there are several relationships involving the element). \n* Since ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 defines architecture in terms of the relationship of a system to its environment the smallest unit of architecture description that may appear in a TRAK architecture view is therefore the Architecture Description Tuple i.e. node - relationship - node.\n\nThe way in which TRAK is managed and released via a set of open source projects is also quite different from other enterprise architecture frameworks. All change requests and feature requests and the sentencing of them are fully visible to anyone, not restricted to those who specify or develop the framework.<ref>Sourceforge. TRAK Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=393432</ref><ref>Sourceforge. TRAK Metamodel Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=304403</ref><ref>Sourceforge. TRAK Viewpoints Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=304405</ref> Releases are under change control and all history is maintained by versioning software ([[Subversion (software)|Subversion (SVN)]]).\n\n==Presentation of TRAK Views==\nTRAK does not specify a notation or presentation language ([[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Description Language|architecture description language]] in ISO/IEC 42010 terminology) in which to present the architecture views. TRAK architecture descriptions are not therefore [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[SysML]] or [[BPMN]] models although any of these notations  can be used to prepare at least some of the views (an ADL might not contain the necessary concepts/stereotypes or might not allow them to be connected in the way needed to represent a TRAK architecture view).\n\nTRAK requires the metamodel element name of every architecture description element in a TRAK architecture view to be explicitly shown so that each TRAK view can be read as a set of declarative statements e.g. \n* ''''System'''. A ''  -is configured with->  '' '''Software'''. B'\n* ''''Claim'''. System A meets the requirement to ... ''  -about->  '' '''Standard'''. Climatic Environmental Specification.'\n* ''''Physical'''. Shield Building ''  -has->   '' '''Vulnerability'''. Structural Weakness ''  <-exploits-  '' '''Threat'''. Deliberate Aircraft Impact'\n\nTuples can be presented using nodes and relationships (a graph).\n[[File:Example TRAK SV 13.jpg|frame|center|Example TRAK SV-13 Solution Risk View Presented as a Graph Showing Tuples from the TRAK Metamodel]]\n\nTRAK also allows a view to be constructed from textual statements. Since a TRAK view is a set of [[Tuple#Etymology|tuples / triples]] it is possible to use a graph or a set of [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] triples to present a TRAK view. TRAK also requires every block to have a name. The intent of this is to ensure that a TRAK architecture view is read as the author of the view meant it and improve semantic consistency. Presentation rules that apply to all TRAK architecture views are specified in the overall TRAK specification <ref name=\"trak\"/><ref>[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture]</ref> (as 'Bye Laws').\n\nTRAK is a logical definition - it specifies what needs to be shown and minimum acceptable content but does not mandate how you achieve it. TRAK simply defines the node and connector elements and the allowed combinations (triples) that must / may appear in each view. It does not specify or mandate any particular notation or language. For example a simple block and connector diagram (as above) is acceptable as is a set of plain text staments or a diagram using the [[Unified_Modeling_Language|UML]].\n\n==ISO 42010 Considerations==\nTRAK applies [[ISO/IEC 42010]] in the following ways:-\n* an architecture description is a response to a task which addresses a stakeholder's concerns (this is addressed using the TRAK::MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record Viewpoint)\n* each TRAK architecture view is specified by a viewpoint within the TRAK architecture framework\n* each TRAK viewpoint identifies the stakeholders, concerns addressed, anti-concerns (things the viewpoint is not to be used for), the metamodel tuples needed, the metamodel tuples allowed, well-formedness (minimum acceptable content) and consistency rules with other views within the architecture description\n* correspondence rules are defined by viewpoints and for an architecture description using the TRAK metamodel.\n\nAn overall comparison between TRAK and [[ISO/IEC 42010]] is made in the TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document. A more detailed comparison against the 2011 version of the standard is made separately <ref name=\"TRAK00015\">TRAK00015 TRAK. \nArchitecture Description. Summary.

There is an element of process introduced, however, because TRAK adheres to ISO/IEC 42010 which states that an architecture description is produced in response to a task and the task stakeholder concerns and also because TRAK has master architecture views which creates dependencies between views and results in minimum allowed architecture view sets.\n\nThis gives rise to a minimal process which is:\n* identify the task stakeholder and their [[#Conceptual Model - Concern|concerns]]\n* using the TRAK Viewpoints select the Viewpoints needed to address the stakeholder concerns\n* develop [[#Conceptual Model - Architecture View|views]] that conform to these viewpoints that address these concerns\n* these in turn may require additional views to be prepared to form a legitimate allowed view set\n* document the purpose, concerns, findings and the [[#Conceptual Model - Architecture Description|architecture description]] using a MV-02 Architecture Design Record View supplemented by a MV-01 Architecture Dictionary View\n\n==Licensing==\nTRAK is released under 2 forms of open source license:\n* GNU Free Documentation License ([[Gfdl|GFDL]]) for the logical definition - TRAK Overall, TRAK Metamodel and TRAK Viewpoints documents\n* GNU Public License ([[Gpl|GPL]]) for implementations of TRAK - UML profile for TRAK for general UML modelling tools and TRAK MDG Technology for [[Sparx Systems]] [[Enterprise Architect (software)|Enterprise Architect]] modelling tool.\n\n==Tool Support==\nTRAK supports modelling tools through the following mechanisms:\n* a [[Profile (UML)|UML profile]] for TRAK - for use with any [[UML tool|UML modelling tool]] that can import a UML profile\n* a plugin for [[Sparx Systems]] [[Enterprise Architect (software)|Enterprise Architect]] based on the UML profile for TRAK.

This is a consequence of the constructs available in UML and the particular implementation in the UML Profile for TRAK and arises because different architecture description languages ([[Architecture description language|ADLs]]) are often design for different purposes and sometimes different domains i.e. in ISO/IEC 42010 the concerns they address are different from those that the architecture framework, in this case TRAK, does.\n\nAs tools represent an implementation of the logical definition of TRAK they may contain limitations or errors owing to the notation language (architecture description language) used and tool-specific capabilities.\n\n==Examples of Architecture Description Using TRAK==\n* Sub Surface Upgrade Programme (SSUP).

Whole System Programme Management Report. 25 May 2011 http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/rvfm-atkins-programme-management-250511.pdf</ref> Development started in 2009 and was based on the then current views of architectural description within London Underground which were based on ISO/IEC 42010 and tied to the [[Systems Engineering|systems engineering]] lifecyle defined in [[ISO/IEC 15288]] .\n\nAlthough the original intent was to develop a rail-specific architecture framework in adapting MODAF to suit local needs any defence or domain-specific content was removed and the result was a domain-free [[#TRAK Metamodel|metamodel]] and viewpoints that were only based on representing [[complex systems]].\n\nTRAK was [[#Licensing|released under open source licenses]] in February 2010.\n\nIt has been formally adopted by the [[Department for Transport|UK Department for Transport]] who chair the TRAK Steering Group that manages the overall direction, strategy and formal releases of TRAK.\n\nThe TRAK development team received a Working Group award.<ref>INCOSE 2010 Working Group Award http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/transport/</ref>  (photo on the [[INCOSE]] Transportation Working Group page <ref>INCOSE Transportation Working Group  http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/transport/</ref>). TRAK was a finalist for the 2011 IET Innovation Awards.<ref>IET Innovation Awards 2001 - Finalists http://conferences.theiet.org/innovation/finalists/index.cfm</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n;Architecture Description Tuple\n:An architectural description element with a named type which has a named relationship to either the same or another architecture description element e.g. <<Organisation>> A 'has part' <<Job>> B. It follows the natural language construct of Subject - [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|Predicate]] - Object - also used in [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. See [[Tuple]]. TRAK requires each tuple to be explicit.\n\n;Master Architecture View\n:Each TRAK metamodel stereotype has a master architecture view type. Within an architecture description or model each element has to be declared or shown on its master architecture view type before it can be used on any other view type.\n\n;Perspective\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 refers to an Architectural Perspective as 'Sharing of architectural models also facilitates an \"aspect-oriented\" style of architectural description'<ref>[http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/ ANSI/IEEE Std 1471 :: ISO/IEC 42010 Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems]</ref> A grouping of related and overlapping architectural views.\n\n;View\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]] refers to an architecture view as 'work product expressing the architecture of a system from the perspective of specific system concerns'. A TRAK view is defined as an Architecture Product in the TRAK metamodel. A TRAK view presents a set of Architecture Description Tuples in accordance with its governing viewpoint.\n\n;Viewpoint\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 - A viewpoint defines a set of conventions (notations, languages and model types) for constructing a certain kind of view. In TRAK a viewpoint is a specification for a single TRAK view.\n\n==TRAK Structure==\nTRAK is defined in a logical way - that is to say free of any notion of how TRAK is implemented in any tool or any architecture description language.\n\nTRAK has 24 [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoints]] which are grouped into 5 perspectives. Each viewpoint belongs to a single perspective and specifies a single [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model Architecture View|view]] (type). Each viewpoint specifies what sets of types of architectural description element and relationships (tuples) can appear. The architectural description element types and relationships are specified by the TRAK metamodel.\n\nThe logical definition of TRAK consists of 3 documents, each of which is an open source project on [[Sourceforge]]:\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document.<ref name=\"trak\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework]</ref> This controls TRAK as a whole. It defines the TRAK Architecture Perspectives, colours, bye laws (rules affecting the design of TRAK, architecture views and architecture descriptions, minimal modelling process.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Viewpoints document.<ref name=\"viewpoints\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakviewpoints TRAK00001 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Viewpoints]</ref> This defines the TRAK architecture viewpoints.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Metamodel document.<ref name=\"metamodel\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakmetamodel TRAK00002 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Metamodel]</ref> This defines the architecture description elements that can appear in a viewpoint definition.\n\n==TRAK Architecture Perspectives==\nTRAK has 5 architecture perspectives,<ref name=\"trak\"/> each of which groups together architecture viewpoints and views of an overlapping subject area:\n* Enterprise Perspective\n* Concept Perspective\n* Procurement Perspective\n* Solution Perspective\n* Management Perspective\n\n===Enterprise Perspective===\nThis perspective covers the enduring capabilities that are needed as part of the bigger enterprise.These are high level needs that everything else contributes to and form part of the long term strategic objectives that need to be managed.\n\n===Concept Perspective===\nThe concept perspective covers the logical view of what is needed in response to the capabilities required by the enterprise in the enterprise perspective. It covers the logical connection of nodes, for example a service control centre, to other nodes with no recognition of how this might be realised either by organisation or technology. It also implies no particular part of a life cycle \u2013 it covers everything from concept to disposal (\"lust to dust\"!).\n\n===Procurement Perspective===\nThe procurement perspective provides a top level view of the solution to the enterprise capability needs outlined in the enterprise perspective and developed in the concept perspective. It provides a way of showing how projects deliver the solutions described in the solution perspective to provide capability. It provides a way of showing time dependency between projects and is an essential for investigating capability gaps.\n\n===Solution Perspective===\nThe solution perspective provides views about the solution \u2013 whether proposed or realised. It covers the parts of \u2018systems\u2019 whether human or machine, their exchanges and protocols. The solution perspective describes how organisations and equipment are organised and governed. The solution perspective describes how the logical requirements outlined in the concept perspective are realised and shows how the solution(s) realise the capability needed by the enterprise and described in the enterprise perspective.\n\n===Management Perspective===\nThe management perspective provides views that describe the architectural task and those relationships that are common across other perspectives. It provides ways of defining the scope and findings of the architectural task - structuring the approach and modelling.\n\nThe management perspective provides ways of describing the normative standards that apply. It contains views that provide supporting information to aid the portability and understanding of the model(s).\n\n==TRAK Architecture Viewpoints & Views==\nEach [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model - Architecture View|architecture view]] in TRAK is specified by a corresponding [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoint]]. The viewpoint is designated using a 'p' in the numbering e.g. a CVp-01 is the architecture viewpoint that specifies a CV-01 architecture view.\n\nIn general use if there is a risk of confusion with a similarly-numbered view in another framework such as [[DODAF]] or [[MODAF]] then a namespace prefix is used e.g. TRAK::SV-01\n\nTRAK defines 24 architecture viewpoints<ref name=\"viewpoints\"/> (by comparison DODAF 2.0 has 52 views/models, MODAF 1.2.004 has 47 views and NAF 3.1 has 49 subviews <ref>Trak-community.org::Wiki::Architecture Framework Comparison http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/Architecture_Framework_Comparison</ref>)\n* Enterprise Perspective\n** EVp-01 Enterprise Goals\n** EVp-02 Capability Hierarchy\n** EVp-03 Capability Phasing\n* Concept Perspective\n** CVp-01 Concept Need\n** CVp-03 Concept Item Exchange\n** CVp-04 Concept Activity to Capability Mapping\n** CVp-05 Concept Activity\n** CVp-06 Concept Sequence\n* Procurement Perspective\n** PrVp-01 Procurement Structure\n** PrVp-02 Procurement Timeline\n** PrVp-03 Procurement Responsibility\n* Solution Perspective\n** SVp-01 Solution Structure\n** SVp-02 Solution Resource Interaction\n** SVp-03 Solution Resource Interaction to Function Mapping\n** SVp-04 Solution Function\n** SVp-05 Solution Function to Concept Activity Mapping\n** SVp-06 Solution Competence\n** SVp-07 Solution Sequence\n** SVp-11 Solution Event Causes\n** SVp-13 Solution Risk\n* Management Perspective\n** MVp-01 Architecture Description Dictionary\n** MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record\n** MVp-03 Requirements & Standards\n** MVp-04 Assurance\n\nThese defined in the TRAK Viewpoints specification.

TRAK architecture descriptions are not therefore [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[SysML]] or [[BPMN]] models although any of these notations  can be used to prepare at least some of the views (an ADL might not contain the necessary concepts/stereotypes or might not allow them to be connected in the way needed to represent a TRAK architecture view).\n\nTRAK requires the metamodel element name of every architecture description element in a TRAK architecture view to be explicitly shown so that each TRAK view can be read as a set of declarative statements e.g. \n* ''''System'''. A ''  -is configured with->  '' '''Software'''. B'\n* ''''Claim'''. System A meets the requirement to ... ''  -about->  '' '''Standard'''. Climatic Environmental Specification.'\n* ''''Physical'''. Shield Building ''  -has->   '' '''Vulnerability'''. Structural Weakness ''  <-exploits-  '' '''Threat'''. Deliberate Aircraft Impact'\n\nTuples can be presented using nodes and relationships (a graph).\n[[File:Example TRAK SV 13.jpg|frame|center|Example TRAK SV-13 Solution Risk View Presented as a Graph Showing Tuples from the TRAK Metamodel]]\n\nTRAK also allows a view to be constructed from textual statements. Since a TRAK view is a set of [[Tuple#Etymology|tuples / triples]] it is possible to use a graph or a set of [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] triples to present a TRAK view. TRAK also requires every block to have a name. The intent of this is to ensure that a TRAK architecture view is read as the author of the view meant it and improve semantic consistency. Presentation rules that apply to all TRAK architecture views are specified in the overall TRAK specification <ref name=\"trak\"/><ref>[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture]</ref> (as 'Bye Laws').\n\nTRAK is a logical definition - it specifies what needs to be shown and minimum acceptable content but does not mandate how you achieve it. TRAK simply defines the node and connector elements and the allowed combinations (triples) that must / may appear in each view. It does not specify or mandaye any particular notation or language. For example a simple block and connector diagram (as above) is acceptable as is a set of plain text staments or a diagram using the [[Unified_Modeling_Language|UML]].\n\n==ISO 42010 Considerations==\nTRAK applies [[ISO/IEC 42010]] in the following ways:-\n* an architecture description is a response to a task which addresses a stakeholder's concerns (this is addressed using the TRAK::MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record Viewpoint)\n* each TRAK architecture view is specified by a viewpoint within the TRAK architecture framework\n* each TRAK viewpoint identifies the stakeholders, concerns addressed, anti-concerns (things the viewpoint is not to be used for), the metamodel tuples needed, the metamodel tuples allowed, well-formedness (minimum acceptable content) and consistency rules with other views within the architecture description\n* correspondence rules are defined by viewpoints and for an architecture description using the TRAK metamodel.\n\nAn overall comparison between TRAK and [[ISO/IEC 42010]] is made in the TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document. A more detailed comparison against the 2011 version of the standard is made separately <ref name=\"TRAK00015\">TRAK00015 TRAK. \nArchitecture Description. Summary.

There is an element of process introduced, however, because TRAK adheres to ISO/IEC 42010 which states that an architecture description is produced in response to a task and the task stakeholder concerns and also because TRAK has master architecture views which creates dependencies between views and results in minimum allowed architecture view sets.\n\nThis gives rise to a minimal process which is:\n* identify the task stakeholder and their [[#Conceptual Model - Concern|concerns]]\n* using the TRAK Viewpoints select the Viewpoints needed to address the stakeholder concerns\n* develop [[#Conceptual Model - Architecture View|views]] that conform to these viewpoints that address these concerns\n* these in turn may require additional views to be prepared to form a legitimate allowed view set\n* document the purpose, concerns, findings and the [[#Conceptual Model - Architecture Description|architecture description]] using a MV-02 Architecture Design Record View supplemented by a MV-01 Architecture Dictionary View\n\n==Licensing==\nTRAK is released under 2 forms of open source license:\n* GNU Free Documentation License ([[Gfdl|GFDL]]) for the logical definition - TRAK Overall, TRAK Metamodel and TRAK Viewpoints documents\n* GNU Public License ([[Gpl|GPL]]) for implementations of TRAK - UML profile for TRAK for general UML modelling tools and TRAK MDG Technology for [[Sparx Systems]] [[Enterprise Architect (software)|Enterprise Architect]] modelling tool.\n\n==Tool Support==\nTRAK supports modelling tools through the following mechanisms:\n* a [[Profile (UML)|UML profile]] for TRAK - for use with any [[UML tool|UML modelling tool]] that can import a UML profile\n* a plugin for [[Sparx Systems]] [[Enterprise Architect (software)|Enterprise Architect]] based on the UML profile for TRAK.

This is a consequence of the constructs available in UML and the particular implementation in the UML Profile for TRAK and arises because different architecture description languages ([[Architecture description language|ADLs]]) are often design for different purposes and sometimes different domains i.e. in ISO/IEC 42010 the concerns they address are different from those that the architecture framework, in this case TRAK, does.\n\nAs tools represent an implementation of the logical definition of TRAK they may contain limitations or errors owing to the notation language (architecture description language) used and tool-specific capabilities.\n\n==Examples of Architecture Description Using TRAK==\n* Sub Surface Upgrade Programme (SSUP).

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee investigation from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019. The lawsuit was settled on April 9, 2020, with the perpetrators fined several million yen and banned from future events related to the [[AKB48 Group]].\n\n==Incident==\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Maho Yamaguchi alleged in her [[SHOWROOM (streaming service)|Showroom]] live stream and Twitter that on December 8, 2018, two men (identified by press as two fans, one unemployed and the other an university student, both 25-year old<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html\n | title=\uff2e\uff27\uff34\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093 \u3001\u75372\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u66b4\u884c | language=ja | work=[[Niigata Nippo]] | date=2019-01-10| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513064058/https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html | archivedate=2019-05-13}}</ref>) after hiding in an apartment on the other side which was previously occupied by another member, had tried to break into her personal apartment as she was entering her apartment after prying open her door.

Additionally, she revealed the existence of still-unreleased voice recordings which contained other current members personally admitting to having had private relationship with the group to which the assailants belonged.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189290449158184963\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u30b9\u30dd\u30cb\u30c1\u3055\u3093\u304c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3082\u3046\u95a2\u308f\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u8a00\u308f\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u65b9\u306f\u3054\u5b58\u77e5\u306e\u901a\u308a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306f\u30ea\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3092\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u76ee\u7dda\u3067\u3084\u308b\u306e\u3067\u76f8\u624b\u304c\u4f55\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3082\u307b\u307c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002AKB\u65b0\u805e\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3066\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3082\u5206\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306f\u305a\u306a\u306e\u306b\u9177\u3059\u304e\u308b }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189320193669029890\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u72ec\u5360\u5165\u624b\u3063\u3066\u6628\u65e5\u306e\u88c1\u5224\u8cc7\u6599\uff1f\u6a2a\u6d41\u3057\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f\u4ee5\u5916\u4f55\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f \u8972\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3089\u4f1a\u793e\u306b\u8b1d\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u306fSNS\u3067\u5acc\u304c\u3089\u305b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u8f9e\u3081\u3066\u304b\u3089\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u3084\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u79c1\u306e\u305b\u3044\u306b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3002\u3053\u3093\u306a\u4f1a\u793e\u3042\u308b\uff1f \u72af\u4eba\u3068\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u306f\u73fe\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u8a8d\u3081\u3066\u308b\u306e\u306b\u3002\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u305d\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189328855129116672\n |date=2020-10-30 |title=\u3044\u3084\u3001\u300c\u4ffa\u3082\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u6307\u5b9a\u3057\u30662\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u7e4b\u304c\u308a\u306e\u8a3c\u62e0ww\u300d\u3063\u3066\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u9001\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306e\u3084\u3081\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30e9\u3057\u3066\u305f\u3051\u3069\u7b11\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f \u7686\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://hochi.news/articles/20191030-OHT1T50031.html | title= \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d\u52a0\u5bb3\u8005\u3068\u306e\u201c\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308a\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u4e0d\u5feb\u611f\u2026\u73fe\u5f79\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u8a3c\u62e0\u97f3\u58f0\u6240\u6301\u3082\u793a\u5506  | language=ja | work=[[Sports Hochi]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref> AKS reportedly denied to the media that their side was responsible for leaking the material to the press<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/201910300000274.html\n | title=  \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u304c\u201c\u8a3c\u62e0\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u5426\u5b9a\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d | language=ja | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref>, as did the defendant side via a stream broadcast.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee investigation from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019.

Dick]]. Published and set in 1962, the novel takes place fifteen years after a different end to [[World War II]], and depicts intrigues between the [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|victorious Axis Powers]]\u2014primarily, [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]]\u2014as they rule over the former United States, as well as daily life under [[totalitarian]] rule.\n\n''The Man in the High Castle'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1963. Reported inspirations include [[Ward Moore]]'s alternate Civil War history, ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), classic World War II histories and the ''[[I Ching]]'' (referred to in the novel). There is a \"novel within the novel\",  an alternate history within the alternate history where the Allies defeat the Axis (though in a manner distinct from the real-life events of the war).\n\nIn 2015, the book was adapted as a [[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|multi-season TV series]], with Dick's daughter, [[Isa Dick Hackett]], as a producer.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the novel's alternate history, US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was assassinated by [[Giuseppe Zangara]] in 1934 <!-- (apparently having delayed his [[Giuseppe Zangara#Assassination attempt|plan]] by one year; there is a reference in the dialogue to FDR having been President for one year) --> leading to the continuation of the [[Great Depression]] and [[United States non-interventionism|US isolationism]] during the opening of [[World War II]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] led [[Nazi Germany]] to conquer most of Europe and the Soviet Union, murdering [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Slavs]], and other groups. Meanwhile, [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] occupied Eastern Asia and [[Oceania]]. The Nazis then, with help of their allies, conquered most of [[Africa]]. As Japan invaded the US [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Germany invaded the US [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. By 1947, the US and the remaining Allies surrendered to the Axis, ending the war.\n\n[[File:The Man in the High Castle novel map of former USA.png|thumb|upright|Partition of the former contiguous USA in ''The Man in the High Castle''\n{{legend|#FF0000|Pacific States of America}}\n{{legend|#55d400|Rocky Mountain States}}\n{{legend|#784421|United States of America}}\n{{legend|#FFCCAA|\"The South\"}}]]\nBy the 1960s, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany are the world's [[Cold War|competing]] [[superpower]]s, with Japan [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|establishing]] the \"Pacific States of America\" (P.S.A.) from the former [[Western United States]] and the remaining [[Mountain states|Rocky Mountain States]] being a neutral [[buffer zone]] between the P.S.A. and the Nazi-occupied former [[Eastern United States]]. In the East, there are two countries: \"The South\" is a racist puppet regime which collaborates with the Nazis. The United States of America still exists by name in the Northeast of the former territory and are controlled by a German military governor. For unexplained reasons, [[Canada]] remains independent despite being part of the Allies.\n\nHitler, though still alive, is incapacitated from advanced [[syphilis]], and [[Martin Bormann]] has become [[Chancellor of Germany]], with [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring]], [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart|Seyss-Inquart]] (who oversees the extermination of the [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|peoples of Africa]]), and other Nazi leaders soon vying to take his place. The Nazis have [[Atlantropa|drained the Mediterranean]] to [[lebensraum|make room]] for farmland, developed and used the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], and designed rockets for extremely fast travel across the world as well as space, having [[Space colonization|colonized]] the [[Moon]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]]. The novel is set mostly in [[San Francisco]]. Here, Chinese residents first appear in the novel as [[second-class citizen]]s and [[black people]] are slaves. The secondary setting of the novel is the Rocky Mountains States, namely the cities of [[Ca\u00f1on City]], [[Denver]] and [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]].\n\n=== Plot summary ===\nIn 1962, fifteen years after Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany have won World War II, Robert \"Bob\" Childan owns an [[Americana]] [[antique shop]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (located in the Japanese-occupied Pacific States of America), which is most commonly frequented by the Japanese, who make a fetish of romanticized American cultural artifacts. Childan is contacted by Nobusuke Tagomi, a high-ranking Japanese trade official, who is seeking a gift to impress a visiting [[Sweden|Swedish]] industrialist named Baynes. Childan's store is stocked in part with counterfeit antiques from the Wyndam-Matson Corporation, a [[metalworking]] company. Frank Frink ([[Given name#Name at birth|formerly]] Fink), a secretly [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] veteran of World War II, has just been fired from the Wyndam-Matson factory, when he agrees to join a former coworker to begin a handcrafted jewelry business. Meanwhile, Frink's ex-wife, Juliana, works as a [[judo]] instructor in [[Canon City, Colorado]]<!-- The spelling in this time-period is \"Canon\", not \"Ca\u00f1on\". --> (in the neutral buffer zone of Mountain States), where she begins a sexual relationship with an [[Italians|Italian]] truck driver and ex-soldier, Joe Cinnadella. Throughout the book, many of these characters frequently make important decisions using prophetic messages they interpret from the ''[[I Ching]]'', a Chinese cultural import. Many characters are also reading a widely banned yet extremely popular new novel, ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which [[story within a story|depicts an alternate history]] in which the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] won World War II in 1947, a concept that amazes and intrigues its readers.\n\nFrink reveals that the Wyndam-Matson Corporation has been supplying Childan with [[counterfeit]] antiques, which effectively works to [[blackmail]] Wyndam-Matson for money to finance Frink's new jewelry venture. Tagomi and Baynes meet, but Baynes repeatedly delays any real business as they await an expected third party from Japan. Suddenly, the public receives news of the death of the recently-ill Chancellor of Germany, Martin Bormann. Childan tentatively, on [[consignment]], takes some of Frink's \"authentic\" new metalwork and attempts to curry favor with a Japanese client, who surprisingly considers Frink's jewelry immensely [[Wu (awareness)|spiritually alive]]. Juliana and Joe take a [[road trip]] to [[Denver, Colorado]], and Joe impulsively decides they should go on a side-trip to meet the mysterious Hawthorne Abendsen, author of ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', who supposedly lives in a guarded fortress-like estate called the \"High Castle\" in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Soon, Joseph Goebbels is announced as the new German Chancellor.\n\nBaynes and Tagomi finally meet their Japanese contact as the Nazi secret police, the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD), close in to arrest Baynes, who is revealed to be a Nazi defector named Rudolf Wegener. Wegener warns his contact, a famed Japanese general, of Operation Dandelion, an upcoming Goebbels-approved plan for the Nazis to launch a surprise attack on the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], in order to [[Battle of annihilation|obliterate them in one swift stroke]]. As Frink is elsewhere exposed as a Jew and arrested, Wegener and Tagomi are confronted by two SD agents, both of whom Tagomi shoots dead with an antique American pistol. Back in Colorado, Joe abruptly changes his appearance and mannerisms before the trip to the High Castle, leading Juliana to deduce that he intends to murder Abendsen. Joe confirms this, revealing himself to be an undercover Swiss Nazi assassin. Juliana mortally wounds Joe and drives off to warn Abendsen of the threat to his life.\n\nWegener flies back to Germany and learns that Reinhard Heydrich (a member of the anti-Dandelion faction) has launched a coup against Goebbels, possibly installing himself as Chancellor. Meanwhile, Tagomi remains shaken by the shootout and goes to Childan to sell back the gun he used in the fight; instead, sensing the energy from one of Frink's jewelry items, Tagomi impulsively buys it from Childan. Tagomi then undergoes a spiritually intense experience during which he momentarily perceives an alternative-history version of San Francisco.<!-- This is evidenced by the presence of the [[Embarcadero]], which Tagomi had never seen before, and an absence of deference to Japanese people by whites. --> Later, Tagomi on a whim forces the German authorities to release Frink, whom Tagomi has never met and does not know is the maker of the jewelry. Juliana soon has her own spiritual experience when she arrives in Cheyenne. There, she discovers that Abendsen now lives in a normal house with his family, having left behind the High Castle due to a change of outlook; he no longer preoccupies himself with thoughts that he might soon be assassinated. After dodging many of Juliana's questions about his inspiration for his novel, Abendsen finally confesses that he used the ''I Ching'' to guide his writing of ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy''. Before leaving, Juliana infers then that \"Truth\" wrote the book in order to reveal the \"Inner Truth\" that Japan and Germany really lost World War II.\n\n== ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' ==\nSeveral characters in ''The Man in the High Castle'' read the popular novel ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', by Hawthorne Abendsen, whose title is assumed or supposed to have come from the Bible<ref name=Castle />{{rp|70}} verse \"The grasshopper shall be a burden\" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ecclesiastes|chapter=12|verse=5}}). Thus, ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' constitutes a novel within a novel, wherein Abendsen writes of an alternative universe, where the Axis Powers lost World War II (1939\u20131947). For this reason, the Germans have banned the novel in the occupied US,<ref name=Castle />{{rp|91}} but it is widely read in the Pacific, and its publication is legal in the neutral countries.\n\n''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' postulates that President Roosevelt survives an assassination attempt but forgoes [[1940 United States presidential election|re-election in 1940]], honoring [[George Washington]]'s [[Term limits in the United States|two-term limit]]. The next president, [[Rexford Tugwell]], removes the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] from [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, saving it from Japanese attack, which ensures that the US enters the conflict a well-equipped naval power.<ref name=Castle />{{rp|70}} The United Kingdom retains most of its military-industrial strength, contributing more to the Allied war effort, leading to [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]]'s defeat in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]; the British advance through the [[Caucasus]] to fight alongside the Soviets to victory in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]; [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]] renege on their membership in the Axis Powers and betray them; British tanks and the [[Red Army]] jointly conquer Berlin; at the end of the war, the Nazi leaders\u2014including Adolf Hitler\u2014are tried for their war crimes, and the ''F\u00fchrer's'' last words are ''Deutsche, hier steh' ich'' (\"Germans, here I stand\"),<ref name=Castle />{{rp|131}} in imitation of [[Martin Luther]].\n\nAfter the war, President Tugwell initiates the [[New Deal]] on a worldwide scale. With American assistance, China goes through a decade of rebuilding. People in lesser developed places in Africa and Asia are sent television kits, through which they learn how to read and receive instructions on practical skills such as digging wells and purifying water. In turn, these places become markets for American factories. In the [[British Empire]], social and economic progress has also brought relief to the masses in India, Burma, Africa and the Middle East. In Europe, there is peace and harmony not only with itself but with the rest of the world. The Soviet Union, crippled by war losses, is divided up.<ref name=Castle />{{rp|165-168}} \n\nAround ten years after the end of the war, the British Empire, still under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]], becomes more racist and expansionist, establishing \"detention preserves\" for disloyal Chinese in South Asia, and suspecting that the US is undermining its rule in South Asia. Meanwhile, the US has ended racial discrimination by the 1950s. Whites and Blacks are able to live and work shoulder by shoulder.\nThese changes provoke racial-cultural tensions between the US and the UK, leading them to a Cold War for global [[hegemony]] between their two vaguely liberal, democratic, capitalist societies. Although the end of the novel is never depicted in the text, one character claims the book ends with the British Empire eventually defeating the US, becoming the sole world superpower.<ref name=Castle />{{rp|169-172}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\nDick said he conceived ''The Man in the High Castle'' when reading ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), by [[Ward Moore]], which occurs mainly in an alternative 20th-century US wherein the [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[American Civil War]]. In the acknowledgments to the book, he mentions other influences: ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' (1960), by [[William L. Shirer]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' (1962), by [[Alan Bullock]]; ''The [[Goebbels Diaries]]'' (1948), [[Louis P. Lochner]], translator; ''Foxes of the Desert'' (1960), by [[Paul Carrell]]; and the 1950 translation of the ''I Ching'' by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]].<ref name='vertex' /><ref name=Castle >{{cite book|last1=Dick|first1=Philip K.|title=The Man in the High Castle|date=2011|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|isbn=9780547601205|page=ix-x |edition=1st Mariner Books| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5aBwki0xmZEC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=the+man+in+the+high+castle+dick+miss+lonelyhearts#v=onepage&q=the%20man%20in%20the%20high%20castle%20dick%20miss%20lonelyhearts&f=false|access-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe acknowledgments have three references to traditional Japanese and Tibetan poetic forms; (i) volume one of the ''Anthology of Japanese Literature'' (1955), edited by [[Donald Keene]], from which is cited the ''[[haiku]]'' on page 48; (ii) from ''Zen and Japanese Culture'' (1955), by [[D.

In this novella, \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" is a male newspaper journalist who writes anonymous advice as an [[Advice column|agony aunt]] to forlorn readers during the height of the Great Depression; hence, \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" tries to find consolation in religion, casual sex, rural vacations, and work, none of which provide him with the sense of authenticity and engagement with the outside world that he needs. West's book is about the elusive quality of relationships and quest for meaning at a time of political turmoil within the United States.\n\nPhilip Dick used the ''I Ching'' to make decisions crucial to the plot of ''The Man in the High Castle'' just as characters within the novel use it to guide decisions.<ref name='vertex'>{{cite journal |last=Cover |first=Arthur Byron | authorlink=Arthur Byron Cover|date=February 1974 |title=Interview with Philip K.

Both the Pacific States of America and the Eastern American puppet state appear to be mere provinces of the Empire of Japan and the Greater Nazi Reich without any apparent autonomous (even [[quisling]]) government institutions. The Rocky Mountain States become an [[anarchy|anarchic]] Neutral Zone. World War II appears to have ended following the destruction of Washington, D.C. with an atomic bomb, rather than a land invasion as in the book. As for Hitler, while elderly, he is apparently mostly hale in his Season 1 finale appearance, though other characters elsewhere in the season do reference his supposed physical infirmity. In the novel, the Italian Empire is a minor power that controls North Africa and the Middle East; in the series, it is shown through maps that these territories are part of the Nazi Empire, suggesting that either the Italian Empire was annexed after the war or is self-governing within the Reich. The drying of the Mediterranean has never happened, though a slightly similar event is mentioned by a character in Season Two as being planned.\n\nCharacters from the book that do appear are in most cases far more fleshed out with deeper and sometimes rather different backstories than their novel originals. For instance, Wegener is a ''[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]]'' in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], rather than a naval captain. Rather than being a member of an organized internal resistance (and despite his relatively low rank) Wegener is a close personal confidante of Hitler and his disillusionment with the regime appears to be largely personal. Juliana and Frank are unmarried, but living together, rather than divorced and separated. Frank has a sister, nephew and niece, although they are killed early in the series, and this propels him into a more active role in relation to the resistance. Juliana also has a sister whose murder by the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' early in the season instigates her search for the mysterious Man in the High Castle, as well as her having a mother and stepfather who are significant supporting characters. Joe Cinnadella is renamed \"Joe Blake\" (though he uses his novel name and backstory while undercover in Season 3) and, as he becomes closer to Juliana, appears to have growing doubts about his role as a Nazi agent. Robert Childan starts season 1 as a minor character but later becomes a main protagonist, starting a trade in the Pacific States and in the Neutral Zone, while Ed McCarthy has a rather more prominent and active role, being revealed as [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in Season 3.\n\nThere are several major additional characters introduced by the television series, and numerous narrative details and plotline elements differ radically from the source novel. For example, the planned Nazi [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] on Japan, \"Operation Dandelion\", is apparently being prevented only by Hitler's personal refusal to authorize it, leading Heydrich and the faction demanding pre-emptive war to plot the F\u00fchrer's assassination. In addition, Hawthorne Abendsen does not appear in the first season of the television version and ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' is a series of [[newsreel]] films depicting multiple alternative realities rather than a novel (although this idea may be borrowed from Dick's later novel ''[[VALIS]]'' which features a mysterious film depicting yet another dystopian alternative history of the United States). As of the Season 1 finale, these films are being tracked down by SS agents like Blake for dispatch to Hitler for an as-yet-unknown purpose.\n\nIn season two, a map of the world is shown on John Smith's wall. On this map, Japan controls the entirety of the Pacific Ocean and most of the Asian continent, including China, India and half of Russia. Japan is also shown to control Australia, New Zealand, western Canada, Alaska, and all Pacific states of the United States. The Japanese Empire controls Baja California and South American countries like Peru and Chile. In contrast, Nazi Germany is shown as controlling all of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The German Empire also controls all of the United States and Canada up to the Rockies in the west and South America including Brazil. Germany also controls the western parts of former USSR such as Ukraine. There are also buffer zones between the empires. Neither empire seems to have invaded Mexico and this neutral zone continues up through the Rockies and through Canada. A similar neutral zone is seen dividing Russia in half.\n\nSeason two also shows two very different lifestyles in the Japanese-controlled Pacific states and the German-controlled east. The Germans have colonized the eastern states and are assimilating its inhabitants into Nazi beliefs. The Japanese Empire is occupying the Pacific states rather than colonizing them. There is enforced segregation between Japanese and Americans citizens. It is implied that Native Americans were exterminated by the Germans, and that the Japanese exterminated the Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, along with most Alaska natives.\n\nSeason 3 was released in 2018 and season 4 in 2019, with each season having 10 episodes.\n\n== Incomplete sequel ==\nIn a 1976 interview, Dick said he planned to write a sequel novel to ''The Man in the High Castle'': \"And so there's no real ending on it. I like to regard it as an open ending. It will segue into a sequel sometime.\"<ref name=\"KPRK Interview 1976\">{{cite web| url=http://www.philipkdickfans.com/literary-criticism/interviews/hour-25-a-talk-with-philip-k-dick/ |title=Hour 25: A Talk With Philip K.

Dick]]. Published and set in 1962, the novel takes place fifteen years after a different end to [[World War II]], and depicts intrigues between the [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|victorious Axis Powers]]\u2014primarily, [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]]\u2014as they rule over the former United States, as well as daily life under [[totalitarian]] rule.\n\n''The Man in the High Castle'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1963. Reported inspirations include [[Ward Moore]]'s alternate Civil War history, ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), classic World War II histories and the ''[[I Ching]]'' (referred to in the novel). There is a \"novel within the novel\",  an alternate history within the alternate history where the Allies defeat the Axis (though in a manner distinct from the real-life events of the war).\n\nIn 2015, the book was adapted as a [[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|multi-season TV series]], with Dick's daughter, [[Isa Dick Hackett]], as a producer.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the novel's alternate history, US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was assassinated by [[Giuseppe Zangara]] in 1934 <!-- (apparently having delayed his [[Giuseppe Zangara#Assassination attempt|plan]] by one year; there is a reference in the dialogue to FDR having been President for one year) --> leading to the continuation of the [[Great Depression]] and [[United States non-interventionism|US isolationism]] during the opening of [[World War II]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] led [[Nazi Germany]] to conquer most of Europe and the Soviet Union, murdering [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Slavs]], and other groups. Meanwhile, [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] occupied Eastern Asia and [[Oceania]]. The Nazis then, with help of their allies, conquered most of [[Africa]]. As Japan invaded the US [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Germany invaded the US [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. By 1947, the US and the remaining Allies surrendered to the Axis, ending the war.\n\n[[File:The Man in the High Castle novel map of former USA.png|thumb|upright|Partition of the former contiguous USA in ''The Man in the High Castle''\n{{legend|#FF0000|Pacific States of America}}\n{{legend|#55d400|Rocky Mountain States}}\n{{legend|#784421|United States of America}}\n{{legend|#FFCCAA|\"The South\"}}]]\nBy the 1960s, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany are the world's [[Cold War|competing]] [[superpower]]s, with Japan [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|establishing]] the \"Pacific States of America\" (P.S.A.) from the former [[Western United States]] and the remaining [[Mountain states|Rocky Mountain States]] being a neutral [[buffer zone]] between the P.S.A. and the Nazi-occupied former [[Eastern United States]]. In the East, there are two countries: \"The South\" is a racist puppet regime which collaborates with the Nazis. The United States of America still exists by name in the Northeast of the former territory and are controlled by a German military governor. For unexplained reasons, [[Canada]] remains independent despite being part of the Allies.\n\nHitler, though still alive, is incapacitated from advanced [[syphilis]], and [[Martin Bormann]] has become [[Chancellor of Germany]], with [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring]], [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart|Seyss-Inquart]] (who oversees the extermination of the [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|peoples of Africa]]), and other Nazi leaders soon vying to take his place. The Nazis have [[Atlantropa|drained the Mediterranean]] to [[lebensraum|make room]] for farmland, developed and used the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], and designed rockets for extremely fast travel across the world as well as space, having [[Space colonization|colonized]] the [[Moon]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]]. The novel is set mostly in [[San Francisco]]. Here, Chinese residents first appear in the novel as [[second-class citizen]]s and [[black people]] are slaves. The secondary setting of the novel is the Rocky Mountains States, namely the cities of [[Ca\u00f1on City]], [[Denver]] and [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]].\n\n=== Plot summary ===\nIn 1962, fifteen years after Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany have won World War II, Robert \"Bob\" Childan owns an [[Americana]] [[antique shop]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (located in the Japanese-occupied Pacific States of America), which is most commonly frequented by the Japanese, who make a fetish of romanticized American cultural artifacts. Childan is contacted by Nobusuke Tagomi, a high-ranking Japanese trade official, who is seeking a gift to impress a visiting [[Sweden|Swedish]] industrialist named Baynes. Childan's store is stocked in part with counterfeit antiques from the Wyndam-Matson Corporation, a [[metalworking]] company. Frank Frink ([[Given name#Name at birth|formerly]] Fink), a secretly [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] veteran of World War II, has just been fired from the Wyndam-Matson factory, when he agrees to join a former coworker to begin a handcrafted jewelry business. Meanwhile, Frink's ex-wife, Juliana, works as a [[judo]] instructor in [[Canon City, Colorado]]<!-- The spelling in this time-period is \"Canon\", not \"Ca\u00f1on\". --> (in the neutral buffer zone of Mountain States), where she begins a sexual relationship with an [[Italians|Italian]] truck driver and ex-soldier, Joe Cinnadella. Throughout the book, many of these characters frequently make important decisions using prophetic messages they interpret from the ''[[I Ching]]'', a Chinese cultural import. Many characters are also reading a widely banned yet extremely popular new novel, ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which [[story within a story|depicts an alternate history]] in which the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] won World War II in 1947, a concept that amazes and intrigues its readers.\n\nFrink reveals that the Wyndam-Matson Corporation has been supplying Childan with [[counterfeit]] antiques, which effectively works to [[blackmail]] Wyndam-Matson for money to finance Frink's new jewelry venture. Tagomi and Baynes meet, but Baynes repeatedly delays any real business as they await an expected third party from Japan. Suddenly, the public receives news of the death of the recently-ill Chancellor of Germany, Martin Bormann. Childan tentatively, on [[consignment]], takes some of Frink's \"authentic\" new metalwork and attempts to curry favor with a Japanese client, who surprisingly considers Frink's jewelry immensely [[Wu (awareness)|spiritually alive]]. Juliana and Joe take a [[road trip]] to [[Denver, Colorado]], and Joe impulsively decides they should go on a side-trip to meet the mysterious Hawthorne Abendsen, author of ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', who supposedly lives in a guarded fortress-like estate called the \"High Castle\" in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Soon, Joseph Goebbels is announced as the new German Chancellor.\n\nBaynes and Tagomi finally meet their Japanese contact as the Nazi secret police, the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD), close in to arrest Baynes, who is revealed to be a Nazi defector named Rudolf Wegener. Wegener warns his contact, a famed Japanese general, of Operation Dandelion, an upcoming Goebbels-approved plan for the Nazis to launch a surprise attack on the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], in order to [[Battle of annihilation|obliterate them in one swift stroke]]. As Frink is elsewhere exposed as a Jew and arrested, Wegener and Tagomi are confronted by two SD agents, both of whom Tagomi shoots dead with an antique American pistol. Back in Colorado, Joe abruptly changes his appearance and mannerisms before the trip to the High Castle, leading Juliana to deduce that he intends to murder Abendsen. Joe confirms this, revealing himself to be an undercover Swiss Nazi assassin. Juliana mortally wounds Joe and drives off to warn Abendsen of the threat to his life.\n\nWegener flies back to Germany and learns that Reinhard Heydrich (a member of the anti-Dandelion faction) has launched a coup against Goebbels, possibly installing himself as Chancellor. Meanwhile, Tagomi remains shaken by the shootout and goes to Childan to sell back the gun he used in the fight; instead, sensing the energy from one of Frink's jewelry items, Tagomi impulsively buys it from Childan. Tagomi then undergoes a spiritually intense experience during which he momentarily perceives an alternative-history version of San Francisco.<!-- This is evidenced by the presence of the [[Embarcadero]], which Tagomi had never seen before, and an absence of deference to Japanese people by whites. --> Later, Tagomi on a whim forces the German authorities to release Frink, whom Tagomi has never met and does not know is the maker of the jewelry. Juliana soon has her own spiritual experience when she arrives in Cheyenne. There, she discovers that Abendsen now lives in a normal house with his family, having left behind the High Castle due to a change of outlook; he no longer preoccupies himself with thoughts that he might soon be assassinated. After dodging many of Juliana's questions about his inspiration for his novel, Abendsen finally confesses that he used the ''I Ching'' to guide his writing of ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy''. Before leaving, Juliana infers then that \"Truth\" wrote the book in order to reveal the \"Inner Truth\" that Japan and Germany really lost World War II.\n\n== ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' ==\nSeveral characters in ''The Man in the High Castle'' read the popular novel ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', by Hawthorne Abendsen, whose title is assumed or supposed to have come from the Bible<ref name=Castle />{{rp|70}} verse \"The grasshopper shall be a burden\" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ecclesiastes|chapter=12|verse=5}}). Thus, ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' constitutes a novel within a novel, wherein Abendsen writes of an alternative universe, where the Axis Powers lost World War II (1939\u20131947). For this reason, the Germans have banned the novel in the occupied US,<ref name=Castle />{{rp|91}} but it is widely read in the Pacific, and its publication is legal in the neutral countries.\n\n''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' postulates that President Roosevelt survives an assassination attempt but forgoes [[1940 United States presidential election|re-election in 1940]], honoring [[George Washington]]'s [[Term limits in the United States|two-term limit]]. The next president, [[Rexford Tugwell]], removes the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] from [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, saving it from Japanese attack, which ensures that the US enters the conflict a well-equipped naval power.<ref name=Castle />{{rp|70}} The United Kingdom retains most of its military-industrial strength, contributing more to the Allied war effort, leading to [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]]'s defeat in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]; the British advance through the [[Caucasus]] to fight alongside the Soviets to victory in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]; [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]] renege on their membership in the Axis Powers and betray them; British tanks and the [[Red Army]] jointly conquer Berlin; at the end of the war, the Nazi leaders\u2014including Adolf Hitler\u2014are tried for their war crimes, and the ''F\u00fchrer's'' last words are ''Deutsche, hier steh' ich'' (\"Germans, here I stand\"),<ref name=Castle />{{rp|131}} in imitation of [[Martin Luther]].\n\nAfter the war, President Tugwell initiates the [[New Deal]] on a worldwide scale. With American assistance, China goes through a decade of rebuilding. People in lesser developed places in Africa and Asia are sent television kits, through which they learn how to read and receive instructions on practical skills such as digging wells and purifying water. In turn, these places become markets for American factories. In the [[British Empire]], social and economic progress has also brought relief to the masses in India, Burma, Africa and the Middle East. In Europe, there is peace and harmony not only with itself but with the rest of the world. The Soviet Union, crippled by war losses, is divided up.<ref name=Castle />{{rp|165-168}} \n\nAround ten years after the end of the war, the British Empire, still under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]], becomes more racist and expansionist, establishing \"detention preserves\" for disloyal Chinese in South Asia, and suspecting that the US is undermining its rule in South Asia. Meanwhile, the US has ended racial discrimination by the 1950s. Whites and Blacks are able to live and work shoulder by shoulder.\nThese changes provoke racial-cultural tensions between the US and the UK, leading them to a Cold War for global [[hegemony]] between their two vaguely liberal, democratic, capitalist societies. Although the end of the novel is never depicted in the text, one character claims the book ends with the British Empire eventually defeating the US, becoming the sole world superpower.<ref name=Castle />{{rp|169-172}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\nDick said he conceived ''The Man in the High Castle'' when reading ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), by [[Ward Moore]], which occurs mainly in an alternative 20th-century US wherein the [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[American Civil War]]. In the acknowledgments to the book, he mentions other influences: ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' (1960), by [[William L. Shirer]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' (1962), by [[Alan Bullock]]; ''The [[Goebbels Diaries]]'' (1948), [[Louis P. Lochner]], translator; ''Foxes of the Desert'' (1960), by [[Paul Carrell]]; and the 1950 translation of the ''I Ching'' by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]].<ref name='vertex' /><ref name=Castle >{{cite book|last1=Dick|first1=Philip K.|title=The Man in the High Castle|date=2011|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|isbn=9780547601205|page=ix-x |edition=1st Mariner Books| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5aBwki0xmZEC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=the+man+in+the+high+castle+dick+miss+lonelyhearts#v=onepage&q=the%20man%20in%20the%20high%20castle%20dick%20miss%20lonelyhearts&f=false|access-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe acknowledgments have three references to traditional Japanese and Tibetan poetic forms; (i) volume one of the ''Anthology of Japanese Literature'' (1955), edited by [[Donald Keene]], from which is cited the ''[[haiku]]'' on page 48; (ii) from ''Zen and Japanese Culture'' (1955), by [[D. T. Suzuki|Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]], from which is cited a ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' on page 135; and (iii) the ''[[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'' (1960), edited by [[Walter Evans-Wentz]].\n\n[[Nathanael West]]'s ''[[Miss Lonelyhearts]]'' (1933)<ref>West, Nathanael (1933) ''Miss Lonelyhearts'', New York, N.Y.: [[Boni & Liveright|Liveright Publ.]]</ref> is also mentioned in the text,<ref name=Castle />{{rp|118}} written before the Roosevelt assassination divergence separating the world of ''The Man in the High Castle'' from ours. In this novella, \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" is a male newspaper journalist who writes anonymous advice as an [[Advice column|agony aunt]] to forlorn readers during the height of the Great Depression; hence, \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" tries to find consolation in religion, casual sex, rural vacations, and work, none of which provide him with the sense of authenticity and engagement with the outside world that he needs. West's book is about the elusive quality of relationships and quest for meaning at a time of political turmoil within the United States.\n\nPhilip Dick used the ''I Ching'' to make decisions crucial to the plot of ''The Man in the High Castle'' just as characters within the novel use it to guide decisions.<ref name='vertex'>{{cite journal |last=Cover |first=Arthur Byron | authorlink=Arthur Byron Cover|date=February 1974 |title=Interview with Philip K.

Both the Pacific States of America and the Eastern American puppet state appear to be mere provinces of the Empire of Japan and the Greater Nazi Reich without any apparent autonomous (even [[quisling]]) government institutions. The Rocky Mountain States become an [[anarchy|anarchic]] Neutral Zone. World War II appears to have ended following the destruction of Washington, D.C. with an atomic bomb, rather than a land invasion as in the book. As for Hitler, while elderly, he is apparently mostly hale in his Season 1 finale appearance, though other characters elsewhere in the season do reference his supposed physical infirmity. In the novel, the Italian Empire is a minor power that controls North Africa and the Middle East; in the series, it is shown through maps that these territories are part of the Nazi Empire, suggesting that either the Italian Empire was annexed after the war or is self-governing within the Reich. The drying of the Mediterranean has never happened, though a slightly similar event is mentioned by a character in Season Two as being planned.\n\nCharacters from the book that do appear are in most cases far more fleshed out with deeper and sometimes rather different backstories than their novel originals. For instance, Wegener is a ''[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]]'' in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], rather than a naval captain. Rather than being a member of an organized internal resistance (and despite his relatively low rank) Wegener is a close personal confidante of Hitler and his disillusionment with the regime appears to be largely personal. Juliana and Frank are unmarried, but living together, rather than divorced and separated. Frank has a sister, nephew and niece, although they are killed early in the series, and this propels him into a more active role in relation to the resistance. Juliana also has a sister whose murder by the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' early in the season instigates her search for the mysterious Man in the High Castle, as well as her having a mother and stepfather who are significant supporting characters. Joe Cinnadella is renamed \"Joe Blake\" (though he uses his novel name and backstory while undercover in Season 3) and, as he becomes closer to Juliana, appears to have growing doubts about his role as a Nazi agent. Robert Childan starts season 1 as a minor character but later becomes a main protagonist, starting a trade in the Pacific States and in the Neutral Zone, while Ed McCarthy has a rather more prominent and active role, being revealed as [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in Season 3.\n\nThere are several major additional characters introduced by the television series, and numerous narrative details and plotline elements differ radically from the source novel. For example, the planned Nazi [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] on Japan, \"Operation Dandelion\", is apparently being prevented only by Hitler's personal refusal to authorize it, leading Heydrich and the faction demanding pre-emptive war to plot the F\u00fchrer's assassination. In addition, Hawthorne Abendsen does not appear in the first season of the television version and ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'' is a series of [[newsreel]] films depicting multiple alternative realities rather than a novel (although this idea may be borrowed from Dick's later novel ''[[VALIS]]'' which features a mysterious film depicting yet another dystopian alternative history of the United States). As of the Season 1 finale, these films are being tracked down by SS agents like Blake for dispatch to Hitler for an as-yet-unknown purpose.\n\nIn season two, a map of the world is shown on John Smith's wall. On this map, Japan controls the entirety of the Pacific Ocean and most of the Asian continent, including China, India and half of Russia. Japan is also shown to control Australia, New Zealand, western Canada, Alaska, and all Pacific states of the United States. The Japanese Empire controls Baja California and South American countries like Peru and Chile. In contrast, Nazi Germany is shown as controlling all of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The German Empire also controls all of the United States and Canada up to the Rockies in the west and South America including Brazil. Germany also controls the western parts of former USSR such as Ukraine. There are also buffer zones between the empires. Neither empire seems to have invaded Mexico and this neutral zone continues up through the Rockies and through Canada. A similar neutral zone is seen dividing Russia in half.\n\nSeason two also shows two very different lifestyles in the Japanese-controlled Pacific states and the German-controlled east. The Germans have colonized the eastern states and are assimilating its inhabitants into Nazi beliefs. The Japanese Empire is occupying the Pacific states rather than colonizing them. There is enforced segregation between Japanese and Americans citizens. It is implied that Native Americans were exterminated by the Germans, and that the Japanese exterminated the Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, along with most Alaska natives.\n\nSeason 3 was released in 2018 and season 4 in 2019, with each season having 10 episodes.\n\n== Incomplete sequel ==\nIn a 1976 interview, Dick said he planned to write a sequel novel to ''The Man in the High Castle'': \"And so there's no real ending on it. I like to regard it as an open ending. It will segue into a sequel sometime.\"<ref name=\"KPRK Interview 1976\">{{cite web| url=http://www.philipkdickfans.com/literary-criticism/interviews/hour-25-a-talk-with-philip-k-dick/ |title=Hour 25: A Talk With Philip K.
