She competed there as a 30-year-old mother of two, earning her the nickname \"'''the flying housewife'''\", and was the most successful athlete at the event.\n\nHaving started competing in athletics in 1935, she took part in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] a year later. Although international competition was stopped by World War II, Blankers-Koen set several world records during that period, in events as diverse as the [[long jump]], the [[high jump]], and [[sprint (running)|sprint]] and [[hurdling]] events.\n\nApart from her four Olympic titles, she won five [[European Athletics Championships|European titles]] and 58 Dutch championships, and set or tied 12 world records \u2013 the last, [[pentathlon]], in 1951 aged 33. She retired from athletics in 1955, after which she became captain of the Dutch female track and field team. In 1999, she was voted \"Female Athlete of the Century\" by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). Her Olympic victories are credited with helping to eliminate the belief that age and motherhood were barriers to success in women's sport.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/>\n\n== Early life==\nBlankers-Koen was born on 26 April 1918 in [[Lage Vuursche]] (near [[Baarn]]) to Arnoldus and Helena Koen. Her father was a government official who competed in the [[shot put]] and [[discus suck my divk name=\"indyobit\"/> She had four brothers.<ref name=\"indyobit\"/> As a teenager, she enjoyed [[tennis]], swimming, [[gymnastics]], [[ice skating]], [[fencing]] and [[running]]. Standing {{convert|5|ft|9|in|m|2|order=flip|abbr=on}}, she was a natural athlete. It soon became clear she had a talent for sports, but she could not decide which sport to pick. A swimming coach advised her to concentrate on running because there were already several top swimmers in the Netherlands at that time (such as [[Rie Mastenbroek]]), and she would have a better chance to qualify for the Olympics in a track event.\n\nHer first appearance in the sport was in 1935, aged 17.<ref name=\"bbcprofile\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/3427787.stm|title=Winner against all odds|work=[[BBC News Online]]|first=Alex|last=Trickett|date=25 January 2004|accessdate=5 February 2007}}</ref> Her first competition was a disappointment, but in her third race, she set a national record in the 800&nbsp;m. Fanny Koen soon made the Dutch team, although as a sprinter, not a middle distance runner. At that time, 800&nbsp;m was generally considered too physically demanding for female contestants, and had been removed from the Olympic programme after 1928.<ref name=\"indyobit\"/> The following year, her coach and future husband, [[Jan Blankers]], a former Olympic [[triple-jump]]er who had participated in the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics]], encouraged her to enter the trials for the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in Berlin.<ref name=\"bbcprofile\"/> At eighteen years old, she was selected to compete in the [[high jump]] and the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m [[Relay race|relay]].\n\nAt the Berlin Olympics, the high jump and the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m relay competitions were held on the same day. In the high jump, she took fifth place (shared with two other jumpers) while the Dutch relay team came in fifth in the final (the sixth team in the final, Germany, was disqualified).<ref name=\"iaaf\"/> She also gained the [[autograph]] of American athlete [[Jesse Owens]]; it became her most treasured possession.<ref name=\"indyobit\"/><ref name=\"observer\">{{cite news|title=Fanny Blankers-Koen|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,641874,00.html|author=Fanny Blankers-Koen|work=[[The Observer]]|date=3 February 2002|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nSlowly, Koen rose to the top. In 1938, she ran her first world record (11.0&nbsp;seconds in the 100&nbsp;yards), and she also won her first international medals. At the European Championships in Vienna, she won the bronze in both the 100 and 200&nbsp;m,<ref name=r1/> which were both won by [[Stanis\u0142awa Walasiewicz]]. Many observers, and Koen herself, expected her to do well at the upcoming [[1940 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], which were due to be held in Helsinki in July 1940.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of World War II put a stop to the preparations. The Olympics were formally cancelled on 2 May 1940, a week before [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands was invaded]].\n\n== World War II ==\nJust prior to the invasion, Koen had become engaged, and on 29 August 1940, she married Jan Blankers (who was fifteen years her senior), thereupon changing her name to Blankers-Koen.  Blankers was then a sports journalist and the coach of the Dutch women's athletics team, even though he originally thought women should not compete in sports \u2013 not an unusual opinion at the time.  However, his attitude toward female athletes changed after he fell in love with Koen.<ref name= \"Een koningin met mannenbenen\">{{cite book | author=Kooman, Kees | title=Een koningin met mannenbenen | location=Amsterdam | publisher=L.J.

The championships were a slight disappointment. In the 100&nbsp;m semi-finals, held during the high jump final, she fell and failed to qualify for the final. Competing with bruises from the fall, she ended the high jump competition in fourth. The second day was more successful, as she won the 80&nbsp;m hurdles event, and led the Dutch relay team to victory in the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m.\n\nAs the leading female athlete in the Netherlands \u2013 in 1947 she won national titles in six women's events \u2013 Blankers-Koen was assured of a place on the Dutch team for the [[1948 Summer Olympics|first post-war Olympics]], held in London. After her experience in Oslo, she decided not to take part in all events, but limit herself to four: she dropped the high jump and long jump to concentrate on the 100&nbsp;m, the 200&nbsp;m, the 80&nbsp;m hurdles, and the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m relay (competition rules also prevented an athlete from competing in more than three individual track and field events<ref name=\"indyobit\">[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040127/ai_n9689782 Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114749/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040127/ai_n9689782 |date=24 September 2015 }}, ''The Independent'', 27 January 2004.

Although she displayed her form two months before the Games by beating her own 80&nbsp;m hurdles world record \u2013 one of the six world records that she held at that time<ref name=\"bbcprofile\"/> \u2013 some journalists questioned her, suggesting 30 years was too old for a woman to be an athlete. The British athletics team's manager, [[Jack Crump]], opined that she was \"too old to make the grade.\"<ref name=\"observer\"/> Many in the Netherlands were concerned for the welfare of the family, saying that she should stay at home to look after her children, not compete in athletics events.<ref name=\"observer\"/><ref name=\"bbcobit\"/>\n\nHer first competition was the 100&nbsp;m, and she qualified easily for the semi-finals, in which she set the fastest time. The final (2 August) was held on a muddy track and in rainy conditions. Blankers-Koen sped to the finish line in 11.9, easily beating her opponents [[Dorothy Manley]] and [[Shirley Strickland]], who took second and third.\n\nFanny Blankers-Koen thereby became the first Dutch athlete to win an Olympic title in athletics, but she was more concerned with her next event, the 80&nbsp;m hurdles. Her chief opponent was [[Maureen Gardner]], also coached by Blankers-Koen's husband<ref name=\"iaaf\"/> and who had equalled Blankers-Koen's world record prior to the Games, and would be running for her home crowd. Both athletes made the final, in which Blankers-Koen got off to a bad start (she would later claim she thought there had been a false start).<ref name= \"Een koningin met mannenbenen\"/> She picked up the pace quickly, but was unable to shake off Gardner, who kept close until the finish line, and the two finished almost simultaneously. When the British national anthem was played, the crowd in [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] cheered, and Blankers-Koen briefly thought she had been beaten. However, the anthem was played in honour of the British royal family, which entered the stadium at that time. Examination of the finish photo clearly showed that not Gardner, but Blankers-Koen had won, although both received the same time (11.2s).\n\nIn spite of her successes, Blankers-Koen nearly failed to start in the semi-finals of the 200&nbsp;m, held the day after the hurdles final.

[[Audrey Patterson]] placed in third, thereby becoming the first African American woman to win an Olympic medal.\n\nThe 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m final was held on the final day of the track and field competitions. The Dutch team, consisting of [[Xenia Stad-de Jong]], [[Netty Witziers-Timmer]], [[Gerda van der Kade-Koudijs]] and Blankers-Koen, qualified for the final, but just before the final, Blankers-Koen was missing. She had gone out to shop for a raincoat, and arrived just in time for the race. As the last runner, she took over the baton in third place, some five meters behind the Australian and Canadian runners.

In 1950, she broke the national record in the 200&nbsp;m, and some journalists already dubbed her as the \"new Fanny\".

Most of the other women on the team at the time suspect it was an attempt by Blankers and Blankers-Koen to eliminate an opponent, although this has never been confirmed.<ref name=\"Een koningin met mannenbenen\"/>\n\nThe same year, Blankers-Koen almost repeated her Olympic performance at the [[1950 European Athletics Championships|European Championships]] in Brussels. She won the titles in the 100&nbsp;m, 200&nbsp;m and 80&nbsp;m hurdles, all with large margins of victory (four-tenths of a second or more), but narrowly missed out on a fourth win in the relay, which was won by the British team.\n\nAt age 34, she took part in her [[1952 Summer Olympics|third Olympics]], which were held in Helsinki.<ref name=\"bbcobit\"/> Although she was in good physical condition, she was severely hampered by a skin [[boil]]. She qualified for the 100&nbsp;m semi-finals, but forfeited a start to save herself for the hurdles race. She reached the final in that event, but after knocking over the second hurdle, she abandoned the race. It was her last major competition. On 7 August 1955, Fanny Blankers-Koen was victorious for the last time, winning the national title in the [[shot put]], her 58th Dutch title.\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter her athletic career, Blankers-Koen served as the team leader of the Dutch athletics team, from the [[1958 European Athletics Championships|1958 European Championships]] to the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn 1977, Blankers-Koen's husband Jan died. It forced her, often dependent on her husband, to become more independent. Some years after his death, she moved back to her old hometown of [[Hoofddorp]]. In 1981, the ''[[Fanny Blankers-Koen Games]]'', an international athletics event, were established. They are still held annually in [[Hengelo]].\n\nBlankers-Koen's last moment of glory came in 1999.

Also in 2007, a plaque was placed in the sportspark at [[Olympiaplein]] in Amsterdam declaring \"''Hier trainde Fanny Blankers-Koen''\" (\"Fanny Blankers-Koen trained here\"). Several locations have been named in her honour, including a fire station in Amsterdam (''Fanny Blankers-Koenkazerne''), a park in [[Almere]] (''FBK-sportpark''), and a sports hall in [[Hoofddorp]]

She competed there as a 30-year-old mother of two, earning her the nickname \"'''the flying housewife'''\", and was the most successful athlete at the event.\n\nHaving started competing in athletics in 1935, she took part in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] a year later. Although international competition was stopped by World War II, Blankers-Koen set several world records during that period, in events as diverse as the [[long jump]], the [[high jump]], and [[sprint (running)|sprint]] and [[hurdling]] events.\n\nApart from her four Olympic titles, she won five [[European Athletics Championships|European titles]] and 58 Dutch championships, and set or tied 12 world records \u2013 the last, [[pentathlon]], in 1951 aged 33. She retired from athletics in 1955, after which she became captain of the Dutch female track and field team. In 1999, she was voted \"Female Athlete of the Century\" by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). Her Olympic victories are credited with helping to eliminate the belief that age and motherhood were barriers to success in women's sport.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/>\n\n== Early life==\nBlankers-Koen was born on 26 April 1918 in [[Lage Vuursche]] (near [[Baarn]]) to Arnoldus and Helena Koen. Her father was a government official who competed in the [[shot put]] and [[discus]].<ref name=\"indyobit\"/> She had four brothers.<ref name=\"indyobit\"/> As a teenager, she enjoyed [[tennis]], swimming, [[gymnastics]], [[ice skating]], [[fencing]] and [[running]]. Standing {{convert|5|ft|9|in|m|2|order=flip|abbr=on}}, she was a natural athlete. It soon became clear she had a talent for sports, but she could not decide which sport to pick. A swimming coach advised her to concentrate on running because there were already several top swimmers in the Netherlands at that time (such as [[Rie Mastenbroek]]), and she would have a better chance to qualify for the Olympics in a track event.\n\nHer first appearance in the sport was in 1935, aged 17.<ref name=\"bbcprofile\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/3427787.stm|title=Winner against all odds|work=[[BBC News Online]]|first=Alex|last=Trickett|date=25 January 2004|accessdate=5 February 2007}}</ref> Her first competition was a disappointment, but in her third race, she set a national record in the 800&nbsp;m. Fanny Koen soon made the Dutch team, although as a sprinter, not a middle distance runner. At that time, 800&nbsp;m was generally considered too physically demanding for female contestants, and had been removed from the Olympic programme after 1928.<ref name=\"indyobit\"/> The following year, her coach and future husband, [[Jan Blankers]], a former Olympic [[triple-jump]]er who had participated in the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics]], encouraged her to enter the trials for the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in Berlin.<ref name=\"bbcprofile\"/> At eighteen years old, she was selected to compete in the [[high jump]] and the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m [[Relay race|relay]].\n\nAt the Berlin Olympics, the high jump and the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m relay competitions were held on the same day. In the high jump, she took fifth place (shared with two other jumpers) while the Dutch relay team came in fifth in the final (the sixth team in the final, Germany, was disqualified).<ref name=\"iaaf\"/> She also gained the [[autograph]] of American athlete [[Jesse Owens]]; it became her most treasured possession.<ref name=\"indyobit\"/><ref name=\"observer\">{{cite news|title=Fanny Blankers-Koen|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,641874,00.html|author=Fanny Blankers-Koen|work=[[The Observer]]|date=3 February 2002|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nSlowly, Koen rose to the top. In 1938, she ran her first world record (11.0&nbsp;seconds in the 100&nbsp;yards), and she also won her first international medals. At the European Championships in Vienna, she won the bronze in both the 100 and 200&nbsp;m,<ref name=r1/> which were both won by [[Stanis\u0142awa Walasiewicz]]. Many observers, and Koen herself, expected her to do well at the upcoming [[1940 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], which were due to be held in Helsinki in July 1940.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of World War II put a stop to the preparations. The Olympics were formally cancelled on 2 May 1940, a week before [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands was invaded]].\n\n== World War II ==\nJust prior to the invasion, Koen had become engaged, and on 29 August 1940, she married Jan Blankers (who was fifteen years her senior), thereupon changing her name to Blankers-Koen.  Blankers was then a sports journalist and the coach of the Dutch women's athletics team, even though he originally thought women should not compete in sports \u2013 not an unusual opinion at the time.  However, his attitude toward female athletes changed after he fell in love with Koen.<ref name= \"Een koningin met mannenbenen\">{{cite book | author=Kooman, Kees | title=Een koningin met mannenbenen | location=Amsterdam | publisher=L.J.

The championships were a slight disappointment. In the 100&nbsp;m semi-finals, held during the high jump final, she fell and failed to qualify for the final. Competing with bruises from the fall, she ended the high jump competition in fourth. The second day was more successful, as she won the 80&nbsp;m hurdles event, and led the Dutch relay team to victory in the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m.\n\nAs the leading female athlete in the Netherlands \u2013 in 1947 she won national titles in six women's events \u2013 Blankers-Koen was assured of a place on the Dutch team for the [[1948 Summer Olympics|first post-war Olympics]], held in London. After her experience in Oslo, she decided not to take part in all events, but limit herself to four: she dropped the high jump and long jump to concentrate on the 100&nbsp;m, the 200&nbsp;m, the 80&nbsp;m hurdles, and the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m relay (competition rules also prevented an athlete from competing in more than three individual track and field events<ref name=\"indyobit\">[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040127/ai_n9689782 Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114749/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040127/ai_n9689782 |date=24 September 2015 }}, ''The Independent'', 27 January 2004.

Although she displayed her form two months before the Games by beating her own 80&nbsp;m hurdles world record \u2013 one of the six world records that she held at that time<ref name=\"bbcprofile\"/> \u2013 some journalists questioned her, suggesting 30 years was too old for a woman to be an athlete. The British athletics team's manager, [[Jack Crump]], opined that she was \"too old to make the grade.\"<ref name=\"observer\"/> Many in the Netherlands were concerned for the welfare of the family, saying that she should stay at home to look after her children, not compete in athletics events.<ref name=\"observer\"/><ref name=\"bbcobit\"/>\n\nHer first competition was the 100&nbsp;m, and she qualified easily for the semi-finals, in which she set the fastest time. The final (2 August) was held on a muddy track and in rainy conditions. Blankers-Koen sped to the finish line in 11.9, easily beating her opponents [[Dorothy Manley]] and [[Shirley Strickland]], who took second and third.\n\nFanny Blankers-Koen thereby became the first Dutch athlete to win an Olympic title in athletics, but she was more concerned with her next event, the 80&nbsp;m hurdles. Her chief opponent was [[Maureen Gardner]], also coached by Blankers-Koen's husband<ref name=\"iaaf\"/> and who had equalled Blankers-Koen's world record prior to the Games, and would be running for her home crowd. Both athletes made the final, in which Blankers-Koen got off to a bad start (she would later claim she thought there had been a false start).<ref name= \"Een koningin met mannenbenen\"/> She picked up the pace quickly, but was unable to shake off Gardner, who kept close until the finish line, and the two finished almost simultaneously. When the British national anthem was played, the crowd in [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] cheered, and Blankers-Koen briefly thought she had been beaten. However, the anthem was played in honour of the British royal family, which entered the stadium at that time. Examination of the finish photo clearly showed that not Gardner, but Blankers-Koen had won, although both received the same time (11.2s).\n\nIn spite of her successes, Blankers-Koen nearly failed to start in the semi-finals of the 200&nbsp;m, held the day after the hurdles final.

[[Audrey Patterson]] placed in third, thereby becoming the first African American woman to win an Olympic medal.\n\nThe 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m final was held on the final day of the track and field competitions. The Dutch team, consisting of [[Xenia Stad-de Jong]], [[Netty Witziers-Timmer]], [[Gerda van der Kade-Koudijs]] and Blankers-Koen, qualified for the final, but just before the final, Blankers-Koen was missing. She had gone out to shop for a raincoat, and arrived just in time for the race. As the last runner, she took over the baton in third place, some five meters behind the Australian and Canadian runners.

A year earlier, a new Dutch sprint talent, [[Foekje Dillema]] had made her breakthrough. In 1950, she broke the national record in the 200&nbsp;m, and some journalists already dubbed her as the \"new Fanny\".

Most of the other women on the team at the time suspect it was an attempt by Blankers and Blankers-Koen to eliminate an opponent, although this has never been confirmed.<ref name=\"Een koningin met mannenbenen\"/>\n\nThe same year, Blankers-Koen almost repeated her Olympic performance at the [[1950 European Athletics Championships|European Championships]] in Brussels. She won the titles in the 100&nbsp;m, 200&nbsp;m and 80&nbsp;m hurdles, all with large margins of victory (four-tenths of a second or more), but narrowly missed out on a fourth win in the relay, which was won by the British team.\n\nAt age 34, she took part in her [[1952 Summer Olympics|third Olympics]], which were held in Helsinki.<ref name=\"bbcobit\"/> Although she was in good physical condition, she was severely hampered by a skin [[boil]]. She qualified for the 100&nbsp;m semi-finals, but forfeited a start to save herself for the hurdles race. She reached the final in that event, but after knocking over the second hurdle, she abandoned the race. It was her last major competition. On 7 August 1955, Fanny Blankers-Koen was victorious for the last time, winning the national title in the [[shot put]], her 58th Dutch title.\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter her athletic career, Blankers-Koen served as the team leader of the Dutch athletics team, from the [[1958 European Athletics Championships|1958 European Championships]] to the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn 1977, Blankers-Koen's husband Jan died. It forced her, often dependent on her husband, to become more independent. Some years after his death, she moved back to her old hometown of [[Hoofddorp]]. In 1981, the ''[[Fanny Blankers-Koen Games]]'', an international athletics event, were established. They are still held annually in [[Hengelo]].\n\nBlankers-Koen's last moment of glory came in 1999.

Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]].

Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]].

The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened.

A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J.

In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somerville's collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency.

The bedrooms are arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.\n\nThe building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to be one of the three Oxford colleges which can allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their three or four-year undergraduate degree courses.<ref name=Oxfordwebsite /><ref name=whychoose />\n\n===Gardens===\n[[File:Park Lawn, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|]]\nSomerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass.

She was succeeded by the classical scholar [[Emily Penrose]] (1906\u20131926), who set up in 1903 the ''Mary Somerville Research Fellowship'' offering women in Oxford opportunities for research.\n\nThe current principal is [[Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon]], who took up the appointment in August 2017, succeeding [[Alice Prochaska]].<ref name=\"ox\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-02-10-new-somerville-principal-announced |title=New Somerville Principal announced &#124; University of Oxford |website=ox.ac.uk |accessdate=2018-08-20}}</ref> To date seven principals have been alumnae of Somerville, two of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's College]].\n\n==Coat of arms and motto==\nLike all Oxford colleges, Somerville has a variety of symbols and colours which are associated with it.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]], [[Bertha Johnson]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest [[quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]. Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]]. There are also remains of some 19th-century buildings, including a stone-lined well.<ref name=hughes>{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/the-catherine-hughes-building/ |title=The Catherine Hughes Building |access-date=30 August 2018 |website=www.some.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Walton House===\n[[File:Walton House, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|right|House seen from the east]]\nThe original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called House) was built in 1826 and purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=26}} The house could only accommodate seven of the twelve students who came up to Oxford in the first year.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63899#n43 |title=Somerville College \u2013 British History Online |website=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> In 1881, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, [[Walter Cave]] added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}}\n\nToday House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to college are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews; some of the college's paintings by [[Roger Fry]] are located here.<ref name=artuk /> Most of the administration of college, and the academic [[pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]] are in House, as is the Mary Somerville Room, a reception room featuring paintings by Mary Somerville, [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[George Frederic Watts]].<ref name=artuk />\n\n===Park===\n[[File:Park Building, Somerville College, Oxford University.jpg|thumb|right|Park Building]]\nOriginally known as West, due to its location within the college, the idea of building a second self-contained hall was inspired by [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), making it one of the largest college libraries in the university.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}}\n\n[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] have been notable benefactors to the library.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}} The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, [[John Constable]], [[Maud Sumner]] and [[Patrick George]].<ref name=artuk />\n\nThe John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/ |title=John Stuart Mill Collection \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle (having been designed to bring the college together) and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities.

A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from [[University College, Oxford|University]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] Colleges for \u00a34,000 and \u00a31,400 respectively.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

The Senior Common Room is situated on the ground floor. The first floor is occupied by the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly during term time.\n\nMaitland now houses few students, being mainly occupied by fellows' offices and the college IT office. The building is named after Principal Agnes Maitland, and is to the south of Hall.<ref name=\"blogs.some.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Penrose===\nThe Penrose block was designed by [http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/mayors/1836_1962/rogers_harold_1937.html/ Harold Rogers] in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. A row of poplars had to be removed in 1926 for the construction to take place at the south-western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A Walton Street.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/>{{sfn |Manuel|2013 |p=35}} It was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named after Dame [[Emily Penrose]], the third principal of the college. It contains mainly first-year accommodation, with around 30 rooms.<ref name=\"blogs.some.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Darbishire===\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford UK.png|thumb|right|Darbishire Quad]]\nDarbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the Oxford Oratory. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

There is a high degree of variability of usage among Nivkhs depending on village, clan, and even the individual speaker. Varieties are traditionally grouped into four geographic clusters. These are the lower-Amur variety, the North Sakhalin variety (spoken on the coasts around the [[Amur Liman]], including the mainland and west Sakhalin), the East Sakhalin variety (including populations around the [[Tymy River]]), and the South Sakhalin variety (spoken around the [[Poronay River]]). The lexical and phonological differences across these varieties is great enough that specialists describe them as falling into two or three languages, though for purposes of language revival among a small and already divided population, Nivkh is generally presented as a single language, due to fears of the consequences of further division. Gruzdeva (1998) notes that speakers of East Sakhalin and the lower Amur cannot understand each other, and divides the varieties into two languages, '''Nivkh proper''' (including the lower Amur, Northern Sakhalin / Straits and Western Sakhalin varieties) and '''Nighvng''' (the East and South Sakhalin varieties).  Fortescue (2016)<ref name=\"Fortescue2016\">Fortescue, Michael. 2016. ''Comparative Nivkh Dictionary''. Languages of the World/Dictionaries (LW/D) 62. Munich: Lincom Europa. {{ISBN|9783862886876}}</ref> notes that the Amur, East Sakhalin and South Sakhalin varieties have low intelligibility with each other, and considers each of them to constitute a separate language.\n\n==Classification==\nNivkh is not known to be related to any other language, making it an [[language isolate|isolated family]]. For convenience, it may be included in the geographical group of [[Paleosiberian languages]]. Many words in the Nivkh languages bear a certain resemblance to words of similar meaning in other [[Paleosiberian languages]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Korean language|Korean]], or [[Tungusic languages]], but no regular sound correspondences have been discovered to systematically account for the vocabularies of these various families, so any lexical similarities are considered to be due to chance or to borrowing.\n\n[[Michael Fortescue]] suggested in 1998 that Nivkh might be related to the [[Mosan languages]] of North America,<ref>Fortescue, M. (1998).

This coincided with smallpox epidemics and the expansion of Sakhalin's prisoner population, as Russia began sending groups of its convicts to Sakhalin in 1873. At this time, reportedly few Nivkh spoke Russian.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Shaman's Coat: A Native History of Siberia|last=Reid|first=Anne|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=2002|isbn=0-8027-1399-8|location=London|chapter=The Ainu, Nivkh, and Uilta|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shamanscoatnativ00reid}}</ref>\n\nThe official Russian census reported similar numbers of ethnic Nivkhs in 1897 (4,500) and in 2002 (5,200). However, the number of native speakers among the ethnic Nivkhs dropped from 100% to 23.3% in the same period. All recorded native Nivkh speakers were bilingual in Russian, most of them were born in 1920-1940s,[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_04_04.htm] when a significant decline in the number of native Nivkh speakers occurred, due to Stalin's policy of collectivization imposed on indigenous economies,<ref name=\":1\" /> and in many cases, driving Nivkh individuals to hired labor, marking a departure from traditional means of subsistence.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many Nivkh were forcibly displaced from their more widely spread settlements to Nogliki, a small city, in the process of centralization. The traditional Nivkh way of life was gradually and sometimes forcibly converted to a Soviet way of life, as changes in subsistence, diet, dwellings, and education have resulted. In 2010s the Nivkh language is taught in the 1-3 grades in several schools in [[Sakhalin]] and [[Khabarovsk]] regions. A monthly newspaper \"Nivkh dif\" (Nivkh language) is published in Sakhalin. Nivkh language books are also regularly published in Russia.\n\n==Grammar==\nNivkh is an agglutinating synthetic language. It has a developed case system, as well as other grammatical markers, but no grammatical gender. The basic word order of Nivkh is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], the subject being frequently omitted in speech.[[Nivkh language#cite note-9|<sup>[9]</sup>]] Nivkh is notable for the high degree of incorporation between words. For example, morphemes that express spatial relationships (prepositions or postpositions in many other languages) are incorporated into the noun to which they relate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gruzdeva|first=Ekaterina|title=The Linguistic Consequences of Nivkh Language Attrition|journal=SKY Journal of Linguistics|volume=15}}</ref> Words consist of easily definable roots and productive grammatical morphemes, most of which are suffixes. Nivkh has no adjectives, but rather verbs that describe a state of being. There are two verb tenses: non-future and future. The non-future form may combine with adverbials, as well as context, to indicate a time frame.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Syntax of the Nivkh Language: The Amur Dialect|last=Nedjalkov|first=Vladimir|last2=Otaina|first2=Galina|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2013|location=Philadelphia, PA}}</ref>\n\nAs Russian has become the dominant language in all spheres of life, Nivkh grammar has changed in the last century. For example, Nivkh has recently begun to mark plurals on counting nouns and pairs, a change that originated from the grammar rules of Russian. However, it has been postulated that due to the vastly differing grammatical structures of the two tongues, grammatical interference has not been extensive. Simplification has occurred past borrowed Russian structure, though; due to disuse of the language and a changing culture, many of the complex morphological aspects of Nivkh have been simplified or fallen out of use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gruzdeva|first=Ekaterina|title=Aspects of Russian-Nivkh Grammatical Interference: The Nivkh Imperative.|journal=Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics|volume=28}}</ref> In a process referred to as obsolescence, things like the distinction between the morpheme for counting sledges and the morpheme for counting fishnets has disappeared, with speakers opting to use more general categories of counting numbers or other descriptors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521653213|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=23|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Orthography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Nivkh orthography<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/nivkh.htm|title=Nivkh language, alphabet and pronunciation|work=Omniglot| accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n!

This has been taken a distinct process, but has also been explained to be fundamentally the same, with the [[citation form]] of these verbs containing an underlying stop, lenited due to the presence of a former ''i-'' prefix (which still survives in the citation form of other verbs, where it causes regular consonant alternation).

There is a high degree of variability of usage among Nivkhs depending on village, clan, and even the individual speaker. Varieties are traditionally grouped into four geographic clusters. These are the lower-Amur variety, the North Sakhalin variety (spoken on the coasts around the [[Amur Liman]], including the mainland and west Sakhalin), the East Sakhalin variety (including populations around the [[Tymy River]]), and the South Sakhalin variety (spoken around the [[Poronay River]]). The lexical and phonological differences across these varieties is great enough that specialists describe them as falling into two or three languages, though for purposes of language revival among a small and already divided population, Nivkh is generally presented as a single language, due to fears of the consequences of further division. Gruzdeva (1998) notes that speakers of East Sakhalin and the lower Amur cannot understand each other, and divides the varieties into two languages, '''Nivkh proper''' (including the lower Amur, Northern Sakhalin / Straits and Western Sakhalin varieties) and '''Nighvng''' (the East and South Sakhalin varieties).

For convenience, it may be included in the geographical group of [[Paleosiberian languages]]. Many words in the Nivkh languages bear a certain resemblance to words of similar meaning in other [[Paleosiberian languages]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Korean language|Korean]], or [[Tungusic languages]], but no regular sound correspondences have been discovered to systematically account for the vocabularies of these various families, so any lexical similarities are considered to be due to chance or to borrowing.\n\n[[Michael Fortescue]] suggested in 1998 that Nivkh might be related to the [[Mosan languages]] of North America,<ref>Fortescue, M. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Su_xVd0gTOcC&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=nivkh+language+related+to+mosan&source=bl&ots=HqRwtXlQjK&sig=mSxlvDhZxcSgVlFo6wFc-3p34Bk&hl=en&ei=yB75S6HfBYL-0gSL29zpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=nivkh%20language%20related%20to%20mosan&f=false ''Language relations across Bering Strait: reappraising the archaeological and linguistic evidence''.]</ref> and later, in 2011, he argued that Nivkh, which he referred to as an \"isolated Amuric language\", was related to the [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages]], forming a Chukotko-Kamchatkan\u2013Amuric language family,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fortescue | first1 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of Nivkh to Chukotko-Kamchatkan revisited | url = | journal = Lingua | volume = 121 | issue = 8| pages = 1359\u20131376 | doi = 10.1016/j.lingua.2011.03.001 }}</ref> though the evidence was judged to be \"insufficient\" by ''Glottolog''.<ref name=Glottolog/>\n\nMore recently, Sergei Nikolaev argued in two papers for a systematic relationship between Nivkh and the [[Algic languages]] of North America and a more distant relationship between these two together and the [[Wakashan languages]] of coastal British Columbia.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/15693360/S.L._Nikolaev._2015._Toward_the_reconstruction_of_Proto-Algonquian-Wakashan._Part_1_Proof_of_the_Algonquian-Wakashan_relationship Nikolaev, S.

They maintained trade with the neighboring Ainu, Japanese, and Chinese, until Russian contact, which began in the 17th century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Peoples of Siberia|last=Ivanov|first=S.|last2=Levin|first2=M.|last3=Smolyak|first3=A. V.|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1964|chapter=The Nikvhi}}</ref> The 19th century shows the first recorded decline of Nivkh numbers, with official estimates dropping from 1856 to 1889. This coincided with smallpox epidemics and the expansion of Sakhalin's prisoner population, as Russia began sending groups of its convicts to Sakhalin in 1873. At this time, reportedly few Nivkh spoke Russian.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Shaman's Coat: A Native History of Siberia|last=Reid|first=Anne|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=2002|isbn=0-8027-1399-8|location=London|chapter=The Ainu, Nivkh, and Uilta|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shamanscoatnativ00reid}}</ref>\n\nThe official Russian census reported similar numbers of ethnic Nivkhs in 1897 (4,500) and in 2002 (5,200). However, the number of native speakers among the ethnic Nivkhs dropped from 100% to 23.3% in the same period. All recorded native Nivkh speakers were bilingual in Russian, most of them were born in 1920-1940s,[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_04_04.htm] when a significant decline in the number of native Nivkh speakers occurred, due to Stalin's policy of collectivization imposed on indigenous economies,<ref name=\":1\" /> and in many cases, driving Nivkh individuals to hired labor, marking a departure from traditional means of subsistence.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many Nivkh were forcibly displaced from their more widely spread settlements to Nogliki, a small city, in the process of centralization. The traditional Nivkh way of life was gradually and sometimes forcibly converted to a Soviet way of life, as changes in subsistence, diet, dwellings, and education have resulted. In 2010s the Nivkh language is taught in the 1-3 grades in several schools in [[Sakhalin]] and [[Khabarovsk]] regions. A monthly newspaper \"Nivkh dif\" (Nivkh language) is published in Sakhalin. Nivkh language books are also regularly published in Russia.\n\n==Grammar==\nNivkh is an agglutinating synthetic language. It has a developed case system, as well as other grammatical markers, but no grammatical gender. The basic word order of Nivkh is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], the subject being frequently omitted in speech.[[Nivkh language#cite note-9|<sup>[9]</sup>]] Nivkh is notable for the high degree of incorporation between words. For example, morphemes that express spatial relationships (prepositions or postpositions in many other languages) are incorporated into the noun to which they relate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gruzdeva|first=Ekaterina|title=The Linguistic Consequences of Nivkh Language Attrition|journal=SKY Journal of Linguistics|volume=15}}</ref> Words consist of easily definable roots and productive grammatical morphemes, most of which are suffixes. Nivkh has no adjectives, but rather verbs that describe a state of being. There are two verb tenses: non-future and future. The non-future form may combine with adverbials, as well as context, to indicate a time frame.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Syntax of the Nivkh Language: The Amur Dialect|last=Nedjalkov|first=Vladimir|last2=Otaina|first2=Galina|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2013|location=Philadelphia, PA}}</ref>\n\nAs Russian has become the dominant language in all spheres of life, Nivkh grammar has changed in the last century. For example, Nivkh has recently begun to mark plurals on counting nouns and pairs, a change that originated from the grammar rules of Russian. However, it has been postulated that due to the vastly differing grammatical structures of the two tongues, grammatical interference has not been extensive. Simplification has occurred past borrowed Russian structure, though; due to disuse of the language and a changing culture, many of the complex morphological aspects of Nivkh have been simplified or fallen out of use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gruzdeva|first=Ekaterina|title=Aspects of Russian-Nivkh Grammatical Interference: The Nivkh Imperative.|journal=Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics|volume=28}}</ref> In a process referred to as obsolescence, things like the distinction between the morpheme for counting sledges and the morpheme for counting fishnets has disappeared, with speakers opting to use more general categories of counting numbers or other descriptors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521653213|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=23|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Orthography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Nivkh orthography<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/nivkh.htm|title=Nivkh language, alphabet and pronunciation|work=Omniglot| accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n!

This has been taken a distinct process, but has also been explained to be fundamentally the same, with the [[citation form]] of these verbs containing an underlying stop, lenited due to the presence of a former ''i-'' prefix (which still survives in the citation form of other verbs, where it causes regular consonant alternation). Initial fricatives in nouns never change.<ref name=\"CA\"/>\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowel system of Nivkh is unusual, being described by [[Ian Maddieson]] as \"defective.\" It is actually a rotated system in which a gap in the mid front region of the [[vowel space]] is compensated for by moving vowels around. The centralised {{IPA|/\u0264/}} has been described by Maddieson (1984) as complementing a gap caused by the lack of an ordinary mid front vowel.\n\nThe mid front vowel expected in a five-vowel system may have in the past developed into a close-to-mid front unrounded diphthong, represented in Maddieson's description of the language as {{IPA|/\u026ae/}}.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2 align=\"center\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n! align=\"center\" colspan=2|[[Back vowel|back]]\n|-\n!<small>unrounded</small>\n!<small>rounded</small>\n|-align=center\n!
