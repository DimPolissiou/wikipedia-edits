Her father was a political reporter and [[journalist]] for the ''[[New York World]]''. Her parents divorced when she was still a child. In June 1949, Oliver joined her mother in [[Southern California]], where Ruth was in the process of becoming a well-known [[Hollywood]] astrologer. Oliver made a decision to embark upon a career as an actress and chose the stage name Susan Oliver.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nBy September 1949 and using her new name, Oliver returned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to begin drama studies at [[Swarthmore College]], followed by professional training at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in New York City. After working in [[summer stock]] and regional theater, and in unbilled bits in daytime and primetime TV shows and commercials, she made her first major television appearance in a supporting role in the July 31, 1955, episode of the live drama series ''Goodyear TV Playhouse,'' and quickly progressed to leading parts in other shows.\n\nOliver did numerous TV shows in 1957, and appeared on stage. She began the year with an [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] part, as the daughter of an 18th-century [[Manhattan]] family, in her first Broadway play, ''Small War on Murray Hill,'' a [[Robert E. Sherwood]] comedy.<ref>The play's opening night at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] was on January 3, 1957, and 12 performances later, closing night was January 12. [[Leo Genn]] performed as [[General Howe]].</ref> That same year, Oliver replaced [[Mary Ure]] as the female lead in the Broadway production of [[John Osborne]]'s play ''[[Look Back in Anger]].''\n\nThe play's short run was immediately followed by larger roles in live TV plays on ''Kaiser Aluminum Hour,'' ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'', and ''Matinee Theater.'' Oliver then went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], where she appeared in the November 14, 1957, episode of ''[[Climax! (TV series)|Climax!]],'' one of the few live drama series based on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], as well as in a number of filmed shows, including one of the first episodes of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Wagon Train]],'' ''[[Father Knows Best]],'' ''[[The Americans (1961 TV series)|The Americans]],'' and ''[[Johnny Staccato]].''\n\nIn July 1957, Oliver was chosen for the title role in her first motion picture, ''[[The Green-Eyed Blonde]],'' a low-budget [[independent film|independent]] [[melodrama]] scripted by [[Dalton Trumbo]] (under a pseudonym), and released by [[Warner Bros.]] in December on the bottom half of a double bill.<ref>The film was scripted by [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] writer Dalton Trumbo and credited to \"[[Hollywood blacklist|front]]\" Sally Stubblefield.</ref> It is the only motion picture on which Oliver received top billing.{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}} \n\nIn mid-1958, Oliver began rehearsals for a co-starring role in ''Patate,'' her second Broadway play.<ref>The melancholy comedy, written by [[France|French]] playwright [[Marcel Achard]], played to sold-out theaters in [[Paris]] upon its premiere in 1957. Adapted for American audiences by [[Irwin Shaw]], ''Patate'' (which in [[French language|French]] means \"[[Wiktionary:spud|spud]]\", but can also mean \"[[Wiktionary:chump|chump]]\") paired Oliver with veteran leading man [[Tom Ewell]] (in the title role) and [[Lee Bowman]]. The play opened at [[Henry Miller's Theatre]] on October 28, 1958, and closed on November 1.</ref> Its seven-performance run was even shorter than that of ''Small War on Murray Hill,'' but won Oliver a [[Theatre World Award]] for \"Outstanding Breakout Performance\"; it was her last Broadway appearance.\n\n===Television and films===\n[[File:Gardner McKay Susan Oliver Guy Stockwell Adventures in Paradise 1961.JPG|right|thumb|300px|With [[Gardner McKay]] and [[Guy Stockwell]] in ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]'' (1961)]]\n[[File:Susan Oliver as Vina as an Orion slave girl.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Susan Oliver as Vina transformed into an Orion slave girl, in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episodes [[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|\"The Cage\"]] and [[The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|\"The Menagerie\"]]]]\nOn April 6, 1960, the 28-year-old Oliver played a spoiled young runaway, Maggie Hamilton, who gets soundly spanked by scout Flint McCullough ([[Robert Horton (actor)|Robert Horton]]), in \"The Maggie Hamilton Story\" on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Wagon Train]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/susan-oliver/credits/175772/|title=Susan Oliver|website=TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> McCullough searches for her so the wagon train can proceed on schedule, and after rescuing her from some drunken hooligans and an Indian played by [[Leonard Nimoy]], he is rewarded by her biting him and pulling his gun on him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0743192/|title=The Maggie Hamilton Story|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> On November 9, 1960, she was cast as the lead guest star in \"The Cathy Eckhart Story\" on ''Wagon Train'', with husband-and-wife actors [[John Larch]] and [[Vivi Janiss]] as Ben and Sarah Harness.\n\nOliver was cast in the 1960 episode of ''[[The Deputy (TV series)|The Deputy]]'' as the long-lost daughter of star [[Henry Fonda]]'s late girl friend, and appeared in ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre]]'' episode \"Knife of Hate\" as Susan Pittman.

She was one of the original 19 women admitted to the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[Directing Workshop for Women]] (DWW), and she left a \"good chunk of funding for the DWW.\"<ref>''WOMEN DIRECTORS IN HOLLYWOOD, The Founding of the Directing Workshop for Women of the American Film Institute, a History, THE DREAM OF THE MARBLE BRIDGE,'' http://janhaag.com/ESessays.html</ref> In 1977, she wrote and directed ''Cowboysan'', her AFI DWW short film that presents the fantasy scenario of a Japanese actor and actress playing leads in an American [[western (genre)|western]].

She made her last onscreen appearance in the November 6, 1988, episode of the syndicated horror anthology ''[[Freddy's Nightmares]]''. During her career in Hollywood, Oliver appeared in more than 100 television programs.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\n==Aviator and author==\nOliver experienced an event in February 1959 that underscored her later aviation accomplishments. She was a passenger aboard [[Pan Am Flight 115]], a [[Boeing 707]] on a transatlantic flight from Paris to New York City when it dropped from {{convert|35000|to|6000|ft}}. It was February 3, 1959, the same day [[Buddy Holly]] died in an airplane crash. These events caused her to avoid flying for the next year, even turning down job offers (with the exception of auditioning for ''[[BUtterfield 8]]'') if they were so short notice she could only travel by air. She eventually underwent hypnosis to overcome her fear of flying.<ref name=odyssey/>\n\nIn July 1964, [[Hal Fishman]] introduced her to personal flying when he took her on an evening flight over [[Los Angeles]] in a [[Cessna 172]].<ref name=odyssey>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Susan|title=Odyssey: A Daring Transatlantic Journey|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co.|year=1983|isbn=0-02-592920-8}}</ref> The experience motivated her to return the next day to the [[Santa Monica Airport]] to begin training for a private pilot certificate. In 1966, while preparing for her own transatlantic flight, she was a passenger in a [[Piper J-3 Cub]] when the pilot ran into wires while \"show-boating\";<ref name=odyssey /> the airplane flipped and crashed. She and the pilot escaped injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=75958&key=0|title=NTSB No. LAX67D0086|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, piloting her own [[Aero Commander 200]], she became the fourth<!--History records Amelia Earhart as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, she did it alone in a Lockheed Vega in 1932. Gerry Mock did it in 1964 in a [[Cessna 180]] as part of the first solo round-the-world flight by a woman.

Although she was attempting to fly to Moscow, her odyssey ended in Denmark after the government of the Soviet Union denied her permission to enter its air space. She wrote about her aviation exploits and philosophy of life in an autobiography published in 1983.<ref name=odyssey/>\n\nIn 1968, she was contacted by Learjet to see if she was interested in obtaining a type rating on one of their jets with the intent to set record flights for them. She earned the rating and even flew some charters (having by that time acquired a commercial pilot certificate in single- and multiengined land airplanes), but did not fly any record flights in their jets.<ref name=odyssey/>\n\nIn 1970, Oliver co-piloted a [[Piper PA-24 Comanche|Piper Comanche]] to victory in the 2760-mile transcontinental race known as the \"[[Powder Puff Derby (1947)|Powder Puff Derby]]\", which resulted in her being named Pilot of the Year. The pilot was Margaret Mead (not [[Margaret Mead|the famous anthropologist]]), an experienced pilot who had flown in several derbies with different co-pilots. In 1972, her training for a glider rating was chronicled for an episode of the television series ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' and the segment aired in March 1973.<ref>[https://newspaperarchive.com/robesonian/1973-03-18/page-27 Robesonian newspaper archives], March 18, 1973; accessed March 7, 2015.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''FAA Registry'', the glider rating was issued to Oliver on July 21, 1972. It was her last rating. The registry shows her to have earned commercial pilot ratings for airplane single-engined land, airplane multiengined land, instrument airplane, and private privileges for glider. Her last aviation medical examination was in May 1976; therefore, she could not legally pilot any aircraft except gliders after May 1978, marking the end of her piloting of powered aircraft.<ref>[https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry Profile], amsrvs.registry.faa.gov; accessed March 7, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOliver was diagnosed with colorectal cancer that later [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to her lungs, and she died on May 10, 1990, at the [[Motion Picture and Television Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/15/obituaries/susan-oliver-is-dead-television-actress-61.html|title=Susan Oliver Is Dead; Television Actress|newspaper=New York Times|date=1990-05-15|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Selected TV and filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In June 1949, Oliver joined her mother in [[Southern California]], where Ruth was in the process of becoming a well-known [[Hollywood]] astrologer. Oliver made a decision to embark upon a career as an actress and chose the stage name Susan Oliver.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nBy September 1949 and using her new name, Oliver returned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to begin drama studies at [[Swarthmore College]], followed by professional training at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in New York City. After working in [[summer stock]] and regional theater, and in unbilled bits in daytime and primetime TV shows and commercials, she made her first major television appearance in a supporting role in the July 31, 1955, episode of the live drama series ''Goodyear TV Playhouse,'' and quickly progressed to leading parts in other shows.\n\nOliver did numerous TV shows in 1957, and appeared on stage. She began the year with an [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] part, as the daughter of an 18th-century [[Manhattan]] family, in her first Broadway play, ''Small War on Murray Hill,'' a [[Robert E. Sherwood]] comedy.<ref>The play's opening night at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] was on January 3, 1957, and 12 performances later, closing night was January 12. [[Leo Genn]] performed as [[General Howe]].</ref> That same year, Oliver replaced [[Mary Ure]] as the female lead in the Broadway production of [[John Osborne]]'s play ''[[Look Back in Anger]].''\n\nThe play's short run was immediately followed by larger roles in live TV plays on ''Kaiser Aluminum Hour,'' ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'', and ''Matinee Theater.'' Oliver then went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], where she appeared in the November 14, 1957, episode of ''[[Climax!

She eventually underwent hypnosis to overcome her fear of flying.<ref name=odyssey/>\n\nIn July 1964, [[Hal Fishman]] introduced her to personal flying when he took her on an evening flight over [[Los Angeles]] in a [[Cessna 172]].<ref name=odyssey>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Susan|title=Odyssey: A Daring Transatlantic Journey|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co.|year=1983|isbn=0-02-592920-8}}</ref> The experience motivated her to return the next day to the [[Santa Monica Airport]] to begin training for a private pilot certificate.

She earned the rating and even flew some charters (having by that time acquired a commercial pilot certificate in single- and multiengined land airplanes), but did not fly any record flights in their jets.<ref name=odyssey/>\n\nIn 1970, Oliver co-piloted a [[Piper PA-24 Comanche|Piper Comanche]] to victory in the 2760-mile transcontinental race known as the \"[[Powder Puff Derby (1947)|Powder Puff Derby]]\", which resulted in her being named Pilot of the Year. The pilot was Margaret Mead (not [[Margaret Mead|the famous anthropologist]]), an experienced pilot who had flown in several derbies with different co-pilots.

{"title_page": "German prisoners of war in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=May 2016}}Large numbers of German prisoners of war were held in Britain between the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 and late 1948.  Their numbers reached a peak of around 400,000 in 1946, and then began to fall when repatriation began.<ref>Wolff, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in britischer Hand \u2014 ein \u00dcberblick.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974)</ref>   The experiences of these prisoners differed in certain important respects from those of captured German servicemen held by other nations.  The treatment of the captives, though strict, was generally humane, and fewer prisoners died in British captivity than in other countries.  The British government also introduced a programme of re-education, which was intended to demonstrate to the POWs the evils of the Nazi regime, while promoting the advantages of democracy.  Some 25,000 German prisoners remained in the United Kingdom voluntarily after being released from prisoner of war status.<ref name=\"Hansard HC 22 April 1947\">Hansard (HC) 22 April 1947</ref><!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eden POW Camp, Malton, Yorkshire, England.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|View of the former Eden POW Camp, Malton, Yorkshire, United Kingdom]] -->\n[[File:Yorkshire 157.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|View of the former [[Eden Camp Museum|Eden POW Camp, Malton]], Yorkshire, United Kingdom]]\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Early phase of the war===\nInitially the only Germans captured by the British were naval personnel (mainly submariners) and members of the ''Luftwaffe'' (German air force).<ref name=\"Moore\">{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Bob|title=Glen Mill: The International History of a Local POW Camp during World War II|journal=Manchester Region History Review|date=1996|pages=42\u201348|issn=0707-5332}}</ref>  The first prisoners were the captain and crew of a submarine, [[German submarine U-39 (1938)|U-39]], on 14 September 1939, only days after the outbreak of war.  The commanding officer, Captain Gerhard Glattes, was to serve one of the longest terms as a POW in British hands: he was finally released in April 1947 after seven-and-a-half years in captivity.<ref>Busch, R. and R\u00f6ll, H-J.  German U-boat Commanders of World War II (USA: United States Naval Institute, 1999)</ref>  Luftwaffe personnel who were captured include [[Franz von Werra]], known as ''[[The One That Got Away (1957 film)|The One That Got Away]]'' from the book and subsequent film of that title.<ref>Burt, J. and Leasor, J.  The One That Got Away  (London, Mayflower, 1978)</ref>\n\nInitially two prisoner of war camps were established:\n* '''Camp No. 1, Grizedale Hall, Cumbria'''\nThis forty-room mansion was reserved for officers and became known as the 'U-boat Hotel'.  It had space for 200 prisoners of war, but in November 1939 it was occupied by only twenty-one men.<ref>Hansard (HC) 21 November 1939</ref>\n* '''Camp No. 2, Glen Mill, Oldham, Lancashire'''\nThis was a former cotton mill housing 2,000 'other ranks' (i.e. those with the rank of sergeant or lower).<ref name=\"Moore\" />\n\nDuring the early phase of the war, Britain adopted a policy of sending all enemy prisoners to Canada.  This measure was intended to preclude the possibility of POWs escaping and making their way back to Germany.  A further reason given was that food and other necessities were in short supply within the United Kingdom.  Consequently, men were generally shipped to Canada as soon as there were enough to fill a troop carrier.<ref name=\"Moore\" />  This meant that the total held within the UK seldom exceeded 2,000 men, whereas about 9,000 German prisoners were being held in Canada by late 1942.<ref>Held, R.  Kriegsgefangenschaft in Gro\u00dfbritannien (Oldenbourg, Munich, 2008) p. 79</ref>\n\n===Middle phase of the war===\nThe situation changed dramatically following the [[North African Campaign|Desert War]].  The United States had been at war with Germany since December 1941, and in late 1942 British and American forces began a joint campaign against German and Italian troops in North Africa. These Axis forces finally surrendered in May 1943, leaving the Allies with around 260,000 enemy prisoners of war on their hands.  About half of these POWs were German, half Italian.<ref name=\"Wolff, H 1974 p. 103\">Wolff, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in britischer Hand \u2014 ein \u00dcberblick.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974) p. 103</ref>  The United States and Britain had previously agreed that in any joint operations they would share prisoners on a 50-50 basis, regardless of which nation's army had actually captured the individual soldiers concerned.  (This meant, for example, that all POWs captured in the Desert War would be divided equally between Britain and the US, although the majority of prisoners in this particular campaign had been taken by the British).<ref>Jung, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in amerikanischer Hand \u2014 USA.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1972) pp. 11\u201312, 243</ref>   However, Britain's resources were already over-stretched, and its government asked the US to take some 130,000 prisoners in addition to its own 'share'.<ref name=\"Wolff, H 1974 p. 103\"/>  The American government agreed to this on condition that they would be able to use the POWs as a labour force within the United States, and subject to Britain's undertaking to foot the bill for shipping the men back to Europe when the time came.  It was agreed that these men would technically count as British prisoners, even though they were to be detained in American camps.\n\nBritain's own German prisoners from the Desert War were held in camps in the Middle East, with the exception of a few high-ranking officers who were sent to Britain for interrogation.  (Britain's Italian prisoners were also taken to the United Kingdom, where they were housed in a network of camps, and were used as a workforce, predominantly in agriculture.<ref>Hansard (HL) 3 December 1941</ref>)\n\n===Late phase of the war===\nAfter [[D-Day]]\u2014the invasion of Europe\u2014very large numbers of German military personnel were taken prisoner.  Immediately after the Allied landings, captured German troops were rounded up and taken to the invasion beaches, where a small fleet of LST ([[Landing Ships, Tank]]) had been detailed to transport them to England.<ref>The National Archives: WO 199/2432</ref>\n\nAs a rule, those whose surnames began with a letter in the first half of the alphabet were sent to the United States. This group was ferried to Portland, Dorset, and then onward to a reception camp at Devizes, Wiltshire. After a few days they were transferred via Liverpool to the United States.  But when ports such as Cherbourg subsequently came under Allied control, shipments of German prisoners could be transferred by troopships directly to the US. Those whose names began with a letter in the second half of the alphabet were transported to the United Kingdom, arriving at the cluster of ports comprising Portsmouth, Gosport and Southampton. The majority were then taken to a transit camp at Kempton Park Racecourse for interrogation, and onward to a network of several hundred camps around the country, many of which had earlier been built and occupied by Italian prisoners, who were due to be repatriated earlier than the Germans. For the first time, the number of German prisoners of war held in Britain reached a substantial total.\n\n===After VE-Day===\nThe practice of transferring prisoners either to Britain or to the US continued until the German surrender in May 1945, when still larger numbers of German troops became prisoners of the Allies.  (See [[German prisoners of war in northwest Europe]]).  The majority of these POWs were held in camps within Germany, and in former German-occupied territories, such as Belgium.<ref>Wolff, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in britischer Hand \u2014 ein \u00dcberblick.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974) pp. 70\u201375</ref>\n\nConditions in the British-run camps in Belgium were described as extremely harsh, and when the Financial Secretary to the War Office, [[Frederick Bellenger]], received reports on the situation he is stated to have been 'filled with horror'.<ref>Hansard (HC) 21 May 1946</ref>  The camps in Belgium were then closed down and all the prisoners were transferred to Britain by late July 1946.<ref>Hansard (HC) 30 July 1946</ref>\n\nIn early 1946, the United States chose to repatriate all of the POWs in its camps.<ref>Lewis, G. and Mewha, J.  History of Prisoner of War Utilization by the United States Army 1776\u20131945 (USA, Department of the Army, 1955)</ref>   The Germans were informed that they were being repatriated to Germany, where they would be set free.  However, some 130,000 of these men were \"British-owned\" prisoners, according to the \"50-50\" split referred to above.  Instead of being transported to Germany and released, they were delivered to Liverpool and were informed on arrival that they would have to remain in captivity in Britain for a further unspecified period.  These events caused considerable resentment among the Germans, as many of them had fought against and been captured by American forces, and had been unaware until then that they were technically prisoners of the British.\n\nThe episode seriously undermined Britain's attempts to promote democracy.  To quote British Member of Parliament Tom Driberg: 'It may be that the American officers who got them on to the boats on that pretext [that they were going straight to Germany] had no authority to give that undertaking.  It may be that they only said that in order to get them to go quietly, but nonetheless it was an undertaking that was given, and while that is in their minds we cannot possibly preach to them that democracy is a particularly fair or desirable system of government.'<ref>Hansard (HC) 24 March 1947</ref>\n\nDriberg's statement was echoed by one of the prisoners, who said: 'Under National Socialism I was told to believe all that I was told.  I was promised lots of things but the promises were never kept.  But in America I was promised that I was on my way back to Germany. That promise was also broken.  How do you now expect me to believe anything at all?'<ref>POWD report quoted in Faulk, H.  Group Captives (London, Chatto & Windus, 1977) p. 177</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of these additional prisoners, the total in Britain exceeded 400,000 in September 1946.\n\n===Numbers of German POWs in Britain, 1945\u20131946===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Month !!

Some prisoners, however, expressed the view that they should have been allowed to return home and rebuild their own country, instead of working in Britain.<ref>Hansard (HL) 11 July 1946</ref>  In practice, though, it is unlikely that accommodation for the men could have been provided, at least in the initial period following Germany's surrender.  It is also doubtful whether materials, transport and other resources required for the country's reconstruction could have been provided at that time;{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n* '''Britain's commitment to repatriate its Italian prisoners of war:''' Italy had switched sides, and the Italians were no longer regarded as the enemy.  It was not until all the Italians had been returned to their country that resources (including shipping) could be made available for the repatriation of the German POWs.\n\nOnce repatriation of the German prisoners had commenced, most of the men had been returned to Germany by the latter half of 1948.  Even at this late stage, Britain was still desperately short of agricultural workers while, at the same time, a significant number of the POWs were reluctant to return to Germany.  (Reasons for this included their original home now being within the Soviet sector; being in a relationship with a British woman; and adverse reactions to the atrocities committed by the Nazis).  Britain introduced a scheme under which men could be discharged from their prisoner status and could apply to stay on as civilian workers.  About 30,000 men asked to join the scheme and just under 25,000 were accepted.<ref name=\"Hansard HC 22 April 1947\"/>  One of the chosen applicants was former paratrooper [[Bert Trautmann|Bernhard ('Bert') Trautmann]], who went on to become a legendary footballer with Manchester City.  Some of the other men who stayed on under this initiative are still resident in Britain at the time of writing (2016).\n\n===Numbers of German POWs in Britain, 1946\u20131948===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An International Red Cross report states:  'In the USA and Great Britain, at the end of the war, there was practically no change: the living conditions of the prisoners of war remained similar to those in force during the war.'<ref>Wolff, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in britischer Hand \u2014 ein \u00dcberblick.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974) p. 31</ref>\n\n===Work===\nEven before the German surrender some of the POWs were put to work as agricultural labourers on a trial basis.<ref>J. Anthony Hellen: 'Temporary settlements and transient populations. The legacy of Britain': 1940\u20131948: ''[[Erdkunde]]'', vol. 53, 1999, p. 198</ref>  After VE-Day all prisoners were required to work (excluding officers who could not be forced to do so.  Some officers did, however, volunteer for certain tasks).  Most POWs were employed on farms, as Britain urgently needed a high level of food production, and there was a shortage of agricultural workers.  Some performed other duties, as shown by the following table, which reflects the situation in mid-1946.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type of employment !! Comments !! No. of POWs\n|-\n| Agriculture || Including camp staff associated with agriculture || 163,000\n|-\n| Preparation of Building Sites || || 22,000\n|-\n| \"Other useful work\" ||  || 94,000\n|-\n| Not employed || Inc. 11,000 sick and in detention || 46,000\n|-\n| \"Unemployable\" || Mainly officers and protected personnel (medical, etc.) || 13,000\n|-\n| || Total || 338,000\n|}\n\nAt first it was usual for groups of about 30 men to be escorted by armed guards to the fields where they were to work.  They were kept under close supervision at all times.  However, following the German surrender, the British government allowed some prisoners to be billeted on the farms where they were employed under minimal supervision.\n\nThe prisoners received pay of one shilling (5p) per day.  The position of the British government was that this was merely \"pocket money\", and that it was the responsibility of the Prisoners' own government (i.e. Germany) to make good the arrears when the men were finally repatriated.  In this matter, Britain neglected to consider that the German government no longer existed, and control of Germany rested in the hands of Britain itself, and with the other Allies.  (see [[Allied Commission]]).\n\nA controversial topic was the use of prisoners of war for the disposal of unexploded bombs, land-mines and munitions.  Dangerous activities of this kind were expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.  But, as mentioned above, Britain maintained that the Geneva Convention was not valid in the post-war period.  Britain also argued that the prisoners in question had volunteered for these duties. At least three German POWs are known to have died while carrying out these hazardous tasks.<ref>Faulk, H.  Group Captives (London, Chatto & Windus, 1977) pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nDuring the catastrophic snowstorms suffered by Britain in the winter of 1946\u201347, German POWs stood shoulder to shoulder with Allied troops in an effort to re-open essential road and rail links.<ref>The Times, 18 February 1947, p. 4</ref>  The importance of their labour at this critical time cannot be overstated.\n\n===Relations with the civilian population===\nSome citizens felt animosity towards the German prisoners, particularly during the war and just afterward.  As time passed, though, the mood changed.  It was reported that many people sympathised with the prisoners, who had no immediate prospect of being repatriated.  The practice of billeting POWs with farmers provided an opportunity for an atmosphere of trust and friendship to evolve.\n\nIn late 1946 civilians were allowed for the first time to invite prisoners to their homes for Christmas.  One German was so moved by the experience that he wrote to a local newspaper: 'In no way was I prepared for what was done for me during Christmas Day by the family.  I was like a dear part of it.  Where they were, I was too, what they had I had too, and where they went I went too.'<ref>The Times, 30 December 1947, p. 5</ref>\n\nRestrictions on the prisoners were, by late 1947, almost completely removed.  The men were allowed to leave the camp unescorted and walk around the surrounding district.  They could now mix with civilians; visit caf\u00e9s and cinemas; and attend church services.  Many met local women, though there was initially a ban on 'romantic liaisons': but once the ban was lifted, 796 marriages between German POWs and British women took place immediately.  Many more would follow.<ref>Hansard (HC) 8 July 1947</ref>  (See also The National Archives: RG 48/2009)\n\n===Re-education===\nPrisoners were encouraged to produce their own camp magazines, and a weekly German-language newspaper, ''Wochenpost'', was published by the British government specifically for the POWs.  Lectures by visiting speakers were arranged, and libraries, gramophone records, and film shows were provided.  All of these activities were intended to demonstrate the principles of freedom of speech and political and racial tolerance.

(Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974)</ref>   The experiences of these prisoners differed in certain important respects from those of captured German servicemen held by other nations.  The treatment of the captives, though strict, was generally humane, and fewer prisoners died in British captivity than in other countries.  The British government also introduced a programme of re-education, which was intended to demonstrate to the POWs the evils of the Nazi regime, while promoting the advantages of democracy.  Some 25,000 German prisoners remained in the United Kingdom voluntarily after being released from prisoner of war status.<ref name=\"Hansard HC 22 April 1947\">Hansard (HC) 22 April 1947</ref><!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eden POW Camp, Malton, Yorkshire, England.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|View of the former Eden POW Camp, Malton, Yorkshire, United Kingdom]] -->\n[[File:Yorkshire 157.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|View of the former [[Eden Camp Museum|Eden POW Camp, Malton]], Yorkshire, United Kingdom]]\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Early phase of the war===\nInitially the only Germans captured by the British were naval personnel (mainly submariners) and members of the ''Luftwaffe'' (German air force).<ref name=\"Moore\">{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Bob|title=Glen Mill: The International History of a Local POW Camp during World War II|journal=Manchester Region History Review|date=1996|pages=42\u201348|issn=0707-5332}}</ref>  The first prisoners were the captain and crew of a submarine, [[German submarine U-39 (1938)|U-39]], on 14 September 1939, only days after the outbreak of war.  The commanding officer, Captain Gerhard Glattes, was to serve one of the longest terms as a POW in British hands: he was finally released in April 1947 after seven-and-a-half years in captivity.<ref>Busch, R. and R\u00f6ll, H-J.  German U-boat Commanders of World War II (USA: United States Naval Institute, 1999)</ref>  Luftwaffe personnel who were captured include [[Franz von Werra]], known as ''[[The One That Got Away (1957 film)|The One That Got Away]]'' from the book and subsequent film of that title.<ref>Burt, J. and Leasor, J.  The One That Got Away  (London, Mayflower, 1978)</ref>\n\nInitially two prisoner of war camps were established:\n\n*'''Camp No. 1, Grizedale Hall, Cumbria'''\nThis forty-room mansion was reserved for officers and became known as the 'U-boat Hotel'.  It had space for 200 prisoners of war, but in November 1939 it was occupied by only twenty-one men.<ref>Hansard (HC) 21 November 1939</ref>\n\n*'''Camp No. 2, Glen Mill, Oldham, Lancashire'''\nThis was a former cotton mill housing 2,000 'other ranks' (i.e. those with the rank of sergeant or lower).<ref name=\"Moore\" />\n\nDuring the early phase of the war, Britain adopted a policy of sending all enemy prisoners to Canada.  This measure was intended to preclude the possibility of POWs escaping and making their way back to Germany.  A further reason given was that food and other necessities were in short supply within the United Kingdom.  Consequently, men were generally shipped to Canada as soon as there were enough to fill a troop carrier.<ref name=\"Moore\" />  This meant that the total held within the UK seldom exceeded 2,000 men, whereas about 9,000 German prisoners were being held in Canada by late 1942.<ref>Held, R.  Kriegsgefangenschaft in Gro\u00dfbritannien (Oldenbourg, Munich, 2008) p. 79</ref>\n\n===Middle phase of the war===\nThe situation changed dramatically following the [[North African Campaign|Desert War]].  The United States had been at war with Germany since December 1941, and in late 1942 British and American forces began a joint campaign against German and Italian troops in North Africa. These Axis forces finally surrendered in May 1943, leaving the Allies with around 260,000 enemy prisoners of war on their hands.  About half of these POWs were German, half Italian.<ref name=\"Wolff, H 1974 p. 103\">Wolff, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in britischer Hand \u2014 ein \u00dcberblick.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974) p. 103</ref>  The United States and Britain had previously agreed that in any joint operations they would share prisoners on a 50-50 basis, regardless of which nation's army had actually captured the individual soldiers concerned.  (This meant, for example, that all POWs captured in the Desert War would be divided equally between Britain and the US, although the majority of prisoners in this particular campaign had been taken by the British).<ref>Jung, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in amerikanischer Hand \u2014 USA.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1972) pp. 11\u201312, 243</ref>   However, Britain's resources were already over-stretched, and its government asked the US to take some 130,000 prisoners in addition to its own 'share'.<ref name=\"Wolff, H 1974 p. 103\"/>  The American government agreed to this on condition that they would be able to use the POWs as a labour force within the United States, and subject to Britain's undertaking to foot the bill for shipping the men back to Europe when the time came.  It was agreed that these men would technically count as British prisoners, even though they were to be detained in American camps.\n\nBritain's own German prisoners from the Desert War were held in camps in the Middle East, with the exception of a few high-ranking officers who were sent to Britain for interrogation.  (Britain's Italian prisoners were also taken to the United Kingdom, where they were housed in a network of camps, and were used as a workforce, predominantly in agriculture.<ref>Hansard (HL) 3 December 1941</ref>)\n\n===Late phase of the war===\nAfter [[D-Day]]\u2014the invasion of Europe\u2014very large numbers of German military personnel were taken prisoner.  Immediately after the Allied landings, captured German troops were rounded up and taken to the invasion beaches, where a small fleet of LST ([[Landing Ships, Tank]]) had been detailed to transport them to England.<ref>The National Archives: WO 199/2432</ref>\n\nAs a rule, those whose surnames began with a letter in the first half of the alphabet were sent to the United States. This group was ferried to Portland, Dorset, and then onward to a reception camp at Devizes, Wiltshire. After a few days they were transferred via Liverpool to the United States.  But when ports such as Cherbourg subsequently came under Allied control, shipments of German prisoners could be transferred by troopships directly to the US. Those whose names began with a letter in the second half of the alphabet were transported to the United Kingdom, arriving at the cluster of ports comprising Portsmouth, Gosport and Southampton. The majority were then taken to a transit camp at Kempton Park Racecourse for interrogation, and onward to a network of several hundred camps around the country, many of which had earlier been built and occupied by Italian prisoners, who were due to be repatriated earlier than the Germans. For the first time, the number of German prisoners of war held in Britain reached a substantial total.\n\n===After VE-Day===\nThe practice of transferring prisoners either to Britain or to the US continued until the German surrender in May 1945, when still larger numbers of German troops became prisoners of the Allies.  (See [[German prisoners of war in northwest Europe]]).  The majority of these POWs were held in camps within Germany, and in former German-occupied territories, such as Belgium.<ref>Wolff, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in britischer Hand \u2014 ein \u00dcberblick.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974) pp. 70\u201375</ref>\n\nConditions in the British-run camps in Belgium were described as extremely harsh, and when the Financial Secretary to the War Office, [[Frederick Bellenger]], received reports on the situation he is stated to have been 'filled with horror'.<ref>Hansard (HC) 21 May 1946</ref>  The camps in Belgium were then closed down and all the prisoners were transferred to Britain by late July 1946.<ref>Hansard (HC) 30 July 1946</ref>\n\nIn early 1946, the United States chose to repatriate all of the POWs in its camps.<ref>Lewis, G. and Mewha, J.  History of Prisoner of War Utilization by the United States Army 1776\u20131945 (USA, Department of the Army, 1955)</ref>   The Germans were informed that they were being repatriated to Germany, where they would be set free.  However, some 130,000 of these men were \"British-owned\" prisoners, according to the \"50-50\" split referred to above.  Instead of being transported to Germany and released, they were delivered to Liverpool and were informed on arrival that they would have to remain in captivity in Britain for a further unspecified period.  These events caused considerable resentment among the Germans, as many of them had fought against and been captured by American forces, and had been unaware until then that they were technically prisoners of the British.\n\nThe episode seriously undermined Britain's attempts to promote democracy.  To quote British Member of Parliament Tom Driberg: 'It may be that the American officers who got them on to the boats on that pretext [that they were going straight to Germany] had no authority to give that undertaking.  It may be that they only said that in order to get them to go quietly, but nonetheless it was an undertaking that was given, and while that is in their minds we cannot possibly preach to them that democracy is a particularly fair or desirable system of government.'<ref>Hansard (HC) 24 March 1947</ref>\n\nDriberg's statement was echoed by one of the prisoners, who said: 'Under National Socialism I was told to believe all that I was told.  I was promised lots of things but the promises were never kept.  But in America I was promised that I was on my way back to Germany. That promise was also broken.  How do you now expect me to believe anything at all?'<ref>POWD report quoted in Faulk, H.  Group Captives (London, Chatto & Windus, 1977) p. 177</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of these additional prisoners, the total in Britain exceeded 400,000 in September 1946.\n\n===Numbers of German POWs in Britain, 1945\u20131946===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some prisoners, however, expressed the view that they should have been allowed to return home and rebuild their own country, instead of working in Britain.<ref>Hansard (HL) 11 July 1946</ref>  In practice, though, it is unlikely that accommodation for the men could have been provided, at least in the initial period following Germany's surrender.  It is also doubtful whether materials, transport and other resources required for the country's reconstruction could have been provided at that time;{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n* '''Britain's commitment to repatriate its Italian prisoners of war:''' Italy had switched sides, and the Italians were no longer regarded as the enemy.  It was not until all the Italians had been returned to their country that resources (including shipping) could be made available for the repatriation of the German POWs.\n\nOnce repatriation of the German prisoners had commenced, most of the men had been returned to Germany by the latter half of 1948.  Even at this late stage, Britain was still desperately short of agricultural workers while, at the same time, a significant number of the POWs were reluctant to return to Germany.  (Reasons for this included their original home now being within the Soviet sector; being in a relationship with a British woman; and adverse reactions to the atrocities committed by the Nazis).  Britain introduced a scheme under which men could be discharged from their prisoner status and could apply to stay on as civilian workers.  About 30,000 men asked to join the scheme and just under 25,000 were accepted.<ref name=\"Hansard HC 22 April 1947\"/>  One of the chosen applicants was former paratrooper [[Bert Trautmann|Bernhard ('Bert') Trautmann]], who went on to become a legendary footballer with Manchester City.  Some of the other men who stayed on under this initiative are still resident in Britain at the time of writing (2016).\n\n===Numbers of German POWs in Britain, 1946\u20131948===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An International Red Cross report states:  'In the USA and Great Britain, at the end of the war, there was practically no change: the living conditions of the prisoners of war remained similar to those in force during the war.'<ref>Wolff, H. Die deutschen Kriegsgefangenen in britischer Hand \u2014 ein \u00dcberblick.  (Wissenschaftliche Kommission f\u00fcr deutsche Kriegsgefangenengeschichte, 1974) p. 31</ref>\n\n===Work===\nEven before the German surrender some of the POWs were put to work as agricultural labourers on a trial basis.<ref>J. Anthony Hellen: 'Temporary settlements and transient populations. The legacy of Britain': 1940\u20131948: ''[[Erdkunde]]'', vol. 53, 1999, p. 198</ref>  After VE-Day all prisoners were required to work (excluding officers who could not be forced to do so.  Some officers did, however, volunteer for certain tasks).  Most POWs were employed on farms, as Britain urgently needed a high level of food production, and there was a shortage of agricultural workers.  Some performed other duties, as shown by the following table, which reflects the situation in mid-1946.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type of employment !! Comments !!

They were kept under close supervision at all times.  However, following the German surrender, the British government allowed some prisoners to be billeted on the farms where they were employed under minimal supervision.\n\nThe prisoners received pay of one shilling (5p) per day.  The position of the British government was that this was merely \"pocket money\", and that it was the responsibility of the Prisoners' own government (i.e. Germany) to make good the arrears when the men were finally repatriated.  In this matter, Britain neglected to consider that the German government no longer existed, and control of Germany rested in the hands of Britain itself, and with the other Allies.  (see [[Allied Commission]]).\n\nA controversial topic was the use of prisoners of war for the disposal of unexploded bombs, land-mines and munitions.  Dangerous activities of this kind were expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.  But, as mentioned above, Britain maintained that the Geneva Convention was not valid in the post-war period.  Britain also argued that the prisoners in question had volunteered for these duties. At least three German POWs are known to have died while carrying out these hazardous tasks.<ref>Faulk, H.  Group Captives (London, Chatto & Windus, 1977) pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nDuring the catastrophic snowstorms suffered by Britain in the winter of 1946\u201347, German POWs stood shoulder to shoulder with Allied troops in an effort to re-open essential road and rail links.<ref>The Times, 18 February 1947, p. 4</ref>  The importance of their labour at this critical time cannot be overstated.\n\n===Relations with the civilian population===\nSome citizens felt animosity towards the German prisoners, particularly during the war and just afterward.  As time passed, though, the mood changed.  It was reported that many people sympathised with the prisoners, who had no immediate prospect of being repatriated.  The practice of billeting POWs with farmers provided an opportunity for an atmosphere of trust and friendship to evolve.\n\nIn late 1946 civilians were allowed for the first time to invite prisoners to their homes for Christmas.  One German was so moved by the experience that he wrote to a local newspaper: 'In no way was I prepared for what was done for me during Christmas Day by the family.  I was like a dear part of it.  Where they were, I was too, what they had I had too, and where they went I went too.'<ref>The Times, 30 December 1947, p. 5</ref>\n\nRestrictions on the prisoners were, by late 1947, almost completely removed.  The men were allowed to leave the camp unescorted and walk around the surrounding district.  They could now mix with civilians; visit caf\u00e9s and cinemas; and attend church services.  Many met local women, though there was initially a ban on 'romantic liaisons': but once the ban was lifted, 796 marriages between German POWs and British women took place immediately.  Many more would follow.<ref>Hansard (HC) 8 July 1947</ref>  (See also The National Archives: RG 48/2009)\n\n===Re-education===\nPrisoners were encouraged to produce their own camp magazines, and a weekly German-language newspaper, ''Wochenpost'', was published by the British government specifically for the POWs.  Lectures by visiting speakers were arranged, and libraries, gramophone records, and film shows were provided.  All of these activities were intended to demonstrate the principles of freedom of speech and political and racial tolerance.  POWs who were deemed to be suitable for more intensive instruction were invited to attend the college at [[Wilton Park]], which had been set up for their benefit, and which is still in existence.\n\nThe Scientific Commission for the History of German Prisoners of War (often referred to as the Maschke Commission, after its chairman, [[Erich Maschke]]) came to the following conclusion:  'Although as a whole many critics saw the re-education efforts made by the victorious powers as problematic and questionable, it is a fact that none of the powers made such a decisive effort as Great Britain \u2014 particularly in respect of the POWs \u2014 to assist Germany's return to a free and democratic European group of nations ... in this respect the prisoners held in Great Britain ... were way ahead of their compatriots in Germany.'  <ref>Wolff, H.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The first official execution for heresy was ordered by the King of the Franks at Orleans in 1022 at popular insistence. In 1076, Pope Gregory VI excommunicated the residents of the entire town of Cambrai because a mob had seized and burned a \u2018heretic\u2019 there. In 1034, \"the nobles of Milan insisted that the heretics from Montforte must be burned, against the (formal?) protest of the Archbishop.\"<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|108}} In 1114 the Bishop of Soissons imprisoned some heretics, left to go ask the advice of the holy synod on what to do with them, and while he was gone, the town\u2019s folk, fearing what they termed the \u201chabitual soft-heartedness of ecclesiastics\u201d (clericalem verens mollitiem), stormed the prison, took the accused outside of town, and burned them alive. Of the two most famous and best-known heretics of that time, Peter of Bruys was burned at the stake as a victim of popular fury, and Arnold of Brescia died under the henchman's axe as a victim of his political enemies who used \u2018heresy\u2019 as their excuse.

The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the individual inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century, and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. In his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n==Late Middle Ages (1200 ~ 1400)==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The first official execution for heresy was ordered by the King of the Franks at Orleans in 1022 at popular insistence. In 1076, Pope Gregory VI excommunicated the residents of the entire town of Cambrai because a mob had seized and burned a \u2018heretic\u2019 there. In 1034, \"the nobles of Milan insisted that the heretics from Montforte must be burned, against the (formal?) protest of the Archbishop.\"<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|108}} In 1114 the Bishop of Soissons imprisoned some heretics, left to go ask the advice of the holy synod on what to do with them, and while he was gone, the town\u2019s folk, fearing what they termed the \u201chabitual soft-heartedness of ecclesiastics\u201d (clericalem verens mollitiem), stormed the prison, took the accused outside of town, and burned them alive. Of the two most famous and best-known heretics of that time, Peter of Bruys was burned at the stake as a victim of popular fury, and Arnold of Brescia died under the henchman's axe as a victim of his political enemies who used \u2018heresy\u2019 as their excuse.

The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the individual inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century, and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. In his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n==Late Middle Ages (1200 ~ 1400)==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
