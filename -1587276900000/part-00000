Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]].

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Anthony Frederick Sandys - Queen Eleanor.JPG|[[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n=== Major companies ===\n\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n[[File:Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac.jpg|250px|thumb|Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac]]\n*[[Arena (swimwear)|Arena]]\n*[[Groupe Bernard]]\n*[[Groupe Castel]]\n*[[Cdiscount]]\n*[[Dassault Group|Dassault]]\n*[[Jock (company)|Jock]]\n*[[Marie Brizard et Roger International|Marie Brizard]]\n*[[McKesson Corporation]]\n*[[Oxbow (surfwear)|Oxbow]]\n*[[Pernod Ricard|Ricard]]\n*[[Sanofi-Aventis|Sanofi Aventis]]\n*[[Smurfit Kappa]]\n*[[Snecma|SNECMA]]\n*[[Solectron]]\n*[[Thales Group]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Population ==\n\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Anthony Frederick Sandys - Queen Eleanor.JPG|[[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

There were stops at ''Foxes Bridge'', ''Knockane'', ''Firmount'' and ''Donoughmore''. [[Donoughmore railway station]] opened in 1893 but closed in 1934. It was situated at the bottom of New Tipperary.\n\nThere are two [[Regional road (Ireland)|Regional roads]] in Donoughmore, the [[R619 road (Ireland)|R619]] and the [[R579 road (Ireland)|R579]]. During the 18th century and 19th century [[History of roads in Ireland|specialist roads]] were built for various reasons. Cork city had a thriving butter market at the time and roads where built to places in Kerry to better facilitate this trade. One of these, locally called the 'Old Kerry Road'<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.millstreet.ie/blog/history/kerrymans-table |title = The Kerrymans Table / The Old Kerry Butter Road|date = 2009-08-21}}</ref> was one such 'Butter Road'.

These churches are in the Catholic Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne|Cloyne]].\n\nA [[Church of Ireland]] church existed in the parish until the 1960s, when it was de-consecrated. The building was a garage until recently, and a plaque in the garage commemorated this fact. Although the Church of Ireland church is now gone, the title of [[Prebendary]] of Donoughmore still exists. The current prebendary is Rev'd Ian Jonas, the priest in Carrigrohane church.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cork.anglican.org/our-people/clergy/the-revd-canon-ian-jonas/ |title = Ian Jonas}}</ref>\n\nAt Donoughmore Cross there is also the ruins of a very old church.

As a result, he requested a transfer of land to Grenagh from Inniscarra and Donoughmore. Whilst he was allowed to take the land surrounding present day courtbrack from Inniscarra he was denied his request for the Donoughmore townlands of Ballycraheen and part of Garraun South.<ref>{{cite book|last=Duggan|first=John J|title=Grenagh and Courtbrack: History of a rural parish|year=2009}} p54</ref>\n\n==History==\n*There are a number of standing stones and ring forts in the Donoughmore area.

A [[Peerage of Ireland|peerage]] system was established in Ireland to help with the administration of English rule. One of these titles, the [[Earl of Donoughmore]], takes its name from the parish. The story is that Francis Hely of neighbouring Kilshannig conformed to the [[Church Of Ireland|established religion]], and after doing so he was able to marry a Protestant woman named Prudence Earbery, the daughter of Mathias Earbery, a leaseowner in Donoughmore. Their son [[John Hely-Hutchinson (statesman)|John Hely]] married a woman by the name of [[Christiana Hely-Hutchinson, 1st Baroness Donoughmore|Christina Nixon]], who was an heiress to her grand-uncle Richard Hutchinson. After marriage he took the name of John Hely-Hutchinson. He became a politician and provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Using his position he got his wife a peerage, and she took the name of his homeland as her title even though she did not live there but in Knocklofty, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]]. She became [[Baroness]] Donoughmore of Knocklofty and her son [[Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 1st Earl of Donoughmore|Richard Hely-Hutchinson]] became the first [[Baron]] Donoughmore and later, after supporting the [[Act of Union 1800|Act Of Union]], he became the Earl.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hely-Hutchinson, John |volume=13 |page=255 |first=Ronald John |last=McNeill |authorlink=Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun}}</ref><ref>Diarmuid O Murchadha \"Family Names of County Cork\" The Collins Press, Cork 1996 p174</ref> The current Earl lives in [[Brampton (disambiguation)|Brampton]], England.\n* Three passengers on the ''[[Titanic]]'' were from Donoughmore.

The major had been captured in the hope of exchanging him for IRA prisoners. When the IRA prisoners were executed instead of being released, the decision was made to execute the major. The manner in which he accepted his faith holding no ill will to his captors and including writing a letter to his wife with the opening words 'My own darling little wife, I'm to be shot in an hour' left a mark on many, including [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], who went to great lengths to retrieve the location of his body.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://historicgraves.com/story/major-geoffrey-lee-compton-smith |title = Major Geoffrey Lee Compton Smith &#124; Historic Graves}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/humaninterest/war-of-independence-disappeared-recalled-225827.html | title=War of Independence 'disappeared' recalled| date=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n*During the [[Irish Civil War]], the Donoughmore Battalion fought for the anti-treaty side.

Scoil I\u00f3saif and St. Lachteen's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lachteen.ie|title=St Lachteens National School Donoughmore|date=|publisher=Lachteen.ie|accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>  There used to be more schools within the parish, including Rathcoola School.\n\n==Transportation==\nDonoughmore was formerly linked with Cork City by the narrow gauge [[Cork and Muskerry Light Railway]]. There were stops at ''Foxes Bridge'', ''Knockane'', ''Firmount'' and ''Donoughmore''. [[Donoughmore railway station]] opened in 1893 but closed in 1934. It was situated at the bottom of New Tipperary.\n\nThere are two [[Regional road (Ireland)|Regional roads]] in Donoughmore, the [[R619 road (Ireland)|R619]] and the [[R579 road (Ireland)|R579]]. During the 18th century and 19th century [[History of roads in Ireland|specialist roads]] were built for various reasons. Cork city had a thriving butter market at the time and roads where built to places in Kerry to better facilitate this trade. One of these, locally called the 'Old Kerry Road'<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.millstreet.ie/blog/history/kerrymans-table |title = The Kerrymans Table / The Old Kerry Butter Road|date = 2009-08-21}}</ref> was one such 'Butter Road'. It consists of the largest section of continually straight road within the parish.\n\n==Religion==\nDonoughmore civil parish is coterminous with the [[Roman Catholic]] parish which has two functioning churches: St. Josephs and St. Lachteen's. These churches are in the Catholic Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne|Cloyne]].\n\nA [[Church of Ireland]] church existed in the parish until the 1960s, when it was de-consecrated. The building was a garage until recently, and a plaque in the garage commemorated this fact. Although the Church of Ireland church is now gone, the title of [[Prebendary]] of Donoughmore still exists. The current prebendary is Rev'd Ian Jonas, the priest in Carrigrohane church.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cork.anglican.org/our-people/clergy/the-revd-canon-ian-jonas/ |title = Ian Jonas}}</ref>\n\nAt Donoughmore Cross there is also the ruins of a very old church.

As a result, he requested a transfer of land to Grenagh from Inniscarra and Donoughmore. Whilst he was allowed to take the land surrounding present day courtbrack from Inniscarra he was denied his request for the Donoughmore townlands of Ballycraheen and part of Garraun South.<ref>{{cite book|last=Duggan|first=John J|title=Grenagh and Courtbrack: History of a rural parish|year=2009}} p54</ref>\n\n==History==\n*There are a number of standing stones and ring forts in the Donoughmore area.

A [[Peerage of Ireland|peerage]] system was established in Ireland to help with the administration of English rule. One of these titles, the [[Earl of Donoughmore]], takes its name from the parish. The story is that Francis Hely of neighbouring Kilshannig conformed to the [[Church Of Ireland|established religion]], and after doing so he was able to marry a Protestant woman named Prudence Earbery, the daughter of Mathias Earbery, a leaseowner in Donoughmore. Their son [[John Hely-Hutchinson (statesman)|John Hely]] married a woman by the name of [[Christiana Hely-Hutchinson, 1st Baroness Donoughmore|Christina Nixon]], who was an heiress to her grand-uncle Richard Hutchinson. After marriage he took the name of John Hely-Hutchinson. He became a politician and provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Using his position he got his wife a peerage, and she took the name of his homeland as her title even though she did not live there but in Knocklofty, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]]. She became [[Baroness]] Donoughmore of Knocklofty and her son [[Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 1st Earl of Donoughmore|Richard Hely-Hutchinson]] became the first [[Baron]] Donoughmore and later, after supporting the [[Act of Union 1800|Act Of Union]], he became the Earl.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hely-Hutchinson, John |volume=13 |page=255 |first=Ronald John |last=McNeill |authorlink=Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun}}</ref><ref>Diarmuid O Murchadha \"Family Names of County Cork\" The Collins Press, Cork 1996 p174</ref> The current Earl lives in [[Brampton (disambiguation)|Brampton]], England.\n* Three passengers on the ''[[Titanic]]'' were from Donoughmore.

The major had been captured in the hope of exchanging him for IRA prisoners. When the IRA prisoners were executed instead of being released, the decision was made to execute the major.

The ''Einsatzgruppen'' were involved in the murder of much of the [[intelligentsia]], including members of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|priesthood]]{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=4}} and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"[[Final Solution]] to the [[Jewish Question]]\" (''Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage'') in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet [[political commissar]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Romani people]] as well as actual or alleged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nUnder the direction of ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and the supervision of SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' operated in territories occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' worked hand-in-hand with the [[Order Police battalions]] on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the [[Rumbula massacre]] (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], the Wehrmacht cooperated with the ''Einsatzgruppen'', providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. Historian [[Raul Hilberg]] estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'', related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] in 1947\u201348, charged with [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]]. Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.\n\n== Formation and Aktion T4 ==\nThe ''Einsatzgruppen'' were formed under the direction of SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and operated by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) before and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Edeiken|2000}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' had their origins in the ad hoc ''Einsatzkommando'' formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in [[Austria]] in March 1938.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}} Originally part of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police; SiPo), two units of ''Einsatzgruppen'' were stationed in the [[Sudetenland]] in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary due to the [[Munich Agreement]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=405, 412}} From September 1939, the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) had overall command of the ''Einsatzgruppen''.{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial, Vol. 20, Day 194}}\n\nAs part of the drive by the Nazi regime to remove so-called \"undesirable\" elements from the German population, from September to December 1939 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and others took part in [[Action T4]], a program of systematic murder of persons with physical and mental disabilities and patients of psychiatric hospitals. Aktion T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941, but the killings continued until the end of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and others, but [[gas chamber]]s were put into use by spring 1940.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\n== Invasion of Poland ==\n{{main|Intelligenzaktion|Operation Tannenberg}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1968-034-19A, Exekution von polnischen Geiseln.jpg|thumb|Execution of Poles in [[K\u00f3rnik]], 20 October 1939]]\n[[File:Palmiry ostatnia droga.jpeg|thumb|Polish women led to mass execution in a forest near [[Palmiry massacre|Palmiry]]]]\nIn response to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s plan to [[invasion of Poland|invade Poland]] on 1 September 1939, Heydrich re-formed the ''Einsatzgruppen'' to travel in the wake of the German armies.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=425}} Membership at this point was drawn from the SS, the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (Security Service; SD), the police, and the [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=11}} Heydrich placed SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Werner Best]] in command, who assigned {{ill|Hans-Joachim Tesmer|de}} to choose personnel for the task forces and their subgroups, called ''[[Einsatzkommando]]s'', from among educated people with military experience and a strong ideological commitment to Nazism.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|pp=11, 20}} Some had previously been members of paramilitary groups such as the ''[[Freikorps]]''.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=17}} Heydrich instructed Wagner in meetings in late July that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' should undertake their operations in cooperation with the ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Order Police; Orpo) and military commanders in the area.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=14}} Army intelligence was in constant contact with ''Einsatzgruppen'' to coordinate their activities with other units.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=17}}\n\nInitially numbering 2,700 men (and ultimately 4,250 in Poland),{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=12}} the ''Einsatzgruppen''{{'}}s mission was to kill members of the Polish leadership most clearly identified with Polish national identity: the intelligentsia, [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|members of the clergy]], teachers, and members of the nobility.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Browning|Matth\u00e4us|2004|pp=16\u201318}} As stated by Hitler: \"...&nbsp;there must be no Polish leaders; where Polish leaders exist they must be killed, however harsh that sounds\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=143}} SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' [[Lothar Beutel]], commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' IV, later testified that Heydrich gave the order for these killings at a series of meetings in mid-August.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=15}} The ''[[Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen]]'' \u2014 lists of people to be killed \u2014 had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939, using dossiers collected by the SD from 1936 forward.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=16}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' performed these murders with the support of the ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'', a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=144\u2013145}} Members of the SS, the [[Wehrmacht]], and the ''Ordnungspolizei'' also shot civilians during the Polish campaign.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=429}} Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939.

However, Hitler had decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' when it was tactically possible to do so.

As they walked, some SS men went up and down the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=208\u2013210}}\n\nWhen the columns neared the prepared execution site, the victims were driven some {{convert|270|m|yd}} from the road into the forest, where any possessions that had not yet been abandoned were seized. Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln's bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way. About a thousand were killed on the streets of the city or on the way to the site, bringing the total deaths for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=210\u2013214}}\n\n== Second sweep ==\n''Einsatzgruppe B, C'', and ''D'' did not immediately follow ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The ''Einsatzgruppe'' commanders, with the exception of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} An ''Einsatzgruppe'' report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=549}} Thus, an interval passed between the first round of ''Einsatzgruppen'' massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|pp=342\u2013343}} During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=64}}\n\n''Einsatzgruppe'' A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area, so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist ''Einsatzgruppe'' B. In [[Dnepropetrovsk]] in February 1942, ''Einsatzgruppe'' D reduced the city's Jewish population from 30,000 to 702 over the course of four days.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=372}} The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings. Haberer wrote that, as in the Baltic states, the Germans could not have killed so many Jews so quickly without local help. He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus. In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20. This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were killed by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=78}}\n\nThe second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=353\u2013354}}\n\n== Transition to gassing ==\n{{see also|Final Solution}}\n\n[[File:Chelmno Gas Van.jpg|thumb|[[Magirus-Deutz]] van found near [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp]] is the same type as those used as [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s. ]]\nAfter a time, Himmler found that the killing methods used by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=197}} Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems, and many turned to drink.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=52, 124, 168}} As much as possible, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=199\u2014200}} Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=163}} A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' D, SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Ohlendorf]], particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nDuring a visit to [[Minsk]] in August 1941, Himmler witnessed an ''Einsatzgruppen'' mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=547\u2013548}} By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}} He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=551}} Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main ''Einsatzgruppen'' from 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=548}} However, the gas vans were not popular with the ''Einsatzkommandos'', because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=243}} Some of the early mass killings at [[extermination camp]]s used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at [[Auschwitz]] using [[Zyklon B]], a cyanide-based pesticide gas.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\nPlans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe\u2014eleven million people\u2014were formalised at the [[Wannsee Conference]], held on 20 January 1942. Some would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]], and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the [[Final Solution]] of the [[Jewish question]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage}}).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=555\u2013556}} Permanent killing centres at Auschwitz, [[Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], [[Treblinka]], and other Nazi extermination camps replaced mobile death squads as the primary method of mass killing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=279\u2013280}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' remained active, however, and were put to work fighting partisans, particularly in Belarus.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=248}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Stalingrad|fall of Stalingrad]] in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of a special task force, [[Sonderaktion 1005|''Sonderkommando'' 1005]], under SS-''Standartenf\u00fchrer'' [[Paul Blobel]]. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves all along the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern Front]] to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=258\u2013260, 262}}\n\nBy 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the ''Einsatzgruppen'' retreated alongside the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most ''Einsatzgruppen'' personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}\n\n== Plans for the Middle East and Britain ==\n[[Einsatzgruppe Egypt|''Einsatzgruppe'' Egypt]], led by [[Walter Rauff]], was raised in 1942 and standing by in [[Athens]], prepared to enter Egypt and Palestine once German forces arrived there.\n\nAccording to historians [[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]] and {{ill|Martin C\u00fcppers|de|}}, based on archival research, the units purpose was to carry out a mass killing of the [[Jew]]ish population in [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate of Palestine]] and [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], similar to the way the [[Einsatzgruppe]]n operated in [[eastern Europe]]. Despite the word \"Palestine\" never being mentioned in the archival documents, the researchers state that the unit's objective was to go there in order to enact systematic mass murder of Jews.<ref>[[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]], [[Martin C\u00fcppers]]: \u201eBeseitigung der j\u00fcdisch-nationalen Heimst\u00e4tte in Pal\u00e4stina.\u201c Das Einsatzkommando bei der Panzerarmee Afrika 1942.

But since Rommel was 500&nbsp;km away at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], it is unlikely that the two were able to meet.{{sfn|Mallmann|C\u00fcppers|Smith|2010}}{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=357}} Former Iraqi prime minister [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] and the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] played roles, engaging in antisemitic radio propaganda, preparing to recruit volunteers, and in raising an [[Free Arabian Legion|Arab-German Battalion]] that would also follow ''Einsatzgruppe'' Egypt to the Middle East.{{sfn|Mallmann|C\u00fcppers|Smith|2010|pp=127\u2013130}}\n\nHowever, according to historian Haim Saadon, Director of the Center of Research on North African Jewry in WWII, there was no extermination plan: Rauff's documents show that his foremost concern being the assisting the Wehrmacht, and he came up with idea of forced labour camps in the process.

On 6 July 1941 ''Einsatzkommando'' 4b of ''Einsatzgruppe'' C reported that \"Armed forces surprisingly welcome hostility against the Jews\".{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=301}} Few complaints about the killings were ever raised by Wehrmacht officers.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=131}} On 8 September, ''Einsatzgruppe'' D reported that relations with the German Army were \"excellent\".{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=301}} In the same month, Stahlecker of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A wrote that Army Group North had been exemplary in co-operating with the exterminations and that relations with the [[4th Panzer Army]], commanded by General [[Erich Hoepner]], were \"very close, almost cordial\".{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=301}} In the south, the Romanian Army worked closely with ''Einsatzgruppe'' D to massacre Ukrainian Jews,{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=64}} killing around 26,000 Jews in the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]].{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=79}} The German historian [[Peter Longerich]] thinks it probable that the Wehrmacht, along with the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN), incited the [[Lviv pogroms]], during which 8,500 to 9,000 Jews were killed by the native population and ''Einsatzgruppe'' C in July 1941.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=194}} Moreover, most people on the home front in Germany had some idea of the massacres being committed by the ''Einsatzgruppen''.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=88}} British historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] noted that although Himmler had forbidden photographs of the killings, it was common for both the men of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and for bystanders to take pictures to send to their loved ones, which he felt suggested widespread approval of the massacres.{{sfn|Klee|Dressen|Riess|1991|p=xi}}\n\nOfficers in the field were well aware of the killing operations being conducted by the ''Einsatzgruppen''.{{sfn|Wette|2007|pp=200\u2013201}} The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the ''Einsatzgruppen'' massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote that this was just an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.{{sfn|Hillgruber|1989|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n== Einsatzgruppen Trial ==\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]] in 1947\u201348, part of the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]] held under United States military authority. The men were charged with [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and membership in the SS (which had been declared a criminal organization). Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were among the judgments; only four executions were carried out, on 7 June 1951; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=274\u2013275}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J08517, Otto Ohlendorf.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto Ohlendorf]], 1943]]\n\nSeveral ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders, including Ohlendorf, claimed at the trial to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=187}} To date no evidence has been found that such an order was ever issued.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=187\u2013189}} German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders as ''accomplices'' to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as ''perpetrators'' of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=439}}\n\nStreim postulated that the existence of an early comprehensive order was a fabrication created for use in Ohlendorf's defence. This theory is now widely accepted by historians.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=188}} Longerich notes that most orders received by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders\u2014especially when they were being ordered to carry out criminal activities\u2014were vague, and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \"severe\" and \"firm\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=189\u2013190}} British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] argues that Hitler's apocalyptic remarks before Barbarossa about the necessity for a war without mercy to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" were interpreted by ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders as permission and encouragement to engage in extreme antisemitic violence, with each ''Einsatzgruppen'' commander to use his own discretion about how far he was prepared to go.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nMost of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former ''Einsatzgruppe'' members with war crimes.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=275\u2013276}} And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.{{sfn|Segev|2010|pp=226, 250, 376}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Functionalism versus intentionalism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Myth of the clean Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Porajmos]]\n* [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | last = Browning | first = Christopher R. | title = Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland | publisher = Penguin | location = London; New York | orig-year = 1992 | year = 1998 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Browning | first1 = Christopher | author-link = Christopher Browning | last2 = Matth\u00e4us | first2 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink2 = J\u00fcrgen Matth\u00e4us | title = The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 \u2013 March 1942 | series = Comprehensive History of the Holocaust | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | location = Lincoln | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8032-1327-2 | ref = harv | url = https://archive.org/details/originsoffinalso00brow }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Caron | first1 = Jean-Christophe | title = Erwin Rommel: Auf der Jagd nach dem Schatz des \"W\u00fcstenfuchses\" | page = 2 | journal = Spiegel Online | date = 22 December 2007 | language = German | url = http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/erwin-rommel-auf-der-jagd-nach-dem-schatz-des-wuestenfuchses-a-522484-2.html | accessdate = 9 September 2016 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Conze | first1 = Eckart | last2 = Frei | first2 = Norbert | last3 = Hayes | first3 = Peter | last4 = Zimmermann | first4 = Moshe | title = Das Amt und die Vergangenheit : deutsche Diplomaten im Dritten Reich und in der Bundesrepublik | year = 2010 | publisher = Karl Blessing | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 978-3-89667-430-2 | ref = {{sfnRef|Conze, Frei et al.|2010}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Craig | first = William | authorlink = William Craig (author) | title = Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad | year = 1973 | publisher = Konecky & Konecky | location = Old Saybrook, CT | isbn = 978-1-56852-368-2 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Crowe | first = David | title = Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of his Life, Wartime Activities and the True Story Behind the List | year = 2007 | origyear = 2004 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-465-00253-5 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Dams | first1 = Carsten | last2 = Stolle | first2 = Michael | title = Die Gestapo: Herrschaft und Terror im Dritten Reich | series = Becksche Reihe | year = 2012 | origyear = 2008 | language = German | publisher = Beck | location = Munich | isbn = 978-3-406-62898-6 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Edeiken | first = Yale F. | publisher = Holocaust History Project | title = Introduction to the Einsatzgruppen | date = 22 August 2000 | url = http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | accessdate= 10 June 2018 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007085553/http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | archive-date = 7 October 2015}}\n* {{cite book | title = Trials of War Criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10 | location = N\u00fcrnberg | date = October 1946 \u2013 April 1949 | volume =Volume 4 | series = Green Series | chapter = Einsatzgruppen case | chapter-url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-IV.pdf | url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NTs_war-criminals.html | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 June 2018 | ref = {{sfnRef|Einsatzgruppen judgment}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

The ''Einsatzgruppen'' were involved in the murder of much of the [[intelligentsia]], including members of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|priesthood]]{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=4}} and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"[[Final Solution]] to the [[Jewish Question]]\" (''Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage'') in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet [[political commissar]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Romani people]] as well as actual or alleged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nUnder the direction of ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and the supervision of SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' operated in territories occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' worked hand-in-hand with the [[Order Police battalions]] on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the [[Rumbula massacre]] (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], the Wehrmacht cooperated with the ''Einsatzgruppen'', providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. Historian [[Raul Hilberg]] estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'', related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] in 1947\u201348, charged with [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]]. Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.\n\n== Formation and Aktion T4 ==\nThe ''Einsatzgruppen'' were formed under the direction of SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and operated by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) before and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Edeiken|2000}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' had their origins in the ad hoc ''Einsatzkommando'' formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in [[Austria]] in March 1938.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}} Originally part of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police; SiPo), two units of ''Einsatzgruppen'' were stationed in the [[Sudetenland]] in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary due to the [[Munich Agreement]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents.

Aktion T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941, but the killings continued until the end of the war.

The Germans relied increasingly on the ''Ar\u0101js Kommando'' and similar groups to perform massacres of Jews.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=70}}\n\nSuch extensive and enthusiastic collaboration with the ''Einsatzgruppen'' has been attributed to several factors. Since the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Kresy|''Kresy Wschodnie'']] and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=73}} The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n[[File:Liepaja December 1941 massacres 01.jpeg|thumb|[[Liep\u0101ja massacres]] in Latvia, December 1941]]\nHistorian Erich Haberer notes that many survived and made sense of the \"totalitarian atomization\" of society by seeking conformity with communism.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=76}} As a result, by the time of the German invasion in 1941, many had come to see conformity with a totalitarian regime as socially acceptable behaviour; thus, people simply transferred their allegiance to the German regime when it arrived.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=76}} Some who had collaborated with the Soviet regime sought to divert attention from themselves by naming Jews as collaborators and killing them.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Einsatzgruppen SD issued and used dog-tag.jpg|thumb|Dog tag issued by Einsatzgruppen SD]]\n\n=== Rumbula ===\n{{main|Rumbula massacre}}\n\nIn November 1941 Himmler was dissatisfied with the pace of the exterminations in Latvia, as he intended to move Jews from Germany into the area. He assigned SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' Jeckeln, one of the perpetrators of the Babi Yar massacre, to liquidate the [[Riga ghetto]]. Jeckeln selected a site about {{convert|10|km}} southeast of Riga near the Rumbula railway station, and had 300 Russian prisoners of war prepare the site by digging pits in which to bury the victims. Jeckeln organised around 1,700 men, including 300 members of the ''Arajs Kommando'', 50 German SD men, and 50 Latvian guards, most of whom had already participated in mass killings of civilians. These troops were supplemented by Latvians, including members of the Riga city police, battalion police, and ghetto guards. Around 1,500 able-bodied Jews would be spared execution so their slave labour could be exploited; a thousand men were relocated to a fenced-off area within the ghetto and 500 women were temporarily housed in a prison and later moved to a separate nearby ghetto, where they were put to work mending uniforms.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=206\u2013209}}\n\nAlthough Rumbula was on the rail line, Jeckeln decided that the victims should travel on foot from Riga to the execution ground. Trucks and buses were arranged to carry children and the elderly. The victims were told that they were being relocated, and were advised to bring up to {{convert|20|kg}} of possessions. The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00&nbsp;am. The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground. As they walked, some SS men went up and down the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=208\u2013210}}\n\nWhen the columns neared the prepared execution site, the victims were driven some {{convert|270|m|yd}} from the road into the forest, where any possessions that had not yet been abandoned were seized. Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln's bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way. About a thousand were killed on the streets of the city or on the way to the site, bringing the total deaths for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=210\u2013214}}\n\n== Second sweep ==\n''Einsatzgruppe B, C'', and ''D'' did not immediately follow ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The ''Einsatzgruppe'' commanders, with the exception of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} An ''Einsatzgruppe'' report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=549}} Thus, an interval passed between the first round of ''Einsatzgruppen'' massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|pp=342\u2013343}} During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=64}}\n\n''Einsatzgruppe'' A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area, so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist ''Einsatzgruppe'' B. In [[Dnepropetrovsk]] in February 1942, ''Einsatzgruppe'' D reduced the city's Jewish population from 30,000 to 702 over the course of four days.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=372}} The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings. Haberer wrote that, as in the Baltic states, the Germans could not have killed so many Jews so quickly without local help. He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus. In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20. This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were killed by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=78}}\n\nThe second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=353\u2013354}}\n\n== Transition to gassing ==\n{{see also|Final Solution}}\n\n[[File:Chelmno Gas Van.jpg|thumb|[[Magirus-Deutz]] van found near [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp]] is the same type as those used as [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s. ]]\nAfter a time, Himmler found that the killing methods used by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=197}} Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems, and many turned to drink.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=52, 124, 168}} As much as possible, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=199\u2014200}} Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=163}} A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' D, SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Ohlendorf]], particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nDuring a visit to [[Minsk]] in August 1941, Himmler witnessed an ''Einsatzgruppen'' mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=547\u2013548}} By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}} He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=551}} Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main ''Einsatzgruppen'' from 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=548}} However, the gas vans were not popular with the ''Einsatzkommandos'', because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=243}} Some of the early mass killings at [[extermination camp]]s used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at [[Auschwitz]] using [[Zyklon B]], a cyanide-based pesticide gas.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\nPlans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe\u2014eleven million people\u2014were formalised at the [[Wannsee Conference]], held on 20 January 1942. Some would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]], and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the [[Final Solution]] of the [[Jewish question]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage}}).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=555\u2013556}} Permanent killing centres at Auschwitz, [[Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], [[Treblinka]], and other Nazi extermination camps replaced mobile death squads as the primary method of mass killing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=279\u2013280}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' remained active, however, and were put to work fighting partisans, particularly in Belarus.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=248}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Stalingrad|fall of Stalingrad]] in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of a special task force, [[Sonderaktion 1005|''Sonderkommando'' 1005]], under SS-''Standartenf\u00fchrer'' [[Paul Blobel]]. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves all along the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern Front]] to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=258\u2013260, 262}}\n\nBy 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the ''Einsatzgruppen'' retreated alongside the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most ''Einsatzgruppen'' personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}\n\n== Plans for the Middle East and Britain ==\n[[Einsatzgruppe Egypt|''Einsatzgruppe'' Egypt]], led by [[Walter Rauff]], was raised in 1942 and standing by in [[Athens]], prepared to enter Egypt and Palestine once German forces arrived there.\n\nAccording to historians [[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]] and {{ill|Martin C\u00fcppers|de|}}, based on archival research, the units purpose was to carry out a mass killing of the [[Jew]]ish population in [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate of Palestine]] and [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], similar to the way the [[Einsatzgruppe]]n operated in [[eastern Europe]].

He states that those German generals who claimed that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.{{sfn|Hillgruber|1989|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n== Einsatzgruppen Trial ==\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]] in 1947\u201348, part of the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]] held under United States military authority. The men were charged with [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and membership in the SS (which had been declared a criminal organization). Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were among the judgments; only four executions were carried out, on 7 June 1951; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=274\u2013275}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J08517, Otto Ohlendorf.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto Ohlendorf]], 1943]]\n\nSeveral ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders, including Ohlendorf, claimed at the trial to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=187}} To date no evidence has been found that such an order was ever issued.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=187\u2013189}} German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders as ''accomplices'' to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as ''perpetrators'' of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=439}}\n\nStreim postulated that the existence of an early comprehensive order was a fabrication created for use in Ohlendorf's defence. This theory is now widely accepted by historians.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=188}} Longerich notes that most orders received by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders\u2014especially when they were being ordered to carry out criminal activities\u2014were vague, and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \"severe\" and \"firm\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=189\u2013190}} British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] argues that Hitler's apocalyptic remarks before Barbarossa about the necessity for a war without mercy to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" were interpreted by ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders as permission and encouragement to engage in extreme antisemitic violence, with each ''Einsatzgruppen'' commander to use his own discretion about how far he was prepared to go.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nMost of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former ''Einsatzgruppe'' members with war crimes.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=275\u2013276}} And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.{{sfn|Segev|2010|pp=226, 250, 376}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Functionalism versus intentionalism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Myth of the clean Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Porajmos]]\n* [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | last = Browning | first = Christopher R. | title = Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland | publisher = Penguin | location = London; New York | orig-year = 1992 | year = 1998 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Browning | first1 = Christopher | author-link = Christopher Browning | last2 = Matth\u00e4us | first2 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink2 = J\u00fcrgen Matth\u00e4us | title = The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 \u2013 March 1942 | series = Comprehensive History of the Holocaust | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | location = Lincoln | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8032-1327-2 | ref = harv | url = https://archive.org/details/originsoffinalso00brow }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Caron | first1 = Jean-Christophe | title = Erwin Rommel: Auf der Jagd nach dem Schatz des \"W\u00fcstenfuchses\" | page = 2 | journal = Spiegel Online | date = 22 December 2007 | language = German | url = http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/erwin-rommel-auf-der-jagd-nach-dem-schatz-des-wuestenfuchses-a-522484-2.html | accessdate = 9 September 2016 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Conze | first1 = Eckart | last2 = Frei | first2 = Norbert | last3 = Hayes | first3 = Peter | last4 = Zimmermann | first4 = Moshe | title = Das Amt und die Vergangenheit : deutsche Diplomaten im Dritten Reich und in der Bundesrepublik | year = 2010 | publisher = Karl Blessing | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 978-3-89667-430-2 | ref = {{sfnRef|Conze, Frei et al.|2010}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Craig | first = William | authorlink = William Craig (author) | title = Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad | year = 1973 | publisher = Konecky & Konecky | location = Old Saybrook, CT | isbn = 978-1-56852-368-2 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Crowe | first = David | title = Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of his Life, Wartime Activities and the True Story Behind the List | year = 2007 | origyear = 2004 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-465-00253-5 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Dams | first1 = Carsten | last2 = Stolle | first2 = Michael | title = Die Gestapo: Herrschaft und Terror im Dritten Reich | series = Becksche Reihe | year = 2012 | origyear = 2008 | language = German | publisher = Beck | location = Munich | isbn = 978-3-406-62898-6 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Edeiken | first = Yale F. | publisher = Holocaust History Project | title = Introduction to the Einsatzgruppen | date = 22 August 2000 | url = http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | accessdate= 10 June 2018 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007085553/http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | archive-date = 7 October 2015}}\n* {{cite book | title = Trials of War Criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10 | location = N\u00fcrnberg | date = October 1946 \u2013 April 1949 | volume =Volume 4 | series = Green Series | chapter = Einsatzgruppen case | chapter-url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-IV.pdf | url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NTs_war-criminals.html | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 June 2018 | ref = {{sfnRef|Einsatzgruppen judgment}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were [[Nalanda]] (in modern-day [[Bihar]]) and [[Manassa]] in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as [[Buddhist P\u00e1li literature]], logic, [[p\u00e1li grammar]], etc. [[Chanakya]], a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of [[Mauryan Empire]].\n\nSammanas and [[Brahmin|Brahmin gurus]] historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the ''[[Sammana]]s'', were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the ''[[Kshatriya]]'', were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the ''[[Vaishya]]'', were taught their trade and the working class of the ''[[Shudra]]s'' was generally deprived of educational advantages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Amit |title=Department of School Education & Literacy in India - MHRD |url=https://www.wiki.meramaal.com/2018/08/17/department-of-school-education/ |website=Meramaal Wiki |accessdate=2 August 2019 |date=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== School education ==\n{{see also | List of schools in India |l1 = List of schools}}\n[[File:University of Calcutta cropped.JPG|thumb|220x220px|[[University of Calcutta]], established on 1857, was the first multidisciplinary and secular Western-style institution in Asia.]]\n\nThe central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the \"[[10+2]]+3\" pattern of education.<ref name=\"ncert policy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/oth_anoun/npe86.pdf|title=National Policy on Education (with modifications undertaken in 1992)|publisher=National Council of Educational Research and Training|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>{{rp|3}} In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges,<ref name=\"ncert policy\"/>{{rp|44}} and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/10-2-3-scheme-seeks-to-divide-schooling-into-two-stages-of-education/1/203052.html|title=10+2+3: A Game of Numbers?|last=Vyas|first=Neena|work=India Today|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=30 June 2012}}</ref> The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.<ref name=\"ncert policy\"/>{{rp|5}} This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964\u201366.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1977-10+2+3+system+of+education:+The+new+class+structure/1/76361.html|title=1977-10+2+3 system of education: The new class structure\n|last=Bamzai|first=Kaveree|work=India Today|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=24 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Administration===\n====Policy====\nEducation Policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively.

Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.\n* [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located at New Delhi, Capital City of India. It makes the curriculum related matters for school education across India.<ref name=\"I09RA-233\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 233</ref> The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies.<ref name=\"I09RA-230-234\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 230\u2013234</ref> There are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level.\n* State Government Boards of Education: Most of the state governments have at least one \"State board of secondary school education\". However, some states like Andhra Pradesh have more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English - often considered less rigorous than central curriculums such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some even at the 5th, 6th and 8th level.\n* [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th standards that are called board exams. Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12. Examinations are offered in Hindi and English.\n* [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations]] (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE - Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC - Class/Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE - Class/Grade 12). CISCE English level has been compared to UK's A-Levels; this board offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have often been compared with CICSE and ISC examinations. CICSE is generally considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination. The CBSE and ISC are recognised internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of CBSE and ISC exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school.\n*[[National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS): The NIOS conducts two examinations, namely, Secondary Examination and Senior Secondary Examination (All India) and also some courses in Vocational Education. National Board of education is run by Government of India's HRD Ministry to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode. A pilot project started by CBSE to provide high class affordable education, provides education up to 12th standard. Choice of subjects is highly customisable and equivalent to CBSE. Home-schooled students usually take NIOS or international curriculum examinations as they are ineligible to write CBSE or ISC exams.\n* '''Islamic [[Madrasah]]''': Their boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] or Darul Uloom Nadwtul Ulama.\n* '''Autonomous schools''': Such as [[Woodstock School]], [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram|Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education Puducherry]], [[Visva-Bharati University|Patha Bhavan]] and [[Ananda Marga|Ananda Marga Gurukula]].\n* [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB): These are generally private schools that have dual affiliation with one of the school education board of India as well as affiliated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) Programme and/or the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB).\n* '''International schools''', which offer 10th and 12th standard examinations under the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Senior Secondary Examination systems or under their home nations school boards (such as run by foreign embassies or the expat communities).\n* [[Special education]]: A special Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) programme was started in 1974 with a focus on primary education.<ref name=\"I09RA-233\"/> but which was converted into Inclusive Education at Secondary Stage<ref>[http://www.education.nic.in/secedu/sec_iedc.asp Secondary Education].

The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still, only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.\n* '''Play group (pre-nursery)''': At playschools, children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves, dressing up, and maintaining cleanliness. The age limit for admission into pre-nursery is 2 to 3 years. [[Anganwadi]] is government-funded free rural childcare & Mothercare nutrition and learning program also incorporating the free [[Midday Meal Scheme]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Anganwadi Services Scheme |url=https://wcd.nic.in/schemes/anganwadi-services-scheme |website=Ministry of Women and Child Development|accessdate=30 March 2020 }}</ref>\n* '''Nursery''': Nursery level activities help children unfold their talents, thus enabling them to sharpen their mental and physical abilities. The age limit for admission in nursery is 3 to 4 years. \n* '''LKG''': It is also called the Junior Kindergarten (Jr.&nbsp;kg) stage. The age limit for admission in LKG is 4 to 5 years. \n* '''UKG''': It is also called the Senior Kindergarten (Sr.&nbsp;kg) stage. The age limit for admission in UKG is 5 to 6 years.\nLKG and UKG stages prepare and help children emotionally, mentally, socially and physically to grasp knowledge easily in the later stages of school and college life.\n<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/New-minimum-age-rule-for-entry-level-admission-stumps-parents-schools-in-Mumbai/articleshow/45983976.cms] [[Times of India]]</ref>\nA systematic process of preschool education is followed in India to impart knowledge in the best possible way for a better understanding of the young children. By following an easy and interesting curriculum, teachers strive hard to make the entire learning process enjoyable for the children.\n\n====Primary education====\n[[File:Government_Primary_School,Kharwada_Amona_Bicholim_Goa.jpg|thumb|School children reading books in government primary school library, in [[Goa]]]]\nThe primary education in India is divided into two parts, namely Lower Primary (Class I-IV) and Upper Primary (Middle school, Class V-VIII). The Indian government lays emphasis on primary education ( Class I-VIII ) also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old.<ref name=\"Blackwell93-94\">Blackwell, 93\u201394</ref> Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions.<ref name=\"Blackwell93-94\" /> However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions.<ref name=\"Blackwell93-94\" /> 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country.<ref name=\"dise.in\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dise.in/ar2005.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231235835/http://www.dise.in/ar2005.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 December 2008 |accessdate=8 February 2016  }}</ref>\n\nHowever, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training.

Enrollment has been enhanced, but the levels of quality remain low.\n\n====Secondary education====\n[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|Secondary school girls in [[Delhi]].]]\n[[File:Indian school children at Hnahthial.jpg|thumb|School children in Hnahthial.]]\nSecondary education covers children aged 14 to 18, a group comprising 8.85 [[crore]] children according to the [[2001 Census of India]]. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the \"+2\" stage. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.\n\nUGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as [[Engineering]], [[Medicine|Medical]], and [[Business administration|Business Administration]].\n\nSecondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11-12) with a standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to as \"board exams\"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11\u201312 at a secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India.\n\nMost schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different \"streams\"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.\n\n===== 10th (Matriculation or Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 10 examination usually take six subjects: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, one language, and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers at different schools. \"Elective\" or optional subjects often include Computer Applications, Economics, Physical Education, Commerce, and Environmental Science.\n\n===== 12th (Senior Secondary or Higher Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 12 examination usually take four or five subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing a \"core stream\" in addition to English or the local language: Science (Mathematics/Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), Commerce (Accounts, Business Studies, and Economics), or Humanities (any three of History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Geography depending on school). Students study Mathematics up to single-variable Calculus in grade 12.\n\n===Types of schools===\n====Government schools====\nThe majority of students study in government schools where poor and vulnerable students study for free until the age of 14. An Education Ministry data, 65.2% (113 million,) of all school students in 20 states go to government schools (c. 2017).<ref name=study1>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/in-5-years-private-schools-gain-17-million-students-government-schools-lose-13-million/story-6FV1ic7RLttmWc0ZkhBQBM.html In 5 years, private schools gain 17 million students, government schools lose 13 million], [[Hindustan Times]], 17 April 2017.</ref> These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the centre government.

Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen & politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride.

This welfare thrust raised primary enrollment between 1951 and 1981. In 1986 the National Policy on Education decided to restructure education in tune with the social framework of each state, and with larger national goals. It emphasised that education was necessary for democracy, and central to the improvement of women's condition. The new policy aimed at social change through revised texts, curricula, increased funding for schools, expansion in the numbers of schools, and policy improvements. Emphasis was placed on expanding girls' occupational centres and primary education; secondary and higher education; and rural and urban institutions. The report tried to connect problems like low school attendance with poverty, and the dependence on girls for housework and sibling day care. The National Literacy Mission also worked through female tutors in villages. Although the minimum marriage age is now eighteen for girls, many continue to be married much earlier. Therefore, at the secondary level, female drop-out rates are high.<ref name=Raman238/>}}\n\nSita Anantha Raman also mentions that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions.<ref name=Raman238>Raman, 238</ref>\n\nThe education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

It is either based on a student's success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or competencies.

However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/framing-success-in-teaching/article7597239.ece|title=Framing success in teaching|first=Nalini|last=Haridas|date=31 August 2015|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\n===Coaching===\n[[File:Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi]]\nIncreased competition to get admission in reputed colleges has given rise to private coaching institutes in India.

Within this allocation, major share of {{Indian Rupee}} 21,000&nbsp;crore, is for the flagship programme 'Sarva Siksha Abhiyan'. However, budgetary allocation of {{Indian Rupee}} 210,000 million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of {{Indian Rupee}} 35,659&nbsp;crore for the year 2011\u201312. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation 'Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In recent times, several major announcements were made for developing the poor state of affairs in education sector in India, the most notable ones being the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The announcements are;\n(a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP.\n(b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes.\n(c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty.\n(d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6\u201314 years.\n(e) To universalise education through its flagship programmes such as [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] and [[Midday Meal Scheme]]\n\nHowever, even after five years of implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951\u201352 to 2.31% in 1970\u201371 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000\u201301. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004\u201305. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000\u20132001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget.

These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were [[Nalanda]] (in modern-day [[Bihar]]) and [[Manassa]] in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as [[Buddhist P\u00e1li literature]], logic, [[p\u00e1li grammar]], etc. [[Chanakya]], a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of [[Mauryan Empire]].\n\nSammanas and [[Brahmin|Brahmin gurus]] historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the ''[[Sammana]]s'', were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the ''[[Kshatriya]]'', were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the ''[[Vaishya]]'', were taught their trade and the working class of the ''[[Shudra]]s'' was generally deprived of educational advantages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Amit |title=Department of School Education & Literacy in India - MHRD |url=https://www.wiki.meramaal.com/2018/08/17/department-of-school-education/ |website=Meramaal Wiki |accessdate=2 August 2019 |date=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== School education ==\n{{see also | List of schools in India |l1 = List of schools}}\n[[File:University of Calcutta cropped.JPG|thumb|220x220px|[[University of Calcutta]], established on 1857, was the first multidisciplinary and secular Western-style institution in Asia.]]\n\nThe central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the \"[[10+2]]+3\" pattern of education.<ref name=\"ncert policy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/oth_anoun/npe86.pdf|title=National Policy on Education (with modifications undertaken in 1992)|publisher=National Council of Educational Research and Training|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>{{rp|3}} In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges,<ref name=\"ncert policy\"/>{{rp|44}} and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/10-2-3-scheme-seeks-to-divide-schooling-into-two-stages-of-education/1/203052.html|title=10+2+3: A Game of Numbers?|last=Vyas|first=Neena|work=India Today|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=30 June 2012}}</ref> The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.<ref name=\"ncert policy\"/>{{rp|5}} This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964\u201366.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1977-10+2+3+system+of+education:+The+new+class+structure/1/76361.html|title=1977-10+2+3 system of education: The new class structure\n|last=Bamzai|first=Kaveree|work=India Today|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=24 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Administration===\n====Policy====\nEducation Policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively.

Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.\n* [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located at New Delhi, Capital City of India. It makes the curriculum related matters for school education across India.<ref name=\"I09RA-233\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 233</ref> The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies.<ref name=\"I09RA-230-234\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 230\u2013234</ref> There are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level.\n* State Government Boards of Education: Most of the state governments have at least one \"State board of secondary school education\". However, some states like Andhra Pradesh have more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English - often considered less rigorous than central curriculums such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some even at the 5th, 6th and 8th level.\n* [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th standards that are called board exams. Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12. Examinations are offered in Hindi and English.\n* [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations]] (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE - Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC - Class/Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE - Class/Grade 12). CISCE English level has been compared to UK's A-Levels; this board offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have often been compared with CICSE and ISC examinations. CICSE is generally considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination. The CBSE and ISC are recognised internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of CBSE and ISC exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school.\n*[[National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS): The NIOS conducts two examinations, namely, Secondary Examination and Senior Secondary Examination (All India) and also some courses in Vocational Education. National Board of education is run by Government of India's HRD Ministry to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode. A pilot project started by CBSE to provide high class affordable education, provides education up to 12th standard. Choice of subjects is highly customisable and equivalent to CBSE. Home-schooled students usually take NIOS or international curriculum examinations as they are ineligible to write CBSE or ISC exams.\n* '''Islamic [[Madrasah]]''': Their boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] or Darul Uloom Nadwtul Ulama.\n* '''Autonomous schools''': Such as [[Woodstock School]], [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram|Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education Puducherry]], [[Visva-Bharati University|Patha Bhavan]] and [[Ananda Marga|Ananda Marga Gurukula]].\n* [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB): These are generally private schools that have dual affiliation with one of the school education board of India as well as affiliated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) Programme and/or the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB).\n* '''International schools''', which offer 10th and 12th standard examinations under the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Senior Secondary Examination systems or under their home nations school boards (such as run by foreign embassies or the expat communities).\n* [[Special education]]: A special Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) programme was started in 1974 with a focus on primary education.<ref name=\"I09RA-233\"/> but which was converted into Inclusive Education at Secondary Stage<ref>[http://www.education.nic.in/secedu/sec_iedc.asp Secondary Education].

On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to the primary stage but pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India, pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages. But in cities and big towns, there are many established players in the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still, only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.\n* '''Play group (pre-nursery)''': At playschools, children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves, dressing up, and maintaining cleanliness.

The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the \"+2\" stage. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.\n\nUGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as [[Engineering]], [[Medicine|Medical]], and [[Business administration|Business Administration]].\n\nSecondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11-12) with a standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to as \"board exams\"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11\u201312 at a secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India.\n\nMost schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different \"streams\"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.\n\n===== 10th (Matriculation or Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 10 examination usually take six subjects: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, one language, and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers at different schools. \"Elective\" or optional subjects often include Computer Applications, Economics, Physical Education, Commerce, and Environmental Science.\n\n===== 12th (Senior Secondary or Higher Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 12 examination usually take four or five subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing a \"core stream\" in addition to English or the local language: Science (Mathematics/Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), Commerce (Accounts, Business Studies, and Economics), or Humanities (any three of History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Geography depending on school). Students study Mathematics up to single-variable Calculus in grade 12.\n\n===Types of schools===\n====Government schools====\nThe majority of students study in government schools where poor and vulnerable students study for free until the age of 14.

This welfare thrust raised primary enrollment between 1951 and 1981. In 1986 the National Policy on Education decided to restructure education in tune with the social framework of each state, and with larger national goals. It emphasised that education was necessary for democracy, and central to the improvement of women's condition. The new policy aimed at social change through revised texts, curricula, increased funding for schools, expansion in the numbers of schools, and policy improvements. Emphasis was placed on expanding girls' occupational centres and primary education; secondary and higher education; and rural and urban institutions. The report tried to connect problems like low school attendance with poverty, and the dependence on girls for housework and sibling day care. The National Literacy Mission also worked through female tutors in villages. Although the minimum marriage age is now eighteen for girls, many continue to be married much earlier. Therefore, at the secondary level, female drop-out rates are high.<ref name=Raman238/>}}\n\nSita Anantha Raman also mentions that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions.<ref name=Raman238>Raman, 238</ref>\n\nThe education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

It is either based on a student's success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, both of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/in-school/signpost/recognising-excellence-in-the-teaching-profession/article7680538.ece|title=Recognising excellence in the teaching profession|first=Ramya|last=Venkataraman|date=23 September 2015|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref> This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/framing-success-in-teaching/article7597239.ece|title=Framing success in teaching|first=Nalini|last=Haridas|date=31 August 2015|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\n===Coaching===\n[[File:Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi]]\nIncreased competition to get admission in reputed colleges has given rise to private coaching institutes in India.

Within this allocation, major share of {{Indian Rupee}} 21,000&nbsp;crore, is for the flagship programme 'Sarva Siksha Abhiyan'. However, budgetary allocation of {{Indian Rupee}} 210,000 million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of {{Indian Rupee}} 35,659&nbsp;crore for the year 2011\u201312. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation 'Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In recent times, several major announcements were made for developing the poor state of affairs in education sector in India, the most notable ones being the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The announcements are;\n(a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP.\n(b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes.\n(c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty.\n(d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6\u201314 years.\n(e) To universalise education through its flagship programmes such as [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] and [[Midday Meal Scheme]]\n\nHowever, even after five years of implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951\u201352 to 2.31% in 1970\u201371 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000\u201301. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004\u201305. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000\u20132001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget.

instances of Fogle's illegal behavior that were reported to senior management, including the allegation that Subway's senior vice president of marketing hushed up a 2004 incident in which Fogle propositioned a young girl at a promotional event at a Subway franchise in Las Vegas.<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2017, with the judge writing that the court
