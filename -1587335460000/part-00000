The three wards of Eltham North, South and West have a total population of 35,459.<ref name=ONS/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nEltham developed along part of the road from London to [[Maidstone]] and lies {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} almost due south of [[Woolwich]]. [[Mottingham]], to the south, became part of the parish on the abolition of all [[extra-parochial area]]s, which were rare anomalies in the parish system. [[Eltham College]] and other parts of Mottingham were therefore not considered within Eltham's boundaries even before the 1860s.\n\nFrom the 6th century Eltham was in the ancient [[Lathe of Sutton at Hone]]. In the 1086 Domesday Book its hundred was named ''Gren[u/v]iz'' (Greenwich), which by the 1166 was renamed ''Blachehedfeld'' [[Blackheath, Kent (hundred)|(Blackheath)]] because it had become the location of the annual or more frequent [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] gathering.\n\n{{quote|Eltham lies in the hundred of Blackheath, at the distance of eight miles from London, on the road to Maidstone. The parish is bounded by Woolwich, Plumsted, and the extraparochial hamlet of Kidbrooke, on the north; by Bexley on the east and south east; by Chislehurst on the south; by the extraparochial hamlet of Mottingham, on the south-west, and by Lee on the west. It contains about {{convert|2880|acres|km2}}: of which about 360 are woodland; about 60 waste; about three fifths of the cultivated land are arable. ....This place had formerly a market on Tuesdays, and two fairs; one at the festival of the Holy Trinity, and the other at that of St. Peter and St. Paul; both of which have been long discontinued.|Daniel Lysons, 1796|The Environs of London<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\">Daniel Lysons. (1796) The Environs of London. Vol 4. Pages 394-421. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45484</ref>}}\n\nBy the 1880s the lathes and hundreds of Kent had become obsolete, with the civil parishes and other districts assuming modern governmental functions.\n\nEltham was a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Kent]] until 1889 when it became part of the [[County of London]]{{cn|date=April 2018}} and from 1900 formed part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]]. The metropolitan borough was abolished in 1965 and Eltham then became part of the then London Borough of Greenwich.\n\nEltham today is one of the largest suburban developments in the borough with a population of almost 88,000 people.\n\n===Early development===\n\n[[File:Eltham Palace (25098625346).jpg|thumb|[[Eltham Palace]]]]\n\nEltham lies on a high, sandy plateau which gave it a strategic significance. That, and the fact of its position close to the main route to the [[English Channel]] ports in Kent, led to the creation of the moated medieval [[Eltham Palace]], still its most notable landmark. Daniel Lysons<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> described its origins.\n\n{{quote|The Kings of England had a palace at Eltham at a very early period ... Henry the Third, in the year 1270, kept a public Christmas at his palace of Eltham, being accompanied by the Queen, and all the great men of the realm. Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham, and Patriarch of Jerusalem, bestowed great cost, we are told, on the buildings at this place, and died there on the 28th of March 1311, having, as it is said, some time before given Eltham-house to Edward the Second, or, as some say, to Queen Isabel.... Edward frequently resided here. In 1315, his Queen was brought to bed of a son in this palace, called, from that circumstance, John of Eltham. Edward the Third held a Parliament at Eltham in 1329, and again in 1375.}}\n\nThe nearby manor of Well Hall was home to Sir John Pulteney, four times [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], and later to wealthy Catholic [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]] and his wife Margaret (daughter of Sir Thomas More, known to Catholics as [[Saint]] [[Thomas More]], Chancellor to King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]). In 1733 Sir [[Sir Gregory Page, 2nd Baronet|Gregory Page]] bought this estate for \u00a319,000 and demolished Roper House, building Page House \u2013 later known as Well Hall House \u2013 on the site. Until its demolition in 1931, Well Hall House variously served as a home to [[watchmaker]] [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]], and later to socialist [[Hubert Bland]] and author [[Edith Nesbit]].\n\nAlso of note is Avery Hill Park and its former mansion, accessed from Bexley Road and at various points along the three miles (5&nbsp;km) of other streets that surround the park. Avery Hill was the home of [[John Thomas North|Colonel North]], who made his fortune working in the Chilean nitrate industry. A hothouse is still open to the public and contains temperate and tropical plants. There are also remnants of the formal gardens in the public park. Today the mansion is part of the [[University of Greenwich]], which has been a significant presence on two sites in the area. However, in 2014 the University announced its intentions to withdraw from the site and has now done so.\n\n===Suburban development after 1900===\nThe village streets adjacent to the Palace, and the surrounding land, remained rural until [[Archibald Cameron Corbett]] bought the Eltham Park Estate and developed it with well-built suburban housing between 1900 and 1914. The Bexley Heath Railway (see below) had opened what came to be known as the [[Bexleyheath Line]] in 1895. Suburban development of the district accelerated when the Government, through His Majesty's Office of Works, built the [[Progress Estate]] in [[Well Hall]] and large estates of temporary [[Shanty town|hutment]]s in 1915, to house the vastly increased numbers of wartime workers in the [[Royal Arsenal]] at [[Woolwich]]. In the early years it was called, rather pretentiously, \"Well Hall Garden City\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/case-studies/progress-estate|title=Case Studies - Progress Estate|work=ideal-homes.org.uk|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref> Its name was changed to \"[[Progress Estate]]\" when it was purchased by the [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] in 1925. It compares well with later groups of municipal housing in south London \u2013 which is surprising given the fact that it was constructed rapidly between February and December 1915 and is sub-divided by the [[South Circular Road, London|South Circular Road]] and (until about 1988) by the even busier [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] [[Trunk Road]]. The Progress Estate was made a Conservation Area in 2007.\n\n'''Urban Development''' \n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Eltham map 1870.jpg|Map 2.

Eltham in 2014 Source Open Street Map\n</gallery>\n\nAfter World War I the building of housing estates continued unabated. By the beginning of World War II, four large estates were in existence: the [[Progress Estate]] (1915),  the Page Estate (1923), [[Middle Park, London|Middle Park]] (1931\u201336), and Horn Park (begun 1936, completed 1950s). The latter two were built on Eltham Palace's former hunting parks. [[Coldharbour Estate]] was built in 1947. The small council estates of Pippenhall and Strongbow Crescent were completed about 1960. Since that time new house building has been limited to small private \"infill developments\" and replacements for demolished properties.\n\nEltham residents occupy a housing stock of mixed age, particularly towards Eltham Park and the multiple streets with 'Glen' in their names. There are some fine houses scattered around Eltham. At least two roads, North Park and Court Road, contain million pound homes, and some of the older Victorian buildings have been subdivided into apartments.\n\nA [[Micropub]], The Long Pond, was opened in December 2014 - the first pub in Eltham Park for at least 115 years as Archibald Cameron Corbett would not give permission for pubs and put a restrictive covenant on the land. However, since the [[Licensing Act 2003]] was implemented in 2005, Premise Licences are now granted by the local authority ([[Greenwich London Borough Council]]) instead of magistrates, as long as the applicant satisfies the council and the \"responsible authorities\" (such as Police, Environmental Health, Fire Service) that they will uphold the four licensing objectives (prevention of crime and disorder; public safety; prevention of public nuisance, protection of children from harm), then a licence will be granted. Several licensed premises in Eltham Park now offer \"Off Sales\".\n\n'''Domestic Architecture''' \n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Eltham houses 1.jpg|The Lord Chancellor's Lodging. c1420\nFile:Eltham houses 11.jpg|Clapboard cottage. c1750\nFile:Eltham houses 12.jpg|Pair of cottages. c1800\nFile:Eltham houses 13.jpg|Villas. c1880\nFile:Eltham houses 14.jpg|Terrace houses. c1880\nFile:Eltham houses 2.jpg|\"Corbett Houses\" Eltham Park c1905\nFile:Eltham houses 3.jpg|\"Corbett Houses\" Well Hall c 1905\nFile:Eltham houses 4.jpg|[[Progress Estate]].

Eltham: contours and water courses]]\nEltham has a varied [[topography]]. Map 6 shows contours, spot heights and water courses. The centre of Eltham is on a plateau at about the 60m level with the High Street running along its centre.  There is a scarp slope to the west of the plateau from the top of which are unrestricted views across [[South London]]. [[Eltham Palace]] occupies a commanding position on the edge of the scarp. Eltham Hill offers the steepest descent from the plateau, starting at Eltham High Street and descending 30m over 1&nbsp;km due west at the ''Yorkshire Grey'' (now a [[McDonald's]] outlet). The land to the north of Eltham rises to form the southern slope of [[Shooter's Hill]], one of the [[List of highest points in London|highest points in London]] at a height of 130m. The recently (2014) restored 18th century [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] [[Severndroog Castle]] offers wide views from its observation platform which is 150m above sea level.\n\nFrom Eltham Church at 60m the High Street rises gently to 71m and continues east as Bexley Road at a slightly lower level.\n\nTo the south the plateau slopes gently downwards to [[Mottingham]] (at 49.6m) and [[New Eltham]] (at 46.1m)\n\nEltham is devoid of any major water features, although the [[River Thames]] is approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|1}} away from Eltham's northern limits. The most prominent body of water is the [[River Quaggy]] which runs to the south-west of Eltham and joins the [[River Ravensbourne]] at Lewisham. The Quaggy receives additional water from Mottingham Tarn and feeds the wetlands in Sutclife Park. The only other significant watercourse is the [[River Shuttle]], which rises in Avery Hill Park and flows east to join the [[River Cray]].\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|title = '''Destinations from Eltham'''\n|Northwest = [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]\n|North     = [[Shooters Hill]]\n|Northeast = [[Falconwood]]\n|West      = [[Kidbrooke]]\n|Centre    = Eltham\n|East      = [[Avery Hill]]\n|Southwest = [[Lee, London|Lee]] \n|South     = [[Mottingham]] \n|Southeast = [[New Eltham]]\n}}\n\nOther Nearby Areas\n{{Div col|colwidth=10em}}\n*[[Blackfen]] \n*[[Catford]] \n*[[Charlton, London|Charlton]] \n*[[Chislehurst]] \n*[[Downham]]\n*[[Hither Green]]\n*[[Greenwich]]  \n*[[Grove Park, Lewisham|Grove Park]] \n*[[Lewisham]] \n*[[Plumstead]] \n*[[Sidcup]] \n*[[Welling]] \n*[[Woolwich]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Parks and open spaces===\n[[File:Eltham greenchain.jpg|right|thumbnail|Green Chain Walks in and through Eltham]]\nThere is a large variety of open green space in Eltham, in the form of parkland, fields and woodland.\n\"[[Green Chain Walk]]s\" are signposted footpaths that run through or link the green spaces. Some are also bridleways or cycle routes.\n\n*''[[Avery Hill]] Park'' is large, open parkland, to the east. It is most notable for its Winter Garden, a [[Greenhouse|hothouse]] containing tropical trees and plants from around the world. The parkland was acquired by the [[London County Council]] in 1902.\n*''Oxleas Woods, Castle Wood and Jack Wood'', directly north of Eltham, is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. Oxleas Wood covers {{convert|190.3|acre|km2|1}} and is at least 8,000&nbsp;years old. The wood is home to specimen of tree including oak, silver birch, hornbeam and coppice hazel. [[Severndroog Castle]], built in 1784 as a memorial to William James of the East India Company, stands in Castle Wood.\n*''Sutcliffe Park'' is a {{convert|35|acre|km2|1}} park at the westernmost point of Eltham. Previously known as Harrow Meadow, the parkland was reclaimed from the [[River Quaggy]] in the 1930s. The Quaggy was diverted into [[culvert]]s, and the park officially opened in 1937 as Sutcliffe Park, named after the Borough's engineer. On 26 June 1954, the athletics track in Sutcliffe Park was opened, and has since been home to the Cambridge Harriers. In 2003, the park was re-landscaped as a wetland area. The River Quaggy was allowed to flow above-ground in the area, for the first time in 70&nbsp;years. The park borders the [[Ferrier Estate]], which was completed in 1970 and demolished by 2012 to make way for \"Kidbrooke Village\". \n*The ''Royal Blackheath Golf Course''<ref>Web site at ://http://www.royalblackheath.com/home</ref> and the adjoining ''Tarn'' date back to [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times. The golf club, founded in 1766 to the north in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and to the south since its merger with Eltham Golf club in 1923, is the oldest golf club in the world outside Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalblackheath.com/index.lasso?pg=ec7e88a710c7a8e9&mp=cbc638823c5eb85e |title=Our History : Royal Blackheath Golf Club \u2013 The Oldest Golf Club in the world |publisher=Royalblackheath.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The club house Eltham Lodge<ref>Eltham Lodge was built in 1664 to the design of Hugh May for John Shaw, banker to King Charles.

In recent years there has been great effort by local town centre businesses and other important Eltham stakeholders, to drive business, community and tourism improvements, that will help sustain the town centre. These efforts have resulted in the formation of an Eltham town centre partnership (ETCP), chaired by an elected local stakeholder. Greenwich council have member and officer representatives and the University of Greenwich whose Avery Hill Campus borders the Town Centre is also represented. The ETCP have encouraged the development of A new town centre commerce Association \u2013 The Association of Commerce for Eltham (ACE). ACE has established a new Town Centre web portal,<ref>ACE web site:  www.elthamse9.uk</ref> which, as well as providing a basic business directory also provides mechanisms for encouraging interaction between business and community groups. The ETCP is currently trying to encourage the University of Greenwich, to undertake research projects into business and community development, based on Eltham town centre.\n\nIn 2007, the new Eltham Centre opened just off the High Street including council offices and a new swimming pool and incorporating the early 20th century library.\n\nThe Eltham Society was founded in 1965 with the aim of \"Preserving the past, Conserving the present, and Protecting the future\".

Five teenagers were later accused of his murder but the case was dropped due to a lack of evidence.<ref>Paul Peachey (2002) Racist violence returns to streets where Stephen Lawrence was knifed to death, ''The Independent'', 24 August 2002</ref> In 2011 as a result of new evidence coming to light, Gary Dobson and David Norris stood trial for the murder of Stephen Lawrence.

Cray Valley plays an annual charity match against their local non-league rivals Eltham Old Boys Football Club.\n\nEltham's parks provide many facilities for sports and fitness. Eltham Park South has a jogging track and six tennis courts. The Pleasaunce has a bowling green and pavilion. Avery Hill Park has changing rooms and half a dozen football and rugby pitches and with cricket pitches laid out in the summer. \nThe land adjoining Avery Hill is occupied by many sports grounds which include Footscray RUFC, London Electricity Sorts and Social Club, Charlton Park RFC, Sparrows Lane Sports Ground, Cambridge Mission Sports Ground, Unilever Sports Ground, Metrogas Amateur Sports Association, St James Mar Thoma Amateur Sports Ground and the SRC2 Sports Club. The same area is also home to the training ground of professional football club [[Charlton Athletic]] at Sparrows Lane.\n\nAdjacent to Well Hall Pleasaunce is University of Greenwich Athletics Ground. This has a pavilion with changing rooms and six pitches for football and rugby\n\nPreserving these sports areas from the encroachments of property developers is a constant battle for Elthams environmental and community groups. Currently (2014) the focus is on the long disused Gaelic Sports Field in Avery Hill Road, for which there is a planning application to build 150 houses.<ref>SEnine magazine, October 2014, Page 14, \"Gaelic Athletic Association - a Disgrace\"</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Rail===\nEltham, along with most other suburbs in south east London, is not served by the [[London Underground]]. Commuters rely on two rail lines to central London, and the road network. Trains through Eltham terminate at [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]], [[Cannon Street railway station|London Cannon Street]] or [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] in a westerly direction, and [[Crayford railway station|Crayford]], [[Dartford railway station|Dartford]], [[Slade Green railway station|Slade Green]], [[Gravesend railway station|Gravesend]], [[Gillingham railway station (Kent)|Gillingham]] or [[Rochester railway station|Rochester]] in an easterly direction. Given the lack of London Underground access, the two suburban rail lines work at, or above, their capacity during peak-hour commuting to central London. Fast trains take as little as 20 minutes to get to London Charing Cross.\n\n'''Bexleyheath line'''\n\nOriginally opened on 1 May 1895 by a private company, the Bexleyheath Line was taken over by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] after it suffered bankruptcy. There were originally two stations in Eltham: Eltham Well Hall and Eltham Park. Eltham Well Hall station opened in 1895. Eltham Park station opened (after a prolonged legal wrangle) on 1 July 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/e/eltham_park/index.shtml|title=Disused Stations: Eltham Park Station}}</ref> On 11 June 1972, a [[Eltham Well Hall rail crash|London-bound train came off the track]] at Well Hall, killing 6 and injuring 126. Both Eltham stations were closed in 1985 and replaced by a new \u2018[[Eltham railway station|Eltham]]\u2019 station; this coincided with the construction of the Rochester Way Relief Road part of which was built on the site of Eltham Well Hall station. Glenlea Road between Well Hall Road and Archery Road was replaced by the station forecourt and a bus station (this had previously been adjacent to Well Hall station). The new rail station was built above the new road at the point it travels through what is sometimes referred to as 'the Eltham tunnel'. The new station has a modernist feel.<ref>http://www.yellins.co.uk/transporthistory/rail/bex.html picture</ref>\n\n'''Dartford Loop'''\n\nThe Dartford Loop line, about {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} south of Eltham High Street, was opened by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] on 1 September 1866. It is commonly known by locals as the '[[Dartford]] line via [[Sidcup]]'. There are two stations on this line that serve the population living to the south of Eltham: [[Mottingham railway station|Mottingham station]], originally named 'Eltham Station' until 'Eltham Well Hall' opened, and [[New Eltham railway station|New Eltham station]]. Neither station is as large as Eltham station, but both have been heavily upgraded since opening.\n\n===Roads===\nEltham High Street lies on the A210, the original [[A20 road (England)|A20]] London to [[Maidstone]] road. But the A20 has now been diverted southwards, passing through Mottingham, and it is a [[dual carriageway]] that connects to the [[M20 motorway|M20]] motorway in Kent. Similarly, to the north, the dual carriageway A2 has replaced the Rochester Road section, which was always very congested (the old road had dangerous readings of lead pollution, close to schools, before the advent of lead-free petrol).\n\nThe upgrading of these two arterial routes in and out of London means that Eltham is handily positioned between the A20 and A2. Driving on either of these roads into London soon results in congestion, although the A2 does connect through to the [[Blackwall Tunnel]] under the [[Thames]], and thus into east London, all on dual carriageway. Driving eastwards allows access to the [[Dartford Tunnel]], and the [[Kent]] countryside, in as little as 20 minutes in off-peak hours.\n\nCrossing the two from north to the south is the [[A205 road|A205 South Circular road]], a busy arterial route.\n\nThe back streets of Eltham have been largely traffic-calmed by the local Council, but there are chronic rat-runs<ref>The Guardian, Saturday 22 November 2008, Let's Move to Eltham</ref> as many of the measures are ineffective or insufficient. Provision for cyclists is modest, while there are some interesting footpaths along ancient rights of way, for example in Oxleas Wood and Avery Hill Park.\n\n===Buses===\nScheduled coaches, marketed as part of the [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] network, link Eltham Green to [[Pimlico]] and [[Victoria Coach Station|Victoria]] in central London and to several destinations on the Kent coast via [[Bluewater (shopping centre)|Bluewater]] (a retail-based development on a grand scale in Dartford borough) and [[Canterbury]]. Eltham Green is one of the few places in south London served by National Express coaches.\n\nEltham is served by [[Transport for London]] bus routes 122, 124, 126, 132, 160, 161, 162, 233, 286, 314, 321, B15 and B16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/eltham-high-street-a4.pdf |title=Buses from Eltham High Street |work=Transport for London |date=23 November 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/eltham-station-eltham-church-a4.pdf |title=Buses from Eltham Station (Eltham Church) |work=Transport for London |date=23 November 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> These routes connect Eltham to [[Beckenham]], [[Bexleyheath]], [[Bromley]], [[Catford]], [[Chinbrook]], [[Chislehurst]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Foots Cray]], [[Greenwich]], [[Grove Park, Lewisham|Grove Park]], [[Horn Park]], [[Kidbrooke]], [[Lee, London|Lee]], [[Lewisham]], [[Middle Park, London|Middle Park]], [[New Addington]], [[New Cross]], [[Greenwich Peninsula|North Greenwich]], [[Plumstead]], [[Ruxley]], [[Sidcup]], [[Swanley]] and [[Well Hall]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{sources|section|date=April 2018}}\n*[[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] \u2013 Internationally renowned [[watchmaker]], lived in ''Well Hall House''.\n*[[John Ayldon]] \u2013 An operatic [[bass-baritone]] and former member of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].\n*[[Hubert Bland]] \u2013 Socialist and co-founder of the [[Fabian Society]].

The three wards of Eltham North, South and West have a total population of 35,459.<ref name=ONS/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nEltham developed along part of the road from London to [[Maidstone]] and lies {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} almost due south of [[Woolwich]]. [[Mottingham]], to the south, became part of the parish on the abolition of all [[extra-parochial area]]s, which were rare anomalies in the parish system. [[Eltham College]] and other parts of Mottingham were even before the 1860s therefore not considered within Eltham's boundaries.\n\nFrom the 6th century Eltham was in the ancient [[Lathe of Sutton at Hone]]. In the 1086 Domesday Book its hundred was named ''Gren[u/v]iz'' (Greenwich), which by the 1166 was renamed ''Blachehedfeld'' [[Blackheath, Kent (hundred)|(Blackheath)]] because it had become the location of the annual or more frequent [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] gathering.\n\n{{quote|Eltham lies in the hundred of Blackheath, at the distance of eight miles from London, on the road to Maidstone. The parish is bounded by Woolwich, Plumsted, and the extraparochial hamlet of Kidbrooke, on the north; by Bexley on the east and south east; by Chislehurst on the south; by the extraparochial hamlet of Mottingham, on the south-west, and by Lee on the west. It contains about {{convert|2880|acres|km2}}: of which about 360 are woodland; about 60 waste; about three fifths of the cultivated land are arable. ....This place had formerly a market on Tuesdays, and two fairs; one at the festival of the Holy Trinity, and the other at that of St. Peter and St. Paul; both of which have been long discontinued.|Daniel Lysons, 1796|The Environs of London<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\">Daniel Lysons. (1796) The Environs of London. Vol 4. Pages 394-421. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45484</ref>}}\n\nBy the 1880s the lathes and hundreds of Kent had become obsolete, with the civil parishes and other districts assuming modern governmental functions.\n\nEltham was a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Kent]] until 1889 when it became part of the [[County of London]]{{cn|date=April 2018}} and from 1900 formed part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]]. The metropolitan borough was abolished in 1965 and Eltham then became part of the then London Borough of Greenwich.\n\nEltham today is one of the largest suburban developments in the borough with a population of almost 88,000 people.\n\n===Early development===\n\n[[File:Eltham Palace (25098625346).jpg|thumb|[[Eltham Palace]]]]\n\nEltham lies on a high, sandy plateau which gave it a strategic significance. That, and the fact of its position close to the main route to the [[English Channel]] ports in Kent, led to the creation of the moated medieval [[Eltham Palace]], still its most notable landmark. Daniel Lysons<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> described its origins.\n\n{{quote|The Kings of England had a palace at Eltham at a very early period ... Henry the Third, in the year 1270, kept a public Christmas at his palace of Eltham, being accompanied by the Queen, and all the great men of the realm. Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham, and Patriarch of Jerusalem, bestowed great cost, we are told, on the buildings at this place, and died there on the 28th of March 1311, having, as it is said, some time before given Eltham-house to Edward the Second, or, as some say, to Queen Isabel.... Edward frequently resided here. In 1315, his Queen was brought to bed of a son in this palace, called, from that circumstance, John of Eltham. Edward the Third held a Parliament at Eltham in 1329, and again in 1375.}}\n\nThe nearby manor of Well Hall was home to Sir John Pulteney, four times [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], and later to wealthy Catholic [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]] and his wife Margaret (daughter of Sir Thomas More, known to Catholics as [[Saint]] [[Thomas More]], Chancellor to King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]). In 1733 Sir [[Sir Gregory Page, 2nd Baronet|Gregory Page]] bought this estate for \u00a319,000 and demolished Roper House, building Page House \u2013 later known as Well Hall House \u2013 on the site. Until its demolition in 1931, Well Hall House variously served as a home to [[watchmaker]] [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]], and later to socialist [[Hubert Bland]] and author [[Edith Nesbit]].\n\nAlso of note is Avery Hill Park and its former mansion, accessed from Bexley Road and at various points along the three miles (5&nbsp;km) of other streets that surround the park. Avery Hill was the home of [[John Thomas North|Colonel North]], who made his fortune working in the Chilean nitrate industry. A hothouse is still open to the public and contains temperate and tropical plants. There are also remnants of the formal gardens in the public park. Today the mansion is part of the [[University of Greenwich]], which has been a significant presence on two sites in the area. However, in 2014 the University announced its intentions to withdraw from the site and has now done so.\n\n===Suburban development after 1900===\nThe village streets adjacent to the Palace, and the surrounding land, remained rural until [[Archibald Cameron Corbett]] bought the Eltham Park Estate and developed it with well-built suburban housing between 1900 and 1914. The Bexley Heath Railway (see below) had opened what came to be known as the [[Bexleyheath Line]] in 1895. Suburban development of the district accelerated when the Government, through His Majesty's Office of Works, built the [[Progress Estate]] in [[Well Hall]] and large estates of temporary [[Shanty town|hutment]]s in 1915, to house the vastly increased numbers of wartime workers in the [[Royal Arsenal]] at [[Woolwich]]. In the early years it was called, rather pretentiously, \"Well Hall Garden City\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/case-studies/progress-estate|title=Case Studies - Progress Estate|work=ideal-homes.org.uk|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref> Its name was changed to \"[[Progress Estate]]\" when it was purchased by the [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] in 1925. It compares well with later groups of municipal housing in south London \u2013 which is surprising given the fact that it was constructed rapidly between February and December 1915 and is sub-divided by the [[South Circular Road, London|South Circular Road]] and (until about 1988) by the even busier [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] [[Trunk Road]]. The Progress Estate was made a Conservation Area in 2007.\n\n'''Urban Development''' \n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Eltham map 1870.jpg|Map 2.

Eltham in 2014 Source Open Street Map\n</gallery>\n\nAfter World War I the building of housing estates continued unabated. By the beginning of World War II, four large estates were in existence: the [[Progress Estate]] (1915),  the Page Estate (1923), [[Middle Park, London|Middle Park]] (1931\u201336), and Horn Park (begun 1936, completed 1950s). The latter two were built on Eltham Palace's former hunting parks. [[Coldharbour Estate]] was built in 1947. The small council estates of Pippenhall and Strongbow Crescent were completed about 1960. Since that time new house building has been limited to small private \"infill developments\" and replacements for demolished properties.\n\nEltham residents occupy a housing stock of mixed age, particularly towards Eltham Park and the multiple streets with 'Glen' in their names. There are some fine houses scattered around Eltham. At least two roads, North Park and Court Road, contain million pound homes, and some of the older Victorian buildings have been subdivided into apartments.\n\nA [[Micropub]], The Long Pond, was opened in December 2014 - the first pub in Eltham Park for at least 115 years as Archibald Cameron Corbett would not give permission for pubs and put a restrictive covenant on the land. However, since the [[Licensing Act 2003]] was implemented in 2005, Premise Licences are now granted by the local authority ([[Greenwich London Borough Council]]) instead of magistrates, as long as the applicant satisfies the council and the \"responsible authorities\" (such as Police, Environmental Health, Fire Service) that they will uphold the four licensing objectives (prevention of crime and disorder; public safety; prevention of public nuisance, protection of children from harm), then a licence will be granted. Several licensed premises in Eltham Park now offer \"Off Sales\".\n\n'''Domestic Architecture''' \n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Eltham houses 1.jpg|The Lord Chancellor's Lodging. c1420\nFile:Eltham houses 11.jpg|Clapboard cottage. c1750\nFile:Eltham houses 12.jpg|Pair of cottages. c1800\nFile:Eltham houses 13.jpg|Villas. c1880\nFile:Eltham houses 14.jpg|Terrace houses. c1880\nFile:Eltham houses 2.jpg|\"Corbett Houses\" Eltham Park c1905\nFile:Eltham houses 3.jpg|\"Corbett Houses\" Well Hall c 1905\nFile:Eltham houses 4.jpg|[[Progress Estate]].

Eltham: contours and water courses]]\nEltham has a varied [[topography]]. Map 6 shows contours, spot heights and water courses. The centre of Eltham is on a plateau at about the 60m level with the High Street running along its centre.  There is a scarp slope to the west of the plateau from the top of which are unrestricted views across [[South London]]. [[Eltham Palace]] occupies a commanding position on the edge of the scarp. Eltham Hill offers the steepest descent from the plateau, starting at Eltham High Street and descending 30m over 1&nbsp;km due west at the ''Yorkshire Grey'' (now a [[McDonald's]] outlet). The land to the north of Eltham rises to form the southern slope of [[Shooter's Hill]], one of the [[List of highest points in London|highest points in London]] at a height of 130m. The recently (2014) restored 18th century [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] [[Severndroog Castle]] offers wide views from its observation platform which is 150m above sea level.\n\nFrom Eltham Church at 60m the High Street rises gently to 71m and continues east as Bexley Road at a slightly lower level.\n\nTo the south the plateau slopes gently downwards to [[Mottingham]] (at 49.6m) and [[New Eltham]] (at 46.1m)\n\nEltham is devoid of any major water features, although the [[River Thames]] is approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|1}} away from Eltham's northern limits. The most prominent body of water is the [[River Quaggy]] which runs to the south-west of Eltham and joins the [[River Ravensbourne]] at Lewisham. The Quaggy receives additional water from Mottingham Tarn and feeds the wetlands in Sutclife Park. The only other significant watercourse is the [[River Shuttle]], which rises in Avery Hill Park and flows east to join the [[River Cray]].\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|title = '''Destinations from Eltham'''\n|Northwest = [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]\n|North     = [[Shooters Hill]]\n|Northeast = [[Falconwood]]\n|West      = [[Kidbrooke]]\n|Centre    = Eltham\n|East      = [[Avery Hill]]\n|Southwest = [[Lee, London|Lee]] \n|South     = [[Mottingham]] \n|Southeast = [[New Eltham]]\n}}\n\nOther Nearby Areas\n{{Div col|colwidth=10em}}\n*[[Blackfen]] \n*[[Catford]] \n*[[Charlton, London|Charlton]] \n*[[Chislehurst]] \n*[[Downham]]\n*[[Hither Green]]\n*[[Greenwich]]  \n*[[Grove Park, Lewisham|Grove Park]] \n*[[Lewisham]] \n*[[Plumstead]] \n*[[Sidcup]] \n*[[Welling]] \n*[[Woolwich]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Parks and open spaces===\n[[File:Eltham greenchain.jpg|right|thumbnail|Green Chain Walks in and through Eltham]]\nThere is a large variety of open green space in Eltham, in the form of parkland, fields and woodland.\n\"[[Green Chain Walk]]s\" are signposted footpaths that run through or link the green spaces. Some are also bridleways or cycle routes.\n\n*''[[Avery Hill]] Park'' is large, open parkland, to the east. It is most notable for its Winter Garden, a [[Greenhouse|hothouse]] containing tropical trees and plants from around the world. The parkland was acquired by the [[London County Council]] in 1902.\n*''Oxleas Woods, Castle Wood and Jack Wood'', directly north of Eltham, is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. Oxleas Wood covers {{convert|190.3|acre|km2|1}} and is at least 8,000&nbsp;years old. The wood is home to specimen of tree including oak, silver birch, hornbeam and coppice hazel. [[Severndroog Castle]], built in 1784 as a memorial to William James of the East India Company, stands in Castle Wood.\n*''Sutcliffe Park'' is a {{convert|35|acre|km2|1}} park at the westernmost point of Eltham. Previously known as Harrow Meadow, the parkland was reclaimed from the [[River Quaggy]] in the 1930s. The Quaggy was diverted into [[culvert]]s, and the park officially opened in 1937 as Sutcliffe Park, named after the Borough's engineer. On 26 June 1954, the athletics track in Sutcliffe Park was opened, and has since been home to the Cambridge Harriers. In 2003, the park was re-landscaped as a wetland area. The River Quaggy was allowed to flow above-ground in the area, for the first time in 70&nbsp;years. The park borders the [[Ferrier Estate]], which was completed in 1970 and demolished by 2012 to make way for \"Kidbrooke Village\". \n*The ''Royal Blackheath Golf Course''<ref>Web site at ://http://www.royalblackheath.com/home</ref> and the adjoining ''Tarn'' date back to [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times. The golf club, founded in 1766 to the north in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and to the south since its merger with Eltham Golf club in 1923, is the oldest golf club in the world outside Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalblackheath.com/index.lasso?pg=ec7e88a710c7a8e9&mp=cbc638823c5eb85e |title=Our History : Royal Blackheath Golf Club \u2013 The Oldest Golf Club in the world |publisher=Royalblackheath.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The club house Eltham Lodge<ref>Eltham Lodge was built in 1664 to the design of Hugh May for John Shaw, banker to King Charles.

Thus it is both 'suburban' and 'urban', and it forms part of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]], an [[Inner London]] borough.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eltham senine.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cover of SEnine magazine March 2013 showing the refurbished Eltham town sign provided by the Eltham Society]] -->\n\nThe town centre supports a loyal core of shoppers, diners, and drinkers, but the nightlife is modest. In recent years there has been great effort by local town centre businesses and other important Eltham stakeholders, to drive business, community and tourism improvements, that will help sustain the town centre. These efforts have resulted in the formation of an Eltham town centre partnership (ETCP), chaired by an elected local stakeholder. Greenwich council have member and officer representatives and the University of Greenwich whose Avery Hill Campus borders the Town Centre is also represented. The ETCP have encouraged the development of A new town centre commerce Association \u2013 The Association of Commerce for Eltham (ACE). ACE has established a new Town Centre web portal,<ref>ACE web site:  www.elthamse9.uk</ref> which, as well as providing a basic business directory also provides mechanisms for encouraging interaction between business and community groups. The ETCP is currently trying to encourage the University of Greenwich, to undertake research projects into business and community development, based on Eltham town centre.\n\nIn 2007, the new Eltham Centre opened just off the High Street including council offices and a new swimming pool and incorporating the early 20th century library.\n\nThe Eltham Society was founded in 1965 with the aim of \"Preserving the past, Conserving the present, and Protecting the future\".

Trains through Eltham terminate at [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]], [[Cannon Street railway station|London Cannon Street]] or [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] in a westerly direction, and [[Crayford railway station|Crayford]], [[Dartford railway station|Dartford]], [[Slade Green railway station|Slade Green]], [[Gravesend railway station|Gravesend]], [[Gillingham railway station (Kent)|Gillingham]] or [[Rochester railway station|Rochester]] in an easterly direction. Given the lack of London Underground access, the two suburban rail lines work at, or above, their capacity during peak-hour commuting to central London. Fast trains take as little as 20 minutes to get to London Charing Cross.\n\n'''Bexleyheath line'''\n\nOriginally opened on 1 May 1895 by a private company, the Bexleyheath Line was taken over by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] after it suffered bankruptcy. There were originally two stations in Eltham: Eltham Well Hall and Eltham Park. Eltham Well Hall station opened in 1895. Eltham Park station opened (after a prolonged legal wrangle) on 1 July 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/e/eltham_park/index.shtml|title=Disused Stations: Eltham Park Station}}</ref> On 11 June 1972, a [[Eltham Well Hall rail crash|London-bound train came off the track]] at Well Hall, killing 6 and injuring 126. Both Eltham stations were closed in 1985 and replaced by a new \u2018[[Eltham railway station|Eltham]]\u2019 station; this coincided with the construction of the Rochester Way Relief Road part of which was built on the site of Eltham Well Hall station. Glenlea Road between Well Hall Road and Archery Road was replaced by the station forecourt and a bus station (this had previously been adjacent to Well Hall station). The new rail station was built above the new road at the point it travels through what is sometimes referred to as 'the Eltham tunnel'. The new station has a modernist feel.<ref>http://www.yellins.co.uk/transporthistory/rail/bex.html picture</ref>\n\n'''Dartford Loop'''\n\nThe Dartford Loop line, about {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} south of Eltham High Street, was opened by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] on 1 September 1866. It is commonly known by locals as the '[[Dartford]] line via [[Sidcup]]'. There are two stations on this line that serve the population living to the south of Eltham: [[Mottingham railway station|Mottingham station]], originally named 'Eltham Station' until 'Eltham Well Hall' opened, and [[New Eltham railway station|New Eltham station]]. Neither station is as large as Eltham station, but both have been heavily upgraded since opening.\n\n===Roads===\nEltham High Street lies on the A210, the original [[A20 road (England)|A20]] London to [[Maidstone]] road. But the A20 has now been diverted southwards, passing through Mottingham, and it is a [[dual carriageway]] that connects to the [[M20 motorway|M20]] motorway in Kent. Similarly, to the north, the dual carriageway A2 has replaced the Rochester Road section, which was always very congested (the old road had dangerous readings of lead pollution, close to schools, before the advent of lead-free petrol).\n\nThe upgrading of these two arterial routes in and out of London means that Eltham is handily positioned between the A20 and A2. Driving on either of these roads into London soon results in congestion, although the A2 does connect through to the [[Blackwall Tunnel]] under the [[Thames]], and thus into east London, all on dual carriageway. Driving eastwards allows access to the [[Dartford Tunnel]], and the [[Kent]] countryside, in as little as 20 minutes in off-peak hours.\n\nCrossing the two from north to the south is the [[A205 road|A205 South Circular road]], a busy arterial route.\n\nThe back streets of Eltham have been largely traffic-calmed by the local Council, but there are chronic rat-runs<ref>The Guardian, Saturday 22 November 2008, Let's Move to Eltham</ref> as many of the measures are ineffective or insufficient. Provision for cyclists is modest, while there are some interesting footpaths along ancient rights of way, for example in Oxleas Wood and Avery Hill Park.\n\n===Buses===\nScheduled coaches, marketed as part of the [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] network, link Eltham Green to [[Pimlico]] and [[Victoria Coach Station|Victoria]] in central London and to several destinations on the Kent coast via [[Bluewater (shopping centre)|Bluewater]] (a retail-based development on a grand scale in Dartford borough) and [[Canterbury]]. Eltham Green is one of the few places in south London served by National Express coaches.\n\nEltham is served by [[Transport for London]] bus routes 122, 124, 126, 132, 160, 161, 162, 233, 286, 314, 321, B15 and B16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/eltham-high-street-a4.pdf |title=Buses from Eltham High Street |work=Transport for London |date=23 November 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/eltham-station-eltham-church-a4.pdf |title=Buses from Eltham Station (Eltham Church) |work=Transport for London |date=23 November 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> These routes connect Eltham to [[Beckenham]], [[Bexleyheath]], [[Bromley]], [[Catford]], [[Chinbrook]], [[Chislehurst]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Foots Cray]], [[Greenwich]], [[Grove Park, Lewisham|Grove Park]], [[Horn Park]], [[Kidbrooke]], [[Lee, London|Lee]], [[Lewisham]], [[Middle Park, London|Middle Park]], [[New Addington]], [[New Cross]], [[Greenwich Peninsula|North Greenwich]], [[Plumstead]], [[Ruxley]], [[Sidcup]], [[Swanley]] and [[Well Hall]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{sources|section|date=April 2018}}\n*[[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] \u2013 Internationally renowned [[watchmaker]], lived in ''Well Hall House''.\n*[[John Ayldon]] \u2013 An operatic [[bass-baritone]] and former member of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].\n*[[Hubert Bland]] \u2013 Socialist and co-founder of the [[Fabian Society]].

Reddy was accused of completely rigging iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. [[Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation]] officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a one-dollar company in Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which served as the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a \"Zero-Risk system\" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the \"Republic of Bellary\" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-the-republic-of-bellary-a-ministers/825181/|title=In the 'Republic of Bellary', a minister's 'muscle power'|date=1 August 2011|work=The Indian Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/karnataka/article2302226.ece|title=Report details Reddys' rule over 'Republic of Bellary'|date=28 July 2011|work=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n=== Bribery ===\nThe CBI is investigating the alleged bribing of the [[Hyderabad]] Special Court judge T.

Reddy was accused of completely rigging iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. [[Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation]] officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a one-dollar company in Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which served as the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a \"Zero-Risk system\" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the \"Republic of Bellary\" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-the-republic-of-bellary-a-ministers/825181/|title=In the 'Republic of Bellary', a minister's 'muscle power'|date=1 August 2011|work=The Indian Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/karnataka/article2302226.ece|title=Report details Reddys' rule over 'Republic of Bellary'|date=28 July 2011|work=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n=== Bribery ===\nThe CBI is investigating the alleged bribing of the [[Hyderabad]] Special Court judge T.

It was founded as {{Nihongo|'''Kyoto Ceramic Company, Limited'''|\u4eac\u90fd\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Ky\u014dto Seramikku Kabushiki-gaisha}} in 1959 by [[Kazuo Inamori]] and renamed in 1982. The company has diversified its founding technology in ceramic materials through internal development as well as strategic [[mergers and acquisitions]]. It manufactures industrial ceramics, solar power generating systems, telecommunications equipment, office document imaging equipment, electronic components, semiconductor packages, cutting tools, and components for medical, dental, breast and face implant systems.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins to 2000===\nKyocera's original product was a ceramic insulator known as a \"kelcima\" for use in television picture tubes. The company quickly adapted its technologies to produce an expanding range of ceramic components for electronic and structural applications.  In the 1960s, as the NASA space program, the birth of Silicon Valley and the advancement of computer technology created demand for semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs), Kyocera developed ceramic semiconductor packages that remain among its core product lines today.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Kyocera began expanding its material technologies to produce a diverse range of applied ceramic products, including solar photovoltaic modules; biocompatible tooth- and joint-replacement systems; industrial cutting tools; consumer ceramics, such as ceramic-bladed kitchen knives and ceramic-tipped ballpoint pens; and lab-grown gemstones, including rubies, emeralds, sapphires, opals, alexandrites and [[padparadscha]]hs.\n\nThe company acquired electronic equipment manufacturing and radio communication technologies in 1979 through an investment in Cybernet Electronics Corporation, which was merged into Kyocera in 1982.  Shortly afterward, Kyocera introduced one of the first portable, battery-powered laptop computers, sold in the U.S. as the [[TRS-80 Model 100|Tandy Model 100]], which featured an LCD screen and telephone-modem data transfer capability.\n\nKyocera gained optical technologies by acquiring [[Yashica]] Company, Limited in 1983, along with Yashica's prior licensing agreement with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]], and manufactured film and digital cameras under the Kyocera, Yashica and [[Contax]] trade names until 2005, when the company discontinued all film and digital camera production.\n\nIn the 1980s, Kyocera marketed audio components, such as [[CD players]], [[Receiver (home stereo)|receivers]], [[phonograph|turntables]], and [[cassette deck]]s.  These featured unique elements, including Kyocera ceramic-based platforms, and are sought by collectors to the present day.  At one time, Kyocera owned the famous [[KLH (company)|KLH]] brand founded by [[Henry Kloss]], though Kloss and the original [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] design and engineering staff had left the company by the time of the Kyocera purchase.  In 1989, Kyocera stopped production of audio components and sought a buyer for the KLH brand.\n\nIn 1989, Kyocera acquired Elco Corporation, a manufacturer of electronic connectors. In 1990, Kyocera\u2019s global operations expanded significantly with the addition of [[AVX Corporation]], a global manufacturer of passive electronic components, such as ceramic chip capacitors, filters and voltage suppressors.\n\nExpanding sales of photovoltaic solar energy products led the company to create Kyocera Solar Corporation in Japan in 1996, and Kyocera Solar, Inc. in the U.S. in 1999.\n\nOn Aug 4, 1999, Kyocera completed its merger with solar energy systems integrator Golden Genesis Company (Nasdaq:GGGO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Kyocera+Completes+Merger+With+Golden+Genesis+Company.-a055341505|title=Kyocera Completes Merger With Golden Genesis Company}}</ref>\n\n===2000 to present===\nIn January 2000, Kyocera acquired photocopier manufacturer Mita Industrial Company, Limited, and created Kyocera Mita Corporation (now Kyocera Document Solutions Corporation), headquartered in Osaka, Japan, with subsidiaries in more than 25 nations.\n\nAlso in 2000, Kyocera acquired the mobile phone manufacturing operations of Qualcomm Incorporated to form Kyocera Wireless Corp. In 2003, Kyocera Wireless Corp. established Kyocera Wireless India (KWI), a mobile phone subsidiary in Bangalore. KWI has established alliances with several leading players providing CDMA services in India.
