He began offering his water at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became known as Frazier's Station. A test done on a second fresh-water well discovered the water to be chemically similar to that found in some of the most renowned spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in the [[Bohemia]]n town of Karlsbad (now [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Czech Republic]]).<ref>[http://www.carlsbadca.gov/about/history/Pages/default.aspx#layout-tab-2 City of Carlsbad - History of Carlsbad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106010142/http://www.carlsbadca.gov/about/history/Pages/default.aspx#layout-tab-2 |date=November 6, 2012 }}, retrieved March 1, 2012.</ref>\n\nTo take advantage of the find, the Carlsbad Land and Mineral Water Company was formed by a German-born merchant from the Midwest named Gerhard Schutte together with Samuel Church Smith, D.

The area experienced a period of growth, with homes and businesses sprouting up in the 1880s. Agricultural development of [[citrus]] fruits, [[avocados]] and [[olives]] soon changed the landscape.

He began offering his water at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became known as Frazier's Station. A test done on a second fresh-water well discovered the water to be chemically similar to that found in some of the most renowned spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in the [[Bohemia]]n town of Karlsbad (now [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Czech Republic]]).<ref>[http://www.carlsbadca.gov/about/history/Pages/default.aspx#layout-tab-2 City of Carlsbad - History of Carlsbad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106010142/http://www.carlsbadca.gov/about/history/Pages/default.aspx#layout-tab-2 |date=November 6, 2012 }}, retrieved March 1, 2012.</ref>\n\nTo take advantage of the find, the Carlsbad Land and Mineral Water Company was formed by a German-born merchant from the Midwest named Gerhard Schutte together with Samuel Church Smith, D.

The area experienced a period of growth, with homes and businesses sprouting up in the 1880s. Agricultural development of [[citrus]] fruits, [[avocados]] and [[olives]] soon changed the landscape.
