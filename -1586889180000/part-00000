The sinking claimed 1,198 lives, 128 of them American civilians, and the attack of this unarmed civilian ship deeply shocked the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. According to the ship's manifest, ''Lusitania'' was carrying military cargo, though none of this information was relayed to the citizens of Britain and the United States who thought that the ship contained no ammunition or military weaponry whatsoever and it was an act of brutal murder. Munitions that it carried were thousands of crates full of ammunition for rifles, 3-inch artillery shells, and also various other standard ammunition used by infantry. The sinking of the ''Lusitania'' was widely used as propaganda against the German Empire and caused greater support for the war effort. A widespread reaction in the U.S was not seen until the attack on the ferry {{SS|Sussex}} which carried many citizens of the United States of America.\n\nThe initial U.S. response was to threaten to sever [[diplomatic ties]], which persuaded the Germans to issue the [[Sussex pledge]] that reimposed restrictions on U-boat activity. The U.S. reiterated its objections to German submarine warfare whenever U.S. civilians died as a result of German attacks, which prompted the Germans to fully reapply prize rules. This, however, removed the effectiveness of the U-boat fleet, and the Germans consequently sought a decisive surface action, a strategy that culminated in the [[Battle of Jutland]].\n\nAlthough the Germans claimed victory at Jutland, the [[British Grand Fleet]] remained in control at sea. It was necessary to return to effective anticommerce warfare by U-boats. Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], Commander in Chief of the [[High Seas Fleet]], pressed for all-out U-boat war, convinced that a high rate of shipping losses would force Britain to seek an early peace before the United States could react effectively.\n\n[[File:Willy St\u00f6wer - Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool.jpg|thumb|''Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool'' by {{SMU|U-21|Germany|6}} ([[Willy St\u00f6wer]])]]\nThe renewed German campaign was effective, sinking 1.4&nbsp;million tons of shipping between October 1916 and January 1917. Despite this, the political situation demanded even greater pressure, and on 31 January 1917, Germany announced that its U-boats would engage in [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] beginning 1 February. On 17 March, German submarines sank three American merchant vessels, and the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917.\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 was initially very successful, sinking a major part of Britain-bound shipping. With the introduction of escorted convoys, shipping losses declined and in the end the German strategy failed to destroy sufficient Allied shipping. An armistice became effective on 11 November 1918. Of the surviving German submarines 14 U-boats were scuttled and 122 surrendered.<ref name=Clodfelter>{{cite book|author=Micheal Clodfelter|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492\u20132015|edition=4th|publisher=McFarland|date=2017|p=428}}</ref>\n\nOf the 373 German submarines that had been built, 178 were lost by enemy action.

Before the start of World War II, Germany started building U-boats and training crews, labeling these activities as \"research\" or concealing them using other covers. When this became known, the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] limited Germany to parity with Britain in submarines.

Cross-Atlantic trade in war supplies and food was extensive and critical for Britain's survival. The continuous action surrounding British shipping became known as the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], as the British developed technical defences such as [[ASDIC]] and [[radar]], and the German U-boats responded by hunting in what were called \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]]\" where multiple submarines would stay close together, making it easier for them to sink a specific target. Britain's vulnerable shipping situation existed until 1942, when the tides changed as the U.S. merchant marine and Navy entered the war, drastically increasing the amount of tonnage of supplies sent across the Atlantic. The combination of increased tonnage and increased naval protection of shipping convoys made it much more difficult for U-boats to make a significant dent in British shipping. Once the United States entered the war, U-boats ranged from the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and from the [[Arctic]] to the west and southern African coasts and even as far east as [[Penang]]. The [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] engaged in various tactics against German incursions in the [[Americas]]; these included military surveillance of foreign nations in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean, to deter any local governments from supplying German U-boats.\n\nBecause speed and range were severely limited underwater while running on battery power, U-boats were required to spend most of their time surfaced running on diesel engines, diving only when attacked or for rare daytime torpedo strikes. The more ship-like hull design reflects the fact that these were primarily surface vessels that could submerge when necessary. This contrasts with the cylindrical profile of modern [[nuclear submarine]]s, which are more hydrodynamic underwater (where they spend the majority of their time), but less stable on the surface. While U-boats were faster on the surface than submerged, the opposite is generally true of modern submarines. The most common [[submarine warfare|U-boat attack]] during the early years of the war was conducted on the surface and at night. This period, before the Allied forces developed truly effective antisubmarine warfare <!-- (ASW) --> tactics, which included convoys, was referred to by German submariners as \"''die gl\u00fcckliche Zeit''\" or the [[First Happy Time]].<ref name=\"milHisOnline\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/atlantic/uboatwar.aspx|title=Military History Online|website=www.militaryhistoryonline.com|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n[[File:u534.jpg|thumb|[[German submarine U-534|''U-534'']], Birkenhead Docks, Merseyside, England]]\n\n===Torpedoes===\nThe U-boats' main weapon was the [[torpedo]], though [[sea mine|mine]]s and [[deck gun]]s (while surfaced) were also used. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships; 2,825 merchant ships) were sunk by U-boat torpedoes.<ref name=\"Tread\">{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They were fitted with one of two types of pistol triggers: impact, which detonated the warhead upon contact with a solid object, and [[Magnetic pistol|magnetic]], which detonated upon sensing a change in the magnetic field within a few meters.\n\nOne of the most effective uses of magnetic pistols would be to set the torpedo's depth to just beneath the keel of the target. The explosion under the target's keel would create a [[detonation]] [[shock wave]], which could cause a ship's hull to rupture under the concussive water pressure. In this way, even large or heavily armored ships could be sunk or disabled with a single, well-placed hit.\n\nInitially the depth-keeping equipment and magnetic and contact exploders were notoriously unreliable.  During the first eight months of the war torpedoes often ran at an improper depth, detonated prematurely, or failed to explode altogether\u2014sometimes bouncing harmlessly off the hull of the target ship. This was most evident in [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway, where various skilled U-boat commanders failed to inflict damage on British transports and warships because of faulty torpedoes. The faults were largely due to a lack of testing. The magnetic detonator was sensitive to mechanical oscillations during the torpedo run, and to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field at high latitudes. These early magnetic detonators were eventually phased out, and the depth-keeping problem was solved by early 1942 with improved technology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Karl D\u00f6nitz|title=Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days|publisher=Naval Institute Press|page=482|isbn=0-87021-780-1}}</ref>{{explain|date=January 2019}}\n\nLater in the war, Germany developed an acoustic homing torpedo, the [[G7e torpedo|G7/T5]]. It was primarily designed to combat convoy escorts. The acoustic torpedo was designed to run straight to an arming distance of 400 m and then turn toward the loudest noise detected. This sometimes ended up being the U-boat itself; at least two submarines may have been sunk by their own homing torpedoes. Additionally, these torpedoes were found to be only effective against ships moving at greater than {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}. The Allies countered acoustic torpedoes with noisemaker decoys such as ''[[Foxer]]'', ''FXR'', ''CAT'' and [[Fanfare (decoy)|''Fanfare'']]. The Germans, in turn, countered this by introducing newer and upgraded versions of the acoustic torpedoes, like the late-war [[G7es torpedo|G7es]], and the [[T11 torpedo|T11]]. However, the T11 did not see active service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/technical/torpedoes.htm|title=The Torpedoes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nU-boats also adopted several types of \"pattern-running\" torpedoes that ran straight out to a preset distance, then traveled in either a circular or ladder-like pattern. When fired at a convoy, this increased the probability of a hit if the weapon missed its primary target.\n\n===U-boat developments===\nDuring World War II, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' produced many different types of U-boats as technology evolved. Most notable is the Type VII, known as the \"workhorse\" of the fleet, which was by far the most-produced type, and the Type IX boats, an enlarged VII designed for long-range patrols, some traveling as far as Japan and the east coast of the United States.\n\n[[File:U-boot by Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg|thumb|upright|Oil painting of a [[Kriegsmarine]] U-boat, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]]]\n\nWith the increasing sophistication of Allied detection and subsequent losses, German designers began to fully realise the potential for a truly submerged boat. The [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] \"''Elektroboot''\" was designed to favor submerged performance, both for combat effectiveness and survival. It was the first true submersible. The Type XXI featured an evolutionary design that combined several different strands of the U-boat development program, most notably from the Walter U-boats, the [[German Type XVIIB submarine|Type XVII]], which featured an unsuccessful yet revolutionary [[hydrogen peroxide]] [[air-independent propulsion|air-independent]] [[hydrogen peroxide#Propellant|propellant]] system. These boats featured a streamlined hull design, which formed the basis of the later {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}} nuclear submarine, and was adapted for use with more conventional propulsion systems. The larger hull design allowed for a greatly increased battery capacity, which enabled the XXI to cruise submerged for longer periods and reach unprecedented submerged speeds for the time. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today.\n\nThroughout the war, an [[arms race]] evolved between the Allies and the ''Kriegsmarine'', especially in detection and counterdetection. [[Sonar]] (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) beyond visual range, but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in [[radar]] became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, as well as more anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to [[Radar in World War II#Centimetric|centimetric radar]] (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''Schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The ''Schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''Schnorchel'' also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''Schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.\n\nSeveral other pioneering innovations included acoustic- and electro-absorbent coatings to make them less of an ASDIC or RADAR target. The Germans also developed active countermeasures such as facilities to release artificial chemical bubble-making decoys, known as ''[[Bold (decoy)|Bold]]'', after the mythical [[kobold]].\n\n===Classes===\n* [[German Type I submarine|Type I]]: first prototypes\n* [[German Type II submarine|Type II]]: small submarines used for training purposes\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type V]]: uncompleted experimental midget submarines\n* [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]]: the \"workhorse\" of the U-boats with 709 completed in World War II<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stern |first1=Robert Cecil |title=Type VII U-boats |date=1991 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=1-55750-828-3 |page=155 |edition=First U.S. & Canada |url=https://uboat.net/books/item/378 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n* [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX]]: these long-range U-boats operated as far as the Indian Ocean with the Japanese ([[Monsun Gruppe]]), and the [[South Atlantic]]\n* [[German Type X submarine|Type X]]: long-range minelayers and cargo transports\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type XI]]: uncompleted experimental artillery boats\n* [[German Type XIV submarine|Type XIV]]: used to resupply other U-boats; nicknamed the ''Milchkuh'' (\"Milk Cow\")\n* [[German Type XVII submarine|Type XVII]]: small coastal submarines powered by experimental hydrogen peroxide propulsion systems\n* [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]]: known as the ''Elektroboot''; first subs to operate primarily submerged\n* [[German Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]]: smaller version of the XXI used for coastal operations \n* [[Midget submarine]]s, including [[Biber (submarine)|''Biber'']], [[Hai (midget submarine)|''Hai'']], ''[[Molch]]'', and ''[[Seehund]]''\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects]]\n\n===Countermeasures===\n{{Main|Anti-submarine warfare}}\n[[File:Uboat sinking survivors.png|right|thumb|Survivors from {{GS|U-175}} after being sunk by {{USCGC|Spencer|WPG-36|6}}, 17 April 1943]]\nAdvances in convoy tactics, high-frequency direction finding (referred to as \"[[Huff-Duff]]\"), radar, active [[sonar]] (called ASDIC in Britain), [[depth charge]]s, ASW spigot mortars (also known as [[Hedgehog (weapon)|\"hedgehog\"]]), the intermittent cracking of the German Naval [[Enigma code]], the introduction of the [[Leigh light]], the range of escort aircraft (especially with the use of [[escort carrier]]s), the use of [[Q-ship|mystery ships]], and the full entry of the U.S. into the war with its enormous shipbuilding capacity, all turned the tide against the U-boats. In the end, the U-boat fleet suffered extremely heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners (a 75% casualty rate, the highest of all German forces during the war).\n\nAt the same time, the Allies targeted the U-boat shipyards and their bases with [[strategic bombing]].\n\n===Enigma machine===\n{{Main|Enigma machine}}\nThe British had a major advantage in their ability to read some German naval Enigma codes. An understanding of the German coding methods had been brought to Britain via France from [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Polish breakthrough|Polish code-breakers]]. Thereafter, code books and equipment were captured by raids on German weather ships and from captured U-boats. A team including [[Alan Turing]] used special purpose \"[[Bombe]]s\" and early [[computer]]s to break new German codes as they were introduced. The speedy decoding of messages was vital in directing convoys away from wolf packs and allowing interception and destruction of U-boats. This was demonstrated when the Naval Enigma machines were altered in February 1942 and wolf-pack effectiveness greatly increased until the new code was broken.\n\nThe {{GS|U-110|1940|6}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXB]], was captured in 1941 by the [[Royal Navy]], and its Enigma machine and documents were removed. {{GS|U-559|3=2}} was also captured by the British in October 1942; three sailors boarded her as she was sinking, and desperately threw all the code books out of the submarine so as to salvage them. Two of them, Able Seaman [[Colin Grazier]] and Lieutenant [[Francis Anthony Blair Fasson]], continued to throw code books out of the ship as it went under water, and went down with it. Further code books were captured by raids on weather ships. {{GS|U-744|3=2}} was boarded by crew from the Canadian ship {{HMCS|Chilliwack|K131|6}} on 6 March 1944, and codes were taken from her, but by this time in the war, most of the information was known.<ref>Helgason, Gudmundur \"Captured U Boats\" UBoat.Net http://uboat.net/fates/captured.htm</ref> The {{GS|U-505|3=2}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXC]], was captured by the [[United States Navy]] in June 1944. It is now a [[museum ship]] in Chicago at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].\n\n===Battle of Bell Island===\n{{Main|Battle of the St. Lawrence}}\nTwo events in the battle took place in 1942 when German U-boats attacked four allied [[ore]] carriers at [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The [[Cargo ship|carriers]] {{SS|Saganaga}} and {{SS|Lord Strathcona}} were sunk by {{GS|U-513|3=2}} on 5 September 1942, while the {{SS|Rosecastle}} and ''PLM 27'' were sunk by {{GS|U-518|3=2}} on 2 November with the loss of 69 lives. When the submarine launched a torpedo at the loading pier, [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]] became the only location in North America to be subject to direct attack by German forces in World War II.\n\n===Operation Deadlight===\n{{Main|Operation Deadlight}}\n\"Operation Deadlight\" was the code name for the scuttling of U-boats surrendered to the Allies after the defeat of Germany near the end of the war. Of the 154 U-boats surrendered, 121 were scuttled in deep water off [[Londonderry Port|Lisahally]], Northern Ireland, or [[Loch Ryan]], Scotland, in late 1945 and early 1946.\n\n==Memorial==\n[[M\u00f6ltenort U-Boat Memorial]]\n\n==Post\u2013World War II and Cold War (after 1945)==\n[[File:U15 Kieler Woche 2007 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''U-15'', a [[Type 206 submarine]], of the [[German Navy]] at the [[Kiel Week]] 2007]]\nFrom 1955, the West German ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was allowed to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired. In the 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) re-entered the submarine business. Because West Germany was initially restricted to a 450 tonne displacement limit, the ''Bundesmarine'' focused on small [[coastal submarine]]s to protect against the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Russia]]n) threat in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The Germans sought to use advanced technologies to offset the small displacement, such as [[ferromagnetism|amagnetic]] [[steel]] to protect against [[naval mine]]s and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s.\n\nThe initial [[Type 201 submarine|Type 201]] was a failure because of hull cracking; the subsequent [[Type 205 submarine|Type 205]], first commissioned in 1967, was a success, and 12 were built for the German navy. To continue the U-boat tradition, the new boats received the classic '''U''' designation starting with the ''U-1''.\n\nWith the [[Denmark|Danish]] government's purchase of two Type 205 boats, the West German government realized the potential for the submarine as an export, developing a customized version [[Kobben-class submarine|Type 207]]. Small and agile submarines were built during the Cold War to operate in the shallow Baltic Sea and attack Warsaw Pact resulting in the [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]]. Three of the improved [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]] boats were later sold to the [[Israeli Navy]], becoming the [[Gal class submarine|Type 540]]. The German [[Type 209 submarine|Type 209]] diesel-electric submarine was the most popular export-sales submarine in the world from the late 1960s into the first years of the 21st century. With a larger 1,000\u20131,500 tonne displacement, the class was very customizable and has seen service with 14 navies with 51 examples being built as of 2006. Germany would continue to reap successes with derivations or on the basis of the successful type 209, as are the [[Dolphin-class submarine|Type 800]] sold to [[Israel]] and the [[TR-1700-class submarine|TR-1700]] sold to [[Argentine]].\n\nGermany would continue to succeed as an exporter of submarines as the [[Ula-class submarine|Klasse 210]] sold to [[Norway]], considered the most silent and maneuverable submarines in the world. This would demonstrate its capacity and put its export seal on the world.\n\n[[File:U Boot 212 HDW 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Type 212 submarine]] with air-independent propulsion of the [[German Navy]] in dock at [[Howaldtswerke|HDW]]/[[Kiel]]]]\nGermany has brought the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new [[Type 212 submarine|Type 212]].

While the German term refers to any [[submarine]], the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to [[Submarine#Military|military submarine]]s operated by Germany, particularly in the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role ([[commerce raiding]]) and enforcing a naval [[blockade]] against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the [[British Empire]], and from the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean. German submarines also destroyed Brazilian merchant ships during World War II, causing Brazil to declare war on both Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942.\n\n[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] submarines were also known as U-boats.\n\n==Early U-boats (1850\u20131914)==\nThe first submarine built in Germany, the three-man ''[[Brandtaucher]]'', sank to the bottom of [[Kiel]] harbor on 1 February 1851 during a test dive.<ref>Showell, p. 23</ref><ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1 = Chaffin\n| first1 = Tom\n| title = The H.

At the start of World War I in 1914, Germany had 48 submarines of 13 classes in service or under construction. During that war the Imperial German Navy used ''SM U-1'' for training.

Under the instructions given to U-boat captains, they could sink merchant ships, even potentially neutral ones, without warning.\n\nIn February 1915, a submarine ''U-6'' (''Lepsius'') was rammed and both periscopes were destroyed off [[Beachy Head]] by the collier ''SS Thordis'' commanded by Captain John Bell RNR after firing a torpedo.<ref name=Haley>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/britain-at-war/10134954/Story-of-Captains-courage-resurfaces-after-98-years.html|title=Story of Captain's courage resurfaces after 98 years|work=Daily Telegraph|author=Haley Dixon|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>  \nOn 7 May 1915, {{SMU|U-20|Germany|6}} sank the liner [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']]. The sinking claimed 1,198 lives, 128 of them American civilians, and the attack of this unarmed civilian ship deeply shocked the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. According to the ship's manifest, ''Lusitania'' was carrying military cargo, though none of this information was relayed to the citizens of Britain and the United States who thought that the ship contained no ammunition or military weaponry whatsoever and it was an act of brutal murder. Munitions that it carried were thousands of crates full of ammunition for rifles, 3-inch artillery shells, and also various other standard ammunition used by infantry. The sinking of the ''Lusitania'' was widely used as propaganda against the German Empire and caused greater support for the war effort. A widespread reaction in the U.S was not seen until the attack on the ferry {{SS|Sussex}} which carried many citizens of the United States of America.\n\nThe initial U.S. response was to threaten to sever [[diplomatic ties]], which persuaded the Germans to issue the [[Sussex pledge]] that reimposed restrictions on U-boat activity. The U.S. reiterated its objections to German submarine warfare whenever U.S. civilians died as a result of German attacks, which prompted the Germans to fully reapply prize rules. This, however, removed the effectiveness of the U-boat fleet, and the Germans consequently sought a decisive surface action, a strategy that culminated in the [[Battle of Jutland]].\n\nAlthough the Germans claimed victory at Jutland, the [[British Grand Fleet]] remained in control at sea. It was necessary to return to effective anticommerce warfare by U-boats. Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], Commander in Chief of the [[High Seas Fleet]], pressed for all-out U-boat war, convinced that a high rate of shipping losses would force Britain to seek an early peace before the United States could react effectively.\n\n[[File:Willy St\u00f6wer - Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool.jpg|thumb|''Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool'' by {{SMU|U-21|Germany|6}} ([[Willy St\u00f6wer]])]]\nThe renewed German campaign was effective, sinking 1.4&nbsp;million tons of shipping between October 1916 and January 1917. Despite this, the political situation demanded even greater pressure, and on 31 January 1917, Germany announced that its U-boats would engage in [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] beginning 1 February. On 17 March, German submarines sank three American merchant vessels, and the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917.\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 was initially very successful, sinking a major part of Britain-bound shipping. With the introduction of escorted convoys, shipping losses declined and in the end the German strategy failed to destroy sufficient Allied shipping. An armistice became effective on 11 November 1918.

However, a [[NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw|submarine design office]] was set up in the [[Netherlands]] and a torpedo research program was started in Sweden. Before the start of World War II, Germany started building U-boats and training crews, labeling these activities as \"research\" or concealing them using other covers. When this became known, the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] limited Germany to parity with Britain in submarines.

Cross-Atlantic trade in war supplies and food was extensive and critical for Britain's survival. The continuous action surrounding British shipping became known as the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], as the British developed technical defences such as [[ASDIC]] and [[radar]], and the German U-boats responded by hunting in what were called \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]]\" where multiple submarines would stay close together, making it easier for them to sink a specific target. Britain's vulnerable shipping situation existed until 1942, when the tides changed as the U.S. merchant marine and Navy entered the war, drastically increasing the amount of tonnage of supplies sent across the Atlantic. The combination of increased tonnage and increased naval protection of shipping convoys made it much more difficult for U-boats to make a significant dent in British shipping. Once the United States entered the war, U-boats ranged from the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and from the [[Arctic]] to the west and southern African coasts and even as far east as [[Penang]]. The [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] engaged in various tactics against German incursions in the [[Americas]]; these included military surveillance of foreign nations in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean, to deter any local governments from supplying German U-boats.\n\nBecause speed and range were severely limited underwater while running on battery power, U-boats were required to spend most of their time surfaced running on diesel engines, diving only when attacked or for rare daytime torpedo strikes. The more ship-like hull design reflects the fact that these were primarily surface vessels that could submerge when necessary. This contrasts with the cylindrical profile of modern [[nuclear submarine]]s, which are more hydrodynamic underwater (where they spend the majority of their time), but less stable on the surface. While U-boats were faster on the surface than submerged, the opposite is generally true of modern submarines. The most common [[submarine warfare|U-boat attack]] during the early years of the war was conducted on the surface and at night. This period, before the Allied forces developed truly effective antisubmarine warfare <!-- (ASW) --> tactics, which included convoys, was referred to by German submariners as \"''die gl\u00fcckliche Zeit''\" or the [[First Happy Time]].<ref name=\"milHisOnline\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/atlantic/uboatwar.aspx|title=Military History Online|website=www.militaryhistoryonline.com|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n[[File:u534.jpg|thumb|[[German submarine U-534|''U-534'']], Birkenhead Docks, Merseyside, England]]\n\n===Torpedoes===\nThe U-boats' main weapon was the [[torpedo]], though [[sea mine|mine]]s and [[deck gun]]s (while surfaced) were also used. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships; 2,825 merchant ships) were sunk by U-boat torpedoes.<ref name=\"Tread\">{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They were fitted with one of two types of pistol triggers: impact, which detonated the warhead upon contact with a solid object, and [[Magnetic pistol|magnetic]], which detonated upon sensing a change in the magnetic field within a few meters.\n\nOne of the most effective uses of magnetic pistols would be to set the torpedo's depth to just beneath the keel of the target. The explosion under the target's keel would create a [[detonation]] [[shock wave]], which could cause a ship's hull to rupture under the concussive water pressure. In this way, even large or heavily armored ships could be sunk or disabled with a single, well-placed hit.\n\nInitially the depth-keeping equipment and magnetic and contact exploders were notoriously unreliable.  During the first eight months of the war torpedoes often ran at an improper depth, detonated prematurely, or failed to explode altogether\u2014sometimes bouncing harmlessly off the hull of the target ship. This was most evident in [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway, where various skilled U-boat commanders failed to inflict damage on British transports and warships because of faulty torpedoes. The faults were largely due to a lack of testing. The magnetic detonator was sensitive to mechanical oscillations during the torpedo run, and to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field at high latitudes. These early magnetic detonators were eventually phased out, and the depth-keeping problem was solved by early 1942 with improved technology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Karl D\u00f6nitz|title=Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days|publisher=Naval Institute Press|page=482|isbn=0-87021-780-1}}</ref>{{explain|date=January 2019}}\n\nLater in the war, Germany developed an acoustic homing torpedo, the [[G7e torpedo|G7/T5]]. It was primarily designed to combat convoy escorts. The acoustic torpedo was designed to run straight to an arming distance of 400 m and then turn toward the loudest noise detected. This sometimes ended up being the U-boat itself; at least two submarines may have been sunk by their own homing torpedoes. Additionally, these torpedoes were found to be only effective against ships moving at greater than {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}. The Allies countered acoustic torpedoes with noisemaker decoys such as ''[[Foxer]]'', ''FXR'', ''CAT'' and [[Fanfare (decoy)|''Fanfare'']]. The Germans, in turn, countered this by introducing newer and upgraded versions of the acoustic torpedoes, like the late-war [[G7es torpedo|G7es]], and the [[T11 torpedo|T11]]. However, the T11 did not see active service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/technical/torpedoes.htm|title=The Torpedoes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nU-boats also adopted several types of \"pattern-running\" torpedoes that ran straight out to a preset distance, then traveled in either a circular or ladder-like pattern. When fired at a convoy, this increased the probability of a hit if the weapon missed its primary target.\n\n===U-boat developments===\nDuring World War II, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' produced many different types of U-boats as technology evolved. Most notable is the Type VII, known as the \"workhorse\" of the fleet, which was by far the most-produced type, and the Type IX boats, an enlarged VII designed for long-range patrols, some traveling as far as Japan and the east coast of the United States.\n\n[[File:U-boot by Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg|thumb|upright|Oil painting of a [[Kriegsmarine]] U-boat, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]]]\n\nWith the increasing sophistication of Allied detection and subsequent losses, German designers began to fully realise the potential for a truly submerged boat. The [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] \"''Elektroboot''\" was designed to favor submerged performance, both for combat effectiveness and survival. It was the first true submersible. The Type XXI featured an evolutionary design that combined several different strands of the U-boat development program, most notably from the Walter U-boats, the [[German Type XVIIB submarine|Type XVII]], which featured an unsuccessful yet revolutionary [[hydrogen peroxide]] [[air-independent propulsion|air-independent]] [[hydrogen peroxide#Propellant|propellant]] system. These boats featured a streamlined hull design, which formed the basis of the later {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}} nuclear submarine, and was adapted for use with more conventional propulsion systems. The larger hull design allowed for a greatly increased battery capacity, which enabled the XXI to cruise submerged for longer periods and reach unprecedented submerged speeds for the time. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today.\n\nThroughout the war, an [[arms race]] evolved between the Allies and the ''Kriegsmarine'', especially in detection and counterdetection. [[Sonar]] (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) beyond visual range, but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in [[radar]] became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, as well as more anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to [[Radar in World War II#Centimetric|centimetric radar]] (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''Schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The ''Schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''Schnorchel'' also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''Schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.\n\nSeveral other pioneering innovations included acoustic- and electro-absorbent coatings to make them less of an ASDIC or RADAR target. The Germans also developed active countermeasures such as facilities to release artificial chemical bubble-making decoys, known as ''[[Bold (decoy)|Bold]]'', after the mythical [[kobold]].\n\n===Classes===\n* [[German Type I submarine|Type I]]: first prototypes\n* [[German Type II submarine|Type II]]: small submarines used for training purposes\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type V]]: uncompleted experimental midget submarines\n* [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]]: the \"workhorse\" of the U-boats with 709 completed in World War II<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stern |first1=Robert Cecil |title=Type VII U-boats |date=1991 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=1-55750-828-3 |page=155 |edition=First U.S. & Canada |url=https://uboat.net/books/item/378 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n* [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX]]: these long-range U-boats operated as far as the Indian Ocean with the Japanese ([[Monsun Gruppe]]), and the [[South Atlantic]]\n* [[German Type X submarine|Type X]]: long-range minelayers and cargo transports\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type XI]]: uncompleted experimental artillery boats\n* [[German Type XIV submarine|Type XIV]]: used to resupply other U-boats; nicknamed the ''Milchkuh'' (\"Milk Cow\")\n* [[German Type XVII submarine|Type XVII]]: small coastal submarines powered by experimental hydrogen peroxide propulsion systems\n* [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]]: known as the ''Elektroboot''; first subs to operate primarily submerged\n* [[German Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]]: smaller version of the XXI used for coastal operations \n* [[Midget submarine]]s, including [[Biber (submarine)|''Biber'']], [[Hai (midget submarine)|''Hai'']], ''[[Molch]]'', and ''[[Seehund]]''\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects]]\n\n===Countermeasures===\n{{Main|Anti-submarine warfare}}\n[[File:Uboat sinking survivors.png|right|thumb|Survivors from {{GS|U-175}} after being sunk by {{USCGC|Spencer|WPG-36|6}}, 17 April 1943]]\nAdvances in convoy tactics, high-frequency direction finding (referred to as \"[[Huff-Duff]]\"), radar, active [[sonar]] (called ASDIC in Britain), [[depth charge]]s, ASW spigot mortars (also known as [[Hedgehog (weapon)|\"hedgehog\"]]), the intermittent cracking of the German Naval [[Enigma code]], the introduction of the [[Leigh light]], the range of escort aircraft (especially with the use of [[escort carrier]]s), the use of [[Q-ship|mystery ships]], and the full entry of the U.S. into the war with its enormous shipbuilding capacity, all turned the tide against the U-boats. In the end, the U-boat fleet suffered extremely heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners (a 75% casualty rate, the highest of all German forces during the war).\n\nAt the same time, the Allies targeted the U-boat shipyards and their bases with [[strategic bombing]].\n\n===Enigma machine===\n{{Main|Enigma machine}}\nThe British had a major advantage in their ability to read some German naval Enigma codes. An understanding of the German coding methods had been brought to Britain via France from [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Polish breakthrough|Polish code-breakers]]. Thereafter, code books and equipment were captured by raids on German weather ships and from captured U-boats. A team including [[Alan Turing]] used special purpose \"[[Bombe]]s\" and early [[computer]]s to break new German codes as they were introduced. The speedy decoding of messages was vital in directing convoys away from wolf packs and allowing interception and destruction of U-boats. This was demonstrated when the Naval Enigma machines were altered in February 1942 and wolf-pack effectiveness greatly increased until the new code was broken.\n\nThe {{GS|U-110|1940|6}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXB]], was captured in 1941 by the [[Royal Navy]], and its Enigma machine and documents were removed. {{GS|U-559|3=2}} was also captured by the British in October 1942; three sailors boarded her as she was sinking, and desperately threw all the code books out of the submarine so as to salvage them. Two of them, Able Seaman [[Colin Grazier]] and Lieutenant [[Francis Anthony Blair Fasson]], continued to throw code books out of the ship as it went under water, and went down with it. Further code books were captured by raids on weather ships. {{GS|U-744|3=2}} was boarded by crew from the Canadian ship {{HMCS|Chilliwack|K131|6}} on 6 March 1944, and codes were taken from her, but by this time in the war, most of the information was known.<ref>Helgason, Gudmundur \"Captured U Boats\" UBoat.Net http://uboat.net/fates/captured.htm</ref> The {{GS|U-505|3=2}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXC]], was captured by the [[United States Navy]] in June 1944. It is now a [[museum ship]] in Chicago at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].\n\n===Battle of Bell Island===\n{{Main|Battle of the St. Lawrence}}\nTwo events in the battle took place in 1942 when German U-boats attacked four allied [[ore]] carriers at [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The [[Cargo ship|carriers]] {{SS|Saganaga}} and {{SS|Lord Strathcona}} were sunk by {{GS|U-513|3=2}} on 5 September 1942, while the {{SS|Rosecastle}} and ''PLM 27'' were sunk by {{GS|U-518|3=2}} on 2 November with the loss of 69 lives. When the submarine launched a torpedo at the loading pier, [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]] became the only location in North America to be subject to direct attack by German forces in World War II.\n\n===Operation Deadlight===\n{{Main|Operation Deadlight}}\n\"Operation Deadlight\" was the code name for the scuttling of U-boats surrendered to the Allies after the defeat of Germany near the end of the war. Of the 154 U-boats surrendered, 121 were scuttled in deep water off [[Londonderry Port|Lisahally]], Northern Ireland, or [[Loch Ryan]], Scotland, in late 1945 and early 1946.\n\n==Memorial==\n[[M\u00f6ltenort U-Boat Memorial]]\n\n==Post\u2013World War II and Cold War (after 1945)==\n[[File:U15 Kieler Woche 2007 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''U-15'', a [[Type 206 submarine]], of the [[German Navy]] at the [[Kiel Week]] 2007]]\nFrom 1955, the West German ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was allowed to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired. In the 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) re-entered the submarine business. Because West Germany was initially restricted to a 450 tonne displacement limit, the ''Bundesmarine'' focused on small [[coastal submarine]]s to protect against the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Russia]]n) threat in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The Germans sought to use advanced technologies to offset the small displacement, such as [[ferromagnetism|amagnetic]] [[steel]] to protect against [[naval mine]]s and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s.\n\nThe initial [[Type 201 submarine|Type 201]] was a failure because of hull cracking; the subsequent [[Type 205 submarine|Type 205]], first commissioned in 1967, was a success, and 12 were built for the German navy. To continue the U-boat tradition, the new boats received the classic '''U''' designation starting with the ''U-1''.\n\nWith the [[Denmark|Danish]] government's purchase of two Type 205 boats, the West German government realized the potential for the submarine as an export, developing a customized version [[Kobben-class submarine|Type 207]]. Small and agile submarines were built during the Cold War to operate in the shallow Baltic Sea and attack Warsaw Pact resulting in the [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]]. Three of the improved [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]] boats were later sold to the [[Israeli Navy]], becoming the [[Gal class submarine|Type 540]]. The German [[Type 209 submarine|Type 209]] diesel-electric submarine was the most popular export-sales submarine in the world from the late 1960s into the first years of the 21st century. With a larger 1,000\u20131,500 tonne displacement, the class was very customizable and has seen service with 14 navies with 51 examples being built as of 2006. Germany would continue to reap successes with derivations or on the basis of the successful type 209, as are the [[Dolphin-class submarine|Type 800]] sold to [[Israel]] and the [[TR-1700-class submarine|TR-1700]] sold to [[Argentine]].\n\nGermany would continue to succeed as an exporter of submarines as the [[Ula-class submarine|Klasse 210]] sold to [[Norway]], considered the most silent and maneuverable submarines in the world. This would demonstrate its capacity and put its export seal on the world.\n\n[[File:U Boot 212 HDW 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Type 212 submarine]] with air-independent propulsion of the [[German Navy]] in dock at [[Howaldtswerke|HDW]]/[[Kiel]]]]\nGermany has brought the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new [[Type 212 submarine|Type 212]].

He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career. The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing the flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. He has been jailed or [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on numerous occasions and his struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, and he has not worked in football since being dismissed as the manager of [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 2005.\n\n==Early life==\nGascoigne was born in [[Gateshead]], County Durham, on 27 May 1967.<ref>{{Hugman|7083|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"newcastle\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424061003/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archivedate=24 April 2008 |title=Heroes: Paul Gascoigne |publisher=Newcastle United F.C}}</ref> His father, John (1946\u20132018), was a [[Brick hod|hod carrier]], and his mother, Carol, worked in a factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=12}}</ref> He was named Paul John Gascoigne in tribute to [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Breckenbeds Junior High School]], then the [[Heathfield Senior High School]], both in the [[Low Fell]] area of Gateshead.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=23}}</ref> He was noticed by football scouts while playing for Gateshead Boys, though failed to impress in a trial at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=30}}</ref> Further trials at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] also proved unsuccessful, before the team he supported, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], signed him as a schoolboy in 1980.<ref name=\"Gascoigne 2004 31\">{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=31}}</ref> Gascoigne frequently got into trouble with his friend Jimmy \"Five Bellies\" Gardner.

He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career. The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing the flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. He has been jailed or [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on numerous occasions and his struggles receive regular coverage in the British press.

At the time, the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] was under the rule of [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], who killed the previous ruler before he was expelled by the [[Majapahit]] or the Siamese. It then came under the [[Malacca Sultanate]] and then the [[Johor Sultanate]]. In 1819, [[Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles ]] negotiated a treaty whereby Johor allowed the British to locate a trading port on the island, leading to the establishment of the [[Founding of modern Singapore|British crown colony of Singapore]] in 1819.\n\nDuring [[World War 2]], Singapore was conquered and occupied by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] from 1942 to 1945. When the war ended, Singapore reverted to British control, with increasing levels of [[self-governance|self-government]] being granted, culminating in [[Singapore in Malaysia|Singapore's merger]] with the [[Federation of Malaya]] to form [[Malaysia]] in 1963. However, social unrest and disputes between Singapore's ruling [[People's Action Party]] and Malaysia's [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]] resulted in [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia]]. Singapore became an independent republic on 9 August 1965.\n\nFacing severe unemployment and a housing crisis, Singapore embarked on a rapid modernization programme beginning in the late 1960s through the 1970s that focused on establishing a manufacturing industry, developing large public housing estates and investing heavily on public education and infrastructure.\n\nBy the 1990s, the country had become one of the world's most prosperous nations, with a highly [[economic development|developed]] [[free market economy]], strong [[international trade|international trading]] links, and the highest

Other colonial powers, including the [[British Empire|British]], were limited to a relatively minor presence.<ref name=uslcFounding>{{cite book|author=Leitch Lepoer, Barbara|title=Singapore: A Country Study|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/|accessdate=18 February 2010|series=Country Studies|year=1989|publisher=GPO for tus/singapore/4.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1818, Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of the British colony at [[British Bencoolen|Bencoolen]]. He was determined that Great Britain should replace the Netherlands as the dominant power in the archipelago, since the trade route between [[Qing Dynasty|China]] and [[British Raj|British India]], which had become vitally important with the institution of the [[opium]] trade with China, passed through the archipelago. The Dutch had been stifling British trade in the region by prohibiting the British from operating in Dutch-controlled ports or by subjecting them to a high tariff. Raffles hoped to challenge the Dutch by establishing a new port along the [[Straits of Malacca]], the main ship passageway for the India-China trade. He needed a third port since the British only had the ports of Penang and Bencoolen. The port had to be strategically located along the main trade route between India and China and in the middle of the Malay Archipelago. He convinced [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], the [[Governor-General of India]] and his superior at the [[British East India Company]], to fund an expedition to seek a new British base in the region.<ref name=uslcFounding/> [[File:Stamford Raffles statue.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Raffles by [[Thomas Woolner]] now stands in Singapore, near Raffles's landing site in 1819.]]\n\nRaffles arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port. It lay at the southern tip of the Malay peninsula, near the [[Straits of Malacca]], and possessed a natural deep harbor, fresh water supplies, and timber for repairing ships. It was also located along the main trade route between India and China. Raffles found a small [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[Human settlement|settlement]] at the mouth of the [[Singapore River]], with an estimated population of about 150 that consisted of around 120 Malays and 30 Chinese.<ref name=\"early population\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dD2qVu8EpdUC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Population of Singapore|edition=3rd|author=Saw Swee-Hock|publisher=ISEAS Publishing|date=30 June 2012|isbn= 978-9814380980|pages=7\u20138}}</ref> headed by the [[Temenggung|Temenggong]] and Tengku Abdu'r Rahman.

With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. He offered to recognize Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor, given the title of Sultan Hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.<ref name=uslcFounding/> A formal treaty was signed on 6 February 1819 and modern Singapore was born.<ref>{{cite web|title=1819 \u2013 The February Documents|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)]]|date=7 February 1997|accessdate =18 July 2006|author=Jenny Ng|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Milestones in Singapore's Legal History|publisher=[[Supreme Court, Singapore]]|accessdate=18 July 2006|url=http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39l|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183512/http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39l|archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhen Raffles arrived, it was estimated that there were around 1,000 people living in the whole of the island of Singapore, mostly local groups that would become assimilated into [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]] and a few dozen Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1utb8ZYyUeQC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Singapore in the Malay World: Building and Breaching Regional Bridges|authors=Lily Zubaidah Rahim, Lily Zubaidah Rahim|page=24|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1134013975|year=2010}}</ref><ref name=\"The Malays\">{{cite web|title=The Malays|url=http://yesterday.sg/discover-more/communities-festivals/communities/the-malays/|publisher=National Heritage Board 2011|accessdate=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223000344/http://yesterday.sg/discover-more/communities-festivals/communities/the-malays/|archivedate=23 February 2011|df=dmy}}</ref>  The population increased rapidly soon after Raffles' arrival; the first census of 1824 shows that 6,505 out of the 10,683 total were Malays and Bugis.<ref name=\"1824 census\">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/2fb8948b-5f16-4a7a-8e3c-7a724e1eb6ad|title=First Census of Singapore is Taken|work=History SG}}</ref> Large number of Chinese migrants also started to enter Singapore just months after it became a British settlement, by the census of 1826, there were already more Chinese than Malays excluding Bugis and Javanese.<ref name=\"census 1826\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023134368#page/n43/mode/2up |editors=Wright, Arnold and Cartwright, H.A.|date= 1907|title=Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources|page=37}}</ref> Due to continual migration from [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], China, India and other parts of Asia, Singapore's population had reached nearly 100,000 by 1871, with over half of them Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGEFUeRySkwC&pg=PA317#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Contesting Space in Colonial Singapore: Power Relations and the Urban Built Environment|author=Brenda S.A.

Establishing a trading port from scratch was a daunting endeavor.  Farquhar's administration was fairly funded and was prohibited from collecting port duties to raise revenue as Raffles had decided that Singapore would be a [[free port]]. Farquhar invited settlers to Singapore, and stationed a British official on [[Saint John's Island|St. John's Island]] to invite passing ships to stop in Singapore. As news of the free port spread across the archipelago, [[Bugis]], [[Peranakan|Peranakan Chinese]], and [[Arab]] traders flocked to the island, seeking to circumvent the Dutch trade restrictions. During the starting year of operation in 1819, $400,000 ([[Spanish dollar]]s) worth of trade passed through Singapore. By 1821, the island's population had gone up to around 5,000, and the trade volume was $8 million. The population reached the 10,000 mark in 1824,<ref name=\"1824 census\"/> and with a trade volume of $22 million, Singapore surpassed the long-established port of [[Penang]].<ref name=uslcFounding/>\n\nRaffles returned to Singapore in 1822 and became critical of many of Farquhar's decisions, despite Farquhar's success in leading the settlement through its difficult early years.  For instance, in order to generate much-needed revenue, Farquhar had resorted to selling licenses for gambling and the sale of opium, which Raffles saw as social evils. Shocked at the disarray of the colony as well as the tolerance of slave trade by Farquhar, Raffles set about drafting a set of new policies for the settlement, such as banning of slavery, closing of gambling dens, prohibition of carrying of weapons, and heavy taxation to discourage what he considered to be social vices such as drunkenness and opium-smoking.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819\u20132005|author=C.M.

William Farquhar was also stripped off his post. Farquhar later died in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]].\n\nOn 7 June 1823, [[John Crawfurd]] signed a second treaty with the Sultan and Temenggong, which extended British possession to most of the island. The Sultan and Temenggong traded most of their administrative rights of the island, including the collection of port taxes for lifelong monthly payments of $1500 and $800 respectively.

But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company<ref>Kelly, Nigel. History of Malaya & SouthEast Asia. Heinemann Asia a Division of Reed International (Singapore)) PTE LTD. 1993</ref> together with Penang and Malacca to form the [[Straits Settlements]], administered by the [[British East India Company]]. In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a ''residency'', or subdivision, of the [[Bengal Presidency|Presidency of Bengal]] in [[British India]].<ref name=uslcFlourishing>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 A Flourishing Free Ports|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/5.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=18 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nDuring the subsequent decades, Singapore grew to become an important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including the opening of the Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going [[Steamboat|steamships]], the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869,<ref>Crossroads: A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore (Ch. 5), Jim Baker, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2012.</ref> and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Straits Settlements|url=http://www.sg/explore/history_straits.htm|publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts|accessdate=18 July 2006}}</ref> Its status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]) and [[Manila]] where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singapore Harbor from Its Founding to the Present: A Brief Chronology|url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/post/singapore/economics/harborchron.html|author=George P.

Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.<ref name=uslcFlourishing/>\n\nBy 1827, the Chinese had become the largest ethnic group in Singapore. They consisted of [[Peranakan]]s, who were descendants of early Chinese settlers, and Chinese [[coolie]]s who flocked to Singapore to escape economic hardship in southern China. Their numbers were swelled by those fleeing the turmoil caused by the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842) and [[Second Opium War]] (1856{{ndash}}1860). Many arrived in Singapore as impoverished [[Indentured servant|indentured laborers]]. The Malays were the second largest ethnic group until the 1860s and they worked as fishermen, craftsmen, or as wage earners while continued to live mostly in [[kampung]]s. By 1860, the Indians had become the second largest ethnic group. They consisted of unskilled labourers, traders, and convicts who were sent to carry out public works projects such as clearing jungles and laying out roads. There were also Indian [[Sepoy]] troops garrisoned at Singapore by the British.<ref name=uslcFlourishing/>\n\nDespite Singapore's growing importance, the administration governing the island was understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with the welfare of the populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[smallpox]] caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas.<ref name=uslcFlourishing/> As a result of the administration's ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal [[Secret societies in Singapore|secret societies]] (analogous to modern-day [[Triad society|triads]]) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.<ref>Lim, Irene. (1999) ''Secret societies in Singapore'', National Heritage Board, Singapore History Museum, Singapore {{ISBN|978-9813018792}}</ref>\n\nThe situation created deep concern in the European population of the island. In 1854 the ''[[Singapore Free Press]]'' complained that Singapore was a \"small island\" full of the \"very dregs of the population of south eastern Asia\".<ref>''Singapore Free Press'', 21 July 1854</ref>\n\n===1867\u20131942: Straits Settlements Crown Colony===\n{{Main|Singapore in the Straits Settlements#Crown colony (1867\u20131942)|l1=Crown colony (1867\u20131942)}}\n[[File:Map of Singapore.jpg|thumb|1888 German map of Singapore]]\n\nAs Singapore continued to grow, the deficiencies in the Straits Settlements administration became serious and Singapore's merchant community began agitating against British Indian rule. The British government agreed to establish the Straits Settlements as a separate [[Crown Colony]] on 1 April 1867. This new colony was ruled by a governor under the supervision of the [[Colonial Office]] in London. An [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]] and a [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements|legislative council]] assisted the governor.<ref name=uslcCrown>\n{{cite web|title=Crown Colony|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/6.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=18 July 2006}}\n</ref>  Although members of the councils were not elected, more representatives for the local population were gradually included over the years.\n\n[[File:Map of Singapore (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|[[Baedeker]] map of the city and environs, c. 1914]]\nThe colonial government embarked on several measures to address the serious social problems facing Singapore. A [[Chinese Protectorate]] under [[William A. Pickering|Pickering]] was established in 1877 to address the needs of the Chinese community, especially in controlling the worst abuses of the coolie trade and protecting Chinese women from forced prostitution.<ref name=uslcCrown/> In 1889 Governor Sir [[Cecil Clementi Smith]] banned secret societies, driving them underground.<ref name=uslcCrown/> Nevertheless, many social problems persisted up through the post-war era, including an acute housing shortage and poor health and living standards.

Completed in 1939 at a staggering cost of $500 million, the naval base boasted what was then the largest [[dry dock]] in the world, the third-largest [[floating dock (jetty)|floating dock]], and enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months. It was defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns and by [[Royal Air Force]] squadrons stationed at [[Tengah Air Base]]. [[Winston Churchill]] touted it as the \"[[Gibraltar]] of the East.\" Unfortunately, it was a base without a fleet. The [[British Home Fleet]] was stationed in Europe and the plan was for it to sail quickly to Singapore when needed. However, after World War II broke out in 1939, the Fleet was fully occupied with [[Battle of Britain|defending Britain]].<ref>W. David McIntyre (1979).

One of Japan's objectives was to capture Southeast Asia and secure the rich supply of natural resources to feed its military and industry needs. Singapore, the main Allied base in the region, was an obvious military target because of its flourishing trade and wealth.\n\nThe British military commanders in Singapore had believed that the Japanese attack would come by sea from the south, since the dense Malayan jungle in the north would serve as a natural barrier against invasion. Although they had drawn up a plan for dealing with an attack on northern Malaya, preparations were never completed. The military was confident that \"Fortress Singapore\" would withstand any Japanese attack and this confidence was further reinforced by the arrival of Force Z, a squadron of British warships dispatched to the defense of Singapore, including the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, and cruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}}. The squadron was to have been accompanied by a third capital ship, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|R92|6}}, but it ran aground en route, leaving the squadron without air cover.\n[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-General [[Arthur Percival]], led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of truce to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942.

British troops led by Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]], [[Supreme Allied Commander]] for [[Southeast Asia Command]], returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General [[Itagaki Seishiro]] on behalf of General [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services, as well as the harbor facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]]. There was also a shortage of food, leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.<ref name=uslcAftermathOfWar>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Aftermath of War|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=18 June 2006}}\n</ref>\n\nThe failure of Britain to defend Singapore had destroyed its credibility as an infallible ruler in the eyes of Singaporeans. The decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] and nationalist sentiments, epitomized by the slogan ''[[Merdeka]]'', or \"independence\" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were prepared to gradually increase [[self-governance]] for Singapore and Malaya.<ref name=uslcAftermathOfWar/> On 1 April 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] was dissolved and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled for the following year.<ref name=micaSelfGovernment>{{cite web|title=Towards Self-government|url=http://www.sg/explore/history_towards.htm|publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore|accessdate=18 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n===1948\u20131951: First Legislative Council===\nThe [[1948 Singapore general election|first Singaporean elections]], held in March 1948, were limited as only six of the twenty-five seats on the [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]] were to be elected. Only British subjects had the right to vote, and only 23,000 or about 10% of those eligible registered to vote. Other members of the Council were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers of commerce.<ref name=uslcAftermathOfWar/> Three of the elected seats were won by a newly formed [[Singapore Progressive Party]] (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen and professionals and were disinclined to press for immediate self-rule. The other three seats were won by independents.\n\nThree months after the elections, an armed insurgency by communist groups in Malaya \u2013 the [[Malayan Emergency]] \u2013 broke out. The British imposed tough measures to control [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] groups in both Singapore and Malaya and introduced the controversial [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]], which allowed indefinite detention without trial for persons suspected of being \"threats to security\". Since the left-wing groups were the strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government was stalled for several years.<ref name=uslcAftermathOfWar/>\n\n===1951\u20131955: Second Legislative Council===\nA second Legislative Council election was held in 1951 with the number of elected seats increased to nine. This election was again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local [[government of Singapore]], the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the Emergency over, a British Commission, headed by [[George William Rendel|Sir George Rendel]], proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a [[Chief Minister]] as [[head of government]] and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a [[parliamentary system]]. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.\n\n[[File:A Malay Junk of the Pinas-type.jpg|thumb|210px|1955 stamp with the portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]\nThe election for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively and closely fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly defeated in the election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning [[Labour Front]] was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed a coalition government with the [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]]-[[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] Alliance, which won three seats.<ref name=uslcAftermathOfWar/> Another new party, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), won three seats.\n\n=== 1953\u20131954 The Fajar trial ===\nFajar trial was the first sedition trial in the post-war Malaysia and Singapore.

However, after three days of the trial, Fajar members were immediately released. The famous English Queen's Counsel D.N. Pritt acted as the lead counsel in the case and Lee Kuan Yew who was at that time a young lawyer assisted him as the junior counsel.

The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following the failure of the talk.\n\nThe new Chief Minister, [[Lim Yew Hock]], launched a crackdown on communist and leftist groups, imprisoning many trade union leaders and several pro-communist members of the PAP under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]].<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Road to Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=27 June 2006}}</ref> The British government approved of Lim's tough stance against communist agitators, and when a new round of talks was held beginning in March 1957, they agreed to grant complete internal self-government. A State of Singapore would be created, with its own citizenship. The Legislative Assembly would be expanded to fifty-one members, entirely chosen by popular election, and the Prime Minister and cabinet would control all aspects of government except defense and foreign affairs. The governorship was replaced by a ''[[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]]'' or [[head of state]]. In August 1958, the State of Singapore Act was passed in the United Kingdom Parliament providing for the establishment of the State of Singapore.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/>\n\n===1959\u20131963: Full internal self-government===\n[[1959 Singapore general election|Elections for the new Legislative Assembly]] were held in May 1959.  The [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) won the polls in a landslide victory, winning forty-three of the fifty-one seats. They accomplished this by courting the Chinese-speaking majority, particularly those in the labour unions and radical student organizations. Its leader [[Lee Kuan Yew]], a young Cambridge-educated lawyer, became the first Prime Minister of Singapore.\n\nThe PAP's victory was at first viewed with dismay by foreign and local business leaders because some party's members were pro-communists. Many businesses promptly shifted their headquarters from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> Despite these ill omens, the PAP government embarked on a vigorous program to address Singapore's various economic and social problems. Economic development was overseen by the new Minister of Finance [[Goh Keng Swee]], whose strategy was to encourage foreign and local investment with measures ranging from tax incentives to the establishment of a large [[industrial estate]] in [[Jurong]].<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> The education system was revamped to train a skilled workforce and the English language was promoted over the Chinese language as the language of instruction. To eliminate labour unrest, existing labour unions were consolidated, sometimes forcibly, into a single umbrella organisation, called the [[National Trades Union Congress]] (NTUC) with strong oversight from the government. On the social front, an aggressive and well-funded [[Housing and Development Board|public housing program]] was launched to solve the long-standing housing problem. More than 25,000 high-rise, low-cost apartments were constructed during the first two years of the program.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/>\n\n===Campaign for merger===\n\nDespite their successes in governing Singapore, the PAP leaders, including Lee and Goh, believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya. They felt that the historic and economic ties between Singapore and Malaya were too strong for them to continue as separate nations. Furthermore, Singapore lacked natural resources, and faced both a declining entrep\u00f4t trade and a growing population which required jobs. It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market, eliminating trade tariffs, and thus supporting new industries which would solve the ongoing unemployment woes.\n\nAlthough the PAP leadership campaigned vigorously for a merger, the sizable pro-communist wing of the PAP were strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence as the ruling party of Malaya, [[United Malays National Organisation]], was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of PAP against them. The UMNO leaders were also skeptical of the  idea of a merger due to their distrust of the PAP government and concerns that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended. The issue came to a head in 1961 when pro-communist PAP minister [[Ong Eng Guan]] defected from the party and beat a PAP candidate in a subsequent by-election, a move that threatened to bring down Lee's government.\n\nFaced with the prospect of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], mooted the idea of a Federation of [[Malaysia]], comprising existing [[Federation of Malaya]], Singapore, [[Brunei]] and the British Borneo territories of [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|North Borneo]] and [[Sarawak (British Crown colony)|Sarawak]]. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.\n\nOn 9 July 1963, the leaders of Singapore, Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak signed the [[Malaysia Agreement]] to establish the Federation of Malaysia.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/>\n\n==1963\u20131965: Singapore in Malaysia==\n{{Main|Singapore in Malaysia}}\n{{See also|PAP-UMNO relations|History of Malaysia}}\n\n===Merger===\n[[File:Singapore during the formation of Malaysia (16 September 1963).jpg|thumb|right|The founding father of modern Singapore, [[Lee Kuan Yew]] declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore.]]\nOn 16 September 1963, Malaya, Singapore, [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] were merged and Malaysia was formed.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> The union was rocky from the start. During the [[1963 Singapore general election|1963 Singapore state elections]], a local branch of [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) took part in the election despite an earlier UMNO's agreement with the PAP not to participate in the state's politics during Malaysia's formative years. Although UMNO lost all its bids, relations between PAP and UMNO worsened. The PAP, in a tit-for-tat, challenged UMNO candidates in the 1964 federal election as part of the [[Malaysian Solidarity Convention]], winning one seat in Malaysian Parliament.\n\n===Racial tension===\nRacial tensions increased as ethnic Chinese and other non-Malay ethnic groups in Singapore rejected the discriminatory policies imposed by the Malays such as quotas for the Malays as special privileges were granted to the Malays guaranteed under [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia]]. There were also other financial and economic benefits that were preferentially given to Malays. Lee Kuan Yew and other political leaders began advocating for the fair and equal treatment of all races in Malaysia, with a rallying cry of ''\"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]!\"''.\n\nMeanwhile, the Malays in Singapore were being increasingly incited by the federal government's accusations that the PAP was mistreating the Malays. The external political situation was also tense; [[Indonesia]]n President [[Sukarno]] declared a state of ''[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'' (Confrontation) against Malaysia and initiated military and other actions against the new nation, including the [[MacDonald House bombing|bombing of MacDonald House]] in Singapore 10 March 1965 by Indonesian commandos, killing three people.<ref>{{cite news|title=Terror Bomb Kills 2 Girls at Bank|work=Straits Times|location=Singapore|date=11 March 1965|url=http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mterror1.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201103011/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mterror1.html|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Indonesia also conducted sedition activities to provoke the Malays against the Chinese.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> Numerous racial riots resulted and curfews were frequently imposed to restore order. The most notorious riots were the [[1964 Race Riots]] that first took place on Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s birthday on 21 July with twenty three people killed and hundreds injured, and also, many people by then still hated the rest. During the unrest, the price of food skyrocketed when transport system was disrupted, causing further hardship for the people.\n\nThe state and federal governments also had conflicts on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The [[Bank of China]] branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of [[Lee Kuan Yew]].\n\n===Separation and interdependence ===\nSeeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] decided to expel Singapore from the federation. [[Goh Keng Swee]], who had become skeptical of merger's economic benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy in order to present the British government, in particular, with a ''fait accompli''.\n\nOn the morning of 9 August 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia voted 126\u20130 in favor of a constitutional amendment expelling Singapore from the federation; hours later, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, establishing the island as an independent and sovereign republic.  A tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced in a televised press conference that Singapore had become a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he stated: \"For me, it is a moment of anguish.

The [[Konfrontasi]] was on-going and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms.  Much of the international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of [[natural resource]]s and land.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Two Decades of Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/11.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=28 June 2006}}</ref> Unemployment was ranging between 10\u201312%, threatening to trigger civil unrest.\n\nSingapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th member; and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in October that year. Foreign minister [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] headed a new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and establishing diplomatic relations with other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716151550/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 July 2009|title=Former DPM Rajaratnam dies at age 90|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> On 22 December 1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of Singapore.

The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The [[service industry]] also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Esso]] to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence/> The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.\n\nThe lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues.

The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the [[Dutch colonial empire|Dutch]], who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product.

He was determined that Great Britain should replace the Netherlands as the dominant power in the archipelago, since the trade route between [[Qing Dynasty|China]] and [[British Raj|British India]], which had become vitally important with the institution of the [[opium]] trade with China, passed through the archipelago. The Dutch had been stifling British trade in the region by prohibiting the British from operating in Dutch-controlled ports or by subjecting them to a high tariff. Raffles hoped to challenge the Dutch by establishing a new port along the [[Straits of Malacca]], the main ship passageway for the India-China trade. He needed a third port since the British only had the ports of Penang and Bencoolen. The port had to be strategically located along the main trade route between India and China and in the middle of the Malay Archipelago. He convinced [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], the [[Governor-General of India]] and his superior at the [[British East India Company]], to fund an expedition to seek a new British base in the region.<ref name=uslcFounding/> [[File:Stamford Raffles statue.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Raffles by [[Thomas Woolner]] now stands in Singapore, near Raffles's landing site in 1819.]]\n\nRaffles arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port. It lay at the southern tip of the Malay peninsula, near the [[Straits of Malacca]], and possessed a natural deep harbor, fresh water supplies, and timber for repairing ships. It was also located along the main trade route between India and China.

Establishing a trading port from scratch was a daunting endeavor.  Farquhar's administration was fairly funded and was prohibited from collecting port duties to raise revenue as Raffles had decided that Singapore would be a [[free port]]. Farquhar invited settlers to Singapore, and stationed a British official on [[Saint John's Island|St. John's Island]] to invite passing ships to stop in Singapore. As news of the free port spread across the archipelago, [[Bugis]], [[Peranakan|Peranakan Chinese]], and [[Arab]] traders flocked to the island, seeking to circumvent the Dutch trade restrictions. During the starting year of operation in 1819, $400,000 ([[Spanish dollar]]s) worth of trade passed through Singapore. By 1821, the island's population had gone up to around 5,000, and the trade volume was $8 million. The population reached the 10,000 mark in 1824,<ref name=\"1824 census\"/> and with a trade volume of $22 million, Singapore surpassed the long-established port of [[Penang]].<ref name=uslcFounding/>\n\nRaffles returned to Singapore in 1822 and became critical of many of Farquhar's decisions, despite Farquhar's success in leading the settlement through its difficult early years.  For instance, in order to generate much-needed revenue, Farquhar had resorted to selling licenses for gambling and the sale of opium, which Raffles saw as social evils. Shocked at the disarray of the colony as well as the tolerance of slave trade by Farquhar, Raffles set about drafting a set of new policies for the settlement, such as banning of slavery, closing of gambling dens, prohibition of carrying of weapons, and heavy taxation to discourage what he considered to be social vices such as drunkenness and opium-smoking.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819\u20132005|author=C.M.

William Farquhar was also stripped off his post.

But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company<ref>Kelly, Nigel. History of Malaya & SouthEast Asia. Heinemann Asia a Division of Reed International (Singapore)) PTE LTD. 1993</ref> together with Penang and Malacca to form the [[Straits Settlements]], administered by the [[British East India Company]]. In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a ''residency'', or subdivision, of the [[Bengal Presidency|Presidency of Bengal]] in [[British India]].<ref name=uslcFlourishing>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 A Flourishing Free Ports|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/5.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=18 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nDuring the subsequent decades, Singapore grew to become an important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including the opening of the Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going [[Steamboat|steamships]], the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869,<ref>Crossroads: A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore (Ch. 5), Jim Baker, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2012.</ref> and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Straits Settlements|url=http://www.sg/explore/history_straits.htm|publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts|accessdate=18 July 2006}}</ref> Its status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]) and [[Manila]] where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singapore Harbor from Its Founding to the Present: A Brief Chronology|url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/post/singapore/economics/harborchron.html|author=George P.

Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.<ref name=uslcFlourishing/>\n\nBy 1827, the Chinese had become the largest ethnic group in Singapore. They consisted of [[Peranakan]]s, who were descendants of early Chinese settlers, and Chinese [[coolie]]s who flocked to Singapore to escape economic hardship in southern China. Their numbers were swelled by those fleeing the turmoil caused by the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842) and [[Second Opium War]] (1856{{ndash}}1860). Many arrived in Singapore as impoverished [[Indentured servant|indentured laborers]]. The Malays were the second largest ethnic group until the 1860s and they worked as fishermen, craftsmen, or as wage earners while continued to live mostly in [[kampung]]s. By 1860, the Indians had become the second largest ethnic group. They consisted of unskilled labourers, traders, and convicts who were sent to carry out public works projects such as clearing jungles and laying out roads. There were also Indian [[Sepoy]] troops garrisoned at Singapore by the British.<ref name=uslcFlourishing/>\n\nDespite Singapore's growing importance, the administration governing the island was understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with the welfare of the populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[smallpox]] caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas.<ref name=uslcFlourishing/> As a result of the administration's ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal [[Secret societies in Singapore|secret societies]] (analogous to modern-day [[Triad society|triads]]) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.<ref>Lim, Irene. (1999) ''Secret societies in Singapore'', National Heritage Board, Singapore History Museum, Singapore {{ISBN|978-9813018792}}</ref>\n\nThe situation created deep concern in the European population of the island. In 1854 the ''[[Singapore Free Press]]'' complained that Singapore was a \"small island\" full of the \"very dregs of the population of south eastern Asia\".<ref>''Singapore Free Press'', 21 July 1854</ref>\n\n===1867\u20131942: Straits Settlements Crown Colony===\n{{Main|Singapore in the Straits Settlements#Crown colony (1867\u20131942)|l1=Crown colony (1867\u20131942)}}\n[[File:Map of Singapore.jpg|thumb|1888 German map of Singapore]]\n\nAs Singapore continued to grow, the deficiencies in the Straits Settlements administration became serious and Singapore's merchant community began agitating against British Indian rule. The British government agreed to establish the Straits Settlements as a separate [[Crown Colony]] on 1 April 1867. This new colony was ruled by a governor under the supervision of the [[Colonial Office]] in London. An [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]] and a [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements|legislative council]] assisted the governor.<ref name=uslcCrown>\n{{cite web|title=Crown Colony|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/6.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=18 July 2006}}\n</ref>  Although members of the councils were not elected, more representatives for the local population were gradually included over the years.\n\n[[File:Map of Singapore (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|[[Baedeker]] map of the city and environs, c. 1914]]\nThe colonial government embarked on several measures to address the serious social problems facing Singapore. A [[Chinese Protectorate]] under [[William A. Pickering|Pickering]] was established in 1877 to address the needs of the Chinese community, especially in controlling the worst abuses of the coolie trade and protecting Chinese women from forced prostitution.<ref name=uslcCrown/> In 1889 Governor Sir [[Cecil Clementi Smith]] banned secret societies, driving them underground.<ref name=uslcCrown/> Nevertheless, many social problems persisted up through the post-war era, including an acute housing shortage and poor health and living standards.

Completed in 1939 at a staggering cost of $500 million, the naval base boasted what was then the largest [[dry dock]] in the world, the third-largest [[floating dock (jetty)|floating dock]], and enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months. It was defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns and by [[Royal Air Force]] squadrons stationed at [[Tengah Air Base]]. [[Winston Churchill]] touted it as the \"[[Gibraltar]] of the East.\" Unfortunately, it was a base without a fleet. The [[British Home Fleet]] was stationed in Europe and the plan was for it to sail quickly to Singapore when needed. However, after World War II broke out in 1939, the Fleet was fully occupied with [[Battle of Britain|defending Britain]].<ref>W. David McIntyre (1979).

One of Japan's objectives was to capture Southeast Asia and secure the rich supply of natural resources to feed its military and industry needs. Singapore, the main Allied base in the region, was an obvious military target because of its flourishing trade and wealth.\n\nThe British military commanders in Singapore had believed that the Japanese attack would come by sea from the south, since the dense Malayan jungle in the north would serve as a natural barrier against invasion. Although they had drawn up a plan for dealing with an attack on northern Malaya, preparations were never completed. The military was confident that \"Fortress Singapore\" would withstand any Japanese attack and this confidence was further reinforced by the arrival of Force Z, a squadron of British warships dispatched to the defense of Singapore, including the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, and cruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}}. The squadron was to have been accompanied by a third capital ship, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|R92|6}}, but it ran aground en route, leaving the squadron without air cover.\n[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-General [[Arthur Percival]], led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of truce to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942.

He presided over a shaky government, receiving little cooperation from both the colonial government and the other local parties.

The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following the failure of the talk.\n\nThe new Chief Minister, [[Lim Yew Hock]], launched a crackdown on communist and leftist groups, imprisoning many trade union leaders and several pro-communist members of the PAP under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]].<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Road to Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=27 June 2006}}</ref> The British government approved of Lim's tough stance against communist agitators, and when a new round of talks was held beginning in March 1957, they agreed to grant complete internal self-government. A State of Singapore would be created, with its own citizenship. The Legislative Assembly would be expanded to fifty-one members, entirely chosen by popular election, and the Prime Minister and cabinet would control all aspects of government except defense and foreign affairs. The governorship was replaced by a ''[[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]]'' or [[head of state]]. In August 1958, the State of Singapore Act was passed in the United Kingdom Parliament providing for the establishment of the State of Singapore.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/>\n\n===1959\u20131963: Full internal self-government===\n[[1959 Singapore general election|Elections for the new Legislative Assembly]] were held in May 1959.  The [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) won the polls in a landslide victory, winning forty-three of the fifty-one seats. They accomplished this by courting the Chinese-speaking majority, particularly those in the labour unions and radical student organizations. Its leader [[Lee Kuan Yew]], a young Cambridge-educated lawyer, became the first Prime Minister of Singapore.\n\nThe PAP's victory was at first viewed with dismay by foreign and local business leaders because some party's members were pro-communists. Many businesses promptly shifted their headquarters from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> Despite these ill omens, the PAP government embarked on a vigorous program to address Singapore's various economic and social problems. Economic development was overseen by the new Minister of Finance [[Goh Keng Swee]], whose strategy was to encourage foreign and local investment with measures ranging from tax incentives to the establishment of a large [[industrial estate]] in [[Jurong]].<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> The education system was revamped to train a skilled workforce and the English language was promoted over the Chinese language as the language of instruction. To eliminate labour unrest, existing labour unions were consolidated, sometimes forcibly, into a single umbrella organisation, called the [[National Trades Union Congress]] (NTUC) with strong oversight from the government. On the social front, an aggressive and well-funded [[Housing and Development Board|public housing program]] was launched to solve the long-standing housing problem. More than 25,000 high-rise, low-cost apartments were constructed during the first two years of the program.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/>\n\n===Campaign for merger===\n\nDespite their successes in governing Singapore, the PAP leaders, including Lee and Goh, believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya. They felt that the historic and economic ties between Singapore and Malaya were too strong for them to continue as separate nations. Furthermore, Singapore lacked natural resources, and faced both a declining entrep\u00f4t trade and a growing population which required jobs. It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market, eliminating trade tariffs, and thus supporting new industries which would solve the ongoing unemployment woes.\n\nAlthough the PAP leadership campaigned vigorously for a merger, the sizable pro-communist wing of the PAP were strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence as the ruling party of Malaya, [[United Malays National Organisation]], was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of PAP against them. The UMNO leaders were also skeptical of the  idea of a merger due to their distrust of the PAP government and concerns that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended. The issue came to a head in 1961 when pro-communist PAP minister [[Ong Eng Guan]] defected from the party and beat a PAP candidate in a subsequent by-election, a move that threatened to bring down Lee's government.\n\nFaced with the prospect of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], mooted the idea of a Federation of [[Malaysia]], comprising existing [[Federation of Malaya]], Singapore, [[Brunei]] and the British Borneo territories of [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|North Borneo]] and [[Sarawak (British Crown colony)|Sarawak]]. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.\n\nOn 9 July 1963, the leaders of Singapore, Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak signed the [[Malaysia Agreement]] to establish the Federation of Malaysia.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/>\n\n==1963\u20131965: Singapore in Malaysia==\n{{Main|Singapore in Malaysia}}\n{{See also|PAP-UMNO relations|History of Malaysia}}\n\n===Merger===\n[[File:Singapore during the formation of Malaysia (16 September 1963).jpg|thumb|right|The founding father of modern Singapore, [[Lee Kuan Yew]] declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore.]]\nOn 16 September 1963, Malaya, Singapore, [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] were merged and Malaysia was formed.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> The union was rocky from the start. During the [[1963 Singapore general election|1963 Singapore state elections]], a local branch of [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) took part in the election despite an earlier UMNO's agreement with the PAP not to participate in the state's politics during Malaysia's formative years. Although UMNO lost all its bids, relations between PAP and UMNO worsened. The PAP, in a tit-for-tat, challenged UMNO candidates in the 1964 federal election as part of the [[Malaysian Solidarity Convention]], winning one seat in Malaysian Parliament.\n\n===Racial tension===\nRacial tensions increased as ethnic Chinese and other non-Malay ethnic groups in Singapore rejected the discriminatory policies imposed by the Malays such as quotas for the Malays as special privileges were granted to the Malays guaranteed under [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia]]. There were also other financial and economic benefits that were preferentially given to Malays. Lee Kuan Yew and other political leaders began advocating for the fair and equal treatment of all races in Malaysia, with a rallying cry of ''\"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]!\"''.\n\nMeanwhile, the Malays in Singapore were being increasingly incited by the federal government's accusations that the PAP was mistreating the Malays. The external political situation was also tense; [[Indonesia]]n President [[Sukarno]] declared a state of ''[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'' (Confrontation) against Malaysia and initiated military and other actions against the new nation, including the [[MacDonald House bombing|bombing of MacDonald House]] in Singapore 10 March 1965 by Indonesian commandos, killing three people.<ref>{{cite news|title=Terror Bomb Kills 2 Girls at Bank|work=Straits Times|location=Singapore|date=11 March 1965|url=http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mterror1.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201103011/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mterror1.html|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Indonesia also conducted sedition activities to provoke the Malays against the Chinese.<ref name=uslcRoadToIndependence/> Numerous racial riots resulted and curfews were frequently imposed to restore order. The most notorious riots were the [[1964 Race Riots]] that first took place on Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s birthday on 21 July with twenty three people killed and hundreds injured, and also, many people by then still hated the rest. During the unrest, the price of food skyrocketed when transport system was disrupted, causing further hardship for the people.\n\nThe state and federal governments also had conflicts on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The [[Bank of China]] branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of [[Lee Kuan Yew]].\n\n===Separation and interdependence ===\nSeeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] decided to expel Singapore from the federation. [[Goh Keng Swee]], who had become skeptical of merger's economic benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy in order to present the British government, in particular, with a ''fait accompli''.\n\nOn the morning of 9 August 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia voted 126\u20130 in favor of a constitutional amendment expelling Singapore from the federation; hours later, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, establishing the island as an independent and sovereign republic.  A tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced in a televised press conference that Singapore had become a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he stated: \"For me, it is a moment of anguish.

The [[Konfrontasi]] was on-going and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms.  Much of the international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of [[natural resource]]s and land.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Two Decades of Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/11.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=28 June 2006}}</ref> Unemployment was ranging between 10\u201312%, threatening to trigger civil unrest.\n\nSingapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th member; and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in October that year. Foreign minister [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] headed a new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and establishing diplomatic relations with other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716151550/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 July 2009|title=Former DPM Rajaratnam dies at age 90|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> On 22 December 1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of Singapore.

The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The [[service industry]] also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Esso]] to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence/> The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.\n\nThe lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues.

The region saw many battles between the [[Continental Army]] and the Iroquois, and several treaties drawn up after the war ceded much of the land to settlers of European descent. It is largely rural with rugged terrain.\n\nUpstate New York was transformed by the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, which greatly eased the movement of goods from the upper midwest, the cities along the [[Great Lakes]], and Upstate New York, to the port of New York City. As a result, Upstate became a hotbed for manufacturing, giving birth to such firms as [[General Electric]], [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Xerox]], and it welcomed a large influx of immigrants.

The [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] supply New York City's water.  The region is home to several popular tourist and recreational destinations, including [[Niagara Falls]], the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondack]] and [[Catskill Mountains]], and the [[Finger Lakes]], the latter created by retreating [[glacier]]s.\n\nBecause of its geography, rivers have played a very important role in Upstate New York's history. All the above cities are on navigable or formerly navigable rivers or lakes. Until railroads arrived around 1850, New York ran on rivers: the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], its tributary the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]], and to a lesser extent the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and its tributary the [[Chemung River|Chemung]]. There was regular [[steamboat]] service along the Hudson River between New York City and Albany beginning in 1807, the first such regular service in the world. There was regular commercial and passenger transportation along the Mohawk in small boats until the Erie Canal opened. Utica, which is about as far as you can go on the Mohawk, was in the early nineteenth century a busy port and the economic capital of western New York. The Erie Canal was the biggest and most expensive engineering project in the world up to that date, and even if upstream speed was at first that of a mule, its economic importance was immense, and it transformed the state of New York.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Map of New York Highlighting New York City.svg|thumb|right|New York City is highlighted in red; \"Upstate\" refers to some or all of the area north and west of the city.]]\n[[File:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] across the [[Hudson River]], as seen from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]].

Most of New York State is characterized both by agricultural and forested rural communities, and by small and medium-sized cities and their surrounding suburbs located along major transportation corridors.  The state's major metropolitan areas outside of New York City are Buffalo, Rochester, Albany-Schenectady-Troy, and Syracuse, each of whose population exceeds 500,000.\n\nThe different regions of New York State are influenced by and have affinities with other adjacent regions.  Western New York has cultural and economic ties to the other [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes states]] as well as [[Southern Ontario]].  The [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], the Hudson Valley, the [[Mohawk Valley]] and the [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] area have ties to [[New England]]. The North Country, the extreme northern portion of the state, also has strong cultural, economic, linguistic and familial ties to [[Quebec]] and [[Eastern Ontario]].  Thus, Plattsburgh has close ties to its neighbors in the Montreal area as well as Vermont.

The Catskill Mountains lie in the southeastern part of the state, closer to New York City. The Catskills and the Allegheny Plateau are both part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The northernmost part of the state contains the Adirondack Mountains, which are sometimes considered part of the Appalachians but are geologically separate, a southern extension of the [[Canadian Shield]].\n\nIn the more mountainous eastern part of Upstate New York, the valleys of the Hudson River and the [[Mohawk River]] were historically important travel corridors and remain so today. Western New York in the vicinity of Buffalo is very flat, as it was once the bottom of a glacial lake. The only \"hills\" in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]] are the [[Niagara Escarpment]], which formed the [[Niagara Falls|Falls]].\n\nUpstate has a long shared border with Canadian province of [[Ontario]] divided by water; including the [[Lake Erie]], [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Ontario]] and the St. Lawrence River. It shares a land border with the province of [[Quebec]] in the northernmost part of the state.\n\nThe sizes of upstate counties and towns are generally larger in area and smaller in population, compared with the downstate region, although there are exceptions. The state's smallest county in population ([[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton County]]) and largest county in area ([[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]] on the state's northern border) are both in Upstate New York, while the largest in population ([[Kings County, New York|Kings County]]) and smallest in area ([[Manhattan|New York County]]) are both part of New York City.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:NYlakeeffectsnow.png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Average seasonal snowfall totals for areas subject to lake-effect snow in New York (in inches).<ref name=NWS_snowseason>{{cite web|title=Average Seasonal Snowfall Over the Eastern Great Lakes Region |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210074031/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |website=Erh.noaa.gov |author=NOAA's National Weather Service |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>]]Upstate New York is well known for its cold and snowy winters, particularly in comparison to the more temperate climate of downstate New York.

The conflict between the two peoples continued through the period of early European colonization, and the French, Dutch and English tended to ally with their trading partners among the indigenous peoples. The Haudenosaunee or [[Iroquois confederacy]] of the Five (later Six) Nations was a powerful force in its home territory. The Five Nations' territory extended from the Mohawk River Valley through the western part of the state and into current Pennsylvania. From this home base they also controlled at various times large swaths of additional territory throughout what is now the northeastern United States. The [[Guswhenta (Two Row Wampum Treaty)]], made with the Dutch government in 1613, codified relations between the Haudenosaunee and European colonizers, and formed the basis of subsequent treaties. In the mid-17th century, during the [[Beaver Wars]], the Iroquois were victorious and dominated the tribes of [[Neutral Nation|Neutral Indians]], [[Wenrohronon]] and the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie Indians]] in Western New York. (Survivors were mostly assimilated into the [[Seneca people]] of the Iroquois; some are believed to have escaped to South Carolina, where they merged with other Indian tribes.)\n\nThe region was important from the first days of both [[France|French]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonization In the seventeenth century.  The [[New Netherland]] colony encompassed the Hudson Valley from Manhattan island north to the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where [[Fort Orange]] (later Albany) was established in 1623. The fort at [[Schenectady, New York]] was built in 1661.  The upper Hudson Valley was the center of much of the colony's [[fur trade]], which was highly lucrative, serving a demand for furs in Europe.\n\nNorth and west of New Netherland, the French established trading posts along the St. Lawrence River and as far south as the shores of [[Onondaga Lake]]. They found both trading and proselytizing difficult among the Haudenosaunee, as [[Samuel de Champlain]] had alienated the Haudenosaunee during military forays from [[New France]].  In the 1640s, three [[Jesuit missions in North America#Missions|French Jesuit missionaries]] to New France \u2014St. [[Ren\u00e9 Goupil]], St. [[Isaac Jogues]], and St. [[Jean de Lalande]]\u2014were killed near the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, which was located at the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers, where the modern town of [[Auriesville, New York|Auriesville]] was later developed. They are considered to be the first three [[List of American saints and beatified people|U.S. saints]].\n\nEngland seized New Netherland by force in 1664, renaming it New York.  The Dutch recaptured the colony nine years later, but ceded it to England under the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] of 1674.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the British consolidated their hold on the region.  [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], a Scottish trader, established an estate in the Mohawk Valley, living among the Mohawk, learning their language, and forging an alliance with them. He was appointed as the British Indian agent to the Iroquois. The British also encouraged settlement in the Mohawk Valley by other Europeans, including [[German Palatines]] beginning in the 1720s.\n\nIn what became known as the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754, delegates from seven of the thirteen British North American colonies met at Albany to pursue a treaty with the powerful Mohawk. [[Benjamin Franklin]], a Pennsylvania delegate, proposed a plan for uniting the seven colonies that greatly exceeded the scope of the congress. The delegates spent most of their time debating this [[Albany Plan]] of union, one of the first attempts to form a union of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] \"under one government as far as might be necessary for defense and other general important purposes\".<ref>''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin'', Second Edition.  Yale University Press, 1964. pp.209-210</ref>  The delegates approved an amended version, but the colonies rejected it.\n\nTo counter the French militarily, the British established forts along Lake Ontario and at portages between the Mohawk Valley and the adjacent Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario watersheds. The region became the area for many conflicts of the [[French and Indian War]], such as the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)]] and the [[Siege of Fort William Henry]] (which was later depicted in the work of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]), during the [[Seven Years' War]].\n\nThe British conquered New France by 1760 with the fall of Quebec.  France formally ceded New France to the British in the [[Treaty of Paris of 1763]].  The same year, [[King George III]] issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which established the western and northern boundary of the Province of New York at the limits of the Hudson, Mohawk and Delaware River watersheds.  The area between that boundary and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, including west of the Appalachian Mountains, was to be the \"[[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].\"\n\n===American Revolution===\n\n[[File:Incident in cherry valley.jpg|thumb|[[Cherry Valley massacre]]]]\nBetween 1774 and 1783, deeply divided colonists waged civil war on each other directly and by proxy, through attacks such as the Seneca-led [[Cherry Valley massacre|Cherry Valley]] and the Mohawk-led [[Battle of Cobleskill|Cobleskill]] massacre.  In 1779, the [[Sullivan Expedition]], a campaign by the Continental Army ordered by General [[George Washington]], drove thousands of the Haudenosaunee from their villages, farms and lands in the region in an effort to both avenge and prevent such attacks.\n\nThe region was strategically important to the war plans of both the British and the Continental forces.  British efforts to divide the New England colonies from the rest led to battles including the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]], a significant turning point in the war.  While New York City remained in the hands of the British during most of the war, the upstate region was eventually dominated by the Colonial forces.  At the end of the war, the Continental Army was headquartered in Newburgh.  Uncertain that the Continental Congress would pay back wages, some Continental officers threatened an uprising in what became known as the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]].\n\n===Post-revolutionary period===\nAfter the American Revolution, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] established the border between New York and [[British North America]]. The 45th Parallel became the border with Quebec or [[Lower Canada]].  The St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, the Niagara River and Lake Erie became the border with [[Upper Canada]].  Great Britain continued to occupy military installations along the American shores of the Great Lakes until 1794, including Fort Niagara at the mouth of the Niagara River and Fort Ontario at the mouth of the Oswego River.\n\nThe government of the new State of New York seized the property of New Yorkers who had remained loyal to the British crown.  Thousands emigrated to colonies that remained under British rule, such as Nova Scotia and the newly established Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]).  Haudenosaunee who had fought with the British also fled.  The British Crown granted a large tract of land in Upper Canada to their Haudenosaunee allies, who established the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Grand River]] settlement.\n\nIn the federal [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], the new United States recognized the title of the remaining Haudenosaunee to the land north and west of the Proclamation Line of 1763. Nevertheless, New York state officials and private land agents sought through the early 19th century to extinguish Indian title to these lands via non-Federally-sanctioned treaties, such as the [[Treaty of Big Tree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oswego.edu/library2/archives/digitized_collections/granger/bigtree.html |title=Iroquois Bio |website=Oswego.edu |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref> The [[Treaties of Buffalo Creek]] were designed to finally remove the last of the native claims in Western New York as part of the federal [[Indian Removal]] program, but the purchaser failed to buy most of the land in time, and some of the tribes objected to their exclusion. Three of the four reservations remain in the region to this day; one of the reservations leased out their land to form the city of [[Salamanca (city), New York|Salamanca]], and the coexistence of the predominantly white city and the reservation has been a source of contention since the 1990s.\n\nBoth before and after the Revolution, boundary disputes with other colonies and their successor states also complicated American settlement. In conflict with [[New York Colony]]'s claims west of the Hudson Valley, which placed the entire region in the sprawling [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], [[Pennsylvania Colony]] claimed much of the [[Southern Tier]] until 1774, while [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] claimed all of the region west of Massachusetts to the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Province of New York also claimed jurisdiction east to the Connecticut River.  To pursue this claim north of Connecticut and Massachusetts, New York granted lands to settlers in what is now Vermont at the same time that New Hampshire made grants of the same lands. When Vermont declared independence in 1777, the new Republic of Vermont recognized the New Hampshire grants over those of New York. New Yorkers who lost land in Vermont came to be known as the \"Vermont Sufferers\" and were granted new lands in 1788 in the Town of [[Bainbridge (town), New York|Bainbridge, New York]].\n\nThe dispute with Massachusetts over lands to the west of Massachusetts was settled in the 1786 [[Treaty of Hartford (1786)|Treaty of Hartford]] by dividing the rights to the land. The treaty granted sovereignty to the State of New York, but granted to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the \"pre-emptive\" right to seek title to the land from the Haudenosaunee. The eastern boundary of the Massachusetts lands was thus known as the [[Preemption Line]]. This line runs from the Pennsylvania line due north to Lake Ontario, passing through Seneca Lake. The line was surveyed a second time due to initial errors.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts sold this land in large tracts, including the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] and the [[Holland Purchase]].\n\nMany of the settlers of what then became Central and Western New York came from the New England states. The [[Central New York Military Tract]], where many of the townships were given the names of classical military and literary figures by [[Robert Harpur]], was established to grant land to Revolutionary War veterans. Some of Northern New York was founded by the hundreds of Canadian exiles who had fought in the [[1st Canadian Regiment|First]] and [[2nd Canadian Regiment|Second Canadian Regiments]] of the [[Continental Army]], who were banished from Canada due to their rebellion against the Crown.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|1816 engraving of the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nBattles of the [[War of 1812]] (1812&ndash;1815) were fought on the [[Niagara Frontier]], in the [[Champlain Valley]], including the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], in the [[St. Lawrence Valley]], and on [[Lake Ontario]], including the Battle of [[Sackets Harbor]]. The city of Buffalo was razed by the British as well.<ref name=\"Burning of Buffalo\">{{cite web|title=The Burning of Buffalo, NY|url=http://buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html|work=The Buffalonian|publisher=The People's History Coalition|accessdate=April 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075504/http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html|archive-date=August 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After the war, the US Government began to construct [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Montgomery]] just south of the border at [[Rouses Point]] on [[Lake Champlain]]. Subsequently, it was discovered that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile south of the surveyed line, putting the Fort, which became known as \"Fort Blunder\", in Canada. This was not resolved until 1842 with the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]], in which Great Britain and the United States decided to leave the border on the meandering line as surveyed.\n\n[[History of slavery in New York|Slavery]] existed in [[New Netherland]] and the [[Province of New York]]. New York was in the 1690s the largest importer of slaves among the American colonies. Slavery did not end with the [[American Revolution]], although [[John Jay]] introduced an emancipation bill into the State Assembly as early as 1777. [[Sojourner Truth]] was held as a slave in the [[Hudson Valley]] from the time she was born in 1797 until she escaped in 1826. Through efforts of the [[New York Manumission Society]] and others, New York began to adopt a policy of gradual emancipation in 1799. The law passed in 1817 that would finally emancipate slaves did not take effect for ten years, giving slaveowners an entire decade to sell their slaves away to other states. When the law finally took effect, the last 2,800 slaves in New York State were emancipated on July 4, 1827.\n\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|left|thumb|[[Erie Canal]] at [[Lockport, New York]], in 1839]]\nAlthough routes for travel on foot and by canoe had existed across the region for hundreds of years, transportation of agricultural goods to market was expensive and slow.  Influenced by the canals being built in Britain, leading citizens of New York began to press for the construction of a canal across the state.  Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] prevailed upon the legislature to charter and fund construction of a canal from Albany to Buffalo. Construction of the [[Erie Canal]] began in 1817 and was completed in 1825.  The canal allowed the area to become an important component of the 19th century industrial expansion in the United States. The canal also promoted trade with [[British North America]] and settlement of newer states in western territories. Later in the century the [[New York Central Railroad]] followed the \"water-level route\" from New York City to the Great Lakes, contributing to the industrialization of cities along its route.\n\nSeveral times in the nineteenth century, Upstate New York served as a staging area and refuge for Canadian rebels against Great Britain, as well as Irish-American invaders of Canada, straining British-American relations. In 1837 and 1838, in the aftermath of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]], some [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] rebels escaped south to the North Country, while on the [[Niagara Frontier]], events of the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], also known as the [[Patriot War]], took place. In the late 1860s, some of the [[Fenian Raids]] were launched across the Niagara Frontier; [[Fenians]] also assembled in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone]].\n\nAlthough now largely discredited, the report of the 1905\u201307 [[Mills Commission]], charged with investigating the [[origins of baseball]], named [[Cooperstown]] as the place where [[baseball]] was invented in the 1830s or 1840s by [[Abner Doubleday]]. Cooperstown is the home of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]. (Modern research suggests that the game was actually developed in its modern form in New York City.)\n\nIn the pre-Civil War era, Upstate New York became a major center of radical [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] activity and was an important nexus of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Resistance to the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was particularly heated in the region, as evidenced by such events as the [[Jerry Rescue]]. The American [[women's rights]] movement was also born in Upstate New York at this time. The [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, was held at [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]] in 1848.  The [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Convention]], the second such convention, was held two weeks later in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].\n\nThrough the nineteenth century, Upstate New York was a hotbed of religious revivalism. A number of sects, such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]], established themselves in Upstate New York during that time. This led evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] to coin the term the \"[[Burned-Over District]]\" for the region. Because of the comparative isolation of the region, many of the sects were non-conformist, and because of their non-traditional tenets they had numerous difficulties with government and other local people. The region is considered to be the cradle of [[Mormonism]], as well as the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement. The [[Mormon]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualists]] are the only 21st century survivors of the hundreds of sects created during this time; some more mainstream churches, such as the [[Wesleyan Church]] and [[Free Methodist Church]] (both offshoots of Methodism that originated in political disputes with the mainline [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist church]]), also survive.\n\nIn the 19th century, extractive industries changed the landscape.  [[Potash]] was manufactured as the land was cleared for farming. [[Logging]] was rampant in the Adirondacks. [[Iron]] was mined in the Adirondacks and the North Country. By the 1870s, business leaders, concerned about the effect of deforestation on the water supply necessary to the Erie Canal, advocated for the creation of forest preserves in the Adirondacks and the Catskills. The [[Adirondack Park]] and [[Catskill Park]] were created and strengthened by a series of legislation between 1885 and 1894, when the \"[[Forever wild]]\" provision of the [[New York State Constitution]] was added.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Harvard Mark I.jpg|thumb|[[Harvard Mark I]], one of the earliest [[computer]]s, made by [[IBM]] in [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]]]]\nDuring the era immediately following World War II, Upstate reached what was probably its peak influence in the national economy. Major local corporations such as [[IBM]], [[General Electric]], [[Kodak]], [[Xerox]] and [[Carrier Corporation|Carrier]] had national success,  producing cutting-edge products for business, government and consumers, and leadership in corporate culture. The opening of the [[New York State Thruway]] in the mid-1950s gave the region superior access to other eastern markets. This regional advantage faded as many local firms relocated certain operations to other states, or downsized in the face of foreign competition, similar to events in other areas in the American [[Rust Belt]].\n\nSince the late 20th century, with the decline of manufacturing and its jobs, the area has generally suffered a net population loss, most heavily in Western New York.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} By contrast, many [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] families are recent arrivals to the area and have helped revive agriculture as part of the economy. Beginning in 1974, many Mennonite families moved to the [[Penn Yan]] area of [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]] from [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], seeking cheaper farmland.  Amish communities have also been established in St. Lawrence, [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]] and [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] counties, and are making farming profitable.\n\nArtisans are reviving traditional specialty cheeses, and developing growing markets for their products, including shipping some items to the New York metropolitan market. A Greek-style yogurt, [[Chobani]], is being produced Upstate by a recent immigrant, who has expanded his operation nationally.\n\nAdditionally, Upstate New York continues to boast low crime rates, high educational prospects, and readily affordable daily essentials, earning Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and Buffalo spots in the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine list of top ten places to raise a family in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html|title=America's Best Places To Raise A Family|first=Francesca|last=Levy|date=June 7, 2010|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFive of the six Iroquois nations have filed land claims against New York State (or have sought settlement of pending claims), based on late 18th-century treaties following the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[State of New York]] (which did not have constitutional authority to treat with American Indian nations) and the United States.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2015}}\n{{main|Innovation and business in Upstate New York}}\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Upstate New York}}\nOften attributed to the region's semi-rural to rural character, there is more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] in culture and politics than found in the more urban downstate area, and the region is the power base of the state's [[New York Republican State Committee|Republican Party]].

Bush]] by fewer than 1,500 votes (1,553,246 votes to 1,551,971) in the Upstate Region.\n\n=== Relationship with New York City ===\n{{see also|Secession in New York#Upstate secession|label 1=Upstate secession}}\nNew York City is dependent on upstate for a variety of services; the latter is the source of the city's water supply via the [[Delaware Aqueduct]] and the [[Catskill Aqueduct]]; much of the city's electric power supply comes from state owned [[Niagara Falls hydroelectric generating plants|hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]]; and most of the state's prisons are upstate; hence the popular term \"being sent up the river\" (however, the term originally referred to [[Sing Sing]], which is \"up the Hudson River\" from New York City, but being in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County]] is still in the \"downstate\" region). Conversely, the operation of state facilities providing these services is an important part of the upstate economy.\n\n== Historic events ==\n<!--Keep in chronological order-->\n*[[Battle of Valcour Island]], 1776\n*[[Battle of Oriskany]], 1777\n*[[Battles of Saratoga]], turning point of the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1777\n*[[Cherry Valley massacre]], 1778\n*[[Sullivan Campaign]], 1779\n*[[Second Great Awakening]] in the [[burned-over district]], early 1800s\n*[[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|The Morgan Affair]], 1826\n*Publication of the [[Book of Mormon]], 1830\n*[[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention held in the United States, 1848\n*[[Jerry Rescue]], 1851\n*[[The Angola Horror|Angola Horror]] train wreck, 1867 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/wkbkch02.Html |title=Notes on Railroad Accidents - 1879 |website=Catskillarchive.com |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n*First execution via the [[electric chair]], in [[Auburn Prison]] in 1890\n*[[William McKinley assassination|Assassination of President William McKinley]] in Buffalo, 1901\n*Anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]], McKinley's assassin, convicted at trial and electrocuted in [[Auburn Prison]], 1901\n*[[Split Rock, New York|Split Rock]] Explosion, 1918\n*[[Remington Rand strike of 1936\u20131937]]\n*[[Continental Charters Flight 44-2]], 1951\n*[[Allegheny Reservoir]] construction, 1961\u20131967\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 1965]]\n*[[Woodstock]] music festival, 1969\n*[[Attica Prison riot]], 1971\n*[[Hurricane Agnes]], 1972\n*Collapse of [[New York State Thruway]] bridge over [[Schoharie Creek]], 1987 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007211915/http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2006 }}</ref>\n*[[New York State Labor Day derechos]], 1998\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 2003]]\n*[[Continental Airlines Flight 3407]], 2009\n*[[Binghamton shootings]], 2009\n*[[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], 2011\n*[[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]], 2011\n*[[Clinton Correctional Facility escape]], 2015\n\n===Journalists===\n*[[Gordon Ackerman]]\n*[[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], muckraker, born in [[Dunkirk, New York|Dunkirk]]\n*[[Wolf Blitzer]] was raised in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\n*[[Amy Dickinson]], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' advice columnist, who grew up on a dairy farm in [[Freeville, New York|Freeville]]\n*[[Frederick Douglass]] (1818&ndash;1895), editor and publisher of abolitionist newspapers: ''[[North Star (newspaper)|The North Star]]'', published in Rochester, ''Frederick Douglass Weekly'', ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'', ''Douglass' Monthly'' and ''New National Era''.\n*[[Ira Joe Fisher]], author and weatherman, who was born and raised in [[Little Valley (village), New York|Little Valley]]\n*[[Megyn Kelly]]\n*[[Verlyn Klinkenborg]], member of the ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial board; writer and farmer\n*[[Francis Mallison]] of [[Rome, New York|Rome]].

The region saw many battles between the [[Continental Army]] and the Iroquois, and several treaties drawn up after the war ceded much of the land to settlers of European descent. It is largely rural with rugged terrain.\n\nUpstate New York was transformed by the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, which greatly eased the movement of goods from the upper midwest, the cities along the [[Great Lakes]], and Upstate New York, to the port of New York City. As a result, Upstate became a hotbed for manufacturing, giving birth to such firms as [[General Electric]], [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Xerox]], and it welcomed a large influx of immigrants.

The [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] supply New York City's water.  The region is home to several popular tourist and recreational destinations, including [[Niagara Falls]], the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondack]] and [[Catskill Mountains]], and the [[Finger Lakes]], the latter created by retreating [[glacier]]s.\n\nBecause of its geography, rivers have played a very important role in Upstate New York's history. All the above cities are on navigable or formerly navigable rivers or lakes. Until railroads arrived around 1850, New York ran on rivers: the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], its tributary the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]], and to a lesser extent the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and its tributary the [[Chemung River|Chemung]]. There was regular [[steamboat]] service along the Hudson River between New York City and Albany beginning in 1807, the first such regular service in the world. There was regular commercial and passenger transportation along the Mohawk in small boats until the Erie Canal opened. Utica, which is about as far as you can go on the Mohawk, was in the early nineteenth century a busy port and the economic capital of western New York. The Erie Canal was the biggest and most expensive engineering project in the world up to that date, and even if upstream speed was at first that of a mule, its economic importance was immense, and it transformed the state of New York.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Map of New York Highlighting New York City.svg|thumb|right|New York City is highlighted in red; \"Upstate\" refers to some or all of the area north and west of the city.]]\n[[File:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] across the [[Hudson River]], as seen from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]].

This latter boundary places most, but not all, of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] Counties in Downstate, while putting the northwestern edge of Rockland County as well as the northernmost quarter of Westchester County (including [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]]) in Upstate; area residents often use [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] to delineate the boundary between upstate and downstate New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pad.human.cornell.edu/maps2010/maps/NY%20Urban%20Area%20Maps.pdf |format=PDF |title=NY Urbanized Area Maps : Area and Density |website=Pad.human.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>{{Failed verification|talkpage=Talk:Upstate_New_York#Upstate_again|reason=nothing in the preceding paragraph is supported by the reference|date=February 2016}}\n\nYet another usage follows the  U.S. Census definition of the [[New York metropolitan area]] prior to 2010, which included Westchester, Rockland, and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] Counties.

Most of New York State is characterized both by agricultural and forested rural communities, and by small and medium-sized cities and their surrounding suburbs located along major transportation corridors.  The state's major metropolitan areas outside of New York City are Buffalo, Rochester, Albany-Schenectady-Troy, and Syracuse, each of whose population exceeds 500,000.\n\nThe different regions of New York State are influenced by and have affinities with other adjacent regions.  Western New York has cultural and economic ties to the other [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes states]] as well as [[Southern Ontario]].  The [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], the Hudson Valley, the [[Mohawk Valley]] and the [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] area have ties to [[New England]]. The North Country, the extreme northern portion of the state, also has strong cultural, economic, linguistic and familial ties to [[Quebec]] and [[Eastern Ontario]].  Thus, Plattsburgh has close ties to its neighbors in the Montreal area as well as Vermont.  Much of New York State receives television and radio broadcasts from Canada and there are often other cross-border ties, both historical and familial.  A similar relationship can be seen in Northern [[New England]].\n\nLinguistically, upstate New York from Western New York east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] is part of the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]] region of American English dialectology, a region which includes Midwestern cities as far west as [[Chicago]] and [[Milwaukee]]. The Hudson and lower Mohawk Valley has more in common dialectologically with western New England and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~dinkin/GapHandout.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925234304/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~dinkin/GapHandout.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2007 }}</ref>  The boundary between the use of the words ''pop'' and ''soda'' to refer to soft drinks, however, falls farther west than the edge of the Inland North, running just to around the city of Rochester: Buffalo and areas west of Rochester use ''pop'', like the rest of the Inland North to the west, whereas areas east of Rochester, like Syracuse and Binghamton, use ''soda'', like New England and New York City. In Ithaca and Elmira, the border is less clear, with some people having grown up with ''pop'' and some with ''soda''; however, current trends see Ithaca, at least, turning to mostly \"soda.\"\n\n[[File:Swami opening.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremony at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]]]\n\n[[Foodways]] indigenous to regions of Upstate New York include:\n* [[Buffalo wings]] and [[beef on weck sandwich]] (Buffalo)\n*the [[Robert C.

In the center of the Finger Lakes region, [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] is known for the Bo Burger, a cheeseburger with a fried egg on top.\n\nTwo of the most important [[rock festival]]s of the 20th century were held in Upstate New York. In 1969 the [[Woodstock Festival]] was held in [[Bethel, New York]], while in 1973 another [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen|multiday festival]] was held at the [[Watkins Glen International Raceway]].\n\nSome literary, documentary and cinematic depictions of upstate present a sense of small town, simple lifestyles, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', set in a small upstate town (probably based on [[Seneca Falls, New York|Seneca Falls]]) in the 1940s.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.svg|thumb|right|Ancestries from across the United States]] \nThe population of New York State is 19,746,227, with 11,323,961 living in either New York City or Long Island,{{when|date=January 2019}} leaving 8,422,266 for the entire rest of the state. This means Upstate NY has a population density far lower than that of downstate. Upstate is typified by farmland and forest, many large lakes, and two (major) mountain ranges, with a few metro areas dotting the map.\nResidents of [[English Americans|English]] colonial ancestry are common, as well as [[German Americans|German]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[Italian Americans|Italian]], with most metropolitan counties having a similar number of residents from each group.  The North Country is heavily French Canadian. Italian Americans are the largest ethnic group in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady County]], as well as in some counties in the [[Hudson Valley]] that are closest to [[New York City]]. Irish Americans represent the largest ethnic group from the Capital District, Syracuse, Binghamton, and the rest of the Hudson Valley, though they also have large Italian American populations; Irish population is consistently above 15% in most of upstate New York (reaching over 20% in the upper Hudson Valley), compared to less than 8% in most of New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2015/03/which_county_is_the_most_irish_in_new_york_state_list.html|title=Which county is the most Irish in New York state?

[[African Americans]], while not as numerous as in New York City, make up at least 25% of the residents in cities such as Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany.\n\nThere is also a significant presence of the indigenous [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] or Six Nations in the region, who retain several reservations: the [[Seneca nation]] and [[Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians]] in Western New York, the [[Onondaga nation]] south of Syracuse, the [[Oneida nation]] of Oneida County and the [[Mohawk nation]] in [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]]. Members of the Six Nations also live in the cities of Upstate New York.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Whiteface Mountain from Lake Placid Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Whiteface Mountain]], in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]]]]\nThe headwaters of the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]], Hudson, and [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] rivers are located in the region. The region is characterized by the major mountain ranges, large lakes, and extensive forests.\n\n[[File:Canisteo valley 1453.JPG|left|thumb|Canisteo River Valley in the [[Allegheny Plateau]]]]\nThe [[Allegheny Plateau]] extends into west and central New York from the south. The Catskill Mountains lie in the southeastern part of the state, closer to New York City. The Catskills and the Allegheny Plateau are both part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The northernmost part of the state contains the Adirondack Mountains, which are sometimes considered part of the Appalachians but are geologically separate, a southern extension of the [[Canadian Shield]].\n\nIn the more mountainous eastern part of Upstate New York, the valleys of the Hudson River and the [[Mohawk River]] were historically important travel corridors and remain so today. Western New York in the vicinity of Buffalo is very flat, as it was once the bottom of a glacial lake. The only \"hills\" in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]] are the [[Niagara Escarpment]], which formed the [[Niagara Falls|Falls]].\n\nUpstate has a long shared border with Canadian province of [[Ontario]] divided by water; including the [[Lake Erie]], [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Ontario]] and the St. Lawrence River. It shares a land border with the province of [[Quebec]] in the northernmost part of the state.\n\nThe sizes of upstate counties and towns are generally larger in area and smaller in population, compared with the downstate region, although there are exceptions. The state's smallest county in population ([[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton County]]) and largest county in area ([[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]] on the state's northern border) are both in Upstate New York, while the largest in population ([[Kings County, New York|Kings County]]) and smallest in area ([[Manhattan|New York County]]) are both part of New York City.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:NYlakeeffectsnow.png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Average seasonal snowfall totals for areas subject to lake-effect snow in New York (in inches).<ref name=NWS_snowseason>{{cite web|title=Average Seasonal Snowfall Over the Eastern Great Lakes Region |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210074031/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |website=Erh.noaa.gov |author=NOAA's National Weather Service |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>]]Upstate New York is well known for its cold and snowy winters, particularly in comparison to the more temperate climate of downstate New York.

The villages of [[Old Forge, New York|Old Forge]] and [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]], both in the Adirondacks, often vie on winter nights with places like [[International Falls, Minnesota]] and [[Fargo, North Dakota]] for the coldest spot in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Osborn |first=Liz |url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/coldest.php |title=Coldest Places in United States |publisher=Current Results |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany of the features of the upstate landscape, such as the [[Finger Lakes]] and the [[drumlin]]s that dot the region, are the result of [[glacier]]s during the [[Ice Age]].\n\n====Statistics for selected cities====\n{{#lst:Albany, New York|weather box}}\n{{#lst:Binghamton, New York|weather box}}\n{{Buffalo, New York weatherbox|collapsed=Y}}\n{{Rochester, New York weatherbox}}\n{{#lst:Syracuse, New York|weather box}}\n{{wide image|Niagra Falls-wide image-NPS.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|[[Niagara Falls]] in the [[Niagara Falls National Heritage Area]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Theiroquoislonghouse.png|thumb|Traditional Iroquois [[longhouse]]]]\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the area was long inhabited by [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people (mainly west of the Hudson and around the Great Lakes), and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking people (mainly east of the Hudson). The conflict between the two peoples continued through the period of early European colonization, and the French, Dutch and English tended to ally with their trading partners among the indigenous peoples. The Haudenosaunee or [[Iroquois confederacy]] of the Five (later Six) Nations was a powerful force in its home territory. The Five Nations' territory extended from the Mohawk River Valley through the western part of the state and into current Pennsylvania. From this home base they also controlled at various times large swaths of additional territory throughout what is now the northeastern United States. The [[Guswhenta (Two Row Wampum Treaty)]], made with the Dutch government in 1613, codified relations between the Haudenosaunee and European colonizers, and formed the basis of subsequent treaties. In the mid-17th century, during the [[Beaver Wars]], the Iroquois were victorious and dominated the tribes of [[Neutral Nation|Neutral Indians]], [[Wenrohronon]] and the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie Indians]] in Western New York. (Survivors were mostly assimilated into the [[Seneca people]] of the Iroquois; some are believed to have escaped to South Carolina, where they merged with other Indian tribes.)\n\nThe region was important from the first days of both [[France|French]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonization In the seventeenth century.  The [[New Netherland]] colony encompassed the Hudson Valley from Manhattan island north to the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where [[Fort Orange]] (later Albany) was established in 1623. The fort at [[Schenectady, New York]] was built in 1661.  The upper Hudson Valley was the center of much of the colony's [[fur trade]], which was highly lucrative, serving a demand for furs in Europe.\n\nNorth and west of New Netherland, the French established trading posts along the St. Lawrence River and as far south as the shores of [[Onondaga Lake]]. They found both trading and proselytizing difficult among the Haudenosaunee, as [[Samuel de Champlain]] had alienated the Haudenosaunee during military forays from [[New France]].  In the 1640s, three [[Jesuit missions in North America#Missions|French Jesuit missionaries]] to New France \u2014St. [[Ren\u00e9 Goupil]], St. [[Isaac Jogues]], and St. [[Jean de Lalande]]\u2014were killed near the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, which was located at the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers, where the modern town of [[Auriesville, New York|Auriesville]] was later developed. They are considered to be the first three [[List of American saints and beatified people|U.S. saints]].\n\nEngland seized New Netherland by force in 1664, renaming it New York.  The Dutch recaptured the colony nine years later, but ceded it to England under the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] of 1674.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the British consolidated their hold on the region.  [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], a Scottish trader, established an estate in the Mohawk Valley, living among the Mohawk, learning their language, and forging an alliance with them. He was appointed as the British Indian agent to the Iroquois. The British also encouraged settlement in the Mohawk Valley by other Europeans, including [[German Palatines]] beginning in the 1720s.\n\nIn what became known as the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754, delegates from seven of the thirteen British North American colonies met at Albany to pursue a treaty with the powerful Mohawk. [[Benjamin Franklin]], a Pennsylvania delegate, proposed a plan for uniting the seven colonies that greatly exceeded the scope of the congress. The delegates spent most of their time debating this [[Albany Plan]] of union, one of the first attempts to form a union of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] \"under one government as far as might be necessary for defense and other general important purposes\".<ref>''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin'', Second Edition.  Yale University Press, 1964. pp.209-210</ref>  The delegates approved an amended version, but the colonies rejected it.\n\nTo counter the French militarily, the British established forts along Lake Ontario and at portages between the Mohawk Valley and the adjacent Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario watersheds. The region became the area for many conflicts of the [[French and Indian War]], such as the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)]] and the [[Siege of Fort William Henry]] (which was later depicted in the work of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]), during the [[Seven Years' War]].\n\nThe British conquered New France by 1760 with the fall of Quebec.  France formally ceded New France to the British in the [[Treaty of Paris of 1763]].  The same year, [[King George III]] issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which established the western and northern boundary of the Province of New York at the limits of the Hudson, Mohawk and Delaware River watersheds.  The area between that boundary and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, including west of the Appalachian Mountains, was to be the \"[[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].\"\n\n===American Revolution===\n\n[[File:Incident in cherry valley.jpg|thumb|[[Cherry Valley massacre]]]]\nBetween 1774 and 1783, deeply divided colonists waged civil war on each other directly and by proxy, through attacks such as the Seneca-led [[Cherry Valley massacre|Cherry Valley]] and the Mohawk-led [[Battle of Cobleskill|Cobleskill]] massacre.  In 1779, the [[Sullivan Expedition]], a campaign by the Continental Army ordered by General [[George Washington]], drove thousands of the Haudenosaunee from their villages, farms and lands in the region in an effort to both avenge and prevent such attacks.\n\nThe region was strategically important to the war plans of both the British and the Continental forces.  British efforts to divide the New England colonies from the rest led to battles including the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]], a significant turning point in the war.  While New York City remained in the hands of the British during most of the war, the upstate region was eventually dominated by the Colonial forces.  At the end of the war, the Continental Army was headquartered in Newburgh.  Uncertain that the Continental Congress would pay back wages, some Continental officers threatened an uprising in what became known as the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]].\n\n===Post-revolutionary period===\nAfter the American Revolution, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] established the border between New York and [[British North America]]. The 45th Parallel became the border with Quebec or [[Lower Canada]].  The St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, the Niagara River and Lake Erie became the border with [[Upper Canada]].  Great Britain continued to occupy military installations along the American shores of the Great Lakes until 1794, including Fort Niagara at the mouth of the Niagara River and Fort Ontario at the mouth of the Oswego River.\n\nThe government of the new State of New York seized the property of New Yorkers who had remained loyal to the British crown.  Thousands emigrated to colonies that remained under British rule, such as Nova Scotia and the newly established Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]).  Haudenosaunee who had fought with the British also fled.  The British Crown granted a large tract of land in Upper Canada to their Haudenosaunee allies, who established the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Grand River]] settlement.\n\nIn the federal [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], the new United States recognized the title of the remaining Haudenosaunee to the land north and west of the Proclamation Line of 1763. Nevertheless, New York state officials and private land agents sought through the early 19th century to extinguish Indian title to these lands via non-Federally-sanctioned treaties, such as the [[Treaty of Big Tree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oswego.edu/library2/archives/digitized_collections/granger/bigtree.html |title=Iroquois Bio |website=Oswego.edu |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref> The [[Treaties of Buffalo Creek]] were designed to finally remove the last of the native claims in Western New York as part of the federal [[Indian Removal]] program, but the purchaser failed to buy most of the land in time, and some of the tribes objected to their exclusion. Three of the four reservations remain in the region to this day; one of the reservations leased out their land to form the city of [[Salamanca (city), New York|Salamanca]], and the coexistence of the predominantly white city and the reservation has been a source of contention since the 1990s.\n\nBoth before and after the Revolution, boundary disputes with other colonies and their successor states also complicated American settlement. In conflict with [[New York Colony]]'s claims west of the Hudson Valley, which placed the entire region in the sprawling [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], [[Pennsylvania Colony]] claimed much of the [[Southern Tier]] until 1774, while [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] claimed all of the region west of Massachusetts to the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Province of New York also claimed jurisdiction east to the Connecticut River.  To pursue this claim north of Connecticut and Massachusetts, New York granted lands to settlers in what is now Vermont at the same time that New Hampshire made grants of the same lands. When Vermont declared independence in 1777, the new Republic of Vermont recognized the New Hampshire grants over those of New York. New Yorkers who lost land in Vermont came to be known as the \"Vermont Sufferers\" and were granted new lands in 1788 in the Town of [[Bainbridge (town), New York|Bainbridge, New York]].\n\nThe dispute with Massachusetts over lands to the west of Massachusetts was settled in the 1786 [[Treaty of Hartford (1786)|Treaty of Hartford]] by dividing the rights to the land. The treaty granted sovereignty to the State of New York, but granted to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the \"pre-emptive\" right to seek title to the land from the Haudenosaunee. The eastern boundary of the Massachusetts lands was thus known as the [[Preemption Line]]. This line runs from the Pennsylvania line due north to Lake Ontario, passing through Seneca Lake. The line was surveyed a second time due to initial errors.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts sold this land in large tracts, including the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] and the [[Holland Purchase]].\n\nMany of the settlers of what then became Central and Western New York came from the New England states. The [[Central New York Military Tract]], where many of the townships were given the names of classical military and literary figures by [[Robert Harpur]], was established to grant land to Revolutionary War veterans. Some of Northern New York was founded by the hundreds of Canadian exiles who had fought in the [[1st Canadian Regiment|First]] and [[2nd Canadian Regiment|Second Canadian Regiments]] of the [[Continental Army]], who were banished from Canada due to their rebellion against the Crown.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|1816 engraving of the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nBattles of the [[War of 1812]] (1812&ndash;1815) were fought on the [[Niagara Frontier]], in the [[Champlain Valley]], including the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], in the [[St. Lawrence Valley]], and on [[Lake Ontario]], including the Battle of [[Sackets Harbor]]. The city of Buffalo was razed by the British as well.<ref name=\"Burning of Buffalo\">{{cite web|title=The Burning of Buffalo, NY|url=http://buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html|work=The Buffalonian|publisher=The People's History Coalition|accessdate=April 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075504/http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html|archive-date=August 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After the war, the US Government began to construct [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Montgomery]] just south of the border at [[Rouses Point]] on [[Lake Champlain]]. Subsequently, it was discovered that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile south of the surveyed line, putting the Fort, which became known as \"Fort Blunder\", in Canada. This was not resolved until 1842 with the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]], in which Great Britain and the United States decided to leave the border on the meandering line as surveyed.\n\n[[History of slavery in New York|Slavery]] existed in [[New Netherland]] and the [[Province of New York]]. New York was in the 1690s the largest importer of slaves among the American colonies. Slavery did not end with the [[American Revolution]], although [[John Jay]] introduced an emancipation bill into the State Assembly as early as 1777. [[Sojourner Truth]] was held as a slave in the [[Hudson Valley]] from the time she was born in 1797 until she escaped in 1826. Through efforts of the [[New York Manumission Society]] and others, New York began to adopt a policy of gradual emancipation in 1799. The law passed in 1817 that would finally emancipate slaves did not take effect for ten years, giving slaveowners an entire decade to sell their slaves away to other states. When the law finally took effect, the last 2,800 slaves in New York State were emancipated on July 4, 1827.\n\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|left|thumb|[[Erie Canal]] at [[Lockport, New York]], in 1839]]\nAlthough routes for travel on foot and by canoe had existed across the region for hundreds of years, transportation of agricultural goods to market was expensive and slow.  Influenced by the canals being built in Britain, leading citizens of New York began to press for the construction of a canal across the state.  Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] prevailed upon the legislature to charter and fund construction of a canal from Albany to Buffalo. Construction of the [[Erie Canal]] began in 1817 and was completed in 1825.  The canal allowed the area to become an important component of the 19th century industrial expansion in the United States. The canal also promoted trade with [[British North America]] and settlement of newer states in western territories. Later in the century the [[New York Central Railroad]] followed the \"water-level route\" from New York City to the Great Lakes, contributing to the industrialization of cities along its route.\n\nSeveral times in the nineteenth century, Upstate New York served as a staging area and refuge for Canadian rebels against Great Britain, as well as Irish-American invaders of Canada, straining British-American relations. In 1837 and 1838, in the aftermath of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]], some [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] rebels escaped south to the North Country, while on the [[Niagara Frontier]], events of the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], also known as the [[Patriot War]], took place. In the late 1860s, some of the [[Fenian Raids]] were launched across the Niagara Frontier; [[Fenians]] also assembled in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone]].\n\nAlthough now largely discredited, the report of the 1905\u201307 [[Mills Commission]], charged with investigating the [[origins of baseball]], named [[Cooperstown]] as the place where [[baseball]] was invented in the 1830s or 1840s by [[Abner Doubleday]]. Cooperstown is the home of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]. (Modern research suggests that the game was actually developed in its modern form in New York City.)\n\nIn the pre-Civil War era, Upstate New York became a major center of radical [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] activity and was an important nexus of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Resistance to the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was particularly heated in the region, as evidenced by such events as the [[Jerry Rescue]]. The American [[women's rights]] movement was also born in Upstate New York at this time. The [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, was held at [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]] in 1848.  The [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Convention]], the second such convention, was held two weeks later in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].\n\nThrough the nineteenth century, Upstate New York was a hotbed of religious revivalism. A number of sects, such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]], established themselves in Upstate New York during that time. This led evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] to coin the term the \"[[Burned-Over District]]\" for the region. Because of the comparative isolation of the region, many of the sects were non-conformist, and because of their non-traditional tenets they had numerous difficulties with government and other local people. The region is considered to be the cradle of [[Mormonism]], as well as the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement. The [[Mormon]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualists]] are the only 21st century survivors of the hundreds of sects created during this time; some more mainstream churches, such as the [[Wesleyan Church]] and [[Free Methodist Church]] (both offshoots of Methodism that originated in political disputes with the mainline [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist church]]), also survive.\n\nIn the 19th century, extractive industries changed the landscape.  [[Potash]] was manufactured as the land was cleared for farming. [[Logging]] was rampant in the Adirondacks. [[Iron]] was mined in the Adirondacks and the North Country. By the 1870s, business leaders, concerned about the effect of deforestation on the water supply necessary to the Erie Canal, advocated for the creation of forest preserves in the Adirondacks and the Catskills. The [[Adirondack Park]] and [[Catskill Park]] were created and strengthened by a series of legislation between 1885 and 1894, when the \"[[Forever wild]]\" provision of the [[New York State Constitution]] was added.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Harvard Mark I.jpg|thumb|[[Harvard Mark I]], one of the earliest [[computer]]s, made by [[IBM]] in [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]]]]\nDuring the era immediately following World War II, Upstate reached what was probably its peak influence in the national economy. Major local corporations such as [[IBM]], [[General Electric]], [[Kodak]], [[Xerox]] and [[Carrier Corporation|Carrier]] had national success,  producing cutting-edge products for business, government and consumers, and leadership in corporate culture. The opening of the [[New York State Thruway]] in the mid-1950s gave the region superior access to other eastern markets. This regional advantage faded as many local firms relocated certain operations to other states, or downsized in the face of foreign competition, similar to events in other areas in the American [[Rust Belt]].\n\nSince the late 20th century, with the decline of manufacturing and its jobs, the area has generally suffered a net population loss, most heavily in Western New York.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} By contrast, many [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] families are recent arrivals to the area and have helped revive agriculture as part of the economy. Beginning in 1974, many Mennonite families moved to the [[Penn Yan]] area of [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]] from [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], seeking cheaper farmland.  Amish communities have also been established in St. Lawrence, [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]] and [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] counties, and are making farming profitable.\n\nArtisans are reviving traditional specialty cheeses, and developing growing markets for their products, including shipping some items to the New York metropolitan market. A Greek-style yogurt, [[Chobani]], is being produced Upstate by a recent immigrant, who has expanded his operation nationally.\n\nAdditionally, Upstate New York continues to boast low crime rates, high educational prospects, and readily affordable daily essentials, earning Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and Buffalo spots in the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine list of top ten places to raise a family in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html|title=America's Best Places To Raise A Family|first=Francesca|last=Levy|date=June 7, 2010|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFive of the six Iroquois nations have filed land claims against New York State (or have sought settlement of pending claims), based on late 18th-century treaties following the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[State of New York]] (which did not have constitutional authority to treat with American Indian nations) and the United States.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2015}}\n{{main|Innovation and business in Upstate New York}}\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Upstate New York}}\nOften attributed to the region's semi-rural to rural character, there is more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] in culture and politics than found in the more urban downstate area, and the region is the power base of the state's [[New York Republican State Committee|Republican Party]]. Upstate New York does however have several [[New York State Democratic Committee|Democratic]]-dominated counties, including [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] (Buffalo), [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] (Rochester), [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] (Syracuse), [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]] (Ithaca), and [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] (Albany).\n\nAs a whole, Upstate New York is roughly equally divided in federal elections between Democrats and Republicans. In [[U.S. presidential election, 2004, in New York|2004]], [[John Kerry]] defeated [[George W. Bush]] by fewer than 1,500 votes (1,553,246 votes to 1,551,971) in the Upstate Region.\n\n=== Relationship with New York City ===\n{{see also|Secession in New York#Upstate secession|label 1=Upstate secession}}\nNew York City is dependent on upstate for a variety of services; the latter is the source of the city's water supply via the [[Delaware Aqueduct]] and the [[Catskill Aqueduct]]; much of the city's electric power supply comes from state owned [[Niagara Falls hydroelectric generating plants|hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]]; and most of the state's prisons are upstate; hence the popular term \"being sent up the river\" (however, the term originally referred to [[Sing Sing]], which is \"up the Hudson River\" from New York City, but being in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County]] is still in the \"downstate\" region). Conversely, the operation of state facilities providing these services is an important part of the upstate economy.\n\n== Historic events ==\n<!--Keep in chronological order-->\n*[[Battle of Valcour Island]], 1776\n*[[Battle of Oriskany]], 1777\n*[[Battles of Saratoga]], turning point of the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1777\n*[[Cherry Valley massacre]], 1778\n*[[Sullivan Campaign]], 1779\n*[[Second Great Awakening]] in the [[burned-over district]], early 1800s\n*[[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|The Morgan Affair]], 1826\n*Publication of the [[Book of Mormon]], 1830\n*[[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention held in the United States, 1848\n*[[Jerry Rescue]], 1851\n*[[The Angola Horror|Angola Horror]] train wreck, 1867 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/wkbkch02.Html |title=Notes on Railroad Accidents - 1879 |website=Catskillarchive.com |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n*First execution via the [[electric chair]], in [[Auburn Prison]] in 1890\n*[[William McKinley assassination|Assassination of President William McKinley]] in Buffalo, 1901\n*Anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]], McKinley's assassin, convicted at trial and electrocuted in [[Auburn Prison]], 1901\n*[[Split Rock, New York|Split Rock]] Explosion, 1918\n*[[Remington Rand strike of 1936\u20131937]]\n*[[Continental Charters Flight 44-2]], 1951\n*[[Allegheny Reservoir]] construction, 1961\u20131967\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 1965]]\n*[[Woodstock]] music festival, 1969\n*[[Attica Prison riot]], 1971\n*[[Hurricane Agnes]], 1972\n*Collapse of [[New York State Thruway]] bridge over [[Schoharie Creek]], 1987 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007211915/http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2006 }}</ref>\n*[[New York State Labor Day derechos]], 1998\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 2003]]\n*[[Continental Airlines Flight 3407]], 2009\n*[[Binghamton shootings]], 2009\n*[[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], 2011\n*[[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]], 2011\n*[[Clinton Correctional Facility escape]], 2015\n\n===Journalists===\n*[[Gordon Ackerman]]\n*[[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], muckraker, born in [[Dunkirk, New York|Dunkirk]]\n*[[Wolf Blitzer]] was raised in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\n*[[Amy Dickinson]], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' advice columnist, who grew up on a dairy farm in [[Freeville, New York|Freeville]]\n*[[Frederick Douglass]] (1818&ndash;1895), editor and publisher of abolitionist newspapers: ''[[North Star (newspaper)|The North Star]]'', published in Rochester, ''Frederick Douglass Weekly'', ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'', ''Douglass' Monthly'' and ''New National Era''.\n*[[Ira Joe Fisher]], author and weatherman, who was born and raised in [[Little Valley (village), New York|Little Valley]]\n*[[Megyn Kelly]]\n*[[Verlyn Klinkenborg]], member of the ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial board; writer and farmer\n*[[Francis Mallison]] of [[Rome, New York|Rome]].
