Pictures]]. Based on the unpublished children's book ''Yeti Tracks'' by [[Sergio Pablos]], the film was co-written and directed by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], and stars the voices of [[Channing Tatum]], [[James Corden]], [[Zendaya]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[LeBron James]], [[Gina Rodriguez]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Yara Shahidi]], [[Ely Henry]], and [[Jimmy Tatro]]. The plot follows a group of [[Yeti]] who come across a human, with each species thinking the other was just a myth.\n\n''Smallfoot'' was theatrically released in the United States on September 28, 2018. It received a moderately positive reception from critics and was a box office success, grossing over $214 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nA village of [[Yeti]]s lives in isolation on the top of a mountain in the [[Himalayas]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Peter|url=https://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/channing-tatum-belts-out-tune-in-smallfoot/news-story/8aad30b072ffad2b0e520d16a2fee43d|title=Channing Tatum belts out tune in Smallfoot|website=News.co.au|archivedate=September 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> above the clouds and hidden away from sight. Migo is a yeti who abides by the law of the ancient stones held by the Stonekeeper, the yetis' leader. Migo's father, Dorgle, projects himself through the air each morning to hit a gong with his head, as the yetis believe this allows the sun to rise. While learning how to ring the gong, Migo is distracted by the Stonekeeper's daughter, Meechee, whom he has a crush on, and misses the gong, landing outside the village. There, Migo witnesses a plane crash and finds a \"smallfoot\" (human), whom the yetis believe is mythical. Migo runs back to inform the villagers, but because he lacks proof, Stonekeeper claims he is lying and banishes him from the village. Migo is suddenly visited by rejected yetis Gwangi, Kolka, and Fleem who bring him to the Smallfoot Evidentiary Society, which is led by Meechee. She convinces Migo travel below the clouds despite the stones telling them that there is nothing underneath. After some hesitation, Migo agrees to go, but his rope snaps and Migo falls, where he discovers land.\n\nPercy Patterson is a British human filmmaker of wildlife documentaries who has lost most of his viewership. He meets the pilot who saw Migo, and in an attempt to regain his fame, tries unsuccessfully to convince his assistant, Brenda, to dress up as a yeti for filming. Migo arrives and unknowingly scares Percy when trying to communicate with him. Migo takes Percy with him and they stop in a cave to wait out a blizzard. Percy films and uploads a video of Migo narrating that the Yeti plans to eat him, before attempting to escape. While chasing Percy, Migo's toe becomes caught in a bear trap and Percy takes pity on him by removing the trap and bandaging Migo's wound. Percy agrees to go with Migo and they head back up the mountain, where they reunite with the S.E.S.\n\nThe villagers are confused by Percy's appearance, but happily accept him and learn about his culture, much to Stonekeeper's dismay. Afterwards, Stonekeeper takes Migo inside the palace and reveals the truth: yetis used to live below the clouds, but were forced into hiding by the humans who attacked them. To keep them safe, they created the stones, and the clouds are actually steam made by the yetis' daily tasks to keep them hidden. In order to protect the village, Migo agrees to continue the lie by telling the yetis that Percy, who is experiencing [[high altitude sickness]], is just a hairless [[wild yak]]. Stonekeeper takes Percy and locks him in a box, so Percy will be unable to alert other humans of the yetis' whereabouts. Migo later discovers that Meechee took Percy away to return him home, and jumps down the mountain with Gwangi and Kolka following suit.\n\nPercy recovers and discovers that his video of Migo has generated public excitement, but then notices that Meechee has become distracted by the wonders in [[Kathmandu]] and accidentally causes a disruption. Meechee is attacked by the police, but is rescued by Gwangi, Kolka and Migo. The yetis try to make it back to the mountain, but are chased by a SWAT helicopter that Stonekeeper takes down using his stones. Migo attempts to divert the police away from the other yetis, when Percy arrives on his snowmobile and shoots Migo with a tranquilizer gun to save him. The police chase and capture Percy in his yeti suit, and arrest him for public disturbance and fraud.\n\nBack at the village, inside the palace, Migo and Stonekeeper explain the truth to the yetis while Migo apologizes for lying to them. Migo tells the others that even though humans may still be scared of the yetis, they should try to communicate with them. The yetis leave the village, and when Percy and Brenda notice them, they emerge from the crowd and stand up for the yetis. The rest of the humans slowly welcome the yetis and accept them into their lives.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n*[[Channing Tatum]] as Migo, a young male [[yeti]] who is determined to prove the existence of the Smallfoot.\n*[[James Corden]] as Percy Patterson, a British [[human]] [[filmmaker]] of wildlife documentaries trying to get back in the spotlight, who becomes Migo's Smallfoot-best friend.\n*[[Zendaya]] as Meechee, a young female yeti, the Stonekeeper's daughter, Thorp's younger sister, the leader of S.E.S., and Migo's love interest.\n*[[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Stonekeeper, the condescending yeti [[Tribal chief|chief]] and father of Thorp and Meechee.\n*[[LeBron James]] as Gwangi, a large purple male yeti who is part of the S.E.S.\n*[[Gina Rodriguez]] as Kolka, a female yeti who is part of the S.E.S.\n*[[Danny DeVito]] as Dorgle, a short male yeti who is the village gong ringer and Migo's widowed father.\n*[[Yara Shahidi]] as Brenda, Percy's co-worker for his show and his morally conscious assistant, who doesn't believe in yetis until the end of the movie.\n*[[Ely Henry]] as Fleem, a small male yeti who is part of the S.E.S.\n*[[Jimmy Tatro]] as Thorp, a slow-witted male yeti who's the Stonekeeper's son and Meechee's older brother.\n*[[Patricia Heaton]] as Mama Bear, a [[himalayan brown bear]] that Migo and Percy encounter in a cave while waiting out a blizzard.

Pictures]]. Based on the unpublished children's book ''Yeti Tracks'' by [[Sergio Pablos]], the film was co-written and directed by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], and stars the voices of [[Channing Tatum]], [[James Corden]], [[Zendaya]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[LeBron James]], [[Gina Rodriguez]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Yara Shahidi]], [[Ely Henry]], and [[Jimmy Tatro]]. The plot follows a group of [[Yeti]] who come across a human, with each species thinking the other was just a myth.\n\n''Smallfoot'' was theatrically released in the United States on September 28, 2018. It received a moderately positive reception from critics and was a box office success, grossing over $214 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nA village of [[Yeti]]s lives in isolation on the top of a mountain in the [[Himalayas]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Peter|url=https://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/channing-tatum-belts-out-tune-in-smallfoot/news-story/8aad30b072ffad2b0e520d16a2fee43d|title=Channing Tatum belts out tune in Smallfoot|website=News.co.au|archivedate=September 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> above the clouds and hidden away from sight. Migo is a yeti who abides by the law of the ancient stones held by the Stonekeeper, the yetis' leader. Migo's father, Dorgle, projects himself through the air each morning to hit a gong with his head, as the yetis believe this allows the sun to rise. While learning how to ring the gong, Migo is distracted by the Stonekeeper's daughter, Meechee, whom he has a crush on, and misses the gong, landing outside the village. There, Migo witnesses a plane crash and finds a \"smallfoot\" (human), whom the yetis believe is mythical. Migo runs back to inform the villagers, but because he lacks proof, Stonekeeper claims he is lying and banishes him from the village. Migo is suddenly visited by rejected yetis Gwangi, Kolka, and Fleem who bring him to the Smallfoot Evidentiary Society, which is led by Meechee. She convinces Migo travel below the clouds despite the stones telling them that there is nothing underneath. After some hesitation, Migo agrees to go, but his rope snaps and Migo falls, where he discovers land.\n\nPercy Patterson is a British human filmmaker of wildlife documentaries who has lost most of his viewership. He meets the pilot who saw Migo, and in an attempt to regain his fame, tries unsuccessfully to convince his assistant, Brenda, to dress up as a yeti for filming. Migo arrives and unknowingly scares Percy when trying to communicate with him. Migo takes Percy with him and they stop in a cave to wait out a blizzard. Percy films and uploads a video of Migo narrating that the Yeti plans to eat him, before attempting to escape. While chasing Percy, Migo's toe becomes caught in a bear trap and Percy takes pity on him by removing the trap and bandaging Migo's wound. Percy agrees to go with Migo and they head back up the mountain, where they reunite with the S.E.S.\n\nThe villagers are confused by Percy's appearance, but happily accept him and learn about his culture, much to Stonekeeper's dismay. Afterwards, Stonekeeper takes Migo inside the palace and reveals the truth: yetis used to live below the clouds, but were forced into hiding by the humans who attacked them. To keep them safe, they created the stones, and the clouds are actually steam made by the yetis' daily tasks to keep them hidden. In order to protect the village, Migo agrees to continue the lie by telling the yetis that Percy, who is experiencing [[high altitude sickness]], is just a hairless [[wild yak]]. Stonekeeper takes Percy and locks him in a box, so Percy will be unable to alert other humans of the yetis' whereabouts. Migo later discovers that Meechee took Percy away to return him home, and jumps down the mountain with Gwangi and Kolka following suit.\n\nPercy recovers and discovers that his video of Migo has generated public excitement, but then notices that Meechee has become distracted by the wonders in [[Kathmandu]] and accidentally causes a disruption. Meechee is attacked by the police, but is rescued by Gwangi, Kolka and Migo. The yetis try to make it back to the mountain, but are chased by a SWAT helicopter that Stonekeeper takes down using his stones. Migo attempts to divert the police away from the other yetis, when Percy arrives on his snowmobile and shoots Migo with a tranquilizer gun to save him. The police chase and capture Percy in his yeti suit, and arrest him for public disturbance and fraud.\n\nBack at the village, inside the palace, Migo and Stonekeeper explain the truth to the yetis while Migo apologizes for lying to them. Migo tells the others that even though humans may still be scared of the yetis, they should try to communicate with them. The yetis leave the village, and when Percy and Brenda notice them, they emerge from the crowd and stand up for the yetis. The rest of the humans slowly welcome the yetis and accept them into their lives.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n*[[Channing Tatum]] as Migo, a young male [[yeti]] who is determined to prove the existence of the Smallfoot.\n*[[James Corden]] as Percy Patterson, a British [[human]] [[filmmaker]] of wildlife documentaries trying to get back in the spotlight, who becomes Migo's Smallfoot-best friend.\n*[[Zendaya]] as Meechee, a young female yeti, the Stonekeeper's daughter, Thorp's younger sister, the leader of S.E.S., and Migo's love interest.\n*[[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Stonekeeper, the condescending yeti [[Tribal chief|chief]] and father of Thorp and Meechee.\n*[[LeBron James]] as Gwangi, a large purple male yeti who is part of the S.E.S.\n*[[Gina Rodriguez]] as Kolka, a female yeti who is part of the S.E.S.\n*[[Danny DeVito]] as Dorgle, a short male yeti who is the village gong ringer and Migo's widowed father.\n*[[Yara Shahidi]] as Brenda, Percy's co-worker for his show and his morally conscious assistant, who doesn't believe in yetis until the end of the movie.\n*[[Ely Henry]] as Fleem, a small male yeti who is part of the S.E.S.\n*[[Jimmy Tatro]] as Thorp, a slow-witted male yeti who's the Stonekeeper's son and Meechee's older brother.\n*[[Patricia Heaton]] as Mama Bear, a [[himalayan brown bear]] that Migo and Percy encounter in a cave while waiting out a blizzard.

It freezes the virus and then you can go back to living your life. ''' (sometimes referred to as '''air plasma''') is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature [[corona discharge]] plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface. The corona [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes is often used to create a curtain of corona plasma.  Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material.  All materials have an inherent [[surface energy]].  Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and roll goods that are handled in a web format. Corona treatment is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic film, extrusion, and converting industries.\n\n==History==\nThe corona treatment was invented by the Danish engineer Verner Eisby in 1951. Verner had been asked by one of his customers if he could find a solution which would make it possible to print on plastic. \nVerner found that there were already a couple of ways to accomplish this. One was a gas flame method and the other was a spark generating method, both of which were crude and uncontrollable and did not produce a homogeneous product. Verner came up with the theory that a high frequency corona discharge would provide both a more efficient and controllable method to treat the surface. Exhaustive experiments proved him to be correct. Verner's company, Vetaphone, obtained patent rights for the new corona treatment system.\n\n==Materials==\nMany [[plastics]], such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]], have chemically inert and nonporous surfaces with low [[surface tension]]s causing them to be non-receptive to bonding with printing [[ink]]s, [[coating]]s, and [[adhesive]]s. Although results are invisible to the naked eye, surface treating modifies surfaces to improve adhesion.\n\nPolyethylene, polypropylene, [[nylon]], [[Vinyl polymer|vinyl]], [[PVC]], [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], metalized surfaces, foils, paper, and [[paperboard]] stocks are commonly treated by this method. It is safe, economical, and delivers high line speed throughput. Corona treatment is also suitable for the treatment of [[Injection molding|injection]] and [[Blow molding|blow]] molded parts, and is capable of treating multiple surfaces and difficult parts with a single pass. <ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Sellin\n | first =Noeli\n | title =Surface composition analysis of PP films treated by corona discharge\n | journal = Materials Research\n | publisher =\n| date =2003\n | pages =\n| volume     = 6\n| issue      = 2\n | url =http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-14392003000200009&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es\n | isbn =\n| access-date =September 21, 2018\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Suzer\n | first =S\n | title =XPS and water contact angle measurements on aged and corona\u2010treated PP\n | journal = Applied Polymer Science\n | publisher =\n| date =1999\n | pages =1846-1850\n| volume     = 74\n| issue      = 7\n | url =http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11693/25174/bilkent-research-paper.pdf?sequence=1\n | isbn =\n| access-date =September 21, 2018\n }}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nCorona discharge equipment consists of a [[high-frequency]] power generator, a [[high-voltage]] [[transformer]], a stationary [[electrode]], and a treater ground roll.  Standard utility electrical power is converted into higher frequency power which is then supplied to the treater station. The treater station applies this power through [[ceramic]] or [[metal]] electrodes over an air gap onto the material's surface.\n\nTwo basic corona treater stations are used in [[extrusion coating]] applications\u2014''Bare Roll'' and ''Covered Roll''. On a bare roll treater station, the dielectric encapsulates the electrode. On a covered roll station, it encapsulates the treater base roll. The treater consists of an electrode and a base roll in both stations. In theory a covered roll treater is generally used to treat non-conductive webs, and a Bare Roll treater is used to treat conductive webs. However, manufacturers who treat a variety of substrates on the same production line may choose to use a Bare Roll treater.<ref>{{cite web | title = Corona Treating for Coating Applications | url = http://www.faustel.com/technical-library/corona-treating-for-coating-applications}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-treatment==\nMany substrates provide a better bonding surface when they are treated at the time they are produced. This is called \u201cpre-treatment.\u201d The effects of corona treatment diminish over time.  Therefore, many surfaces will require a second \u201cbump\u201d treatment at the time they are converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives.\n\n==Other technologies==\nOther technologies used for surface treatment include in-line atmospheric (air) plasma, flame plasma, and chemical plasma systems.\n\n===Atmospheric plasma treatment===\n[[Atmospheric-pressure plasma]] treatment is very similar to corona treatment but there are a few differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However, in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric plasma treatment technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's non-treated side; also known as backside treatment.\n\n===Flame plasma===\nFlame plasma treaters generate more heat than other treating processes, but materials treated through this method tend to have a longer shelf-life. These plasma systems are different from air plasma systems because flame plasma occurs when flammable gas and surrounding air are combusted into an intense blue flame. Objects\u2019 surfaces are [[Polarizability|polarized]] from the flame plasma affecting the distribution of the surface's [[electron]]s in an [[oxidation]] form.  This treatment requires higher temperatures so many of the materials that are treated with a flame plasma can be damaged.\n\n===Chemical plasma===\nChemical plasma is based on the combination of air plasma and flame plasma. Much like air plasma, chemical plasma fields are generated from electrically charged air. But, instead of air, chemical plasma relies on a mixture of other gases depositing various [[chemical group]]s onto the treated surface.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flame treatment]]\n* [[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n* [[Plasma activation]]\n* [[Polymeric surface]]\n* [[Surface finishing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://tantec.com/what-is-surface-treatment.html Technical article describing how surface treatment with Corona and plasma works] \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corona Treatment}}\n[[Category:Industrial processes]]\n[[Category:Plastics industry]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n{{About|an industrial surface modification technique|treatment of the coronavirus disease|Coronavirus disease 2019}}\n[[File:Verner Eisby - Inventor of Corona treatment.JPG|thumb|right|Verner Eisby, a Danish engineer, the inventor of corona treatment.]]\n\n'''Corona treatment''' (sometimes referred to as '''air plasma''') is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature [[corona discharge]] plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface.

However, manufacturers who treat a variety of substrates on the same production line may choose to use a Bare Roll treater.<ref>{{cite web | title = Corona Treating for Coating Applications | url = http://www.faustel.com/technical-library/corona-treating-for-coating-applications}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-treatment==\nMany substrates provide a better bonding surface when they are treated at the time they are produced. This is called \u201cpre-treatment.\u201d The effects of corona treatment diminish over time.  Therefore, many surfaces will require a second \u201cbump\u201d treatment at the time they are converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives.\n\n==Other technologies==\nOther technologies used for surface treatment include in-line atmospheric (air) plasma, flame plasma, and chemical plasma systems.\n\n===Atmospheric plasma treatment===\n[[Atmospheric-pressure plasma]] treatment is very similar to corona treatment but there are a few differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However, in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric plasma treatment technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's non-treated side; also known as backside treatment.\n\n===Flame plasma===\nFlame plasma treaters generate more heat than other treating processes, but materials treated through this method tend to have a longer shelf-life. These plasma systems are different from air plasma systems because flame plasma occurs when flammable gas and surrounding air are combusted into an intense blue flame. Objects\u2019 surfaces are [[Polarizability|polarized]] from the flame plasma affecting the distribution of the surface's [[electron]]s in an [[oxidation]] form.  This treatment requires higher temperatures so many of the materials that are treated with a flame plasma can be damaged.\n\n===Chemical plasma===\nChemical plasma is based on the combination of air plasma and flame plasma. Much like air plasma, chemical plasma fields are generated from electrically charged air. But, instead of air, chemical plasma relies on a mixture of other gases depositing various [[chemical group]]s onto the treated surface.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flame treatment]]\n* [[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n* [[Plasma activation]]\n* [[Polymeric surface]]\n* [[Surface finishing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://tantec.com/what-is-surface-treatment.html Technical article describing how surface treatment with Corona and plasma works] \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corona Treatment}}\n[[Category:Industrial processes]]\n[[Category:Plastics industry]]\n", "name_user": "71.214.50.178", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_treatment"}

First shown as a concept car at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#1995|Tokyo Motor Show]] in 1995, the production version was launched on April 15, 1999 to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. The S2000 is named for its engine displacement of two&nbsp;liters, carrying on in the tradition of the [[Honda S500|S500]], [[Honda S600|S600]], and [[Honda S800|S800]] roadsters of the 1960s.\n\n[[File:S2000-logo.png|thumb|right|S2000 logo]]\nSeveral revisions were made throughout the car's production life, including changes to the engine, gearbox, suspension, interior and exterior. Officially two variants exist: the initial launch model was given the chassis code AP1; though cosmetically similar, the facelifted version, known as the AP2 in North America and Japan, incorporated significant changes to the drivetrain and suspension. Production of the S2000 ceased on August 19th 2009.\n\nThe Honda S2000 was notable for its exceptional specific power output of about 124 hp per litre, or about two horsepower per cubic inch, the highest of any mass production, [[naturally aspirated engine]]d car.<ref name=JDMspecF20C>{{cite web |url=http://www.jdmspecengines.com/honda-engines/f-series/f20c.html |title=JDM Spec Engines - Honda F20C Engine |author= |year=2011 |website=jdmspecengines.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219024630/http://www.jdmspecengines.com/honda-engines/f-series/f20c.html |archive-date=2018-02-19 |quote=The F20C held the record for producing the highest specific power output for any mass production naturally aspirated piston engine with 123.5HP/L until Ferrari began production of 458 Italia in 2010, which produces 124.5 HP/L.}}</ref>\n\n==Concept car==\n[[File:Honda S2000 high X-bone frame.jpg|thumb|left|The X-bone frame (yellow) used in the construction of the S2000 chassis]]\nIntroduced at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#1995|1995 Tokyo Motor Show]],<ref name=\"OfficialRelease\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hondanews.com/channels/honda-automobiles/archive/2000/releases/honda-s2000-introduction |title=Honda S2000 - Introduction |accessdate=2013-06-20 |date=2001-02-21 |work=Honda Media Newsroom |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610125910/http://hondanews.com/channels/honda-automobiles/archive/2000/releases/honda-s2000-introduction |archivedate=2012-06-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"s2000prototype\">{{cite web | url=http://world.honda.com/news/1998/4980924b.html | title=Honda Announces the S2000 Prototype | accessdate=2011-04-10 | date=1998-09-24 | publisher=Honda Worldwide}}</ref> the Honda Sport Study Model [[concept car]] was the design study for the production version of the S2000.

The compact and lightweight engine, mounted entirely behind the front axle, allow the S2000 to achieve a 50:50 front/rear weight distribution and lower [[rotational inertia]]. An electrically powered [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] top with internal cloth lining was standard, with an [[aluminum]] hardtop available as an optional extra (in 2001). Honda offered the S2000 in Berlina Black, New Formula Red, Gran Prix White, Sebring Silver and Silverstone Metallic exterior colours in the US domestic market.\n\nThe 2001 model was largely unchanged; Honda added a digital clock to the radio display and made the rear wind blocker standard. Honda also added Spa Yellow exterior colour to the US domestic market lineup. For the 2002 model year, suspension settings were revised and the plastic rear window was replaced by a glass unit incorporating an electric defroster. Other updates included slightly revised tail lamps with chrome rings, an upgraded radio with separate tweeters, a leather gearshift knob, leatherette console cover and a revised [[engine control unit]]. Honda added Suzuka Blue exterior colour to the US domestic market lineup.\n\nThe AP1 was manufactured up to 2003 at Honda's [[Takanezawa, Tochigi|Takanezawa]] plant, alongside the [[Honda NSX|NSX]] and [[Honda Insight#First generation (1999\u20132006)|Insight]] hybrid.<ref name=\"takanezawa\">{{cite web | author=Kazuhiko Tsunoda |title=Gaining New Insight Into Aluminum Body Production |date=August 2000 |url=http://www.insightcentral.net/KB/development/tsunoda.html |accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>{{br}}\n\n===Type V (Japan - 2000)===\nHonda announced the S2000 Type V on July 7, 2000 in the Japanese domestic market. Notable changes from the standard model include variable gear ratio steering (VGS), a steering system that continuously changes steering ratio based upon vehicle speed and steering angle to provide improved handling, it was the first system of its kind to be incorporated into a car. The lock-to-lock steering ratio was reduced to 1.4 turns (stock is 2.4). Honda outfitted Type V cars with revised damper units, stabilizers and limited slip differentials to \"complement the VGS\". Equipped cars came with a special steering wheel and a VGS badge on the rear.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=TYPE V|url=http://world.honda.com/news/2000/4000707.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906044918/http://world.honda.com/news/2000/4000707.html|archivedate=2015-09-06}}</ref> \n\n{{anchor|AP2}}\n\n==AP2 (Known in Europe as \"AP1 facelift\") - 2003\u20132009==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = HondaS2000-007.jpg\n| name = Honda S2000 (AP2)\n| production = 2003\u20132009\n| assembly = [[List of Honda facilities#Japan|Suzuka Plant]], [[Suzuka, Mie]], Japan\n| engine = 2.2&nbsp;L [[Honda F20C engine|F22C1]] [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| transmission = 6-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|94.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|162.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|68.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|50.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{cvt|1295-1299|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe 2004 model S2000 underwent several significant changes. Production moved to [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]]. The new model introduced {{convert|17|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tyres along with a retuned suspension to reduce [[oversteer]]. The spring rates and [[shock absorber]] damping were altered and the suspension geometry was modified to improve stability by reducing [[toe (automotive)|toe-in]] changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass [[manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchronizer]]s were replaced with carbon fibre. In addition, cosmetic changes were made to the exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new [[light-emitting diode|LED]] tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhaust pipes. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European models, they retained the 2.0-litre F20C engines and remained designated as AP1 models.\n\n[[File:HondaS2000-002.jpg|thumb|left|2005 Honda S2000 (rear view)]]\n\nFor the North American market, the updates also included the introduction of a larger version of the F20C (with a designation of [[Honda F20C engine#F22C1|F22C1]]), this larger engine gave the new model a chassis designation of AP2. The engine's stroke was lengthened, increasing its displacement to {{convert|2157|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}}. At the same time, the redline and fuel cutoff were reduced from 8,800&nbsp;rpm and 9,000&nbsp;rpm to 8,000&nbsp;rpm and 8,200&nbsp;rpm respectively, mandated by the longer travel of the pistons. Peak torque increased by 6% to {{convert|220|N.m|0|abbr=on}} at 6,800&nbsp;rpm while power output remained unchanged at {{convert|177|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} achieved at a lower 7,800&nbsp;rpm.

A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70\u201380%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a [[tonneau]] cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6&nbsp;mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the shift load effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.\n\nCR models were only available with yellow and black Alcantara interiors. Additionally, the CR interior has faux carbon fiber overlays on the center console and radio door and a peak power indicator light on the instrument gauge cluster that flashes when the engine is producing its peak power output. Finally, in an effort to reduce weight and lower the [[center of gravity]], the spare tire was omitted and air conditioning and stereo were offered only as options. Net weight savings without the additional hardtop came to {{convert|41|kg|lb|abbr=on}} relative to the standard model.

The S2000 is named for its engine displacement of two&nbsp;liters, carrying on in the tradition of the [[Honda S500|S500]], [[Honda S600|S600]], and [[Honda S800|S800]] roadsters of the 1960s.\n\n[[File:S2000-logo.png|thumb|right|S2000 logo]]\nSeveral revisions were made throughout the car's production life, including changes to the engine, gearbox, suspension, interior and exterior. Officially two variants exist: the initial launch model was given the chassis code AP1; though cosmetically similar, the facelifted version, known as the AP2 in North America and Japan, incorporated significant changes to the drivetrain and suspension. Production of the S2000 ceased on August 19th 2009.\n\nThe Honda S2000 was notable for its exceptional specific power output of about 124 hp per litre, or about two horsepower per cubic inch, the highest of any mass production, [[naturally aspirated engine]]d car.<ref name=JDMspecF20C>{{cite web |url=http://www.jdmspecengines.com/honda-engines/f-series/f20c.html |title=JDM Spec Engines - Honda F20C Engine |author= |year=2011 |website=jdmspecengines.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219024630/http://www.jdmspecengines.com/honda-engines/f-series/f20c.html |archive-date=2018-02-19 |quote=The F20C held the record for producing the highest specific power output for any mass production naturally aspirated piston engine with 123.5HP/L until Ferrari began production of 458 Italia in 2010, which produces 124.5 HP/L.}}</ref>\n\n==Concept car==\n[[File:Honda S2000 high X-bone frame.jpg|thumb|left|The X-bone frame (yellow) used in the construction of the S2000 chassis]]\nIntroduced at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#1995|1995 Tokyo Motor Show]],<ref name=\"OfficialRelease\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hondanews.com/channels/honda-automobiles/archive/2000/releases/honda-s2000-introduction |title=Honda S2000 - Introduction |accessdate=2013-06-20 |date=2001-02-21 |work=Honda Media Newsroom |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610125910/http://hondanews.com/channels/honda-automobiles/archive/2000/releases/honda-s2000-introduction |archivedate=2012-06-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"s2000prototype\">{{cite web | url=http://world.honda.com/news/1998/4980924b.html | title=Honda Announces the S2000 Prototype | accessdate=2011-04-10 | date=1998-09-24 | publisher=Honda Worldwide}}</ref> the Honda Sport Study Model [[concept car]] was the design study for the production version of the S2000.

The car has {{convert|16|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheels with [[Bridgestone]] Potenza S-02 tyres. The compact and lightweight engine, mounted entirely behind the front axle, allow the S2000 to achieve a 50:50 front/rear weight distribution and lower [[rotational inertia]]. An electrically powered [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] top with internal cloth lining was standard, with an [[aluminum]] hardtop available as an optional extra (in 2001). Honda offered the S2000 in Berlina Black, New Formula Red, Gran Prix White, Sebring Silver and Silverstone Metallic exterior colours in the US domestic market.\n\nThe 2001 model was largely unchanged; Honda added a digital clock to the radio display and made the rear wind blocker standard. Honda also added Spa Yellow exterior colour to the US domestic market lineup. For the 2002 model year, suspension settings were revised and the plastic rear window was replaced by a glass unit incorporating an electric defroster. Other updates included slightly revised tail lamps with chrome rings, an upgraded radio with separate tweeters, a leather gearshift knob, leatherette console cover and a revised [[engine control unit]]. Honda added Suzuka Blue exterior colour to the US domestic market lineup.\n\nThe AP1 was manufactured up to 2003 at Honda's [[Takanezawa, Tochigi|Takanezawa]] plant, alongside the [[Honda NSX|NSX]] and [[Honda Insight#First generation (1999\u20132006)|Insight]] hybrid.<ref name=\"takanezawa\">{{cite web | author=Kazuhiko Tsunoda |title=Gaining New Insight Into Aluminum Body Production |date=August 2000 |url=http://www.insightcentral.net/KB/development/tsunoda.html |accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>{{br}}\n\n===Type V (Japan - 2000)===\nHonda announced the S2000 Type V on July 7, 2000 in the Japanese domestic market. Notable changes from the standard model include variable gear ratio steering (VGS), a steering system that continuously changes steering ratio based upon vehicle speed and steering angle to provide improved handling, it was the first system of its kind to be incorporated into a car. The lock-to-lock steering ratio was reduced to 1.4 turns (stock is 2.4). Honda outfitted Type V cars with revised damper units, stabilizers and limited slip differentials to \"complement the VGS\". Equipped cars came with a special steering wheel and a VGS badge on the rear.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=TYPE V|url=http://world.honda.com/news/2000/4000707.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906044918/http://world.honda.com/news/2000/4000707.html|archivedate=2015-09-06}}</ref> \n\n{{anchor|AP2}}\n\n==AP2 (Known in Europe as \"AP1 facelift\") - 2003\u20132009==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = HondaS2000-007.jpg\n| name = Honda S2000 (AP2)\n| production = 2003\u20132009\n| assembly = [[List of Honda facilities#Japan|Suzuka Plant]], [[Suzuka, Mie]], Japan\n| engine = 2.2&nbsp;L [[Honda F20C engine|F22C1]] [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| transmission = 6-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|94.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|162.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|68.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|50.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{cvt|1295-1299|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe 2004 model S2000 underwent several significant changes. Production moved to [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]]. The new model introduced {{convert|17|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tyres along with a retuned suspension to reduce [[oversteer]]. The spring rates and [[shock absorber]] damping were altered and the suspension geometry was modified to improve stability by reducing [[toe (automotive)|toe-in]] changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass [[manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchronizer]]s were replaced with carbon fibre. In addition, cosmetic changes were made to the exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new [[light-emitting diode|LED]] tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhaust pipes. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European models, they retained the 2.0-litre F20C engines and remained designated as AP1 models.\n\n[[File:HondaS2000-002.jpg|thumb|left|2005 Honda S2000 (rear view)]]\n\nFor the North American market, the updates also included the introduction of a larger version of the F20C (with a designation of [[Honda F20C engine#F22C1|F22C1]]), this larger engine gave the new model a chassis designation of AP2. The engine's stroke was lengthened, increasing its displacement to {{convert|2157|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}}. At the same time, the redline and fuel cutoff were reduced from 8,800&nbsp;rpm and 9,000&nbsp;rpm to 8,000&nbsp;rpm and 8,200&nbsp;rpm respectively, mandated by the longer travel of the pistons. Peak torque increased by 6% to {{convert|220|N.m|0|abbr=on}} at 6,800&nbsp;rpm while power output remained unchanged at {{convert|177|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} achieved at a lower 7,800&nbsp;rpm. In conjunction with the introduction of the F22C1, Honda also changed the transmission [[gear ratio]]s by shortening the first five gears and lengthening the sixth.<ref name=\"2004intro\">{{cite web |url=http://www.honda.com/newsandviews/article.aspx?id=2003100142120 |title=2004 Honda S2000 - Introduction Part 1 | date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2013-06-20 |work=Honda Media Newsroom}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = HondaS2000-005.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = HondaS2000-006.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = 2005 Honda S2000 AP2 red/black interior\n}}\nIn 2006, the F22C1 was also introduced to the Japanese market, with a power output of {{convert|178|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|221|Nm|lbf.ft|0|abbr=on}}.

A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70\u201380%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a [[tonneau]] cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6&nbsp;mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the shift load effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.\n\nCR models were only available with yellow and black Alcantara interiors. Additionally, the CR interior has faux carbon fiber overlays on the center console and radio door and a peak power indicator light on the instrument gauge cluster that flashes when the engine is producing its peak power output. Finally, in an effort to reduce weight and lower the [[center of gravity]], the spare tire was omitted and air conditioning and stereo were offered only as options. Net weight savings without the additional hardtop came to {{convert|41|kg|lb|abbr=on}} relative to the standard model. The engine in the S2000 CR was unchanged from the standard trim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/autoshows/12648/2008-honda-s2000-cr.html | title =2008 Honda S2000 CR | accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=April 2007 | author=Mike Dushane | work=Car and Driver }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.honda.com/newsandviews/article.aspx?id=4099-en | title=2008 Honda S2000 - Introduction | date=2007-08-15 | accessdate=2013-06-21 | work=American Honda}}</ref> [[Shigeru Uehara]], the designer of the S2000, stated that the CR was positioned between the Type S and a hypothetical Type R.<ref>{{cite AV media | title=2008 Honda S2000 CR: Shigeru Uehara talks with Inside Line | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dmDmxOm7Ro | publisher=Edmunds | minutes=1:04 | date=2007-08-11 | accessdate=2013-06-21 | quote=Probably the position of this vehicle is just between Type R and Type S}}</ref> However, Honda has never made an official Type R S2000 variant.\n\nProduction volume of fewer than 2,000 units was expected however the final number produced was 625 for the combined 2008 and 2009 model years.

Changes are similar to the U.S. market's CR edition, sharing the weight loss, a purpose built bodykit providing much higher downforce, bespoke wheels and interior. Although it shares the wheels with the CR edition, the Type S retains the rear tyre size of 245/40R-17 for better handling. A specific Type S suspension setup with improved geometry was designed to enhance the handling, the setup is stiffer but more compromising than the CR setup to suit it better to everyday spirited driving and the Japanese ''touge'' experience.<ref>{{cite web|title=TYPE S\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc|url=http://www.honda.co.jp/S2000/webcatalog/type-s-tech/}}</ref> The Type S retains its soft top folding mechanism.\n\nThe interior is a Type S specific yellow and black Alcantara material scheme (similar to the CR).

{"title_page": "Economic history of World War I", "text_new": "[[File:Silver into bullets.jpg|thumb|250px|British poster encouraging investment in war bonds]]\n\nThe '''economic history of World War I''' covers the methods used by the [[First World War]] (1914\u20131918), as well as related postwar issues such as war debts and reparations.  It also covers the economic mobilization of labor, industry, and agriculture leading to economic failure.  It deals with economic warfare such as the blockade of Germany, and with some issues closely related to the economy, such as military issues of transportation.  For a broader perspective see [[Home front during World War I]].\n\nAll of the powers in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1914 expected a short war; none had made any economic preparations for a long war, such as stockpiling food or critical raw materials. The longer the war went on, the more the advantages went to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], with their larger, deeper, more versatile economies and better access to global supplies.  As [[Stephen Broadberry]] and Mark Harrison conclude, once stalemate set in late in 1914: \"The greater Allied capacity for taking risks, absorbing the cost of mistakes, replacing losses, and accumulating overwhelming quantitative superiority should eventually have turned the balance against Germany\".<ref>Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 1 [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/academic/harrison/papers/ww1toronto2.pdf online p 2]</ref>\n\nThe Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $147 billion on the war and the [[Central Powers]] only $61 billion. Among the Allies, Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the U.S. $27 billion (America joined after the war started) while among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.<ref>H.E. Fisk, ''The Inter-Allied Debts'' (1924) pp 13 & 325 reprinted in Horst Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1943 edition), appendix table II</ref>\n\nTotal war demanded total mobilization of all the nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed just for that). Behind the lines labour power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons both old and new. Agriculture had to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (some of whom had been farmers and needed to be replaced by women, children and the elderly who now did the work without animal assistance) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation, in general, was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916 when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States.  The U.S. took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war. The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization in such a way that the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.<ref>Gerd Hardach, ''First World War: 1914\u20131918'' (1981)</ref>\n\n==Europe==\n{{see also|Home front during World War I|}}\n[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in the neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.\n\nThe [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] quickly stabilized, with almost no movement of more than a few hundred yards.  The greatest single expenditure on both sides was for artillery shells, the chief weapon in the war. Since the front was highly stable, both sides built elaborate railway networks that brought supplies within a mile or two of the front lines, with horse-drawn wagons used for the final deliveries.  In the ten-month battle at Verdun, the French and Germans fired some 10 million shells in all, weighing 1.4 million tons of steel.<ref>John Horn, ed.

Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply.  Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use.  There were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico.<ref>[[Harold F. Williamson]], ''The American Petroleum Industry: the Age of Energy 1899-1959 '' (1963) 2:267</ref>  The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German u-boats. Convoys and the construction of new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated American supplies to Britain, France and Italy.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power''  (1991) pp 176-77</ref>\n\nAn oil crisis occurred in Britain due to the 1917 German submarine campaign. Standard Oil of NJ, for example, lost 6 tankers (including the brand new John D. Archbold) between May and September.  The only solution to the crisis lay with increased oil shipment from America. The Allies formed the Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference with USA, Britain, France, and Italy as the members. Standard and Royal Dutch/Shell ran it and made it work. The introduction of convoys as an antidote to the German U-boats and the joint management system by Standard Oil and Royal Dutch/Shell helped to solve the Allies' supply problems. The close working relationship that evolved was in marked contrast to the feud between the government and Standard Oil years earlier. In 1917 and 1918, there was increased domestic demand for oil partly due to the cold winter that created a shortage of coal. Inventories and imported oil from Mexico were used to close the gap. In January 1918, the U.S. Fuel Administrator ordered industrial plants east of Mississippi to close for a week to free up oil for Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ronald W. Ferrier|author2=J. H.

Their followers, both Catholic and Protestant, served extensively in the British forces, many in three specially raised divisions.  Over 200,000 Irishmen fought in the war, in several theatres with 30,000 deaths.  In 1916, supporters of Irish independence from the United Kingdom took the opportunity of the ongoing war to [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaim an Irish Republic]] and to defend it in [[Easter Rising|an armed rebellion against British rule]] in Dublin. The rebellion was poorly planned and quickly suppressed.

In terms of long-run economic trends, the war hardly affected the direction or the speed of change.

However, Fischer also says it was done by means of exclusion and repression. He says the war turned a peaceful nation into \"one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval.\"<ref>Gerhard Fischer, \"'Negative integration' and an Australian road to modernity: Interpreting the Australian homefront experience in World War I,\" ''Australian Historical Studies,'' (April 1995) 26#104 pp 452-76</ref>\n\nIn 1914 the Australian economy was small but the population of five million was very nearly the most prosperous in the world per capita. The nation depended on the export of wool, mutton, wheat and minerals.  London provided assurances that it would underwrite the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue in the face of the German u-boat threat. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them. On the whole Australian commerce expanded.<ref>Thorough coverage is in [[Ernest Scott]], ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp 480-738; see pp 516-18, 539.</ref>  In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. Iron mining and steel manufacture grew enormously.<ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975''  (1977) p 110</ref>  Inflation became a factor as consumer prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1936) pp. 549, 563</ref>\n\nThe trade union movement, already powerful grew rapidly, though the movement split on the political question of conscription. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8\u201312 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to.<ref name=Scott663>Scott 1941, p. 663.</ref> Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and \u00a34,785,607 in lost wages.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp. 663-65</ref><ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975''  (1977) p 110-11</ref>\n\nThe cost of the war was \u00a3377 million, of which 70% was borrowed and the rest came from taxes.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) p. 495</ref> Overall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy. Real aggregate [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 percent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, failing by 16 percent.<ref>Ian W.

When the war began Bank of England officials worked with the government of South Africa to block any gold shipments to Germany, and force the mine owners to sell only to the Treasury, at prices set by the Treasury.  This facilitated purchases of munitions and food in the U.S, and other neutrals. By 1919 London lost control to the mining companies (which were now backed by the South African government). They wanted the higher prices and sales to New York that a free market would provide.<ref>Russell Ally, \"War and gold--the Bank of England, the London gold market and South Africa's gold, 1914-19,\" ''Journal of Southern African Studies'' (1991) 17#2 pp 221-38 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637235 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n[[File:Dinant-ruins-ww1.jpg|thumb|Destroyed houses in [[Dinant]], 1915.

Most Belgians \"turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation,\" according to Kossmann.<ref>Kossmann, p 525</ref>  In 1916 Germany deported 120,000 men to work in Germany; this led to protests from neutral countries and they were returned.

New resources were opened, especially copper mining in [[Katanga Province]]. The [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]] company dominated the copper industry, exporting its product along a direct rail line to the sea at [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]].  The war caused a heavy demand for copper, and production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operate at [[Lubumbashi|Elisabethville]]. Before the war the copper was sold to Germany and, in order to prevent loss of capacity, the British purchased all the Congo's wartime output with the revenues going to the [[De Broqueville government in exile|Belgian government in exile]]. Diamond and gold mining also expanded during the war. The Anglo-Dutch firm [[Unilever|Lever Bros.]] greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war and there was an increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton.

But thousands of little factories opened up across France, hiring women, youth, elderly, disabled veterans, and behind the lines soldiers. Algerian and Vietnamese laborers were brought in.

By late 1915 there was a severe shortage of artillery shells. The very large but poorly equipped Russian army fought tenaciously and desperately despite its poor organisation and lack of munitions. Casualties were enormous. By 1915, many soldiers were sent to the front unarmed, and told to pick up whatever weapons they could from the battlefield.<ref>Peter Gatrell, \"Poor Russia, Poor Show: Mobilising a Backward Economy for War, 1913\u20131917\" in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds., ''The Economics of World War I'' pp (2005) 235\u2013275.</ref>\n\nThe onset of World War I exposed the poor administrative skills of the czarist government under [[Nicholas II]]. A show of national unity had accompanied Russia's entrance into the war, with defense of the Slavic Serbs the main battle cry. In the summer of 1914, the Duma and the zemstva expressed full support for the government's war effort. The initial conscription was well organized and peaceful, and the early phase of Russia's military buildup showed that the empire had learned lessons from the Russo-Japanese War. But military reversals and the government's incompetence soon soured much of the population. Enemy control of the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and markets.\n\nRussia had not prepared for a major war and reacted very slowly as problems mounted in 1914\u201316.  Inflation became a serious problem. Because of inadequate material support for military operations, the [[War Industry Committees]] were formed to ensure that necessary supplies reached the front. But army officers quarreled with civilian leaders, seized administrative control of front areas, and refused to cooperate with the committee. The central government distrusted the independent war support activities that were organized by zemstva and cities. The Duma quarreled with the war bureaucracy of the government, and center and center-left deputies eventually formed the Progressive Bloc to create a genuinely constitutional government.  While the central government was hampered by court intrigue, the strain of the war began to cause popular unrest. Food shortages increasingly impacted urban areas, caused by military purchases,  transportation bottlenecks, financial confusion, and administrative mismanagement.<ref>Mikhail D.

Increasing conflict between the tsar and the Duma destroyed popular and elite support for the old regime. In early 1917, deteriorating rail transport caused acute food and fuel shortages, which resulted in escalating riots and strikes. Authorities summoned troops to quell the disorders in Petrograd (as St. Petersburg had been called since September 1914, to Russianize the Germanic name). In 1905 troops had fired on demonstrators and saved the monarchy, but in 1917 the troops turned their guns over to the angry crowds. Public support for the tsarist regime simply evaporated in 1917, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.<ref>W.

Loans from Britain paid for nearly all its war expenses. The Italian army of 875,000 men was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, and the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus.<ref>Francesco Galassi and Mark Harrison, \"Italy at war, 1915\u20131918,\" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch. 9</ref>\n\nBefore the war the government had ignored labor issues, but now it had to intervene to mobilize war production. With the main working-class Socialist party reluctant to support the war effort, strikes were frequent and cooperation was minimal, especially in the Socialist strongholds of [[Piedmont]] and [[Lombardy]]. The government imposed high wage scales, as well as collective bargaining and insurance schemes.<ref>Luigi Tomassini, \"Industrial Mobilization and the labour market in Italy during the First World War,\" ''Social History,'' (Jan 1991), 16#1 pp 59\u201387</ref>   Many large firms expanded dramatically. The workforce at the Ansaldo munitions company grew from 6,000 to 110,000 as it manufactured 10,900 artillery pieces, 3,800 warplanes, 95 warships and 10 million artillery shells. At [[Fiat]] the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000.  Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.<ref>Tucker, ''European Powers in the First World War,'' p 375-76</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\n{{main|United States home front during World War I}}\n\n====Economic confusion in 1917====\n[[File:Liberty bound poster.jpg|thumb|Poster to promote the sale of Liberty Bonds, c. 1917\u201318; contributed coins will cut the ropes binding [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to the stake.]]\nIn terms of munitions production, the 15 months after April 1917 involved an amazing parade of mistakes, misguided enthusiasm, and confusion. Americans were willing enough, but they did not know their proper role.  Wilson was unable to figure out what to do when, or even to decide who was in charge.  Typical of the confusion was the coal shortage that hit in December 1917. Because coal was by far the most major source of energy and heat, a grave crisis ensued.  There was in fact plenty of coal being mined, but 44,000 loaded freight and coal cars were tied up in horrendous traffic jams in the rail yards of the East Coast. Two hundred ships were waiting in New York harbor for cargo that was delayed by the mess.  The solution included nationalizing the coal mines and the railroads for the duration, shutting down factories one day a week to save fuel, and enforcing a strict system of priorities. Only in March 1918 did Wilson finally take control of the crisis<ref>David Kennedy, ''Over Here'' 113-25</ref>\n\n====Women====\nThe war saw many women gaining access to and taking on jobs traditionally assigned to men. Many worked on the [[assembly line]]s of factories, producing trucks and munitions. The morale of the women remained high, as millions join the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families.  With rare exceptions, the women did not protest the draft.<ref>Lettie Gavin, ''American Women in World War I: They Also Served'' (2006)</ref> For the first time, department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses.\n\n====Labor====\n[[Samuel Gompers]], head of the AFL, and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. The AFL unions strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military, and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war labor union called the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and also left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful [[Council of National Defense]], where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917.  In 1919, the Union tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel and other industries. The strikes, all of which failed, forced unions back to their position around 1910.<ref>Philip Taft, ''The A.F.L. in the time of Gompers'' (1957)</ref>\n\n== Central Powers ==\n{{see also|Home front during World War I}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|World War I|History of Germany during World War I}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-047-37, Munitionsfabrik.jpg|thumb|German munitions factory, 1916]]\nWhile Germany rapidly mobilized its soldiers, it had to improvise the mobilization of the civilian economy for the war effort. It was severely handicapped by the British blockade that cut off food supplies, machinery and raw materials.\n\n[[Walter Rathenau]] played the key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department (Kriegsrohstoffabteilung\u2014\"KRA\"); he was in charge of it from August 1914 to March 1915 and established the basic policies and procedures.  His senior staff were on loan from industry. KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the [[Blockade of Germany|British blockade]], as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices and regulated the distribution to vital war industries. It began the development of ersatz raw materials. KRA suffered many inefficiencies caused by the complexity and selfishness KRA encountered from commerce, industry, and the government.<ref>D. G. Williamson, \"Walther Rathenau and the K.R.A.

It was proved that the [[income]] of the majority of the enterprises declined proportionally to the loss in the [[real wage]]. Moreover, the international corporate profits (e.g. in the UK) of that time were generally higher than those of Germany. The only companies that have undergone the rise in profits were related to the [[Chemical industry|chemical]], [[Metal Industry|metal]] and [[Machine industry|machinery industries]]. Those were usually referred to as \u2018[[war profiteers]]\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=BATEN |first1=J\u00d6RG |last2=SCHULZ |first2=RAINER |title=Making profits in wartime: corporate profits, inequality, and GDP in Germany during the First World War |journal=The Economic History Review |date=13 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe military took an increasingly dominant role in setting economic priorities and in direct control of vital industries. It was usually inefficient, but it performed very well in aircraft.  The army set prices and wages, gave out draft exemptions, guaranteed the supply of credit and raw materials, limited patent rights, and supervised management\u2013labor relationships. The industry expanded very rapidly with high quality products and many innovations, and paid wages well above the norm for skilled workers.<ref>John H.

Eight national war loans reached out to the entire population and raised 100 million marks. It proved almost impossible to borrow money from outside.  The national debt rose from only 5 billion marks in 1914 to 156 billion in 1918.  These bonds became worthless in 1923 because of hyperinflation.<ref>T.

Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916\u20131917 was known as the \"turnip winter\", because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.  Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.<ref>Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914\u20131918'' (2004) pp. 141\u201342</ref><ref>Ernest H.

They drove out Greeks and Armenians who had been the backbone of the business community, replacing them with ethnic Turks who were given favorable contracts but who lacked the international connections, credit sources, and entrepreneurial skills needed for business.<ref>{{cite book|author=Erik J.

Turkish wheat was in high demand, but transportation was rudimentary and not much of it reached Germany. The war cut off imports except from Germany. Prices quadrupled.  The Germans provided loans and supplied the army with hardware, especially captured Belgian and Russian equipment. Other supplies were in short supply; the soldiers were often in rags.  Medical services were very bad and illness and death rates were high. Most of the Ottoman soldiers deserted when they had the opportunity, so the force level shrank from a peak strength of 800,000 in 1916 to only 100,000 in 1918.<ref>Zurcher, ''Turkey: A Modern History'' (2004) pp 122\u201331</ref>\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n{{main|Austria-Hungary#World War I}}\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian monarchical [[personal union]] of the two countries was a result of the [[Compromise of 1867]]. Kingdom of Hungary lost its former status after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. However following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states became co-equal within the Empire.

The strong agriculture and [[food industry]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] with the centre of [[Budapest]] became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around [[Prague]] and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This [[division of labour]] between the east and west, besides the existing [[economic and monetary union]], led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century. Austria could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the [[first industrial revolution]], but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the [[second industrial revolution]], in these modern industrial sectors the Austrian competition could not become overwhelming.<ref>[[Iv\u00e1n T.

The United States and Canada prospered during the war. The reparations levied on Germany by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were, in theory, supposed to restore the damage to the civilian economies, but little of the reparations money went for that. Most of Germany's reparations payments were funded by loans from American banks, and the recipients used them to pay off loans they had from the U.S. Treasury.  Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid out 19 billion goldmarks in reparations, and received 27 billion goldmarks in loans from New York bankers and others. These loans were eventually paid back by Germany after World War II.<ref>Ferguson, ''The Pity of War'' (1998) p 417</ref><ref>Zara S.

It also covers the economic mobilization of labor, industry, and agriculture leading to economic failure.  It deals with economic warfare such as the blockade of Germany, and with some issues closely related to the economy, such as military issues of transportation.  For a broader perspective see [[Home front during World War I]].\n\nAll of the powers in 1914 expected a short war; none had made any economic preparations for a long war, such as stockpiling food or critical raw materials. The longer the war went on, the more the advantages went to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], with their larger, deeper, more versatile economies and better access to global supplies.  As [[Stephen Broadberry]] and Mark Harrison conclude, once stalemate set in late in 1914: \"The greater Allied capacity for taking risks, absorbing the cost of mistakes, replacing losses, and accumulating overwhelming quantitative superiority should eventually have turned the balance against Germany\".<ref>Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds.

One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $147 billion on the war and the [[Central Powers]] only $61 billion. Among the Allies, Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the U.S. $27 billion (America joined after the war started) while among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.<ref>H.E. Fisk, ''The Inter-Allied Debts'' (1924) pp 13 & 325 reprinted in Horst Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1943 edition), appendix table II</ref>\n\nTotal war demanded total mobilization of all the nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed just for that). Behind the lines labour power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons both old and new. Agriculture had to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (some of whom had been farmers and needed to be replaced by women, children and the elderly who now did the work without animal assistance) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation, in general, was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916 when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States.  The U.S. took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war. The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization in such a way that the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.<ref>Gerd Hardach, ''First World War: 1914\u20131918'' (1981)</ref>\n\n==Europe==\n{{see also|Home front during World War I|}}\n[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in the neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.\n\nThe [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] quickly stabilized, with almost no movement of more than a few hundred yards.  The greatest single expenditure on both sides was for artillery shells, the chief weapon in the war. Since the front was highly stable, both sides built elaborate railway networks that brought supplies within a mile or two of the front lines, with horse-drawn wagons used for the final deliveries.  In the ten-month battle at Verdun, the French and Germans fired some 10 million shells in all, weighing 1.4 million tons of steel.<ref>John Horn, ed.

The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943).<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War'' (1998) p 249</ref>\n\nDespite fears in 1916 that munitions production was lagging, the output was more than adequate. The annual output of artillery grew from 91 guns in 1914 to 8039 in 1918.

Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply.  Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use.  There were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico.<ref>[[Harold F. Williamson]], ''The American Petroleum Industry: the Age of Energy 1899-1959 '' (1963) 2:267</ref>  The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German u-boats. Convoys and the construction of new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated American supplies to Britain, France and Italy.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power''  (1991) pp 176-77</ref>\n\nAn oil crisis occurred in Britain due to the 1917 German submarine campaign. Standard Oil of NJ, for example, lost 6 tankers (including the brand new John D. Archbold) between May and September.  The only solution to the crisis lay with increased oil shipment from America. The Allies formed the Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference with USA, Britain, France, and Italy as the members. Standard and Royal Dutch/Shell ran it and made it work. The introduction of convoys as an antidote to the German U-boats and the joint management system by Standard Oil and Royal Dutch/Shell helped to solve the Allies' supply problems. The close working relationship that evolved was in marked contrast to the feud between the government and Standard Oil years earlier. In 1917 and 1918, there was increased domestic demand for oil partly due to the cold winter that created a shortage of coal. Inventories and imported oil from Mexico were used to close the gap. In January 1918, the U.S. Fuel Administrator ordered industrial plants east of Mississippi to close for a week to free up oil for Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ronald W. Ferrier|author2=J. H.

At the outbreak of the war, most Irish people, regardless of political affiliation, supported the war in much the same way as their British counterparts,<ref>{{cite book|last=Pennell|first=Catriona|title=A Kingdom United: Popular Responses to the Outbreak of the First World War in Britain and Ireland|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199590582}}</ref> and both [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] and [[unionism in Ireland|unionist]] leaders initially backed the British war effort. Their followers, both Catholic and Protestant, served extensively in the British forces, many in three specially raised divisions.  Over 200,000 Irishmen fought in the war, in several theatres with 30,000 deaths.  In 1916, supporters of Irish independence from the United Kingdom took the opportunity of the ongoing war to [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaim an Irish Republic]] and to defend it in [[Easter Rising|an armed rebellion against British rule]] in Dublin. The rebellion was poorly planned and quickly suppressed.

The Asian and African colonies provided large numbers of civilian workers, as well as some soldiers.

Over one million Indian troops served overseas, of whom 62,000 died and another 67,000 were wounded.<ref>Ian Sumner, ''The Indian Army 1914\u20131947'' (Osprey, 2001).</ref>\n\n=====Canada=====\n{{Further| Conscription Crisis of 1917|Canadian women in the World Wars}}\nCanada was prosperous during the war but ethnic conflict escalated almost out of control. In terms of long-run economic trends, the war hardly affected the direction or the speed of change.

Women temporarily took war jobs, and at the end of the war there was [[Canadian Labour Revolt|a great deal of unrest]] among union members and farmers for a few years.<ref>Douglas McCalla, \"The Economic Impact of the Great War,\" in ''Canada and the First World War,'' edited by David MacKenzie (2005): 138\u2013153, esp. p. 148</ref>\n\n=====Australia=====\n\n{{see also|Home front during World War I#Australia}}\n[[File:Australian Honour Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Australian Honour Flag]], awarded to subscribers of the Australian Government's 7th War Loan in 1918]]\n[[Billy Hughes]], prime minister from October 1915, expanded the government's role in the economy, while dealing with intense debates over the issue of conscription.<ref>Kosmas Tsokhas, \"The Forgotten Economy and Australia's Involvement in the Great War,\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' (1993) 4#2 331-357</ref>  Historian Gerhard Fisher argues that the Hughes government aggressively promoted economic, industrial, and social modernization. However, Fischer also says it was done by means of exclusion and repression. He says the war turned a peaceful nation into \"one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval.\"<ref>Gerhard Fischer, \"'Negative integration' and an Australian road to modernity: Interpreting the Australian homefront experience in World War I,\" ''Australian Historical Studies,'' (April 1995) 26#104 pp 452-76</ref>\n\nIn 1914 the Australian economy was small but the population of five million was very nearly the most prosperous in the world per capita. The nation depended on the export of wool, mutton, wheat and minerals.  London provided assurances that it would underwrite the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue in the face of the German u-boat threat. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them. On the whole Australian commerce expanded.<ref>Thorough coverage is in [[Ernest Scott]], ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp 480-738; see pp 516-18, 539.</ref>  In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. Iron mining and steel manufacture grew enormously.<ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975''  (1977) p 110</ref>  Inflation became a factor as consumer prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1936) pp. 549, 563</ref>\n\nThe trade union movement, already powerful grew rapidly, though the movement split on the political question of conscription. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8\u201312 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to.<ref name=Scott663>Scott 1941, p. 663.</ref> Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and \u00a34,785,607 in lost wages.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp. 663-65</ref><ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975''  (1977) p 110-11</ref>\n\nThe cost of the war was \u00a3377 million, of which 70% was borrowed and the rest came from taxes.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) p. 495</ref> Overall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy. Real aggregate [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 percent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, failing by 16 percent.<ref>Ian W. McLean, ''Why Australia Prospered: The Shifting Sources of Economic Growth'' (2013), pp. 147\u2013148.</ref>\n\n=====South Africa=====\nSouth Africa's main economic role was in the supply of two-thirds of the gold production in the British Empire (most of the remainder came from Australia).  When the war began Bank of England officials worked with the government of South Africa to block any gold shipments to Germany, and force the mine owners to sell only to the Treasury, at prices set by the Treasury.  This facilitated purchases of munitions and food in the U.S, and other neutrals. By 1919 London lost control to the mining companies (which were now backed by the South African government). They wanted the higher prices and sales to New York that a free market would provide.<ref>Russell Ally, \"War and gold--the Bank of England, the London gold market and South Africa's gold, 1914-19,\" ''Journal of Southern African Studies'' (1991) 17#2 pp 221-38 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637235 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n[[File:Dinant-ruins-ww1.jpg|thumb|Destroyed houses in [[Dinant]], 1915.

New resources were opened, especially copper mining in [[Katanga Province]]. The [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]] company dominated the copper industry, exporting its product along a direct rail line to the sea at [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]].  The war caused a heavy demand for copper, and production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operate at [[Lubumbashi|Elisabethville]]. Before the war the copper was sold to Germany and, in order to prevent loss of capacity, the British purchased all the Congo's wartime output with the revenues going to the [[De Broqueville government in exile|Belgian government in exile]]. Diamond and gold mining also expanded during the war. The Anglo-Dutch firm [[Unilever|Lever Bros.]] greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war and there was an increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton. New rail and steamship lines opened to handle the expanded export traffic.<ref>{{Cite EB1922 |wstitle=Belgian Congo |volume=30 |page=429 |first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Heroic Women of France.

French GDP in 1918 was 24% smaller than in 1913; since a third went into the war effort, the civilian standard of living fell by half. But thousands of little factories opened up across France, hiring women, youth, elderly, disabled veterans, and behind the lines soldiers. Algerian and Vietnamese laborers were brought in. Plants produced 200,000 75mm shells a day. The US provided much food, steel, coal and machine tools, and $3.6 billion in loans to finance it all; the British loaned another $3 billion.<ref>* Philippe Bernard, and Henri Dubief.

The economy was supported after 1917 by American government loans which were used to purchase foods and manufactured goods. The arrival of over a million American soldiers in 1918 brought heavy spending for food and construction materials.\n\nFrance's diverse regions suffered in different ways. While the occupied area in 1913 contained only 14% of France's industrial workers, it produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal.<ref>Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War: 1914\u20131918'' (1977) pp 87\u201388</ref> War contracts made some firms prosperous but on the whole did not compensate for the loss of foreign markets.

Internal lines of communication and transportation were disrupted, and shipments of the main export, cheap wine, had to be cut back.

A famous example was [[Ho Chi Minh]] who worked in Paris, and was highly active in organizing fellow Vietnamese, and even demanding a voice for them at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The French army enlisted hundreds of thousands of colonials.

By late 1915 there was a severe shortage of artillery shells. The very large but poorly equipped Russian army fought tenaciously and desperately despite its poor organisation and lack of munitions. Casualties were enormous. By 1915, many soldiers were sent to the front unarmed, and told to pick up whatever weapons they could from the battlefield.<ref>Peter Gatrell, \"Poor Russia, Poor Show: Mobilising a Backward Economy for War, 1913\u20131917\" in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds., ''The Economics of World War I'' pp (2005) 235\u2013275.</ref>\n\nThe onset of World War I exposed the poor administrative skills of the czarist government under [[Nicholas II]]. A show of national unity had accompanied Russia's entrance into the war, with defense of the Slavic Serbs the main battle cry. In the summer of 1914, the Duma and the zemstva expressed full support for the government's war effort. The initial conscription was well organized and peaceful, and the early phase of Russia's military buildup showed that the empire had learned lessons from the Russo-Japanese War. But military reversals and the government's incompetence soon soured much of the population. Enemy control of the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and markets.\n\nRussia had not prepared for a major war and reacted very slowly as problems mounted in 1914\u201316.  Inflation became a serious problem. Because of inadequate material support for military operations, the [[War Industry Committees]] were formed to ensure that necessary supplies reached the front. But army officers quarreled with civilian leaders, seized administrative control of front areas, and refused to cooperate with the committee. The central government distrusted the independent war support activities that were organized by zemstva and cities. The Duma quarreled with the war bureaucracy of the government, and center and center-left deputies eventually formed the Progressive Bloc to create a genuinely constitutional government.  While the central government was hampered by court intrigue, the strain of the war began to cause popular unrest. Food shortages increasingly impacted urban areas, caused by military purchases,  transportation bottlenecks, financial confusion, and administrative mismanagement.<ref>Mikhail D. Karpachev, \"The Provisioning Crisis during the First World War,\"  ''Russian Studies in History'' 55#3-4 (2016): 209-233.</ref>  By 1915  high food prices and fuel shortages caused strikes in some cities.

Increasing conflict between the tsar and the Duma destroyed popular and elite support for the old regime. In early 1917, deteriorating rail transport caused acute food and fuel shortages, which resulted in escalating riots and strikes. Authorities summoned troops to quell the disorders in Petrograd (as St. Petersburg had been called since September 1914, to Russianize the Germanic name). In 1905 troops had fired on demonstrators and saved the monarchy, but in 1917 the troops turned their guns over to the angry crowds. Public support for the tsarist regime simply evaporated in 1917, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.<ref>W.

Loans from Britain paid for nearly all its war expenses. The Italian army of 875,000 men was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, and the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus.<ref>Francesco Galassi and Mark Harrison, \"Italy at war, 1915\u20131918,\" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch. 9</ref>\n\nBefore the war the government had ignored labor issues, but now it had to intervene to mobilize war production. With the main working-class Socialist party reluctant to support the war effort, strikes were frequent and cooperation was minimal, especially in the Socialist strongholds of [[Piedmont]] and [[Lombardy]]. The government imposed high wage scales, as well as collective bargaining and insurance schemes.<ref>Luigi Tomassini, \"Industrial Mobilization and the labour market in Italy during the First World War,\" ''Social History,'' (Jan 1991), 16#1 pp 59\u201387</ref>   Many large firms expanded dramatically. The workforce at the Ansaldo munitions company grew from 6,000 to 110,000 as it manufactured 10,900 artillery pieces, 3,800 warplanes, 95 warships and 10 million artillery shells. At [[Fiat]] the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000.  Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.<ref>Tucker, ''European Powers in the First World War,'' p 375-76</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\n{{main|United States home front during World War I}}\n\n====Economic confusion in 1917====\n[[File:Liberty bound poster.jpg|thumb|Poster to promote the sale of Liberty Bonds, c. 1917\u201318; contributed coins will cut the ropes binding [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to the stake.]]\nIn terms of munitions production, the 15 months after April 1917 involved an amazing parade of mistakes, misguided enthusiasm, and confusion. Americans were willing enough, but they did not know their proper role.  Wilson was unable to figure out what to do when, or even to decide who was in charge.  Typical of the confusion was the coal shortage that hit in December 1917. Because coal was by far the most major source of energy and heat, a grave crisis ensued.  There was in fact plenty of coal being mined, but 44,000 loaded freight and coal cars were tied up in horrendous traffic jams in the rail yards of the East Coast. Two hundred ships were waiting in New York harbor for cargo that was delayed by the mess.  The solution included nationalizing the coal mines and the railroads for the duration, shutting down factories one day a week to save fuel, and enforcing a strict system of priorities. Only in March 1918 did Wilson finally take control of the crisis<ref>David Kennedy, ''Over Here'' 113-25</ref>\n\n====Women====\nThe war saw many women gaining access to and taking on jobs traditionally assigned to men. Many worked on the [[assembly line]]s of factories, producing trucks and munitions. The morale of the women remained high, as millions join the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families.  With rare exceptions, the women did not protest the draft.<ref>Lettie Gavin, ''American Women in World War I: They Also Served'' (2006)</ref> For the first time, department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses.\n\n====Labor====\n[[Samuel Gompers]], head of the AFL, and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. The AFL unions strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military, and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war labor union called the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and also left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful [[Council of National Defense]], where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917.  In 1919, the Union tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel and other industries. The strikes, all of which failed, forced unions back to their position around 1910.<ref>Philip Taft, ''The A.F.L. in the time of Gompers'' (1957)</ref>\n\n== Central Powers ==\n{{see also|Home front during World War I}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|World War I|History of Germany during World War I}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-047-37, Munitionsfabrik.jpg|thumb|German munitions factory, 1916]]\nWhile Germany rapidly mobilized its soldiers, it had to improvise the mobilization of the civilian economy for the war effort. It was severely handicapped by the British blockade that cut off food supplies, machinery and raw materials.\n\n[[Walter Rathenau]] played the key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department (Kriegsrohstoffabteilung\u2014\"KRA\"); he was in charge of it from August 1914 to March 1915 and established the basic policies and procedures.  His senior staff were on loan from industry. KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the [[Blockade of Germany|British blockade]], as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices and regulated the distribution to vital war industries. It began the development of ersatz raw materials. KRA suffered many inefficiencies caused by the complexity and selfishness KRA encountered from commerce, industry, and the government.<ref>D. G. Williamson, \"Walther Rathenau and the K.R.A.

It was proved that the [[income]] of the majority of the enterprises declined proportionally to the loss in the [[real wage]]. Moreover, the international corporate profits (e.g. in the UK) of that time were generally higher than those of Germany. The only companies that have undergone the rise in profits were related to the [[Chemical industry|chemical]], [[Metal Industry|metal]] and [[Machine industry|machinery industries]]. Those were usually referred to as \u2018[[war profiteers]]\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=BATEN |first1=J\u00d6RG |last2=SCHULZ |first2=RAINER |title=Making profits in wartime: corporate profits, inequality, and GDP in Germany during the First World War |journal=The Economic History Review |date=13 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe military took an increasingly dominant role in setting economic priorities and in direct control of vital industries. It was usually inefficient, but it performed very well in aircraft.  The army set prices and wages, gave out draft exemptions, guaranteed the supply of credit and raw materials, limited patent rights, and supervised management\u2013labor relationships. The industry expanded very rapidly with high quality products and many innovations, and paid wages well above the norm for skilled workers.<ref>John H.

Eight national war loans reached out to the entire population and raised 100 million marks. It proved almost impossible to borrow money from outside.  The national debt rose from only 5 billion marks in 1914 to 156 billion in 1918.  These bonds became worthless in 1923 because of hyperinflation.<ref>T.

Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916\u20131917 was known as the \"turnip winter\", because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.

Turkish wheat was in high demand, but transportation was rudimentary and not much of it reached Germany. The war cut off imports except from Germany. Prices quadrupled.  The Germans provided loans and supplied the army with hardware, especially captured Belgian and Russian equipment. Other supplies were in short supply; the soldiers were often in rags.  Medical services were very bad and illness and death rates were high. Most of the Ottoman soldiers deserted when they had the opportunity, so the force level shrank from a peak strength of 800,000 in 1916 to only 100,000 in 1918.<ref>Zurcher, ''Turkey: A Modern History'' (2004) pp 122\u201331</ref>\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n{{main|Austria-Hungary#World War I}}\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian monarchical [[personal union]] of the two countries was a result of the [[Compromise of 1867]].

Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around [[Prague]] and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This [[division of labour]] between the east and west, besides the existing [[economic and monetary union]], led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century.

It drafted skilled workers and engineers without realizing the damage it did to the economy.<ref>Tucker, ''The European Powers,'' (1999) pp 85\u201391</ref><ref>Clifford F.

Czechs rejected any customs union with Germany, because it threatened their language and culture. Czech bankers had an eye to early independence; they purchased many securities from the Czech lands, thus insuring their strong domestic position in what became Czechoslovakia in 1918.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{main|Bulgaria during World War I}}\nBulgaria, a poor rural nation of 4.5 million people, at first stayed neutral.  In 1915 it joined the Central Powers.<ref>Tucker, ''The European powers in the First World War'' (1996).  pp 149\u201352</ref> It mobilized a very large army of 800,000 men, using equipment supplied by Germany. Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat.  The [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|peace treaty in 1919]] stripped Bulgaria of its conquests, reduced its army to 20,000 men, and demanded reparations of \u00a3100 million.<ref>Richard C.

Britain sustained the lightest damage to its civilian economy, apart from its loss of men.  The major damage was to its merchant marine and to its financial holdings.  The United States and Canada prospered during the war. The reparations levied on Germany by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were, in theory, supposed to restore the damage to the civilian economies, but little of the reparations money went for that. Most of Germany's reparations payments were funded by loans from American banks, and the recipients used them to pay off loans they had from the U.S. Treasury.  Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid out 19 billion goldmarks in reparations, and received 27 billion goldmarks in loans from New York bankers and others. These loans were eventually paid back by Germany after World War II.<ref>Ferguson, ''The Pity of War'' (1998) p 417</ref><ref>Zara S.

He sought to eliminate the remnants of [[feudalism]] persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the [[nobility]] to inhabit his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the [[Fronde]] rebellion during Louis' minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of [[absolute Monarchy|absolute monarchical rule]] in France that endured until the [[French Revolution]].\n\nLouis also enforced uniformity of religion under the [[Gallican Church|Gallican]] [[Catholic Church]]. His [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]] abolished the rights of the [[Huguenots|Huguenot]] [[Protestantism in France|Protestant minority]] and subjected them to a wave of [[dragonnades]], effectively forcing Huguenots to emigrate or convert, and virtually destroying the French Protestant community.\n\nThe Sun King surrounded himself with a variety of significant political, military, and cultural figures such as [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], the [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Grand Cond\u00e9]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]], [[Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle|Boulle]], [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]], [[Marin Marais|Marais]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]], [[Louis Le Vau|Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart|Mansart]], [[Charles Perrault|Charles]], [[Claude Perrault]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre|Le N\u00f4tre]].\n\nDuring Louis' long reign, France was the leading European power, and it fought three major wars: the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. There were also two lesser conflicts: the [[War of Devolution]] and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Warfare defined the foreign policy of Louis XIV, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled \"by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique\", Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.<ref name=\"James Nathan 1993\">{{cite journal|first=James|last=Nathan|title=Force, Order, and Diplomacy in the Age of Louis XIV|url=https://www.vqronline.org/essay/force-order-and-diplomacy-age-louis-xiv|journal=[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]|publisher=[[University of Virginia]]|location=Charlottesville, Virginia|\nvolume=69|issue=4|date=Autumn 1993|page=633}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Fransk barnprins, troligen Ludvig XIV eller XV fr\u00e5n 1600-talets f\u00f6rsta h\u00e4lft - Skoklosters slott - 95015.tif|thumb|Louis XIV as a young child, unknown painter]]\n[[File:Acte de naissance de Louis XIV 1738.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Baptismal certificate, 1638]]\n\nLouis XIV was born on 5 September 1638 in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], to [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Anne of Austria]].

His mother had experienced four [[stillbirth]]s between 1619 and 1631. Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God.\n\nSensing imminent death, Louis XIII decided to put his affairs in order in the spring of 1643, when Louis XIV was four years old. In defiance of custom, which would have made Queen Anne the sole [[Regent]] of France, the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son's behalf. His lack of faith in Queen Anne's political abilities was his primary rationale. He did, however, make the concession of appointing her head of the council.\n\nLouis' relationship with his mother was uncommonly affectionate for the time. Contemporaries and eyewitnesses claimed that the Queen would spend all her time with Louis. Both were greatly interested in food and theatre, and it is highly likely that Louis developed these interests through his close relationship with his mother. This long-lasting and loving relationship can be evidenced by excerpts in Louis' journal entries, such as:\n<blockquote>\"Nature was responsible for the first knots which tied me to my mother. But attachments formed later by shared qualities of the spirit are far more difficult to break than those formed merely by blood.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Antonia|last=Fraser|title=Love and Louis XIV: The Women in the Life of the Sun King|publisher=[[Random House, Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=2006|pages=14\u201316}}</ref></blockquote>\nIt was his mother who gave Louis his belief in the absolute and divine power of his monarchical rule.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=30\u201340}}</ref>\n\nDuring his childhood, he was taken care of by the governesses [[Fran\u00e7oise de Lansac]] and [[Marie-Catherine de Senecey]]. In 1646, [[Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy|Nicolas V de Villeroy]] became the young king's tutor. Louis XIV became friends with Villeroy's young children, particularly [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroy|Fran\u00e7ois de Villeroy]], and divided his time between the [[Palais-Royal]] and the nearby Hotel de Villeroy.\n\n==Minority and the ''Fronde''==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2017}}<!--many paragraphs with no citations-->\n\n===Accession===\n{{further|Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)}}\n[[File:Bb85790a33.jpg|thumb|right|Louis XIV in 1643, prior to becoming king, by [[Claude Deruet]]]]\nOn 14 May 1643, with Louis XIII dead, Queen Anne had her husband's will [[annul]]led by the ''[[Parlement|Parlement de Paris]]'' (a judicial body comprising mostly [[nobility|nobles]] and high clergymen).{{sfn|B\u00e9ly|2001|p=57}} This action abolished the regency council and made Anne sole Regent of France. Anne exiled some of her husband's ministers (Chavigny, Bouthilier), and she nominated Brienne as her minister of foreign affairs.{{sfn|Sonnino|1998|pp=217\u2013218}} Anne also nominated Saint [[Vincent de Paul]] as her spiritual adviser, which helped her deal with religious policy and the [[Jansenism]] question.{{sfn|McCoy|1942|pp=442\u2013449}}\n\nAnne kept the direction of religious policy strongly in her hand until 1661; her most important political decisions were to nominate Cardinal [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] as her chief minister and the continuation of her late husband's and [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s policy, despite their persecution of her, for the sake of her son. Anne wanted to give her son absolute authority and a victorious kingdom. Her rationales for choosing Mazarin were mainly his ability and his total dependence on her, at least until 1653 when she was no longer regent. Anne protected Mazarin by arresting and exiling her followers who conspired against him in 1643: the [[C\u00e9sar de Bourbon|Duke of Beaufort]] and [[Marie de Rohan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=34\u201337}}</ref> She left the direction of the daily administration of policy to Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nThe best example of Anne's statesmanship and the partial change in her heart towards her native Spain is seen in her keeping of one of Richelieu's men, the Chancellor of France [[Pierre S\u00e9guier]], in his post. S\u00e9guier was the person who had interrogated Anne in 1637, treating her like a \"common criminal\" as she described her treatment following the discovery that she was giving military secrets and information to Spain. Anne was virtually under house arrest for a number of years during her husband's rule. By keeping him in his post, Anne was giving a sign that the interests of France and her son Louis were the guiding spirit of all her political and legal actions. Though not necessarily opposed to Spain, she sought to end the war with a French victory, in order to establish a lasting peace between the Catholic nations.\n\nThe Queen also gave a partial Catholic orientation to French foreign policy. This was felt by the Netherlands, France's Protestant ally, which negotiated a separate peace with Spain in 1648.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=29\u201336}}</ref>\n\nIn 1648, Anne and Mazarin successfully negotiated the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Its terms ensured [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch independence]] from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], awarded some autonomy to the various German princes of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and granted Sweden seats on the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] and territories to control the mouths of the [[Oder River|Oder]], [[Elbe]], and [[Weser River|Weser]] rivers. France, however, profited most from the settlement. Austria, ruled by the [[Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburg]] Emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], ceded all Habsburg lands and claims in [[Alsace]] to France and acknowledged her ''de facto'' sovereignty over the [[Three Bishoprics]] of [[Metz]], [[Verdun]], and [[Toul]]. Moreover, eager to emancipate themselves from Habsburg domination, petty German states sought French protection. This anticipated the formation of the 1658 [[League of the Rhine]], leading to the further diminution of Imperial power.\n\n===Early acts===\nAs the Thirty Years' War came to an end, a civil war known as the ''{{lang|fr|[[Fronde]]}}'' (after the [[sling (weapon)|slings]] used to smash windows) erupted in France. It effectively checked France's ability to exploit the Peace of Westphalia. Anne and Mazarin had largely pursued the policies of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], augmenting the Crown's power at the expense of the nobility and the ''{{lang|fr|[[Parlement]]s}}''. Anne interfered much more in internal policy than foreign affairs; she was a very proud queen who insisted on the divine rights of the King of France.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|thumb|left|Europe after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648]]\n\nAll this led her to advocate a forceful policy in all matters relating to the King's authority, in a manner that was much more radical than the one proposed by Mazarin. The Cardinal depended totally on Anne's support and had to use all his influence on the Queen to avoid nullifying, but to restrain some of her radical actions. Anne imprisoned any aristocrat or member of parliament who challenged her will; her main aim was to transfer to her son an absolute authority in the matters of finance and justice. One of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris, whom she had jailed, died in prison.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=70\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe ''{{lang|fr|Frondeurs}}'', political heirs of the disaffected feudal aristocracy, sought to protect their traditional feudal privileges from the increasingly centralized royal government. Furthermore, they believed their traditional influence and authority was being usurped by the recently ennobled bureaucrats (the ''{{lang|fr|Noblesse de Robe}}'', or \"nobility of the robe\"), who administered the kingdom and on whom the monarchy increasingly began to rely. This belief intensified the nobles' resentment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1648, Anne and Mazarin attempted to tax members of the ''{{lang|fr|Parlement de Paris}}''. The members refused to comply and ordered all of the king's earlier financial edicts burned. Buoyed by the victory of {{lang|fr|[[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Louis, duc d\u2019Enghien]]}} (later known as ''{{lang|fr|le Grand Cond\u00e9}}'') at the [[Battle of Lens]], Mazarin, on Queen Anne's insistence, arrested certain members in a show of force.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=80\u201385}}</ref> The most important arrest, from Anne's point of view, concerned [[Pierre Broussel]], one of the most important leaders in the ''{{lang|fr|Parlement de Paris}}''.\n\n[[File:Louis XIV en Jupiter, vainqueur de la Fronde.jpg|thumb|1655 portrait of Louis, the Victor of the Fronde, portrayed as the god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]]]\n\nPeople in France were complaining about the expansion of royal authority, the high rate of taxation, and the reduction of the authority of the Parlement de Paris and other regional representative entities. Paris erupted in rioting as a result, and Anne was forced, under intense pressure, to free Broussel. Moreover, a mob of angry Parisians broke into the royal palace and demanded to see their king. Led into the royal bedchamber, they gazed upon Louis, who was feigning sleep, were appeased, and then quietly departed. The threat to the royal family prompted Anne to flee Paris with the king and his courtiers.\n\nShortly thereafter, the conclusion of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] allowed Cond\u00e9's army to return to aid Louis and his court. Cond\u00e9's family was close to Anne at that time, and he agreed to help her attempt to restore the king's authority.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=84\u201387}}</ref> The queen's army, headed by Cond\u00e9, attacked the rebels in Paris; the rebels were under the political control of Anne's old friend [[Marie de Rohan]]. Beaufort, who had escaped from the prison where Anne had incarcerated him five years before, was the military leader in Paris, under the nominal control of Conti. After a few battles, a political compromise was reached; the [[Peace of Rueil]] was signed, and the court returned to Paris.\n\nUnfortunately for Anne, her partial victory depended on Cond\u00e9, who wanted to control the queen and destroy Mazarin's influence. It was Cond\u00e9's sister who pushed him to turn against the queen. After striking a deal with her old friend Marie de Rohan, who was able to impose the nomination of {{lang|fr|[[Charles de l'Aubespine, marquis de Ch\u00e2teauneuf]]}} as minister of justice, Anne arrested Cond\u00e9, his brother [[Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]], and the husband of their sister Anne Genevieve de Bourbon, [[duchess of Longueville]]. This situation did not last long, and Mazarin's unpopularity led to the creation of a coalition headed mainly by Marie de Rohan and the duchess of Longueville. This aristocratic coalition was strong enough to liberate the princes, exile Mazarin, and impose a condition of virtual house arrest on Queen Anne.\n\nAll these events were witnessed by Louis and largely explained his later distrust of Paris and the higher aristocracy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=88\u201390,91\u201398}}</ref> \"In one sense, Louis' childhood came to an end with the outbreak of the Fronde. It was not only that life became insecure and unpleasant \u2013 a fate meted out to many children in all ages \u2013 but that Louis had to be taken into the confidence of his mother and Mazarin and political and military matters of which he could have no deep understanding\".{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=22}} \"The family home became at times a near-prison when Paris had to be abandoned, not in carefree outings to other chateaux but in humiliating flights\".{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=22}} The royal family was driven out of Paris twice in this manner, and at one point Louis XIV and Anne were held under virtual arrest in the royal palace in Paris. The Fronde years planted in Louis a hatred of Paris and a consequent determination to move out of the ancient capital as soon as possible, never to return.{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=31}}\n\nJust as the first ''{{lang|fr|Fronde}}'' (the ''{{lang|fr|Fronde parlementaire}}'' of 1648\u20131649) ended, a second one (the ''{{lang|fr|Fronde des princes}}'' of 1650\u20131653) began. Unlike that which preceded it, tales of sordid intrigue and half-hearted warfare characterized this second phase of upper-class insurrection. To the aristocracy, this rebellion represented a protest against and a reversal of their political demotion from [[vassal]]s to [[courtier]]s. It was headed by the highest-ranking French nobles, among them Louis' uncle [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] and first cousin [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier]], known as ''{{lang|fr|la Grande Mademoiselle}}''; [[prince du sang|Princes of the Blood]] such as Cond\u00e9, his brother [[Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]], and their sister the [[Anne Genevi\u00e8ve de Bourbon|Duchess of Longueville]]; dukes of [[bastardy|legitimised]] royal descent, such as [[Henri II d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Longueville|Henri, Duke of Longueville]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Beaufort]]; so-called \"[[prince \u00e9tranger|foreign princes]]\" such as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice, Duke of Bouillon]], his brother [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], and [[Marie de Rohan]], Duchess of Chevreuse; and [[kinship|scions]] of France's oldest families, such as [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld]].\n\nQueen Anne played the most important role in defeating the Fronde because she wanted to transfer absolute authority to her son. In addition, most of the princes refused to deal with Mazarin, who went into exile for a number of years. The ''{{lang|fr|Frondeurs}}'' claimed to act on Louis' behalf, and in his real interest against his mother and Mazarin.\n\nQueen Anne had a very close relationship with the Cardinal, and many observers believed that Mazarin became Louis XIV's stepfather by a secret marriage to Queen Anne.{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=18}} However, Louis' coming-of-age and subsequent [[coronation]] deprived them of the ''{{lang|fr|Frondeurs}}''{{'}} pretext for revolt. The ''{{lang|fr|Fronde}}'' thus gradually lost steam and ended in 1653, when Mazarin returned triumphantly from exile. From that time until his death, Mazarin was in charge of foreign and financial policy without the daily supervision of Anne, who was no longer regent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Louis fell in love with Mazarin's niece [[Marie Mancini]], but Anne and Mazarin ended the king's infatuation by sending Mancini away from court to be married in Italy. While Mazarin might have been tempted for a short period of time to marry his niece to the King of France, Queen Anne was absolutely against this; she wanted to marry her son to the daughter of her brother, [[Philip IV of Spain]], for both dynastic and political reasons. Mazarin soon supported the Queen's position because he knew that her support for his power and his foreign policy depended on making peace with Spain from a strong position and on the Spanish marriage. Additionally, Mazarin's relations with Marie Mancini were not good, and he did not trust her to support his position. All of Louis' tears and his supplications to his mother did not make her change her mind; the Spanish marriage was very important both for its role in ending the war between France and Spain, and because many of the claims and objectives of Louis' foreign policy in the next 50 years would be based on this marriage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bluche|1990|pp=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\n==Personal reign and reforms==\n===Coming of age and early reforms===\n[[File:Royal Monogram of King Louis XIV of France.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Royal Monogram]]\n\nLouis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on 7 September 1651. On the death of Mazarin, in March 1661, Louis assumed personal control of the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister: \"Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal. It is now time that I govern them myself. You [he was talking to the secretaries and ministers of state] will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them. I request and order you to seal no orders except by my command . . . I order you not to sign anything, not even a passport . . . without my command; to render account to me personally each day and to favor no one\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louis-xiv.de/index.php?id=30|title=Louis XIV - the Sun King: Absolutism|website=louis-xiv.de}}</ref> Louis was able to capitalize on the widespread public yearning for law and order, that resulted from prolonged foreign wars and domestic civil strife, to further consolidate central political authority and reform at the expense of the feudal aristocracy. Praising his ability to choose and encourage men of talent, the historian [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]] noted: \"it is the voice of genius of all kinds which sounds from the tomb of Louis\".<ref>[[Ian Dunlop (author)|Ian Dunlop]], \"''Louis XIV''\", (2001) p. xii</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|Louis XIV, King of France, in 1661]]\n\nLouis began his personal reign with administrative and fiscal reforms. In 1661, the treasury verged on bankruptcy. To rectify the situation, Louis chose [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] as [[Controller-General of Finances]] in 1665. However, Louis first had to neutralize [[Nicolas Fouquet]], the [[Superintendent of Finances]], in order to give Colbert a free hand. Although Fouquet's financial indiscretions were not very different from Mazarin's before him or Colbert's after him, his ambition was worrying to Louis. He had, for example, built an opulent ch\u00e2teau at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] where he entertained Louis and his court ostentatiously, as if he were wealthier than the king himself. The court was left with the impression that the vast sums of money needed to support his lifestyle could only have been obtained through [[embezzlement]] of government funds.\n\nFouquet appeared eager to succeed Mazarin and Richelieu in assuming power, and he indiscreetly purchased and privately fortified the remote island of [[Belle \u00cele]]. These acts sealed his doom. Fouquet was charged with embezzlement. The ''Parlement'' found him guilty and sentenced him to exile. However, Louis altered the sentence to life-imprisonment and abolished Fouquet's post.\n\nWith Fouquet dismissed, Colbert reduced the national debt through more efficient taxation. The principal taxes included the ''aides'' and ''douanes'' (both [[Customs (tax)|customs duties]]), the ''[[gabelle]]'' (a tax on salt), and the ''[[taille]]'' (a tax on land). The ''taille'' was reduced at first; financial officials were forced to keep regular accounts, auctioning certain taxes instead of selling them privately to a favored few, revising inventories and removing unauthorized exemptions (for example, in 1661 only 10 per cent from the royal domain reached the King). Reform proved difficult because the ''taille'' was levied by officers of the Crown who had purchased their post at a high price: punishment of abuses necessarily lowered the value of the post. Nevertheless, excellent results were achieved: the deficit of 1661 turned into a surplus in 1666. The interest on the debt was reduced from 52 million to 24 million livres. The ''taille'' was reduced to 42 million in 1661 and 35 million in 1665; finally the revenue from indirect taxation progressed from 26 million to 55 million. The revenues of the royal domain were raised from 80,000 livres in 1661 to 5.5 million livres in 1671. In 1661, the receipts were equivalent to 26 million British pounds, of which 10 million reached the treasury. The expenditure was around 18 million pounds, leaving a deficit of 8 million. In 1667, the net receipts had risen to 20 million [[pounds sterling]], while expenditure had fallen to 11 million, leaving a surplus of 9 million pounds.\n\n[[File:Description-de-l'entree-Du-Roy-et-de-la-Reyne-Paris MG 1114.tif|thumb|Engraving of Louis XIV]]\n\nTo support the reorganized and enlarged army, the panoply of Versailles, and the growing civil administration, the king needed a good deal of money. Finance had always been the weak spot in the French monarchy: methods of collecting taxes were costly and inefficient; direct taxes passed through the hands of many intermediate officials; and indirect taxes were collected by private concessionaries, called tax farmers, who made a substantial profit. Consequently, the state always received far less than what the taxpayers actually paid.\n\nThe main weakness arose from an old bargain between the French crown and nobility: the king might raise taxes without consent if only he refrained from taxing the nobles. Only the \"unprivileged\" classes paid direct taxes, and this term came to mean the peasants only, since many bourgeois, in one way or another, obtained exemptions.\n\nThe system was outrageously unjust in throwing a heavy tax burden on the poor and helpless. Later, after 1700, the French ministers who were supported by Louis' secret wife Madame De Maintenon, were able to convince the king to change his fiscal policy. Louis was willing enough to tax the nobles but was unwilling to fall under their control, and only towards the close of his reign, under extreme stress of war, was he able, for the first time in French history, to impose direct taxes on the aristocratic elements of the population. This was a step toward equality before the law and toward sound public finance, but so many concessions and exemptions were won by nobles and bourgeois that the reform lost much of its value.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=250\u2013253,254\u2013255,256\u2013260}}</ref>\n\nLouis and Colbert also had wide-ranging plans to bolster French commerce and trade. Colbert's [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] administration established new industries and encouraged manufacturers and inventors, such as the [[Lyon]] silk manufacturers and the [[Gobelins manufactory]], a producer of tapestries. He invited manufacturers and artisans from all over Europe to France, such as [[Murano]] glassmakers, Swedish ironworkers, and Dutch shipbuilders. In this way, he aimed to decrease foreign imports while increasing French exports, hence reducing the net outflow of precious metals from France.\n\nLouis instituted reforms in military administration through [[Michel le Tellier]] and the latter's son [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois]]. They helped to curb the independent spirit of the nobility, imposing order on them at court and in the army. Gone were the days when generals protracted war at the frontiers while bickering over precedence and ignoring orders from the capital and the larger politico-diplomatic picture. The old military aristocracy (the ''Noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e'', or \"nobility of the sword\") ceased to have a monopoly over senior military positions and rank. Louvois, in particular, pledged to modernize the army and re-organize it into a professional, disciplined, well-trained force. He was devoted to the soldiers' material well-being and morale, and even tried to direct campaigns.\n\n===Relations with the major colonies===\n[[File:Louis14-Family.jpg|thumb|Louis and his family portrayed as Roman gods in a 1670 painting by [[Jean Nocret]].

Pre-revolutionary France was a patchwork of legal systems, with as many legal customs as there were provinces, and two co-existing legal traditions\u2014[[Custom (law)|customary law]] in the north and [[Roman law|Roman civil law]] in the south.<ref>Merryman, John Henry. ''The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America'', 2007 Stanford University Press.</ref> The ''Grande Ordonnance de Proc\u00e9dure Civile'' of 1667, also known as the ''Code Louis'', was a comprehensive legal code attempting a uniform regulation of [[civil procedure]] throughout legally irregular France. Among other things, it prescribed baptismal, marriage and death records in the state's registers, not the church's, and it strictly regulated the right of the ''Parlements'' to remonstrate.<ref>Antoine, Michel, ''Louis XV'', Fayard, Paris, 1989, p. 33</ref> The ''Code Louis'' played an important part in French legal history as the basis for the [[Napoleonic code]], from which many modern legal codes are, in turn, derived.\n\nOne of Louis' more infamous decrees was the ''Grande Ordonnance sur les Colonies'' of 1685, also known as the ''[[Code Noir]]'' (\"black code\"). Although it sanctioned slavery, it attempted to humanise the practice by prohibiting the separation of families. Additionally, in the colonies, only Roman Catholics could own slaves, and these had to be baptised.\n\nLouis ruled through a number of councils:\n*Conseil d'en haut (\"High Council\", concerning the most important matters of state)\u2014composed of the king, the crown prince, the controller-general of finances, and the secretaries of state in charge of various departments.

In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's eldest daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], as one of the provisions of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]].{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}} The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}} Mazarin and [[Hugues de Lionne|Lionne]], however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 [[\u00e9cu]]s.<ref>Dunlop, p. 54.</ref> The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin [[Charles II of Spain]] to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later [[Philip V of Spain]]), the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa.\n\nThe War of Devolution did not focus on the payment of the dowry, rather, the lack of payment was what Louis XIV used as a pretext for nullifying Maria Theresa's renunciation of her claims, allowing the land to \"devolve\" to him. In [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] (the location of the land in dispute), children of first marriages traditionally were not disadvantaged by their parents' remarriages and still inherited property. Louis' wife was Philip IV's daughter by his first marriage, while the new King of Spain, Charles II, was his son by a subsequent marriage. Thus, Brabant allegedly \"devolved\" to Maria Theresa. This excuse allowed France to attack the [[Spanish Netherlands]].\n\n===Relations with the Dutch===\n[[File:Louis XIV crosses the Rhine at Lobith - Lodewijk XIV trekt bij het Tolhuis bij Lobith de Rijn over, 12 juni 1672 (Adam Frans van der Meulen).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Louis XIV crosses the [[Lower Rhine]] at Lobith on 12 June 1672; [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]]]\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]] with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], France supported the [[Dutch Republic]] as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power. [[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]] from 1653 to 1672, viewed them as crucial for Dutch security and against his domestic [[Prince of Orange|Orangist]] opponents. Louis provided support in the 1665-1667 [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] but used the opportunity to launch the [[War of Devolution]] in 1667. This captured [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]; French expansion in this area was a direct threat to Dutch economic interests.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nThe Dutch opened talks with [[Charles II of England]] on a common diplomatic front against France, leading to the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], between England, the Dutch and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]]. The threat of an escalation and a secret treaty to divide Spanish possessions with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]], the other major claimant to the throne of Spain, led Louis to relinquish many of his gains in the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]].{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}}\n\nLouis placed little reliance on his agreement with Leopold and as it was now clear French and Dutch aims were in direct conflict, he decided to first defeat the Republic, then seize the Spanish Netherlands. This required breaking up the Triple Alliance; he paid Sweden to remain neutral and signed the 1670 [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] with Charles, an Anglo-French alliance against the Dutch. In May 1672, France invaded the Republic, supported by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and the [[Electorate of Cologne]].{{sfn|Lynn|1999|pp=109-110}} \n[[File:Louis XIV, King of France, after Lefebvre - Les collections du ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Louis XIV, ca 1673]]\nRapid French advance led to a coup that toppled [[Johan de Witt|De Witt]] and brought [[William III of England|William III]] to power. Leopold viewed French expansion into the Rhineland as an increasing threat, especially after their seizure of the strategic [[Duchy of Lorraine]] in 1670. The prospect of Dutch defeat led him to an alliance with [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] on 23 June, followed by another with the Republic on 25th.{{sfn|Mckay|1997|p=206}} Although Brandenburg was forced out of the war by the June 1673 [[Treaty of Vossem (1673)|Treaty of Vossem]], in August an anti-French alliance was formed by the Dutch, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], Emperor Leopold and the [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine|Duke of Lorraine]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=133}}\n\nThe French alliance was deeply unpopular in England, who made peace with the Dutch in the February 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]. However, French armies held significant advantages over their opponents; an undivided command, talented generals like [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] and vastly superior logistics. Reforms introduced by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], the [[Secretary of War]], helped maintain large field armies that could be mobilised much quicker, allowing them to mount offensives in early spring before their opponents were ready.{{sfn|Black|2011|pp=97-99}}\n\nThe French were forced to retreat from the Dutch Republic but these advantages allowed them to hold their ground in Alsace and the Spanish Netherlands, while retaking Franche-Comt\u00e9. By 1678, mutual exhaustion led to the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], which was generally settled in France's favour and allowed Louis to intervene in the [[Scanian War]]. Despite military defeat, his ally Sweden regained much of their losses under the 1679 treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679)|Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1679)|Fontainebleau]] and [[Peace of Lund|Lund]] imposed on [[Denmark-Norway]] and Brandenburg.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=213}}\n\nLouis was at the height of his power, but at the cost of uniting his opponents; this increased as he continued his expansion. In 1679, he dismissed his foreign minister [[Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne]], because he was seen as having compromised too much with the allies. Louis maintained the strength of his army, but in his next series of territorial claims avoided using military force alone. Rather, he combined it with legal pretexts in his efforts to augment the boundaries of his kingdom. Contemporary treaties were intentionally phrased ambiguously. Louis established the [[Chambers of Reunion]] to determine the full extent of his rights and obligations under those treaties.\n\n{{Coin image box 1 double\n|header        = Silver coin of Louis XIV, dated 1674\n|image         = File:Louis XIV Coin.jpg\n|caption_left  = Obverse.

Louis also sought [[Strasbourg]]<!-- Please do not uncomment unless consensus has been reached! ({{lang-de|Strassburg|links=no}})-->, an important strategic crossing on the left bank of the Rhine and theretofore a Free Imperial City of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], annexing it and other territories in 1681. Although a part of Alsace, Strasbourg was not part of Habsburg-ruled Alsace and was thus not ceded to France in the Peace of Westphalia.\n\nFollowing these annexations, Spain declared war, precipitating the [[War of the Reunions]]. However, the Spanish were rapidly defeated because the Emperor (distracted by the [[Great Turkish War]]) abandoned them, and the Dutch only supported them minimally. By the [[Truce of Ratisbon]], in 1684, Spain was forced to acquiesce in the French occupation of most of the conquered territories, for 20 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=161\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\nLouis' policy of the ''R\u00e9unions'' may have raised France to its greatest size and power during his reign, but it alienated much of Europe. This poor public opinion was compounded by French actions off the Barbary Coast and at Genoa. First, Louis had [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]], two Barbary pirate strongholds, bombarded to obtain a favourable treaty and the liberation of Christian slaves. Next, in 1684, a [[bombardment of Genoa|punitive mission]] was launched against [[Genoa]] in retaliation for its support for Spain in previous wars. Although the Genoese submitted, and the [[Doge of Genoa|Doge]] led an official mission of apology to Versailles, France gained a reputation for brutality and arrogance. European apprehension at growing French might and the realisation of the extent of the [[dragonnades]]' effect (discussed below) led many states to abandon their alliance with France.<ref name=\"Meriman, John 1996 319\">{{cite book|title=A History of Modern Europe|author=Meriman, John|year=1996|page=319|publisher=W.W.

This, in turn, was succeeded by another Siamese embassy under [[Kosa Pan]], superbly received at Versailles in 1686. Louis then sent another embassy in 1687, under [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]], and French influence grew at the Siamese court, which granted [[Mergui]] as a naval base to France.

Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.\n\nLouis initially supported traditional [[Gallicanism]], which limited [[Pope|papal]] authority in France, and convened an [[Assembly of the French clergy]] in November 1681. Before its dissolution eight months later, the Assembly had accepted the [[Declaration of the Clergy of France]], which increased royal authority at the expense of papal power. Without royal approval, bishops could not leave France, and appeals could not be made to the Pope. Additionally, government officials could not be excommunicated for acts committed in pursuance of their duties. Although the king could not make ecclesiastical law, all papal regulations without royal assent were invalid in France. Unsurprisingly, the pope repudiated the Declaration.<ref name=CatEn/>\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|Louis receiving the [[Doge of Genoa]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on 15 May 1685, following the [[Bombardment of Genoa]]. (''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes. 15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]], Versailles.)]]\n\nBy attaching nobles to his court at Versailles, Louis achieved increased control over the French aristocracy. Apartments were built to house those willing to pay court to the king.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sources of Making of the West, People and Cultures, Vol. 2, Since 1340</ref> However, the pensions and privileges necessary to live in a style appropriate to their rank were only possible by waiting constantly on Louis.<ref name=fordham/> For this purpose, an elaborate court ritual was created wherein the king became the centre of attention and was observed throughout the day by the public. With his excellent memory, Louis could then see who attended him at court and who was absent, facilitating the subsequent distribution of favours and positions. Another tool Louis used to control his nobility was censorship, which often involved the opening of letters to discern their author's opinion of the government and king.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Moreover, by entertaining, impressing, and domesticating them with extravagant luxury and other distractions, Louis not only cultivated public opinion of him, he also ensured the aristocracy remained under his scrutiny.\n\nLouis' extravagance at Versailles extended far beyond the scope of elaborate court rituals. In an excerpt from [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]],'' [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] recounts a story in which Louis took delivery of an [[African elephant]] as a gift. {{quote|In 1668 the king of [[Portugal]] sent an elephant from the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] to the king of France. It was seventeen years old and measured six and a half feet from the ground to the top of its back. The elephant lived in the [[Subsidiary structures of the Palace of Versailles|menagerie at Versailles]] for thirteen years and only grew a further foot, no doubt because the change in climate and food had stunted its growth; so it measured just seven and a half feet when the gentlemen of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences]] carried out their description of it.<ref>{{cite journal |authors= Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton  |title=Elephant |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.944/--elephant?rgn=main;view=fulltext |date=1 April 2015 | journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project |accessdate=1 April 2015 }}</ref>}} This, along with the prohibition of private armies, prevented them from passing time on their own estates and in their regional power bases, from which they historically waged local wars and plotted resistance to royal authority.{{efn|Coincidentally, at roughly the same time and for the same reasons, Japan adopted a similar policy, called [[sankin k\u014dtai]].}} Louis thus compelled and seduced the old military aristocracy (the \"nobility of the sword\") into becoming his ceremonial courtiers, further weakening their power. In their place, Louis raised commoners or the more recently ennobled bureaucratic aristocracy (the \"nobility of the robe\"). He judged that royal authority thrived more surely by filling high executive and administrative positions with these men because they could be more easily dismissed than nobles of ancient lineage, with entrenched influence. It is believed that Louis' policies were rooted in his experiences during the ''Fronde'', when men of high birth readily took up the rebel cause against their king, who was actually the kinsman of some. This victory of Louis' over the nobility may have then in fact ensured the end of major civil wars in France until the French Revolution about a century later.\n\n===France as the pivot of warfare===\n[[File:De-La-Torre-Jean-Du-Mont--M\u00e9moires MG 0958.tif|thumb|Louis XIV]]\n\nIn 1648 France was the leading European power, and most of the wars pivoted around its aggressiveness.  Only poverty-stricken Russia exceeded it in population, and no one could match its wealth, central location, and very strong professional army. It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years' War.  Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard-pressed to pay for all the military adventures, and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it.\n\nDuring the very long reign of King Louis XIV (1643 \u2013 1715), France fought three major wars: the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. There were also two lesser conflicts: the [[War of Devolution]] and the [[War of the Reunions]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p={{page needed|date=July 2017}} }}</ref> The wars were very expensive but they defined Louis XIV's foreign policies, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled \"by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique,\" Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.<ref name=\"James Nathan 1993\"/> By 1695, France retained much of its dominance, but had lost control of the seas to the combination of England and Holland.  What's more, most countries, both Protestant and Catholic, were in alliance against it. [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]], France's leading military strategist, warned the king in 1689 that a hostile \"Alliance\" was too powerful at sea. He recommended the best way for France to fight back was to license French merchants ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships, while avoiding its navies:\n:France has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces; Spain with all its dependencies in Europe, Asia, Africa and America; the Duke of Savoy [in Italy], England, Scotland, Ireland, and all their colonies in the East and West Indies; and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments.  France has ... undeclared enemies, indirectly hostile, hostile, and envious of its greatness, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Venice, Genoa, and part of the Swiss Confederation, all of which states secretly aid France's enemies by the troops that they hire to them, the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade.<ref>Quoted in Geoffrey Simcox, ed., ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism, 1618\u20131763'' (1974), pp. 236-37.</ref>\n\nVauban was pessimistic about France's so-called friends and allies: \n:For lukewarm, useless, or impotent friends, France has the Pope, who is indifferent; the King of England [James II] expelled from his country; the grand Duke of Tuscany; the Dukes of Mantua, Modena, and Parma [all in Italy]; and the other faction of the Swiss.  Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace, the others are cool in their affections....The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance; they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers, and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to... Allies....  We must therefore fall back on privateering as the method of conducting war which is most feasible, simple, cheap, and safe, and which will cost least to the state, the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King, who risks virtually nothing....It will enrich the country, train many good officers for the King, and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace.<ref>Quoted in Simcox, pp. 237, 242.</ref>\n\n==Revocation of the Edict of Nantes==\n{{main| Revocation of the Edict of Nantes}}\n[[File:S21c.jpg|thumb|left|Louis XIV in 1685, the year he revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]]]]\n\nIt has traditionally been suggested that the devout Madame de Maintenon pushed Louis to persecute Protestants and revoke the 1598 [[Edict of Nantes]], which awarded Huguenots political and religious freedom, but her influence in the matter is now being questioned.<ref>For example, see [[Veronica Buckley|Buckley, Veronica]]. ''Madame de Maintenon: The Secret Wife of Louis XIV''. London: Bloomsbury, 2008</ref> Louis saw the persistence of Protestantism as a disgraceful reminder of royal powerlessness. After all, the Edict was the pragmatic concession of his grandfather [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] to end the longstanding [[French Wars of Religion]]. An additional factor in Louis' thinking was the prevailing contemporary European principle to assure socio-political stability, ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (\"whose realm, his religion\"), the idea that the religion of the ruler should be the religion of the realm (as originally confirmed in central Europe in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555).<ref>Sturdy, David J. \"''Louis XIV''\", St Martin's Press, New York (1998), p. 89\u201399.</ref>\n\nResponding to petitions, Louis initially excluded Protestants from office, constrained the meeting of [[synods]], closed churches outside of Edict-stipulated areas, banned Protestant outdoor preachers, and prohibited domestic Protestant migration. He also disallowed Protestant-Catholic intermarriages to which third parties objected, encouraged missions to the Protestants, and rewarded converts to Catholicism.<ref>Sturdy, p. 92\u201393.</ref> This discrimination did not encounter much Protestant resistance, and a steady conversion of Protestants occurred, especially among the noble elites.\n\nIn 1681, Louis dramatically increased his persecution of Protestants. The principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio'' generally had also meant that subjects who refused to convert could emigrate, but Louis banned emigration and effectively insisted that all Protestants must be converted. Secondly, following the proposal of Ren\u00e9 de Marillac and the Marquis of Louvois, he began quartering [[dragoon]]s in Protestant homes. Although this was within his legal rights, the ''dragonnades'' inflicted severe financial strain on Protestants and atrocious abuse. Between 300,000 and 400,000 Huguenots converted, as this entailed financial rewards and exemption from the ''[[dragonnades]]''.<ref>Sturdy, p. 96, citing Pillorget, \"''France Baroque, France Classique''\", i, 935.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dragonnades430.jpg|thumb|[[Camisard|Protestant peasants]] rebelled against the officially sanctioned ''[[dragonnades]]'' (conversions enforced by [[dragoon]]s, labeled \"missionaries in boots\") that followed the Edict of Fontainebleau.]]\n\nOn 15 October 1685, Louis issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which cited the redundancy of privileges for Protestants given their scarcity after the extensive conversions. The Edict of Fontainebleau revoked the Edict of Nantes and repealed all the privileges that arose therefrom.<ref name=CatEn/> By his edict, Louis no longer tolerated the existence of Protestant groups, pastors, or churches in France. No further churches were to be constructed, and those already existing were to be demolished. Pastors could choose either exile or a secular life. Those Protestants who had resisted conversion were now to be [[forced conversion|baptised forcibly]] into the established church.<ref>Cathal J. Nolan, ''Wars of the age of Louis XIV, 1650\u20131715'' (2008) p. 132</ref>\n\nWriters have debated Louis' reasons for issuing the Edict of Fontainebleau. He may have been seeking to placate [[Pope Innocent XI]], with whom relations were tense and whose aid was necessary to determine the outcome of a succession crisis in the [[Electorate of Cologne]]. He may also have acted to upstage Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] and regain international prestige after the latter defeated the Turks without Louis' help. Otherwise, he may simply have desired to end the remaining divisions in French society dating to the Wars of Religion by fulfilling his coronation oath to eradicate heresy.<ref>Sturdy, p. 96-97.</ref><ref>Bluche, p. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nMany historians have condemned the Edict of Fontainebleau as gravely harmful to France.<ref name=bartleby>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/lo/Louis14Fr.html|title=Louis XIV, king of France|author=Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2007|accessdate=19 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107232540/http://www.bartleby.com/65/lo/Louis14Fr.html|archivedate=7 January 2008}}</ref> In support, they cite the emigration of about 200,000 highly skilled Huguenots (roughly one-fourth of the Protestant population, or 1% of the French population) who defied royal decrees and fled France for various Protestant states, weakening the French economy and enriching that of Protestant states.\n\nOn the other hand, there are historians who view this as an exaggeration. They argue that most of France's preeminent Protestant businessmen and industrialists converted to Catholicism and remained.<ref>David J. Sturdy, p. 98, citing W.C. Scoville, ''The Persecution of Huguenots and French Economic Development, 1680\u20131720'' (1960)</ref>\n\nWhat is certain is that reaction to the Edict was mixed. Even while French Catholic leaders exulted, Pope Innocent XI still argued with Louis over Gallicanism and criticised the use of violence. Protestants across Europe were horrified at the treatment of their co-religionists, but most Catholics in France applauded the move. Nonetheless, it is indisputable that Louis' public image in most of Europe, especially in Protestant regions, was dealt a severe blow.\n\nIn the end, however, despite renewed tensions with the [[Camisard]]s of south-central France at the end of his reign, Louis may have helped ensure that his successor would experience fewer instances of the religion-based disturbances that had plagued his forebears. French society would sufficiently change by the time of his descendant, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], to welcome tolerance in the form of the 1787 [[Edict of Versailles]], also known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]]. This restored to non-Catholics their civil rights and the freedom to worship openly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html|title=casinosdigital.de|website=booking-help.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html|archivedate=14 July 2012}}</ref> With the advent of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, Protestants were granted equal rights with their Roman Catholic counterparts.\n\n==League of Augsburg==\n{{Main|War of the Grand Alliance}}\n\n===Causes and conduct of the war===\n[[File:Batalla de Fleurus (1690).jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]], 1690]]\n[[File:Nocret, attributed to - Louis XIV of France - Versailles, MV2066.jpg|thumb|Louis in 1690]]\n\nThe [[War of the League of Augsburg]], which lasted from 1688 to 1697, initiated a period of decline in Louis' political and diplomatic fortunes. The conflict arose from two events in the [[Rhineland]]. First, in 1685, the [[Elector Palatine]] [[Charles II, Elector Palatine|Charles II]] died. All that remained of his immediate family was Louis' sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Elizabeth Charlotte]]. German law ostensibly barred her from succeeding to her brother's lands and electoral dignity, but it was unclear enough for arguments in favour of Elizabeth Charlotte to have a chance of success. Conversely, the princess was clearly entitled to a division of the family's personal property. Louis pressed her claims to land and chattels, hoping the latter, at least, would be given to her.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel. \"The Story of Civilisation (Volume 8): The Age of Louis XIV\", Simon & Schuster, Boston (1963), p. 691.</ref> Then, in 1688, [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], an ally of France, died. The archbishopric had traditionally been held by the [[Wittelsbach]]s of [[Bavaria]]. However, the Bavarian claimant to replace Maximilian Henry, Prince [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria]], was at that time not more than 17 years old and not even ordained. Louis sought instead to install his own candidate, [[William Egon of F\u00fcrstenberg]], to ensure the key Rhenish state remained an ally.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=192}}.</ref>\n\nIn light of his foreign and domestic policies during the early 1680s, which were perceived as aggressive, Louis' actions, fostered by the succession crises of the late 1680s, created concern and alarm in much of Europe. This led to the formation of the 1686 [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] by the Holy Roman Emperor, Spain, Sweden, [[Saxony]], and Bavaria. Their stated intention was to return France to at least the borders agreed to in the Treaty of Nijmegen.<ref>Dunlop, Ian. \"Louis XIV\", p. 313, Pimlico London 2001.</ref> Emperor Leopold I's persistent refusal to convert the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent treaty fed Louis' fears that the Emperor would turn on France and attack the Reunions after settling his affairs in the Balkans.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=189\u2013191}}.</ref>\n\nAnother event that Louis found threatening was the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, in England. Although King [[James II of England|James II]] was Catholic, his two [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] daughters, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], ensured the English people a Protestant succession. However, when James II's son [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]] was born, he took precedence in the succession over his elder sisters. This seemed to herald an era of Catholic monarchs in England. Protestant lords called on the Dutch Prince [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], grandson of [[Charles I of England]], to come to their aid. He sailed for England with troops despite Louis' warning that France would regard it as a provocation. Witnessing numerous desertions and defections, even among those closest to him, James II fled England. Parliament declared the throne vacant, and offered it to James's daughter Mary II and his son-in-law and nephew William. Vehemently anti-French, William (now William III of England) pushed his new kingdoms into war, thus transforming the League of Augsburg into the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]]. Before this happened, Louis expected William's expedition to England to absorb his energies and those of his allies, so he dispatched troops to the Rhineland after the expiry of his ultimatum to the German princes requiring confirmation of the Truce of Ratisbon and acceptance of his demands about the succession crises. This military manoeuvre was also intended to protect his eastern provinces from Imperial invasion by depriving the enemy army of sustenance, thus explaining the pre-emptive [[scorched earth]] policy pursued in much of southwestern Germany (the \"Devastation of the Palatinate\").<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=192\u2013193}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Equestrian portrait louis xiv 1692.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Louis XIV at the [[Siege of Namur (1692)]]]]\n\nFrench armies were generally victorious throughout the war because of Imperial commitments in the Balkans, French logistical superiority, and the quality of French generals such as Cond\u00e9's famous pupil, [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg]]. His triumphs at the Battles of [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Fleurus]] in 1690, [[Battle of Steenkerque|Steenkerque]] in 1692, and [[Battle of Landen|Landen]] in 1693 preserved northern France from invasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p={{page needed|date=July 2017}} }}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Marshal luxembourg.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal de Luxembourg]]\n\nAlthough an attempt to restore James II failed at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, France accumulated a string of victories from Flanders in the north, Germany in the east, and Italy and Spain in the south, to the high seas and the colonies. Louis personally supervised the captures of [[Siege of Mons (1691)|Mons]] in 1691 and [[Siege of Namur (1692)|Namur]] in 1692. Luxembourg gave France the defensive line of the [[Sambre]] by capturing [[Charleroi]] in 1693. France also overran most of the [[Duchy of Savoy]] after the battles of [[Battle of Marsaglia|Marsaglia]] and [[Battle of Staffarda|Staffarde]] in 1693. While naval stalemate ensued after the French victory at the [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]] in 1690 and the Allied victory at [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hougue|Barfleur-La Hougue]] in 1692, the [[Battle of Torroella]] in 1694 exposed [[Catalonia]] to French invasion, culminating in the capture of [[Barcelona]]. Although the Dutch captured [[Pondicherry district|Pondich\u00e9ry]] in 1693, a French raid on the Spanish treasure [[port of Cartagena]], Spain in 1697 yielded a fortune of 10,000,000 livres.\n\nIn July 1695, the city of [[Namur (city)|Namur]], occupied for three years by the French, [[Siege of Namur (1695)|was besieged]] by an allied army led by William III. Louis XIV ordered the surprise destruction of a Flemish city to divert the attention of these troops. This led to the [[bombardment of Brussels]], in which 4-5000 buildings were destroyed, including the entire city-center. The strategy failed, as Namur fell three weeks later, but harmed Louis XIV's reputation: a century later, [[Napoleon]] deemed the bombardment \"as barbarous as it was useless.\"<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Cited in ''Cahiers bruxellois'', t. III, fasc. II, 1958, by C. Terlinden. Lit.: ''aussi barbare qu\u2019inutile''</ref>\n\nPeace was broached by Sweden in 1690. By 1692, both sides evidently wanted peace, and secret bilateral talks began, but to no avail.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=232}}.</ref> Louis tried to break up the alliance against him by dealing with individual opponents, but this did not achieve its aim until 1696, when the [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoyards]] agreed to the Treaty of Turin and switched sides. Thereafter, members of the League of Augsburg rushed to the peace table, and negotiations for a general peace began in earnest, culminating in the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=253}}.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Ryswick===\n{{Main|Treaty of Ryswick}}\nThe [[Treaty of Ryswick]] ended the War of the League of Augsburg and disbanded the Grand Alliance. By manipulating their rivalries and suspicions, Louis divided his enemies and broke their power.\n\nThe treaty yielded many benefits for France. Louis secured permanent French sovereignty over all of Alsace, including Strasbourg, and established the Rhine as the Franco-German border (which persists to this day). Pondich\u00e9ry and [[Acadia]] were returned to France, and Louis' ''de facto'' possession of [[Saint-Domingue]] was recognised as lawful. However, he returned [[Catalonia]] and most of the Reunions.\n\nFrench military superiority might have allowed him to press for more advantageous terms. Thus, his generosity to Spain with regard to Catalonia has been read as a concession to foster pro-French sentiment and may ultimately have induced King [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] to name Louis' grandson [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duke of Anjou]], as heir to the throne of Spain.<ref>Bluche, p. 653.</ref> In exchange for financial compensation, France renounced its interests in the Electorate of Cologne and the Palatinate. [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], which had been occupied by the French since 1670, was returned to its rightful Duke [[Leopold, Duke of Lorraine|Leopold]], albeit with a right of way to the French military. William and Mary were recognised as joint sovereigns of the British Isles, and Louis withdrew support for James II. The Dutch were given the right to garrison forts in the Spanish Netherlands that acted as a protective barrier against possible French aggression. Though in some respects, the Treaty of Ryswick may appear a diplomatic defeat for Louis since he failed to place client rulers in control of the Palatinate or the Electorate of Cologne, he did in fact fulfill many of the aims laid down in his 1688 ultimatum.<ref>Lossky, Andrew. \"''Louis XIV and the French Monarchy''\", New Brunswick, New Jersey (1994), p. 255</ref> In any case, peace in 1697 was desirable to Louis, since France was exhausted from the costs of the war.\n\n==War of the Spanish Succession==\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n\n===Causes and build-up to the war===\n[[File:Hyacinthe Rigaud - Philippe V, roi d'Espagne (1683-1746) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip V of Spain]]]]\nBy the time of the Treaty of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years. King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Milan]], the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]]. He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\nThe principal claimants to the throne of Spain belonged to the ruling families of France and Austria. The French claim derived from Louis XIV's mother Anne of Austria (the older sister of [[Philip IV of Spain]]) and his wife Maria Theresa (Philip IV's eldest daughter). Based on the laws of [[primogeniture]], France had the better claim as it originated from the eldest daughters in two generations. However, their renunciation of succession rights complicated matters. In the case of Maria Theresa, nonetheless, the renunciation was considered null and void owing to Spain's breach of her marriage contract with Louis. In contrast, no renunciations tainted the claims of the Emperor Leopold I's son [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles, Archduke of Austria]], who was a grandson of Philip III's youngest daughter [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]]. The English and Dutch feared that a French or Austrian-born Spanish king would threaten the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] and thus preferred the Bavarian Prince [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria (1692-1699)|Joseph Ferdinand]], a grandson of Leopold I through his first wife [[Margaret Theresa of Spain]] (the younger daughter of Philip IV).\n\nIn an attempt to avoid war, Louis signed the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|Treaty of the Hague]] with William III of England in 1698. This agreement divided Spain's Italian territories between Louis's son ''le Grand Dauphin'' and the Archduke Charles, with the rest of the empire awarded to Joseph Ferdinand. William III consented to permitting the Dauphin's new territories to become part of France when the latter succeeded to his father's throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=267}}.</ref> The signatories, however, omitted to consult the ruler of these lands, and Charles II was passionately opposed to the dismemberment of his empire. In 1699, he re-confirmed his 1693 will that named Joseph Ferdinand as his sole successor.<ref name=\"Dunlop, Ian p. 353\">Dunlop, Ian. \"''Louis XIV''\", p. 353, Pimlico, London 2001.</ref>\n\nSix months later, Joseph Ferdinand died. Therefore, in 1700, Louis and William III concluded a fresh partitioning agreement, the [[Treaty of London (1700)|Treaty of London]]. This allocated Spain, the Low Countries, and the Spanish colonies to the Archduke. The Dauphin would receive all of Spain's Italian territories.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=268}} Charles II acknowledged that his empire could only remain undivided by bequeathing it entirely to a Frenchman or an Austrian. Under pressure from his German wife, [[Maria Anna of Neuburg]], Charles II named the Archduke Charles as his sole heir.\n\n===Acceptance of the will of Charles II and consequences===\n[[File:Louis le Grand; Rigaud Hyacinthe.jpg|thumb|Louis in 1701]]\nOn his deathbed in 1700, Charles II unexpectedly changed his will. The clear demonstration of French military superiority for many decades before this time, the pro-French faction at the court of Spain, and even [[Pope Innocent XII]] convinced him that France was more likely to preserve his empire intact. He thus offered the entire empire to the Dauphin's second son Philip, Duke of Anjou, provided it remained undivided. Anjou was not in the direct line of French succession, thus his accession would not cause a Franco-Spanish union.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=268}} If Anjou refused, the throne would be offered to his younger brother [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]]. If the Duke of Berry declined it, it would go to the Archduke Charles, then to the distantly related [[House of Savoy]] if Charles declined it.<ref>Kamen, Henry. (2001) ''Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice'', Yale University Press, p. 6. {{ISBN|0-300-08718-7}}.</ref>\n\nLouis was confronted with a difficult choice. He might agree to a partition of the Spanish possessions and avoid a general war, or accept Charles II's will and alienate much of Europe. Initially, Louis may have been inclined to abide by the partition treaties. However, the Dauphin's insistence persuaded Louis otherwise.<ref>Dunlop, p. 358.</ref> Moreover, Louis's foreign minister, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert, marquis de Torcy]], pointed out that war with the Emperor would almost certainly ensue whether Louis accepted the partition treaties or Charles II's will. He emphasised that, should it come to war, William III was unlikely to stand by France since he \"made a treaty to avoid war and did not intend to go to war to implement the treaty\".<ref name=\"Dunlop, Ian p. 353\"/> Indeed, in the event of a war, it might be preferable to be already in control of the disputed lands. Eventually, therefore, Louis decided to accept Charles II's will. Philip, Duke of Anjou, thus became Philip V, King of Spain.\n\nMost European rulers accepted Philip as king, though some only reluctantly. Depending on one's views of the war as inevitable or not, Louis acted reasonably or arrogantly.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=269, see footnote 1}}.</ref> He confirmed that Philip V retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position. Admittedly, he may only have been hypothesising a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco-Spanish union. But his actions were certainly not read as being disinterested. Moreover, Louis sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands to evict Dutch garrisons and secure Dutch recognition of Philip V. In 1701, Philip transferred the ''[[asiento]]'' (the right to supply slaves to Spanish colonies) to France, alienating English traders. As tensions mounted, Louis decided to acknowledge [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the son of James II, as king of England on the latter's death, infuriating William III. These actions enraged Britain and the Dutch Republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=269\u2013270}}.</ref> With the Holy Roman Emperor and the petty German states, they formed another Grand Alliance and declared war on France in 1702. French diplomacy, however, secured Bavaria, [[Portugal]], and Savoy as Franco-Spanish allies.<ref>Merriman, page 321.</ref>\n\n===Commencement of fighting===\n[[File:Batalladealmansa.jpg|thumb|The Franco-Spanish army led by the [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick|Duke of Berwick]] defeated decisively the Alliance forces of Portugal, England, and the Dutch Republic at the [[Battle of Almansa]].]]\n[[File:1706-05-23-Slag bij Ramillies.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ramillies]] between the French and the English, 23 May 1706]]\nEven before war was officially declared, hostilities began with Imperial aggression in Italy. When finally declared, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] would last almost until Louis's death, at great cost to him and the kingdom of France.\n\nThe war began with French successes, however the joint talents of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough]], and [[Eugene of Savoy]] checked these victories and broke the myth of French invincibility. The duo allowed the Palatinate and Austria to occupy Bavaria after their victory at the [[Battle of Blenheim]]. [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]], had to flee to the Spanish Netherlands. The impact of this victory won the support of Portugal and Savoy. Later, the [[Battle of Ramillies]] delivered the Low Countries up to the Allies, and the [[Battle of Turin]] forced Louis to evacuate Italy, leaving it open to Allied forces. Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy met again at the [[Battle of Oudenarde]], which enabled them to mount an invasion of France.\n\nFrance established contact with [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] and promised support if he took up the cause of [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence|Hungarian independence]].\n\nDefeats, famine, and mounting debt greatly weakened France. Between 1693 and 1710, over two million people died in two [[famine]]s, made worse as foraging armies seized food supplies from the villages.<ref>{{cite journal|last=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|first=Cormac|author2=Chevet, Jean-Michel |year=2002|title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient R\u00e9gime'' France|journal=The Journal of Economic History|pmid=17494233|volume=62|issue=3|pages=706\u2013733|doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055|url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/368/3/ogradac_article_pub_039.pdf|hdl=10197/368}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Cambridge Journals Online - The Journal of Economic History - Abstract - ''FAMINE AND MARKET IN'' ANCIEN R\u00c9GIME ''FRANCE''|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=62|issue=3|doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055|year=2002|last1=\u00f3 Gr\u00e1da|first1=Cormac|last2=Chevet|first2=Jean-Michel|hdl=10197/368|url=https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/368/3/ogradac_article_pub_039.pdf|pmid=17494233|pages=706\u201333}}</ref> In his desperation, Louis XIV even ordered a disastrous invasion of the English island of [[Guernsey]] in the autumn of 1704 with the aim of raiding their successful harvest. By the winter of 1708\u20131709, Louis was willing to accept peace at nearly any cost. He agreed that the entire Spanish empire should be surrendered to the Archduke Charles, and he also consented to return to the frontiers of the Peace of Westphalia, giving up all the territories he had acquired over sixty years of his reign. He could not speak for his grandson, however, and could not promise that Philip V would accept these terms. Thus, the Allies demanded that Louis single-handedly attack his own grandson to force these terms on him. If he could not achieve this within the year, the war would resume. Louis could not accept these terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=326}}.</ref>\n\n===Turning point===\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = France 1709-A One Louis d'Or.jpg |bSize = 445|cWidth = 220|cHeight = 220|oTop = 3|oLeft = 3|Location = right|Description=Louis XIV depicted on a [[Louis d'or]] in 1709}}\n\nThe final phases of the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated that the Allies could not maintain the Archduke Charles in Spain just as surely as France could not retain the entire Spanish inheritance for King Philip V. The Allies were definitively expelled from central Spain by the Franco-Spanish victories at the Battles of [[Battle of Villaviciosa|Villaviciosa]] and [[Battle of Brihuega|Brihuega]] in 1710. French forces elsewhere remained obdurate despite their defeats. The Allies suffered a [[Pyrrhic victory]] at the [[Battle of Malplaquet]] with 21,000 casualties, twice that of the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=334}}.</ref> Eventually, France recovered its military pride with the decisive victory at [[Battle of Denain|Denain]] in 1712.\n\nFrench military successes near the end of the war took place against the background of a changed political situation in Austria. In 1705, the Emperor Leopold I died. His elder son and successor, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], followed him in 1711. His heir was none other than the Archduke Charles, who secured control of all of his brother's Austrian land holdings. If the Spanish empire then fell to him, it would have resurrected a domain as vast as that of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in the sixteenth century. To the maritime powers of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, this would have been as undesirable as a Franco-Spanish union.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=342}}.</ref>\n\n===Conclusion of peace===\n[[File:Philippe Buache Carte de France divisee suivant les quatre departements de Messieurs les secretaires dEtat 07710637.jpg|thumb|Map of France after the death of Louis XIV]]\nAs a result of the fresh British perspective on the European balance of power, Anglo-French talks began that culminated in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] between Louis, [[Philip V of Spain]], [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], and the [[Dutch Republic]]. In 1714, after losing [[Landau]] and [[Freiburg]], the Holy Roman Emperor also made peace with France in the Treaties of [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] and [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Baden]].\n\nIn the general settlement, Philip V retained Spain and its colonies, whereas Austria received the Spanish Netherlands and divided [[Kingdom of Sicily under Savoy|Spanish Italy]] with [[Savoy]]. Britain kept [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]]. Louis agreed to withdraw his support for James Stuart, son of James II and pretender to the throne of Great Britain, and ceded [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Rupert's Land]], and [[Acadia]] in the Americas to Anne. Britain gained most from the Treaty of Utrecht, but the final terms were much more favourable to France than those which were being discussed in peace negotiations in 1709 and 1710.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} France retained [[Prince Edward Island|\u00cele-Saint-Jean]] and [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], and Louis did acquire a few minor European territories, such as the [[Orange, Vaucluse|Principality of Orange]] and the [[Ubaye Valley]], which covered transalpine passes into Italy. Thanks to Louis, his allies the Electors of Bavaria and Cologne were restored to their pre-war status and returned their lands.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=356\u2013360}}.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages and children===\n[[File:Dual Cypher of King Louis XIV & Queen Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France.svg|thumb|right|Dual Cypher of King Louis XIV & [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Queen Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]]]]\nLouis and his wife [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660. However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, ''[[le Grand Dauphin]]'', known as ''Monseigneur''. Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.\n\nDespite evidence of affection early on in their marriage, Louis was never faithful to Maria Theresa. He took a series of mistresses, both official and unofficial. Among the better documented are [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]] (with whom he had 5 children; 1661\u201367), [[Bonne de Pons d'Heudicourt]] (1665), [[Catherine Charlotte de Gramont]] (1665), [[Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs, Marquise de Montespan]] (with whom he had 7 children; 1667\u201380), [[Anne de Rohan-Chabot]] (1669\u201375), [[Claude de Vin des \u0152illets]] (1 child born in 1676), [[Isabelle de Ludres]] (1675\u201378), and [[Marie Ang\u00e9lique de Scorailles]] (1679\u201381), who died at age 19 in childbirth. Through these liaisons, he produced numerous illegitimate children, most of whom he married to members of [[cadet branch]]es of the [[royal family]].\n\nLouis proved relatively more faithful to his second wife, [[Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, Marquise de Maintenon]].  He first met her through her work caring for his children by Madame de Montespan, noting the care she gave to his favorite, [[Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine]].{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}  The king was, at first, put off by her strict religious practice, but he warmed to her through her care for his children.{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}\n\nWhen he legitimized his children by Madame de Montespan on 20 December 1673, Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9 became the royal governess at Saint-Germain.{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}  As governess, she was one of very few people permitted to speak to him as an equal, without limits.{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}  It is believed that they were married secretly at Versailles on or around 10 October 1683<ref name=autogenerated1>[[Veronica Buckley|Buckley, Veronica]].

He brought the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] under his [[patronage]] and became its \"Protector\". He allowed [[French literature|Classical French literature]] to flourish by protecting such writers as [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], and [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], whose works remain greatly influential to this day. Louis also patronised the visual arts by funding and commissioning various artists, such as [[Charles Le Brun]], [[Pierre Mignard]], [[Antoine Coysevox]], and [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], whose works became famous throughout Europe. In music, composers and musicians such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jacques Champion de Chambonni\u00e8res]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] thrived. In 1661, Louis founded the [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse]], and in 1669, the [[Paris Opera|Acad\u00e9mie d'Op\u00e9ra]], important driving events in the evolution of [[ballet]]. The King also attracted, supported and patronized such artists as [[Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle]] who revolutionised [[marquetry]] with his art of [[inlay]], today known as \"[[Boulle Work]]\".\n\nOver the course of four building campaigns, Louis converted a hunting lodge built by Louis XIII into the spectacular [[Palace of Versailles]]. With the exception of the current Royal Chapel (built near the end of Louis' reign), the palace achieved much of its current appearance after the third building campaign, which was followed by an official move of the royal court to Versailles on 6 May 1682. Versailles became a dazzling, awe-inspiring setting for state affairs and the reception of foreign dignitaries. At Versailles, the king alone commanded attention.\n\n[[File:LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg|thumb|Bust of Louis XIV by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]]]]\n\nSeveral reasons have been suggested for the creation of the extravagant and stately palace, as well as the relocation of the monarchy's seat. For example, the memoirist [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] speculated that Louis viewed Versailles as an isolated power center where treasonous [[cabal]]s could be more readily discovered and foiled.<ref name=fordham>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/17stsimon.html|title=Historical Memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon, volume 1 1691\u20131709: The Court of Louis XIV|author=Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|accessdate=19 January 2008}}</ref> Alternatively, there has been speculation that the revolt of the ''Fronde'' caused Louis to hate Paris, which he abandoned for a country retreat. However, his sponsorship of many public works in Paris, such as the establishment of a police force and of street-lighting,<ref>Dunlop, Ian. \"''Louis XIV''\", p. 242-251, Pimlico London 2001.</ref> lend little credence to this theory. As a further example of his continued care for the capital, Louis constructed the ''[[Les Invalides|H\u00f4tel des Invalides]]'', a military complex and home to this day for officers and soldiers rendered infirm either by injury or old age. While pharmacology was still quite rudimentary in his day, the ''Invalides'' pioneered new treatments and set new standards for hospice treatment. The conclusion of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], in 1668, also induced Louis to demolish the northern walls of Paris in 1670 and replace them with wide tree-lined boulevards.<ref>Dunlop, p. 247.</ref>\n\nLouis also renovated and improved the [[Palais du Louvre|Louvre]] and other royal residences. [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] was originally to plan additions to the Louvre; however, his plans would have meant the destruction of much of the existing structure, replacing it with an Italian summer [[villa]] in the centre of Paris. Bernini's plans were eventually shelved in favour of the elegant [[Louvre Colonnade]] designed by three Frenchmen: [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Charles Le Brun]], and [[Claude Perrault]]. With the relocation of the court to Versailles, the Louvre was given over to the arts and the public.<ref>Bluche, Fran\u00e7ois. \"''Louis XIV''\", p. 497, Hachette Litteratures, Paris (1986).</ref>\nDuring his visit from Rome, Bernini also executed a renowned [[Bust of Louis XIV (Bernini)|portrait bust]] of the king.\n\n==Image and depiction==\n[[File:Bronze bust of Louis XIV. Circa 1660 CE, by unknown artist. From Paris, France. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London.jpg|thumb|Bronze bust of Louis XIV. Circa 1660, by an unknown artist. From Paris, France. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.]]\nFew rulers in world history have commemorated themselves in as grand a manner as Louis.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Peter|last=Burke|title=The fabrication of Louis XIV|journal=History Today|year=1992|volume=42|issue=2}}</ref> Louis used court ritual and the arts to validate and augment his control over France. With his support, Colbert established from the beginning of Louis' personal reign a centralised and institutionalised system for creating and perpetuating the royal image. The King was thus portrayed largely in majesty or at war, notably against Spain. This portrayal of the monarch was to be found in numerous media of artistic expression, such as painting, sculpture, theatre, dance, music, and the almanacs that diffused royal propaganda to the population at large.\n\n===Evolution of royal portraiture===\n[[File:Le roi gouverne par lui-m\u00eame.jpg|thumb|left|''Le roi gouverne par lui-m\u00eame'', ''modello'' for the central panel of the ceiling of the [[Hall of Mirrors]] ca. 1680 by [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], (1619\u20131690)]]\nOver his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of the smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647. In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god [[Apollo]], or [[Alexander the Great]], as can be seen in many works of [[Charles Le Brun]], such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments.\n\nThe depiction of the king in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes, instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted. Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda. There is no better illustration of this than in [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s frequently-reproduced ''Portrait of Louis XIV of 1701'', in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stanis|last=Perez|date=July\u2013September 2003|title=Les rides d'Apollon: l'\u00e9volution des portraits de Louis XIV|trans-title=Apollo's Wrinkles: The Evolution of Portraits of Louis XIV|journal=Revue d'Histoire Moderne et Contemporaine|volume=50|issue=3|pages=62\u201395|issn=0048-8003|jstor=20530984 }}</ref>\n\nRigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture during Louis' reign. Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis' personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the king's costume with great precision, down to his shoe buckle.<ref>See also {{cite journal|doi=10.1353/jhi.2002.0027|first=Amy M.|last=Schmitter|title=Representation and the Body of Power in French Academic Painting|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2002|volume=63|issue=3|pages=399\u2013424|issn=0022-5037|jstor=3654315}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's original, now housed in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], was originally meant as a gift to Louis' grandson, [[Philip V of Spain]]. However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud, often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis' exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.\n\n===Other works of art===\nIn addition to portraits, Louis commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s, to stand in Paris and provincial towns as physical manifestations of his rule. He also commissioned \"war artists\" to follow him on campaigns to document his military triumphs. To remind the people of these triumphs, Louis erected permanent triumphal arches in Paris and the provinces for the first time since the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].\n\nLouis' reign marked the birth and infancy of the art of medallions. Sixteenth-century rulers had often issued medals in small numbers to commemorate the major events of their reigns. Louis, however, struck more than 300 to celebrate the story of the king in bronze, that were enshrined in thousands of households throughout France.\n\nHe also used tapestries as a medium of exalting the monarchy. Tapestries could be allegorical, depicting the elements or seasons, or realist, portraying royal residences or historical events. They were among the most significant means to spread royal propaganda prior to the construction of the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] at Versailles.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3406/hes.2000.2134|first=G\u00e9rard|last=Sabatier|title=La Gloire du Roi: Iconographie de Louis XIV de 1661 a 1672|journal=Histoire, \u00c9conomie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9|year=2000|volume=19|issue=4|pages=527\u2013560|url=http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/hes_0752-5702_2000_num_19_4_2134.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Ballet===\n[[File:Chateau Versailles Galerie des Glaces.jpg|thumb|Hall of Mirrors, Palace of Versailles]]\n\nLouis loved [[French ballet|ballet]] and frequently danced in court ballets during the early half of his reign.

Louis played an Egyptian in ''Le Mariage forc\u00e9'' in 1664, a Moorish gentleman in ''Le Sicilien'' in 1667, and both Neptune and Apollo in ''Les Amants magnifiques'' in 1670.\n\nHe sometimes danced leading roles which were suitably royal or godlike (such as Neptune, Apollo, or the Sun).<ref name=\"PJ 283-298\"/> At other times, he would adopt mundane roles before appearing at the end in the lead role. It is considered that, at all times, he provided his roles with sufficient majesty and drew the limelight with his flair for dancing.<ref name=\"PJ 283-298\"/> For Louis, ballet may not have merely been a tool for manipulation in his propaganda machinery.

They often focused on the miseries arising from poor government, but also carried the hope for a better future when Louis escaped the malignant influence of his ministers and mistresses, and took the government into his own hands. On the other hand, petitions addressed either directly to Louis or to his ministers exploited the traditional imagery and language of monarchy. These varying interpretations of Louis abounded in self-contradictions that reflected the people's amalgamation of their everyday experiences with the idea of monarchy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jens Ivo|first1=Engels|date=July\u2013September 2003|title=D\u00e9nigrer, esp\u00e9rer, assumer la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.

On 18 November 1686, Louis underwent a painful operation for an [[anal fistula]] that was performed by the surgeon Charles Felix de Tassy, who prepared a specially shaped curved [[scalpel]] for the occasion.

His last surviving in-wedlock son, the Dauphin, died in 1711. Barely a year later, the Duke of Burgundy, the eldest of the Dauphin's three sons and then heir to Louis, followed his father. Burgundy's elder son, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1707-1712)|Louis, Duke of Brittany]], joined them a few weeks later. Thus, on his deathbed, Louis' heir was his five-year-old great-grandson, [[Louis XV of France|Louis, Duke of Anjou]], Burgundy's younger son.\n\nLouis foresaw an underaged heir and sought to restrict the power of his nephew [[Philip II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who, as his closest surviving legitimate relative in France, would likely become regent to the prospective Louis XV. Accordingly, the king created a regency council as Louis XIII had in anticipation of Louis XIV's own minority, with some power vested in his illegitimate son [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine]].<ref>Dunlop, p. 454\u2013455.</ref> Orl\u00e9ans, however, had Louis' will annulled by the ''Parlement of Paris'' after his death and made himself sole regent.

Do not imitate me, but be a peaceful prince, and may you apply yourself principally to the alleviation of the burdens of your subjects.<ref name=\"Bluche, Fran\u00e7ois p. 890\">Bluche, p. 890.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:France 1552-1798.png|thumb|Territorial expansion of France under Louis XIV (1643\u20131715) is depicted in orange.]]\n\nSome historians point out that it was a customary demonstration of piety in those days to exaggerate one's sins. Thus they do not place much emphasis on Louis' deathbed declarations in assessing his accomplishments. Rather, they focus on military and diplomatic successes, such as how he placed a French prince on the Spanish throne. This, they contend, ended the threat of an aggressive Spain that historically interfered in domestic French politics. These historians also emphasise the effect of Louis' wars in expanding France's boundaries and creating more defensible frontiers that preserved France from invasion until the Revolution.<ref name=\"Bluche, Fran\u00e7ois p. 890\"/>\n\nArguably, Louis also applied himself indirectly to \"the alleviation of the burdens of [his] subjects.\" For example, he patronised the arts, encouraged industry, fostered trade and commerce, and sponsored the founding of an overseas empire. Moreover, the significant reduction in civil wars and aristocratic rebellions during his reign are seen by these historians as the result of Louis' consolidation of royal authority over feudal elites.<ref>See above, section on \"Height of Power.\"</ref> In their analysis, his early reforms centralised France and marked the birth of the modern French state. They regard the political and military victories as well as numerous cultural achievements as the means by which Louis helped raise France to a preeminent position in Europe.<ref>Dunlop, p. 433; citing Montesquieu: \"''Louis established the greatness of France by building Versailles and Marly''.\"</ref> Europe came to admire France for its military and cultural successes, power, and sophistication. Europeans generally began to emulate French manners, values, goods, and deportment. French became the universal language of the European elite.\n\nLouis' detractors have argued that his considerable foreign, military, and domestic expenditure impoverished and bankrupted France. His supporters, however, distinguish the state, which was impoverished, from France, which was not. As supporting evidence, they cite the literature of the time, such as the social commentary in [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Persian Letters]]''.<ref>Bluche, p. 876, Hachette Litteratures, Paris (1986).</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Louis' critics attribute the social upheaval culminating in the French Revolution to his failure to reform French institutions while the monarchy was still secure. Other scholars counter that there was little reason to reform institutions that largely worked well under Louis. They also maintain that events occurring almost 80 years after his death were not reasonably foreseeable to Louis, and that in any case, his successors had sufficient time to initiate reforms of their own.<ref>Bluche, p. 506 & 877\u2013878, Hachette Litteratures, Paris (1986).</ref>\n\n[[File:Marche du Roy accompagn\u00e9 des ses gardes passant sur le pont neuf et allant au Palais.JPG|thumb|Royal procession passing the [[Pont-Neuf]] under Louis XIV]]\n\nLouis has often been criticised for his vanity. The memoirist [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], who claimed that Louis slighted him, criticised him thus: <blockquote>There was nothing he liked so much as flattery, or, to put it more plainly, adulation; the coarser and clumsier it was, the more he relished it.</blockquote> For his part, [[Voltaire]] saw Louis' vanity as the cause for his bellicosity:<blockquote>It is certain that he passionately wanted glory, rather than the conquests themselves. In the acquisition of Alsace and half of Flanders, and of all of Franche-Comt\u00e9, what he really liked was the name he made for himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-14.htm|title=The wars of Louis XIV|website=wisc.edu|access-date=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603010836/http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-14.htm|archive-date=3 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNonetheless, Louis has also received praise.

This line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orl\u00e9ans and Emperors of Brazil.

He sought to eliminate the remnants of [[feudalism]] persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the [[nobility]] to inhabit his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the [[Fronde]] rebellion during Louis' minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of [[absolute Monarchy|absolute monarchical rule]] in France that endured until the [[French Revolution]].\n\nLouis also enforced uniformity of religion under the [[Gallican Church|Gallican]] [[Catholic Church]]. His [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]] abolished the rights of the [[Huguenots|Huguenot]] [[Protestantism in France|Protestant minority]] and subjected them to a wave of [[dragonnades]], effectively forcing Huguenots to emigrate or convert, and virtually destroying the French Protestant community.\n\nThe Sun King surrounded himself with a variety of significant political, military, and cultural figures such as [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], the [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Grand Cond\u00e9]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]], [[Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle|Boulle]], [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]], [[Marin Marais|Marais]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]], [[Louis Le Vau|Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart|Mansart]], [[Charles Perrault|Charles]], [[Claude Perrault]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre|Le N\u00f4tre]].\n\nDuring Louis' long reign, France was the leading European power, and it fought three major wars: the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. There were also two lesser conflicts: the [[War of Devolution]] and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Warfare defined the foreign policy of Louis XIV, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled \"by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique\", Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.<ref name=\"James Nathan 1993\">{{cite journal|first=James|last=Nathan|title=Force, Order, and Diplomacy in the Age of Louis XIV|url=https://www.vqronline.org/essay/force-order-and-diplomacy-age-louis-xiv|journal=[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]|publisher=[[University of Virginia]]|location=Charlottesville, Virginia|\nvolume=69|issue=4|date=Autumn 1993|page=633}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Fransk barnprins, troligen Ludvig XIV eller XV fr\u00e5n 1600-talets f\u00f6rsta h\u00e4lft - Skoklosters slott - 95015.tif|thumb|Louis XIV as a young child, unknown painter]]\n[[File:Acte de naissance de Louis XIV 1738.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Baptismal certificate, 1638]]\n\nLouis XIV was born on 5 September 1638 in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], to [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Anne of Austria]].

His mother had experienced four [[stillbirth]]s between 1619 and 1631. Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God.\n\nSensing imminent death, Louis XIII decided to put his affairs in order in the spring of 1643, when Louis XIV was four years old. In defiance of custom, which would have made Queen Anne the sole [[Regent]] of France, the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son's behalf. His lack of faith in Queen Anne's political abilities was his primary rationale. He did, however, make the concession of appointing her head of the council.\n\nLouis' relationship with his mother was uncommonly affectionate for the time. Contemporaries and eyewitnesses claimed that the Queen would spend all her time with Louis. Both were greatly interested in food and theatre, and it is highly likely that Louis developed these interests through his close relationship with his mother. This long-lasting and loving relationship can be evidenced by excerpts in Louis' journal entries, such as:\n<blockquote>\"Nature was responsible for the first knots which tied me to my mother. But attachments formed later by shared qualities of the spirit are far more difficult to break than those formed merely by blood.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Antonia|last=Fraser|title=Love and Louis XIV: The Women in the Life of the Sun King|publisher=[[Random House, Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=2006|pages=14\u201316}}</ref></blockquote>\nIt was his mother who gave Louis his belief in the absolute and divine power of his monarchical rule.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=30\u201340}}</ref>\n\nDuring his childhood, he was taken care of by the governesses [[Fran\u00e7oise de Lansac]] and [[Marie-Catherine de Senecey]]. In 1646, [[Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy|Nicolas V de Villeroy]] became the young king's tutor. Louis XIV became friends with Villeroy's young children, particularly [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroy|Fran\u00e7ois de Villeroy]], and divided his time between the [[Palais-Royal]] and the nearby Hotel de Villeroy.\n\n==Minority and the ''Fronde''==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2017}}<!--many paragraphs with no citations-->\n\n===Accession===\n{{further|Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)}}\n[[File:Bb85790a33.jpg|thumb|right|Louis XIV in 1643, prior to becoming king, by [[Claude Deruet]]]]\nOn 14 May 1643, with Louis XIII dead, Queen Anne had her husband's will [[annul]]led by the ''[[Parlement|Parlement de Paris]]'' (a judicial body comprising mostly [[nobility|nobles]] and high clergymen).{{sfn|B\u00e9ly|2001|p=57}} This action abolished the regency council and made Anne sole Regent of France. Anne exiled some of her husband's ministers (Chavigny, Bouthilier), and she nominated Brienne as her minister of foreign affairs.{{sfn|Sonnino|1998|pp=217\u2013218}} Anne also nominated Saint [[Vincent de Paul]] as her spiritual adviser, which helped her deal with religious policy and the [[Jansenism]] question.{{sfn|McCoy|1942|pp=442\u2013449}}\n\nAnne kept the direction of religious policy strongly in her hand until 1661; her most important political decisions were to nominate Cardinal [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] as her chief minister and the continuation of her late husband's and [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s policy, despite their persecution of her, for the sake of her son. Anne wanted to give her son absolute authority and a victorious kingdom. Her rationales for choosing Mazarin were mainly his ability and his total dependence on her, at least until 1653 when she was no longer regent. Anne protected Mazarin by arresting and exiling her followers who conspired against him in 1643: the [[C\u00e9sar de Bourbon|Duke of Beaufort]] and [[Marie de Rohan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=34\u201337}}</ref> She left the direction of the daily administration of policy to Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nThe best example of Anne's statesmanship and the partial change in her heart towards her native Spain is seen in her keeping of one of Richelieu's men, the Chancellor of France [[Pierre S\u00e9guier]], in his post. S\u00e9guier was the person who had interrogated Anne in 1637, treating her like a \"common criminal\" as she described her treatment following the discovery that she was giving military secrets and information to Spain. Anne was virtually under house arrest for a number of years during her husband's rule. By keeping him in his post, Anne was giving a sign that the interests of France and her son Louis were the guiding spirit of all her political and legal actions. Though not necessarily opposed to Spain, she sought to end the war with a French victory, in order to establish a lasting peace between the Catholic nations.\n\nThe Queen also gave a partial Catholic orientation to French foreign policy. This was felt by the Netherlands, France's Protestant ally, which negotiated a separate peace with Spain in 1648.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=29\u201336}}</ref>\n\nIn 1648, Anne and Mazarin successfully negotiated the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Its terms ensured [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch independence]] from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], awarded some autonomy to the various German princes of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and granted Sweden seats on the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] and territories to control the mouths of the [[Oder River|Oder]], [[Elbe]], and [[Weser River|Weser]] rivers. France, however, profited most from the settlement. Austria, ruled by the [[Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburg]] Emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], ceded all Habsburg lands and claims in [[Alsace]] to France and acknowledged her ''de facto'' sovereignty over the [[Three Bishoprics]] of [[Metz]], [[Verdun]], and [[Toul]]. Moreover, eager to emancipate themselves from Habsburg domination, petty German states sought French protection. This anticipated the formation of the 1658 [[League of the Rhine]], leading to the further diminution of Imperial power.\n\n===Early acts===\nAs the Thirty Years' War came to an end, a civil war known as the ''{{lang|fr|[[Fronde]]}}'' (after the [[sling (weapon)|slings]] used to smash windows) erupted in France. It effectively checked France's ability to exploit the Peace of Westphalia. Anne and Mazarin had largely pursued the policies of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], augmenting the Crown's power at the expense of the nobility and the ''{{lang|fr|[[Parlement]]s}}''. Anne interfered much more in internal policy than foreign affairs; she was a very proud queen who insisted on the divine rights of the King of France.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|thumb|left|Europe after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648]]\n\nAll this led her to advocate a forceful policy in all matters relating to the King's authority, in a manner that was much more radical than the one proposed by Mazarin. The Cardinal depended totally on Anne's support and had to use all his influence on the Queen to avoid nullifying, but to restrain some of her radical actions. Anne imprisoned any aristocrat or member of parliament who challenged her will; her main aim was to transfer to her son an absolute authority in the matters of finance and justice. One of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris, whom she had jailed, died in prison.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=70\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe ''{{lang|fr|Frondeurs}}'', political heirs of the disaffected feudal aristocracy, sought to protect their traditional feudal privileges from the increasingly centralized royal government. Furthermore, they believed their traditional influence and authority was being usurped by the recently ennobled bureaucrats (the ''{{lang|fr|Noblesse de Robe}}'', or \"nobility of the robe\"), who administered the kingdom and on whom the monarchy increasingly began to rely. This belief intensified the nobles' resentment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1648, Anne and Mazarin attempted to tax members of the ''{{lang|fr|Parlement de Paris}}''. The members refused to comply and ordered all of the king's earlier financial edicts burned. Buoyed by the victory of {{lang|fr|[[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Louis, duc d\u2019Enghien]]}} (later known as ''{{lang|fr|le Grand Cond\u00e9}}'') at the [[Battle of Lens]], Mazarin, on Queen Anne's insistence, arrested certain members in a show of force.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=80\u201385}}</ref> The most important arrest, from Anne's point of view, concerned [[Pierre Broussel]], one of the most important leaders in the ''{{lang|fr|Parlement de Paris}}''.\n\n[[File:Louis XIV en Jupiter, vainqueur de la Fronde.jpg|thumb|1655 portrait of Louis, the Victor of the Fronde, portrayed as the god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]]]\n\nPeople in France were complaining about the expansion of royal authority, the high rate of taxation, and the reduction of the authority of the Parlement de Paris and other regional representative entities. Paris erupted in rioting as a result, and Anne was forced, under intense pressure, to free Broussel. Moreover, a mob of angry Parisians broke into the royal palace and demanded to see their king. Led into the royal bedchamber, they gazed upon Louis, who was feigning sleep, were appeased, and then quietly departed. The threat to the royal family prompted Anne to flee Paris with the king and his courtiers.\n\nShortly thereafter, the conclusion of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] allowed Cond\u00e9's army to return to aid Louis and his court. Cond\u00e9's family was close to Anne at that time, and he agreed to help her attempt to restore the king's authority.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=84\u201387}}</ref> The queen's army, headed by Cond\u00e9, attacked the rebels in Paris; the rebels were under the political control of Anne's old friend [[Marie de Rohan]]. Beaufort, who had escaped from the prison where Anne had incarcerated him five years before, was the military leader in Paris, under the nominal control of Conti. After a few battles, a political compromise was reached; the [[Peace of Rueil]] was signed, and the court returned to Paris.\n\nUnfortunately for Anne, her partial victory depended on Cond\u00e9, who wanted to control the queen and destroy Mazarin's influence. It was Cond\u00e9's sister who pushed him to turn against the queen. After striking a deal with her old friend Marie de Rohan, who was able to impose the nomination of {{lang|fr|[[Charles de l'Aubespine, marquis de Ch\u00e2teauneuf]]}} as minister of justice, Anne arrested Cond\u00e9, his brother [[Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]], and the husband of their sister Anne Genevieve de Bourbon, [[duchess of Longueville]]. This situation did not last long, and Mazarin's unpopularity led to the creation of a coalition headed mainly by Marie de Rohan and the duchess of Longueville. This aristocratic coalition was strong enough to liberate the princes, exile Mazarin, and impose a condition of virtual house arrest on Queen Anne.\n\nAll these events were witnessed by Louis and largely explained his later distrust of Paris and the higher aristocracy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=88\u201390,91\u201398}}</ref> \"In one sense, Louis' childhood came to an end with the outbreak of the Fronde. It was not only that life became insecure and unpleasant \u2013 a fate meted out to many children in all ages \u2013 but that Louis had to be taken into the confidence of his mother and Mazarin and political and military matters of which he could have no deep understanding\".{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=22}} \"The family home became at times a near-prison when Paris had to be abandoned, not in carefree outings to other chateaux but in humiliating flights\".{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=22}} The royal family was driven out of Paris twice in this manner, and at one point Louis XIV and Anne were held under virtual arrest in the royal palace in Paris. The Fronde years planted in Louis a hatred of Paris and a consequent determination to move out of the ancient capital as soon as possible, never to return.{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=31}}\n\nJust as the first ''{{lang|fr|Fronde}}'' (the ''{{lang|fr|Fronde parlementaire}}'' of 1648\u20131649) ended, a second one (the ''{{lang|fr|Fronde des princes}}'' of 1650\u20131653) began. Unlike that which preceded it, tales of sordid intrigue and half-hearted warfare characterized this second phase of upper-class insurrection. To the aristocracy, this rebellion represented a protest against and a reversal of their political demotion from [[vassal]]s to [[courtier]]s. It was headed by the highest-ranking French nobles, among them Louis' uncle [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] and first cousin [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier]], known as ''{{lang|fr|la Grande Mademoiselle}}''; [[prince du sang|Princes of the Blood]] such as Cond\u00e9, his brother [[Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]], and their sister the [[Anne Genevi\u00e8ve de Bourbon|Duchess of Longueville]]; dukes of [[bastardy|legitimised]] royal descent, such as [[Henri II d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Longueville|Henri, Duke of Longueville]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Beaufort]]; so-called \"[[prince \u00e9tranger|foreign princes]]\" such as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurice, Duke of Bouillon]], his brother [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], and [[Marie de Rohan]], Duchess of Chevreuse; and [[kinship|scions]] of France's oldest families, such as [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|Fran\u00e7ois de La Rochefoucauld]].\n\nQueen Anne played the most important role in defeating the Fronde because she wanted to transfer absolute authority to her son. In addition, most of the princes refused to deal with Mazarin, who went into exile for a number of years. The ''{{lang|fr|Frondeurs}}'' claimed to act on Louis' behalf, and in his real interest against his mother and Mazarin.\n\nQueen Anne had a very close relationship with the Cardinal, and many observers believed that Mazarin became Louis XIV's stepfather by a secret marriage to Queen Anne.{{sfn|Hatton|1972|p=18}} However, Louis' coming-of-age and subsequent [[coronation]] deprived them of the ''{{lang|fr|Frondeurs}}''{{'}} pretext for revolt. The ''{{lang|fr|Fronde}}'' thus gradually lost steam and ended in 1653, when Mazarin returned triumphantly from exile. From that time until his death, Mazarin was in charge of foreign and financial policy without the daily supervision of Anne, who was no longer regent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Louis fell in love with Mazarin's niece [[Marie Mancini]], but Anne and Mazarin ended the king's infatuation by sending Mancini away from court to be married in Italy. While Mazarin might have been tempted for a short period of time to marry his niece to the King of France, Queen Anne was absolutely against this; she wanted to marry her son to the daughter of her brother, [[Philip IV of Spain]], for both dynastic and political reasons. Mazarin soon supported the Queen's position because he knew that her support for his power and his foreign policy depended on making peace with Spain from a strong position and on the Spanish marriage. Additionally, Mazarin's relations with Marie Mancini were not good, and he did not trust her to support his position. All of Louis' tears and his supplications to his mother did not make her change her mind; the Spanish marriage was very important both for its role in ending the war between France and Spain, and because many of the claims and objectives of Louis' foreign policy in the next 50 years would be based on this marriage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bluche|1990|pp=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\n==Personal reign and reforms==\n===Coming of age and early reforms===\n[[File:Royal Monogram of King Louis XIV of France.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Royal Monogram]]\n\nLouis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on 7 September 1651. On the death of Mazarin, in March 1661, Louis assumed personal control of the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister: \"Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal. It is now time that I govern them myself. You [he was talking to the secretaries and ministers of state] will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them. I request and order you to seal no orders except by my command . . . I order you not to sign anything, not even a passport . . . without my command; to render account to me personally each day and to favor no one\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louis-xiv.de/index.php?id=30|title=Louis XIV - the Sun King: Absolutism|website=louis-xiv.de}}</ref> Louis was able to capitalize on the widespread public yearning for law and order, that resulted from prolonged foreign wars and domestic civil strife, to further consolidate central political authority and reform at the expense of the feudal aristocracy. Praising his ability to choose and encourage men of talent, the historian [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]] noted: \"it is the voice of genius of all kinds which sounds from the tomb of Louis\".<ref>[[Ian Dunlop (author)|Ian Dunlop]], \"''Louis XIV''\", (2001) p. xii</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|Louis XIV, King of France, in 1661]]\n\nLouis began his personal reign with administrative and fiscal reforms. In 1661, the treasury verged on bankruptcy. To rectify the situation, Louis chose [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] as [[Controller-General of Finances]] in 1665. However, Louis first had to neutralize [[Nicolas Fouquet]], the [[Superintendent of Finances]], in order to give Colbert a free hand. Although Fouquet's financial indiscretions were not very different from Mazarin's before him or Colbert's after him, his ambition was worrying to Louis. He had, for example, built an opulent ch\u00e2teau at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] where he entertained Louis and his court ostentatiously, as if he were wealthier than the king himself. The court was left with the impression that the vast sums of money needed to support his lifestyle could only have been obtained through [[embezzlement]] of government funds.\n\nFouquet appeared eager to succeed Mazarin and Richelieu in assuming power, and he indiscreetly purchased and privately fortified the remote island of [[Belle \u00cele]]. These acts sealed his doom. Fouquet was charged with embezzlement. The ''Parlement'' found him guilty and sentenced him to exile. However, Louis altered the sentence to life-imprisonment and abolished Fouquet's post.\n\nWith Fouquet dismissed, Colbert reduced the national debt through more efficient taxation. The principal taxes included the ''aides'' and ''douanes'' (both [[Customs (tax)|customs duties]]), the ''[[gabelle]]'' (a tax on salt), and the ''[[taille]]'' (a tax on land). The ''taille'' was reduced at first; financial officials were forced to keep regular accounts, auctioning certain taxes instead of selling them privately to a favored few, revising inventories and removing unauthorized exemptions (for example, in 1661 only 10 per cent from the royal domain reached the King). Reform proved difficult because the ''taille'' was levied by officers of the Crown who had purchased their post at a high price: punishment of abuses necessarily lowered the value of the post. Nevertheless, excellent results were achieved: the deficit of 1661 turned into a surplus in 1666. The interest on the debt was reduced from 52 million to 24 million livres. The ''taille'' was reduced to 42 million in 1661 and 35 million in 1665; finally the revenue from indirect taxation progressed from 26 million to 55 million. The revenues of the royal domain were raised from 80,000 livres in 1661 to 5.5 million livres in 1671. In 1661, the receipts were equivalent to 26 million British pounds, of which 10 million reached the treasury. The expenditure was around 18 million pounds, leaving a deficit of 8 million. In 1667, the net receipts had risen to 20 million [[pounds sterling]], while expenditure had fallen to 11 million, leaving a surplus of 9 million pounds.\n\n[[File:Description-de-l'entree-Du-Roy-et-de-la-Reyne-Paris MG 1114.tif|thumb|Engraving of Louis XIV]]\n\nTo support the reorganized and enlarged army, the panoply of Versailles, and the growing civil administration, the king needed a good deal of money. Finance had always been the weak spot in the French monarchy: methods of collecting taxes were costly and inefficient; direct taxes passed through the hands of many intermediate officials; and indirect taxes were collected by private concessionaries, called tax farmers, who made a substantial profit. Consequently, the state always received far less than what the taxpayers actually paid.\n\nThe main weakness arose from an old bargain between the French crown and nobility: the king might raise taxes without consent if only he refrained from taxing the nobles. Only the \"unprivileged\" classes paid direct taxes, and this term came to mean the peasants only, since many bourgeois, in one way or another, obtained exemptions.\n\nThe system was outrageously unjust in throwing a heavy tax burden on the poor and helpless. Later, after 1700, the French ministers who were supported by Louis' secret wife Madame De Maintenon, were able to convince the king to change his fiscal policy. Louis was willing enough to tax the nobles but was unwilling to fall under their control, and only towards the close of his reign, under extreme stress of war, was he able, for the first time in French history, to impose direct taxes on the aristocratic elements of the population. This was a step toward equality before the law and toward sound public finance, but so many concessions and exemptions were won by nobles and bourgeois that the reform lost much of its value.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petitfils|2002|pp=250\u2013253,254\u2013255,256\u2013260}}</ref>\n\nLouis and Colbert also had wide-ranging plans to bolster French commerce and trade. Colbert's [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] administration established new industries and encouraged manufacturers and inventors, such as the [[Lyon]] silk manufacturers and the [[Gobelins manufactory]], a producer of tapestries. He invited manufacturers and artisans from all over Europe to France, such as [[Murano]] glassmakers, Swedish ironworkers, and Dutch shipbuilders. In this way, he aimed to decrease foreign imports while increasing French exports, hence reducing the net outflow of precious metals from France.\n\nLouis instituted reforms in military administration through [[Michel le Tellier]] and the latter's son [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois]]. They helped to curb the independent spirit of the nobility, imposing order on them at court and in the army. Gone were the days when generals protracted war at the frontiers while bickering over precedence and ignoring orders from the capital and the larger politico-diplomatic picture. The old military aristocracy (the ''Noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e'', or \"nobility of the sword\") ceased to have a monopoly over senior military positions and rank. Louvois, in particular, pledged to modernize the army and re-organize it into a professional, disciplined, well-trained force. He was devoted to the soldiers' material well-being and morale, and even tried to direct campaigns.\n\n===Relations with the major colonies===\n[[File:Louis14-Family.jpg|thumb|Louis and his family portrayed as Roman gods in a 1670 painting by [[Jean Nocret]].

Pre-revolutionary France was a patchwork of legal systems, with as many legal customs as there were provinces, and two co-existing legal traditions\u2014[[Custom (law)|customary law]] in the north and [[Roman law|Roman civil law]] in the south.<ref>Merryman, John Henry. ''The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America'', 2007 Stanford University Press.</ref> The ''Grande Ordonnance de Proc\u00e9dure Civile'' of 1667, also known as the ''Code Louis'', was a comprehensive legal code attempting a uniform regulation of [[civil procedure]] throughout legally irregular France. Among other things, it prescribed baptismal, marriage and death records in the state's registers, not the church's, and it strictly regulated the right of the ''Parlements'' to remonstrate.<ref>Antoine, Michel, ''Louis XV'', Fayard, Paris, 1989, p. 33</ref> The ''Code Louis'' played an important part in French legal history as the basis for the [[Napoleonic code]], from which many modern legal codes are, in turn, derived.\n\nOne of Louis' more infamous decrees was the ''Grande Ordonnance sur les Colonies'' of 1685, also known as the ''[[Code Noir]]'' (\"black code\"). Although it sanctioned slavery, it attempted to humanise the practice by prohibiting the separation of families. Additionally, in the colonies, only Roman Catholics could own slaves, and these had to be baptised.\n\nLouis ruled through a number of councils:\n*Conseil d'en haut (\"High Council\", concerning the most important matters of state)\u2014composed of the king, the crown prince, the controller-general of finances, and the secretaries of state in charge of various departments.

In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's eldest daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], as one of the provisions of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]].{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}} The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}} Mazarin and [[Hugues de Lionne|Lionne]], however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 [[\u00e9cu]]s.<ref>Dunlop, p. 54.</ref> The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin [[Charles II of Spain]] to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later [[Philip V of Spain]]), the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa.\n\nThe War of Devolution did not focus on the payment of the dowry, rather, the lack of payment was what Louis XIV used as a pretext for nullifying Maria Theresa's renunciation of her claims, allowing the land to \"devolve\" to him. In [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] (the location of the land in dispute), children of first marriages traditionally were not disadvantaged by their parents' remarriages and still inherited property. Louis' wife was Philip IV's daughter by his first marriage, while the new King of Spain, Charles II, was his son by a subsequent marriage. Thus, Brabant allegedly \"devolved\" to Maria Theresa. This excuse allowed France to attack the [[Spanish Netherlands]].\n\n===Relations with the Dutch===\n[[File:Louis XIV crosses the Rhine at Lobith - Lodewijk XIV trekt bij het Tolhuis bij Lobith de Rijn over, 12 juni 1672 (Adam Frans van der Meulen).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Louis XIV crosses the [[Lower Rhine]] at Lobith on 12 June 1672; [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]]]\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]] with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], France supported the [[Dutch Republic]] as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power. [[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]] from 1653 to 1672, viewed them as crucial for Dutch security and against his domestic [[Prince of Orange|Orangist]] opponents. Louis provided support in the 1665-1667 [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] but used the opportunity to launch the [[War of Devolution]] in 1667. This captured [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]; French expansion in this area was a direct threat to Dutch economic interests.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nThe Dutch opened talks with [[Charles II of England]] on a common diplomatic front against France, leading to the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], between England, the Dutch and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]]. The threat of an escalation and a secret treaty to divide Spanish possessions with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]], the other major claimant to the throne of Spain, led Louis to relinquish many of his gains in the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]].{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}}\n\nLouis placed little reliance on his agreement with Leopold and as it was now clear French and Dutch aims were in direct conflict, he decided to first defeat the Republic, then seize the Spanish Netherlands. This required breaking up the Triple Alliance; he paid Sweden to remain neutral and signed the 1670 [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] with Charles, an Anglo-French alliance against the Dutch. In May 1672, France invaded the Republic, supported by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and the [[Electorate of Cologne]].{{sfn|Lynn|1999|pp=109-110}} \n[[File:Louis XIV, King of France, after Lefebvre - Les collections du ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Louis XIV, ca 1673]]\nRapid French advance led to a coup that toppled De Witt and brought William III to power. Leopold viewed French expansion into the Rhineland as an increasing threat, especially after their seizure of the strategic [[Duchy of Lorraine]] in 1670. The prospect of Dutch defeat led him to an alliance with [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] on 23 June, followed by another with the Republic on 25th.{{sfn|Mckay|1997|p=206}} Although Brandenburg was forced out of the war by the June 1673 [[Treaty of Vossem (1673)|Treaty of Vossem]], in August an anti-French alliance was formed by the Dutch, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], Emperor Leopold and the [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine|Duke of Lorraine]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=133}}\n\nThe French alliance was deeply unpopular in England, who made peace with the Dutch in the February 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]. However, French armies held significant advantages over their opponents; an undivided command, talented generals like [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] and vastly superior logistics. Reforms introduced by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], the [[Secretary of War]], helped maintain large field armies that could be mobilised much quicker, allowing them to mount offensives in early spring before their opponents were ready.{{sfn|Black|2011|pp=97-99}}\n\nThe French were forced to retreat from the Dutch Republic but these advantages allowed them to hold their ground in Alsace and the Spanish Netherlands, while retaking Franche-Comt\u00e9. By 1678, mutual exhaustion led to the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], which was generally settled in France's favour and allowed Louis to intervene in the [[Scanian War]]. Despite military defeat, his ally Sweden regained much of their losses under the 1679 treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679)|Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1679)|Fontainebleau]] and [[Peace of Lund|Lund]] imposed on [[Denmark-Norway]] and Brandenburg.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=213}}\n\nLouis was at the height of his power, but at the cost of uniting his opponents; this increased as he continued his expansion. In 1679, he dismissed his foreign minister [[Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne]], because he was seen as having compromised too much with the allies. Louis maintained the strength of his army, but in his next series of territorial claims avoided using military force alone. Rather, he combined it with legal pretexts in his efforts to augment the boundaries of his kingdom. Contemporary treaties were intentionally phrased ambiguously. Louis established the [[Chambers of Reunion]] to determine the full extent of his rights and obligations under those treaties.\n\n{{Coin image box 1 double\n|header        = Silver coin of Louis XIV, dated 1674\n|image         = File:Louis XIV Coin.jpg\n|caption_left  = Obverse.

Louis also sought [[Strasbourg]]<!-- Please do not uncomment unless consensus has been reached! ({{lang-de|Strassburg|links=no}})-->, an important strategic crossing on the left bank of the Rhine and theretofore a Free Imperial City of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], annexing it and other territories in 1681. Although a part of Alsace, Strasbourg was not part of Habsburg-ruled Alsace and was thus not ceded to France in the Peace of Westphalia.\n\nFollowing these annexations, Spain declared war, precipitating the [[War of the Reunions]]. However, the Spanish were rapidly defeated because the Emperor (distracted by the [[Great Turkish War]]) abandoned them, and the Dutch only supported them minimally. By the [[Truce of Ratisbon]], in 1684, Spain was forced to acquiesce in the French occupation of most of the conquered territories, for 20 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=161\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\nLouis' policy of the ''R\u00e9unions'' may have raised France to its greatest size and power during his reign, but it alienated much of Europe. This poor public opinion was compounded by French actions off the Barbary Coast and at Genoa. First, Louis had [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]], two Barbary pirate strongholds, bombarded to obtain a favourable treaty and the liberation of Christian slaves. Next, in 1684, a [[bombardment of Genoa|punitive mission]] was launched against [[Genoa]] in retaliation for its support for Spain in previous wars. Although the Genoese submitted, and the [[Doge of Genoa|Doge]] led an official mission of apology to Versailles, France gained a reputation for brutality and arrogance. European apprehension at growing French might and the realisation of the extent of the [[dragonnades]]' effect (discussed below) led many states to abandon their alliance with France.<ref name=\"Meriman, John 1996 319\">{{cite book|title=A History of Modern Europe|author=Meriman, John|year=1996|page=319|publisher=W.W.

This, in turn, was succeeded by another Siamese embassy under [[Kosa Pan]], superbly received at Versailles in 1686. Louis then sent another embassy in 1687, under [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]], and French influence grew at the Siamese court, which granted [[Mergui]] as a naval base to France.

Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.\n\nLouis initially supported traditional [[Gallicanism]], which limited [[Pope|papal]] authority in France, and convened an [[Assembly of the French clergy]] in November 1681. Before its dissolution eight months later, the Assembly had accepted the [[Declaration of the Clergy of France]], which increased royal authority at the expense of papal power. Without royal approval, bishops could not leave France, and appeals could not be made to the Pope. Additionally, government officials could not be excommunicated for acts committed in pursuance of their duties. Although the king could not make ecclesiastical law, all papal regulations without royal assent were invalid in France. Unsurprisingly, the pope repudiated the Declaration.<ref name=CatEn/>\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|Louis receiving the [[Doge of Genoa]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on 15 May 1685, following the [[Bombardment of Genoa]]. (''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes. 15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]], Versailles.)]]\n\nBy attaching nobles to his court at Versailles, Louis achieved increased control over the French aristocracy. Apartments were built to house those willing to pay court to the king.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sources of Making of the West, People and Cultures, Vol. 2, Since 1340</ref> However, the pensions and privileges necessary to live in a style appropriate to their rank were only possible by waiting constantly on Louis.<ref name=fordham/> For this purpose, an elaborate court ritual was created wherein the king became the centre of attention and was observed throughout the day by the public. With his excellent memory, Louis could then see who attended him at court and who was absent, facilitating the subsequent distribution of favours and positions. Another tool Louis used to control his nobility was censorship, which often involved the opening of letters to discern their author's opinion of the government and king.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Moreover, by entertaining, impressing, and domesticating them with extravagant luxury and other distractions, Louis not only cultivated public opinion of him, he also ensured the aristocracy remained under his scrutiny.\n\nLouis' extravagance at Versailles extended far beyond the scope of elaborate court rituals. In an excerpt from [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]],'' [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] recounts a story in which Louis took delivery of an [[African elephant]] as a gift. {{quote|In 1668 the king of [[Portugal]] sent an elephant from the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] to the king of France. It was seventeen years old and measured six and a half feet from the ground to the top of its back. The elephant lived in the [[Subsidiary structures of the Palace of Versailles|menagerie at Versailles]] for thirteen years and only grew a further foot, no doubt because the change in climate and food had stunted its growth; so it measured just seven and a half feet when the gentlemen of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences]] carried out their description of it.<ref>{{cite journal |authors= Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton  |title=Elephant |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.944/--elephant?rgn=main;view=fulltext |date=1 April 2015 | journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project |accessdate=1 April 2015 }}</ref>}} This, along with the prohibition of private armies, prevented them from passing time on their own estates and in their regional power bases, from which they historically waged local wars and plotted resistance to royal authority.{{efn|Coincidentally, at roughly the same time and for the same reasons, Japan adopted a similar policy, called [[sankin k\u014dtai]].}} Louis thus compelled and seduced the old military aristocracy (the \"nobility of the sword\") into becoming his ceremonial courtiers, further weakening their power. In their place, Louis raised commoners or the more recently ennobled bureaucratic aristocracy (the \"nobility of the robe\"). He judged that royal authority thrived more surely by filling high executive and administrative positions with these men because they could be more easily dismissed than nobles of ancient lineage, with entrenched influence. It is believed that Louis' policies were rooted in his experiences during the ''Fronde'', when men of high birth readily took up the rebel cause against their king, who was actually the kinsman of some. This victory of Louis' over the nobility may have then in fact ensured the end of major civil wars in France until the French Revolution about a century later.\n\n===France as the pivot of warfare===\n[[File:De-La-Torre-Jean-Du-Mont--M\u00e9moires MG 0958.tif|thumb|Louis XIV]]\n\nIn 1648 France was the leading European power, and most of the wars pivoted around its aggressiveness.  Only poverty-stricken Russia exceeded it in population, and no one could match its wealth, central location, and very strong professional army. It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years' War.  Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard-pressed to pay for all the military adventures, and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it.\n\nDuring the very long reign of King Louis XIV (1643 \u2013 1715), France fought three major wars: the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. There were also two lesser conflicts: the [[War of Devolution]] and the [[War of the Reunions]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p={{page needed|date=July 2017}} }}</ref> The wars were very expensive but they defined Louis XIV's foreign policies, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled \"by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique,\" Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.<ref name=\"James Nathan 1993\"/> By 1695, France retained much of its dominance, but had lost control of the seas to the combination of England and Holland.  What's more, most countries, both Protestant and Catholic, were in alliance against it. [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]], France's leading military strategist, warned the king in 1689 that a hostile \"Alliance\" was too powerful at sea. He recommended the best way for France to fight back was to license French merchants ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships, while avoiding its navies:\n:France has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces; Spain with all its dependencies in Europe, Asia, Africa and America; the Duke of Savoy [in Italy], England, Scotland, Ireland, and all their colonies in the East and West Indies; and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments.  France has ... undeclared enemies, indirectly hostile, hostile, and envious of its greatness, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Venice, Genoa, and part of the Swiss Confederation, all of which states secretly aid France's enemies by the troops that they hire to them, the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade.<ref>Quoted in Geoffrey Simcox, ed., ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism, 1618\u20131763'' (1974), pp. 236-37.</ref>\n\nVauban was pessimistic about France's so-called friends and allies: \n:For lukewarm, useless, or impotent friends, France has the Pope, who is indifferent; the King of England [James II] expelled from his country; the grand Duke of Tuscany; the Dukes of Mantua, Modena, and Parma [all in Italy]; and the other faction of the Swiss.  Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace, the others are cool in their affections....The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance; they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers, and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to... Allies....  We must therefore fall back on privateering as the method of conducting war which is most feasible, simple, cheap, and safe, and which will cost least to the state, the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King, who risks virtually nothing....It will enrich the country, train many good officers for the King, and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace.<ref>Quoted in Simcox, pp. 237, 242.</ref>\n\n==Revocation of the Edict of Nantes==\n{{main| Revocation of the Edict of Nantes}}\n[[File:S21c.jpg|thumb|left|Louis XIV in 1685, the year he revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]]]]\n\nIt has traditionally been suggested that the devout Madame de Maintenon pushed Louis to persecute Protestants and revoke the 1598 [[Edict of Nantes]], which awarded Huguenots political and religious freedom, but her influence in the matter is now being questioned.<ref>For example, see [[Veronica Buckley|Buckley, Veronica]]. ''Madame de Maintenon: The Secret Wife of Louis XIV''. London: Bloomsbury, 2008</ref> Louis saw the persistence of Protestantism as a disgraceful reminder of royal powerlessness. After all, the Edict was the pragmatic concession of his grandfather [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] to end the longstanding [[French Wars of Religion]]. An additional factor in Louis' thinking was the prevailing contemporary European principle to assure socio-political stability, ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (\"whose realm, his religion\"), the idea that the religion of the ruler should be the religion of the realm (as originally confirmed in central Europe in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555).<ref>Sturdy, David J. \"''Louis XIV''\", St Martin's Press, New York (1998), p. 89\u201399.</ref>\n\nResponding to petitions, Louis initially excluded Protestants from office, constrained the meeting of [[synods]], closed churches outside of Edict-stipulated areas, banned Protestant outdoor preachers, and prohibited domestic Protestant migration. He also disallowed Protestant-Catholic intermarriages to which third parties objected, encouraged missions to the Protestants, and rewarded converts to Catholicism.<ref>Sturdy, p. 92\u201393.</ref> This discrimination did not encounter much Protestant resistance, and a steady conversion of Protestants occurred, especially among the noble elites.\n\nIn 1681, Louis dramatically increased his persecution of Protestants. The principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio'' generally had also meant that subjects who refused to convert could emigrate, but Louis banned emigration and effectively insisted that all Protestants must be converted. Secondly, following the proposal of Ren\u00e9 de Marillac and the Marquis of Louvois, he began quartering [[dragoon]]s in Protestant homes. Although this was within his legal rights, the ''dragonnades'' inflicted severe financial strain on Protestants and atrocious abuse. Between 300,000 and 400,000 Huguenots converted, as this entailed financial rewards and exemption from the ''[[dragonnades]]''.<ref>Sturdy, p. 96, citing Pillorget, \"''France Baroque, France Classique''\", i, 935.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dragonnades430.jpg|thumb|[[Camisard|Protestant peasants]] rebelled against the officially sanctioned ''[[dragonnades]]'' (conversions enforced by [[dragoon]]s, labeled \"missionaries in boots\") that followed the Edict of Fontainebleau.]]\n\nOn 15 October 1685, Louis issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which cited the redundancy of privileges for Protestants given their scarcity after the extensive conversions. The Edict of Fontainebleau revoked the Edict of Nantes and repealed all the privileges that arose therefrom.<ref name=CatEn/> By his edict, Louis no longer tolerated the existence of Protestant groups, pastors, or churches in France. No further churches were to be constructed, and those already existing were to be demolished. Pastors could choose either exile or a secular life. Those Protestants who had resisted conversion were now to be [[forced conversion|baptised forcibly]] into the established church.<ref>Cathal J. Nolan, ''Wars of the age of Louis XIV, 1650\u20131715'' (2008) p. 132</ref>\n\nWriters have debated Louis' reasons for issuing the Edict of Fontainebleau. He may have been seeking to placate [[Pope Innocent XI]], with whom relations were tense and whose aid was necessary to determine the outcome of a succession crisis in the [[Electorate of Cologne]]. He may also have acted to upstage Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] and regain international prestige after the latter defeated the Turks without Louis' help. Otherwise, he may simply have desired to end the remaining divisions in French society dating to the Wars of Religion by fulfilling his coronation oath to eradicate heresy.<ref>Sturdy, p. 96-97.</ref><ref>Bluche, p. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nMany historians have condemned the Edict of Fontainebleau as gravely harmful to France.<ref name=bartleby>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/lo/Louis14Fr.html|title=Louis XIV, king of France|author=Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2007|accessdate=19 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107232540/http://www.bartleby.com/65/lo/Louis14Fr.html|archivedate=7 January 2008}}</ref> In support, they cite the emigration of about 200,000 highly skilled Huguenots (roughly one-fourth of the Protestant population, or 1% of the French population) who defied royal decrees and fled France for various Protestant states, weakening the French economy and enriching that of Protestant states.\n\nOn the other hand, there are historians who view this as an exaggeration. They argue that most of France's preeminent Protestant businessmen and industrialists converted to Catholicism and remained.<ref>David J. Sturdy, p. 98, citing W.C. Scoville, ''The Persecution of Huguenots and French Economic Development, 1680\u20131720'' (1960)</ref>\n\nWhat is certain is that reaction to the Edict was mixed. Even while French Catholic leaders exulted, Pope Innocent XI still argued with Louis over Gallicanism and criticised the use of violence. Protestants across Europe were horrified at the treatment of their co-religionists, but most Catholics in France applauded the move. Nonetheless, it is indisputable that Louis' public image in most of Europe, especially in Protestant regions, was dealt a severe blow.\n\nIn the end, however, despite renewed tensions with the [[Camisard]]s of south-central France at the end of his reign, Louis may have helped ensure that his successor would experience fewer instances of the religion-based disturbances that had plagued his forebears. French society would sufficiently change by the time of his descendant, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], to welcome tolerance in the form of the 1787 [[Edict of Versailles]], also known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]]. This restored to non-Catholics their civil rights and the freedom to worship openly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html|title=casinosdigital.de|website=booking-help.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html|archivedate=14 July 2012}}</ref> With the advent of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, Protestants were granted equal rights with their Roman Catholic counterparts.\n\n==League of Augsburg==\n{{Main|War of the Grand Alliance}}\n\n===Causes and conduct of the war===\n[[File:Batalla de Fleurus (1690).jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]], 1690]]\n[[File:Nocret, attributed to - Louis XIV of France - Versailles, MV2066.jpg|thumb|Louis in 1690]]\n\nThe [[War of the League of Augsburg]], which lasted from 1688 to 1697, initiated a period of decline in Louis' political and diplomatic fortunes. The conflict arose from two events in the [[Rhineland]]. First, in 1685, the [[Elector Palatine]] [[Charles II, Elector Palatine|Charles II]] died. All that remained of his immediate family was Louis' sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Elizabeth Charlotte]]. German law ostensibly barred her from succeeding to her brother's lands and electoral dignity, but it was unclear enough for arguments in favour of Elizabeth Charlotte to have a chance of success. Conversely, the princess was clearly entitled to a division of the family's personal property. Louis pressed her claims to land and chattels, hoping the latter, at least, would be given to her.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel. \"The Story of Civilisation (Volume 8): The Age of Louis XIV\", Simon & Schuster, Boston (1963), p. 691.</ref> Then, in 1688, [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], an ally of France, died. The archbishopric had traditionally been held by the [[Wittelsbach]]s of [[Bavaria]]. However, the Bavarian claimant to replace Maximilian Henry, Prince [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria]], was at that time not more than 17 years old and not even ordained. Louis sought instead to install his own candidate, [[William Egon of F\u00fcrstenberg]], to ensure the key Rhenish state remained an ally.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=192}}.</ref>\n\nIn light of his foreign and domestic policies during the early 1680s, which were perceived as aggressive, Louis' actions, fostered by the succession crises of the late 1680s, created concern and alarm in much of Europe. This led to the formation of the 1686 [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] by the Holy Roman Emperor, Spain, Sweden, [[Saxony]], and Bavaria. Their stated intention was to return France to at least the borders agreed to in the Treaty of Nijmegen.<ref>Dunlop, Ian. \"Louis XIV\", p. 313, Pimlico London 2001.</ref> Emperor Leopold I's persistent refusal to convert the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent treaty fed Louis' fears that the Emperor would turn on France and attack the Reunions after settling his affairs in the Balkans.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=189\u2013191}}.</ref>\n\nAnother event that Louis found threatening was the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, in England. Although King [[James II of England|James II]] was Catholic, his two [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] daughters, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], ensured the English people a Protestant succession. However, when James II's son [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]] was born, he took precedence in the succession over his elder sisters. This seemed to herald an era of Catholic monarchs in England. Protestant lords called on the Dutch Prince [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], grandson of [[Charles I of England]], to come to their aid. He sailed for England with troops despite Louis' warning that France would regard it as a provocation. Witnessing numerous desertions and defections, even among those closest to him, James II fled England. Parliament declared the throne vacant, and offered it to James's daughter Mary II and his son-in-law and nephew William. Vehemently anti-French, William (now William III of England) pushed his new kingdoms into war, thus transforming the League of Augsburg into the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]]. Before this happened, Louis expected William's expedition to England to absorb his energies and those of his allies, so he dispatched troops to the Rhineland after the expiry of his ultimatum to the German princes requiring confirmation of the Truce of Ratisbon and acceptance of his demands about the succession crises. This military manoeuvre was also intended to protect his eastern provinces from Imperial invasion by depriving the enemy army of sustenance, thus explaining the pre-emptive [[scorched earth]] policy pursued in much of southwestern Germany (the \"Devastation of the Palatinate\").<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=192\u2013193}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Equestrian portrait louis xiv 1692.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Louis XIV at the [[Siege of Namur (1692)]]]]\n\nFrench armies were generally victorious throughout the war because of Imperial commitments in the Balkans, French logistical superiority, and the quality of French generals such as Cond\u00e9's famous pupil, [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg]]. His triumphs at the Battles of [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Fleurus]] in 1690, [[Battle of Steenkerque|Steenkerque]] in 1692, and [[Battle of Landen|Landen]] in 1693 preserved northern France from invasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p={{page needed|date=July 2017}} }}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Marshal luxembourg.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal de Luxembourg]]\n\nAlthough an attempt to restore James II failed at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, France accumulated a string of victories from Flanders in the north, Germany in the east, and Italy and Spain in the south, to the high seas and the colonies. Louis personally supervised the captures of [[Siege of Mons (1691)|Mons]] in 1691 and [[Siege of Namur (1692)|Namur]] in 1692. Luxembourg gave France the defensive line of the [[Sambre]] by capturing [[Charleroi]] in 1693. France also overran most of the [[Duchy of Savoy]] after the battles of [[Battle of Marsaglia|Marsaglia]] and [[Battle of Staffarda|Staffarde]] in 1693. While naval stalemate ensued after the French victory at the [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]] in 1690 and the Allied victory at [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hougue|Barfleur-La Hougue]] in 1692, the [[Battle of Torroella]] in 1694 exposed [[Catalonia]] to French invasion, culminating in the capture of [[Barcelona]]. Although the Dutch captured [[Pondicherry district|Pondich\u00e9ry]] in 1693, a French raid on the Spanish treasure [[port of Cartagena]], Spain in 1697 yielded a fortune of 10,000,000 livres.\n\nIn July 1695, the city of [[Namur (city)|Namur]], occupied for three years by the French, [[Siege of Namur (1695)|was besieged]] by an allied army led by William III. Louis XIV ordered the surprise destruction of a Flemish city to divert the attention of these troops. This led to the [[bombardment of Brussels]], in which 4-5000 buildings were destroyed, including the entire city-center. The strategy failed, as Namur fell three weeks later, but harmed Louis XIV's reputation: a century later, [[Napoleon]] deemed the bombardment \"as barbarous as it was useless.\"<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Cited in ''Cahiers bruxellois'', t. III, fasc. II, 1958, by C. Terlinden. Lit.: ''aussi barbare qu\u2019inutile''</ref>\n\nPeace was broached by Sweden in 1690. By 1692, both sides evidently wanted peace, and secret bilateral talks began, but to no avail.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=232}}.</ref> Louis tried to break up the alliance against him by dealing with individual opponents, but this did not achieve its aim until 1696, when the [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoyards]] agreed to the Treaty of Turin and switched sides. Thereafter, members of the League of Augsburg rushed to the peace table, and negotiations for a general peace began in earnest, culminating in the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=253}}.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Ryswick===\n{{Main|Treaty of Ryswick}}\nThe [[Treaty of Ryswick]] ended the War of the League of Augsburg and disbanded the Grand Alliance. By manipulating their rivalries and suspicions, Louis divided his enemies and broke their power.\n\nThe treaty yielded many benefits for France. Louis secured permanent French sovereignty over all of Alsace, including Strasbourg, and established the Rhine as the Franco-German border (which persists to this day). Pondich\u00e9ry and [[Acadia]] were returned to France, and Louis' ''de facto'' possession of [[Saint-Domingue]] was recognised as lawful. However, he returned [[Catalonia]] and most of the Reunions.\n\nFrench military superiority might have allowed him to press for more advantageous terms. Thus, his generosity to Spain with regard to Catalonia has been read as a concession to foster pro-French sentiment and may ultimately have induced King [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] to name Louis' grandson [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duke of Anjou]], as heir to the throne of Spain.<ref>Bluche, p. 653.</ref> In exchange for financial compensation, France renounced its interests in the Electorate of Cologne and the Palatinate. [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], which had been occupied by the French since 1670, was returned to its rightful Duke [[Leopold, Duke of Lorraine|Leopold]], albeit with a right of way to the French military. William and Mary were recognised as joint sovereigns of the British Isles, and Louis withdrew support for James II. The Dutch were given the right to garrison forts in the Spanish Netherlands that acted as a protective barrier against possible French aggression. Though in some respects, the Treaty of Ryswick may appear a diplomatic defeat for Louis since he failed to place client rulers in control of the Palatinate or the Electorate of Cologne, he did in fact fulfill many of the aims laid down in his 1688 ultimatum.<ref>Lossky, Andrew. \"''Louis XIV and the French Monarchy''\", New Brunswick, New Jersey (1994), p. 255</ref> In any case, peace in 1697 was desirable to Louis, since France was exhausted from the costs of the war.\n\n==War of the Spanish Succession==\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n\n===Causes and build-up to the war===\n[[File:Hyacinthe Rigaud - Philippe V, roi d'Espagne (1683-1746) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip V of Spain]]]]\nBy the time of the Treaty of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years. King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Milan]], the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]]. He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\nThe principal claimants to the throne of Spain belonged to the ruling families of France and Austria. The French claim derived from Louis XIV's mother Anne of Austria (the older sister of [[Philip IV of Spain]]) and his wife Maria Theresa (Philip IV's eldest daughter). Based on the laws of [[primogeniture]], France had the better claim as it originated from the eldest daughters in two generations. However, their renunciation of succession rights complicated matters. In the case of Maria Theresa, nonetheless, the renunciation was considered null and void owing to Spain's breach of her marriage contract with Louis. In contrast, no renunciations tainted the claims of the Emperor Leopold I's son [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles, Archduke of Austria]], who was a grandson of Philip III's youngest daughter [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]]. The English and Dutch feared that a French or Austrian-born Spanish king would threaten the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] and thus preferred the Bavarian Prince [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria (1692-1699)|Joseph Ferdinand]], a grandson of Leopold I through his first wife [[Margaret Theresa of Spain]] (the younger daughter of Philip IV).\n\nIn an attempt to avoid war, Louis signed the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|Treaty of the Hague]] with William III of England in 1698. This agreement divided Spain's Italian territories between Louis's son ''le Grand Dauphin'' and the Archduke Charles, with the rest of the empire awarded to Joseph Ferdinand. William III consented to permitting the Dauphin's new territories to become part of France when the latter succeeded to his father's throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=267}}.</ref> The signatories, however, omitted to consult the ruler of these lands, and Charles II was passionately opposed to the dismemberment of his empire. In 1699, he re-confirmed his 1693 will that named Joseph Ferdinand as his sole successor.<ref name=\"Dunlop, Ian p. 353\">Dunlop, Ian. \"''Louis XIV''\", p. 353, Pimlico, London 2001.</ref>\n\nSix months later, Joseph Ferdinand died. Therefore, in 1700, Louis and William III concluded a fresh partitioning agreement, the [[Treaty of London (1700)|Treaty of London]]. This allocated Spain, the Low Countries, and the Spanish colonies to the Archduke. The Dauphin would receive all of Spain's Italian territories.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=268}} Charles II acknowledged that his empire could only remain undivided by bequeathing it entirely to a Frenchman or an Austrian. Under pressure from his German wife, [[Maria Anna of Neuburg]], Charles II named the Archduke Charles as his sole heir.\n\n===Acceptance of the will of Charles II and consequences===\n[[File:Louis le Grand; Rigaud Hyacinthe.jpg|thumb|Louis in 1701]]\nOn his deathbed in 1700, Charles II unexpectedly changed his will. The clear demonstration of French military superiority for many decades before this time, the pro-French faction at the court of Spain, and even [[Pope Innocent XII]] convinced him that France was more likely to preserve his empire intact. He thus offered the entire empire to the Dauphin's second son Philip, Duke of Anjou, provided it remained undivided. Anjou was not in the direct line of French succession, thus his accession would not cause a Franco-Spanish union.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=268}} If Anjou refused, the throne would be offered to his younger brother [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]]. If the Duke of Berry declined it, it would go to the Archduke Charles, then to the distantly related [[House of Savoy]] if Charles declined it.<ref>Kamen, Henry. (2001) ''Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice'', Yale University Press, p. 6. {{ISBN|0-300-08718-7}}.</ref>\n\nLouis was confronted with a difficult choice. He might agree to a partition of the Spanish possessions and avoid a general war, or accept Charles II's will and alienate much of Europe. Initially, Louis may have been inclined to abide by the partition treaties. However, the Dauphin's insistence persuaded Louis otherwise.<ref>Dunlop, p. 358.</ref> Moreover, Louis's foreign minister, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert, marquis de Torcy]], pointed out that war with the Emperor would almost certainly ensue whether Louis accepted the partition treaties or Charles II's will. He emphasised that, should it come to war, William III was unlikely to stand by France since he \"made a treaty to avoid war and did not intend to go to war to implement the treaty\".<ref name=\"Dunlop, Ian p. 353\"/> Indeed, in the event of a war, it might be preferable to be already in control of the disputed lands. Eventually, therefore, Louis decided to accept Charles II's will. Philip, Duke of Anjou, thus became Philip V, King of Spain.\n\nMost European rulers accepted Philip as king, though some only reluctantly. Depending on one's views of the war as inevitable or not, Louis acted reasonably or arrogantly.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=269, see footnote 1}}.</ref> He confirmed that Philip V retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position. Admittedly, he may only have been hypothesising a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco-Spanish union. But his actions were certainly not read as being disinterested. Moreover, Louis sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands to evict Dutch garrisons and secure Dutch recognition of Philip V. In 1701, Philip transferred the ''[[asiento]]'' (the right to supply slaves to Spanish colonies) to France, alienating English traders. As tensions mounted, Louis decided to acknowledge [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the son of James II, as king of England on the latter's death, infuriating William III. These actions enraged Britain and the Dutch Republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=269\u2013270}}.</ref> With the Holy Roman Emperor and the petty German states, they formed another Grand Alliance and declared war on France in 1702.

When finally declared, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] would last almost until Louis's death, at great cost to him and the kingdom of France.\n\nThe war began with French successes, however the joint talents of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough]], and [[Eugene of Savoy]] checked these victories and broke the myth of French invincibility. The duo allowed the Palatinate and Austria to occupy Bavaria after their victory at the [[Battle of Blenheim]]. [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]], had to flee to the Spanish Netherlands. The impact of this victory won the support of Portugal and Savoy. Later, the [[Battle of Ramillies]] delivered the Low Countries up to the Allies, and the [[Battle of Turin]] forced Louis to evacuate Italy, leaving it open to Allied forces. Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy met again at the [[Battle of Oudenarde]], which enabled them to mount an invasion of France.\n\nFrance established contact with [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] and promised support if he took up the cause of [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence|Hungarian independence]].\n\nDefeats, famine, and mounting debt greatly weakened France. Between 1693 and 1710, over two million people died in two [[famine]]s, made worse as foraging armies seized food supplies from the villages.<ref>{{cite journal|last=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|first=Cormac|author2=Chevet, Jean-Michel |year=2002|title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient R\u00e9gime'' France|journal=The Journal of Economic History|pmid=17494233|volume=62|issue=3|pages=706\u2013733|doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055|url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/368/3/ogradac_article_pub_039.pdf|hdl=10197/368}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Cambridge Journals Online - The Journal of Economic History - Abstract - ''FAMINE AND MARKET IN'' ANCIEN R\u00c9GIME ''FRANCE''|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=62|issue=3|doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055|year=2002|last1=\u00f3 Gr\u00e1da|first1=Cormac|last2=Chevet|first2=Jean-Michel|hdl=10197/368|url=https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/368/3/ogradac_article_pub_039.pdf|pmid=17494233|pages=706\u201333}}</ref> In his desperation, Louis XIV even ordered a disastrous invasion of the English island of [[Guernsey]] in the autumn of 1704 with the aim of raiding their successful harvest. By the winter of 1708\u20131709, Louis was willing to accept peace at nearly any cost. He agreed that the entire Spanish empire should be surrendered to the Archduke Charles, and he also consented to return to the frontiers of the Peace of Westphalia, giving up all the territories he had acquired over sixty years of his reign. He could not speak for his grandson, however, and could not promise that Philip V would accept these terms. Thus, the Allies demanded that Louis single-handedly attack his own grandson to force these terms on him. If he could not achieve this within the year, the war would resume. Louis could not accept these terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=326}}.</ref>\n\n===Turning point===\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = France 1709-A One Louis d'Or.jpg |bSize = 445|cWidth = 220|cHeight = 220|oTop = 3|oLeft = 3|Location = right|Description=Louis XIV depicted on a [[Louis d'or]] in 1709}}\n\nThe final phases of the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated that the Allies could not maintain the Archduke Charles in Spain just as surely as France could not retain the entire Spanish inheritance for King Philip V. The Allies were definitively expelled from central Spain by the Franco-Spanish victories at the Battles of [[Battle of Villaviciosa|Villaviciosa]] and [[Battle of Brihuega|Brihuega]] in 1710. French forces elsewhere remained obdurate despite their defeats. The Allies suffered a [[Pyrrhic victory]] at the [[Battle of Malplaquet]] with 21,000 casualties, twice that of the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=334}}.</ref> Eventually, France recovered its military pride with the decisive victory at [[Battle of Denain|Denain]] in 1712.\n\nFrench military successes near the end of the war took place against the background of a changed political situation in Austria. In 1705, the Emperor Leopold I died. His elder son and successor, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], followed him in 1711. His heir was none other than the Archduke Charles, who secured control of all of his brother's Austrian land holdings. If the Spanish empire then fell to him, it would have resurrected a domain as vast as that of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in the sixteenth century. To the maritime powers of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, this would have been as undesirable as a Franco-Spanish union.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|p=342}}.</ref>\n\n===Conclusion of peace===\n[[File:Philippe Buache Carte de France divisee suivant les quatre departements de Messieurs les secretaires dEtat 07710637.jpg|thumb|Map of France after the death of Louis XIV]]\nAs a result of the fresh British perspective on the European balance of power, Anglo-French talks began that culminated in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] between Louis, [[Philip V of Spain]], [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], and the [[Dutch Republic]]. In 1714, after losing [[Landau]] and [[Freiburg]], the Holy Roman Emperor also made peace with France in the Treaties of [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] and [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Baden]].\n\nIn the general settlement, Philip V retained Spain and its colonies, whereas Austria received the Spanish Netherlands and divided [[Kingdom of Sicily under Savoy|Spanish Italy]] with [[Savoy]]. Britain kept [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]]. Louis agreed to withdraw his support for James Stuart, son of James II and pretender to the throne of Great Britain, and ceded [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Rupert's Land]], and [[Acadia]] in the Americas to Anne. Britain gained most from the Treaty of Utrecht, but the final terms were much more favourable to France than those which were being discussed in peace negotiations in 1709 and 1710.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} France retained [[Prince Edward Island|\u00cele-Saint-Jean]] and [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], and Louis did acquire a few minor European territories, such as the [[Orange, Vaucluse|Principality of Orange]] and the [[Ubaye Valley]], which covered transalpine passes into Italy. Thanks to Louis, his allies the Electors of Bavaria and Cologne were restored to their pre-war status and returned their lands.<ref>{{harvnb|Lynn|1999|pp=356\u2013360}}.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages and children===\n[[File:Dual Cypher of King Louis XIV & Queen Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France.svg|thumb|right|Dual Cypher of King Louis XIV & [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Queen Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]]]]\nLouis and his wife [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660. However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, ''[[le Grand Dauphin]]'', known as ''Monseigneur''. Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.\n\nDespite evidence of affection early on in their marriage, Louis was never faithful to Maria Theresa. He took a series of mistresses, both official and unofficial. Among the better documented are [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]] (with whom he had 5 children; 1661\u201367), [[Bonne de Pons d'Heudicourt]] (1665), [[Catherine Charlotte de Gramont]] (1665), [[Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs, Marquise de Montespan]] (with whom he had 7 children; 1667\u201380), [[Anne de Rohan-Chabot]] (1669\u201375), [[Claude de Vin des \u0152illets]] (1 child born in 1676), [[Isabelle de Ludres]] (1675\u201378), and [[Marie Ang\u00e9lique de Scorailles]] (1679\u201381), who died at age 19 in childbirth. Through these liaisons, he produced numerous illegitimate children, most of whom he married to members of [[cadet branch]]es of the [[royal family]].\n\nLouis proved relatively more faithful to his second wife, [[Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, Marquise de Maintenon]].  He first met her through her work caring for his children by Madame de Montespan, noting the care she gave to his favorite, [[Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine]].{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}  The king was, at first, put off by her strict religious practice, but he warmed to her through her care for his children.{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}\n\nWhen he legitimized his children by Madame de Montespan on 20 December 1673, Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9 became the royal governess at Saint-Germain.{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}  As governess, she was one of very few people permitted to speak to him as an equal, without limits.{{sfn|Bryant|2004|p=80}}  It is believed that they were married secretly at Versailles on or around 10 October 1683<ref name=autogenerated1>[[Veronica Buckley|Buckley, Veronica]].

He brought the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] under his [[patronage]] and became its \"Protector\". He allowed [[French literature|Classical French literature]] to flourish by protecting such writers as [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], and [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], whose works remain greatly influential to this day. Louis also patronised the visual arts by funding and commissioning various artists, such as [[Charles Le Brun]], [[Pierre Mignard]], [[Antoine Coysevox]], and [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], whose works became famous throughout Europe. In music, composers and musicians such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jacques Champion de Chambonni\u00e8res]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] thrived. In 1661, Louis founded the [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse]], and in 1669, the [[Paris Opera|Acad\u00e9mie d'Op\u00e9ra]], important driving events in the evolution of [[ballet]]. The King also attracted, supported and patronized such artists as [[Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle]] who revolutionised [[marquetry]] with his art of [[inlay]], today known as \"[[Boulle Work]]\".\n\nOver the course of four building campaigns, Louis converted a hunting lodge built by Louis XIII into the spectacular [[Palace of Versailles]]. With the exception of the current Royal Chapel (built near the end of Louis' reign), the palace achieved much of its current appearance after the third building campaign, which was followed by an official move of the royal court to Versailles on 6 May 1682. Versailles became a dazzling, awe-inspiring setting for state affairs and the reception of foreign dignitaries. At Versailles, the king alone commanded attention.\n\n[[File:LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg|thumb|Bust of Louis XIV by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]]]]\n\nSeveral reasons have been suggested for the creation of the extravagant and stately palace, as well as the relocation of the monarchy's seat. For example, the memoirist [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] speculated that Louis viewed Versailles as an isolated power center where treasonous [[cabal]]s could be more readily discovered and foiled.<ref name=fordham>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/17stsimon.html|title=Historical Memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon, volume 1 1691\u20131709: The Court of Louis XIV|author=Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|accessdate=19 January 2008}}</ref> Alternatively, there has been speculation that the revolt of the ''Fronde'' caused Louis to hate Paris, which he abandoned for a country retreat. However, his sponsorship of many public works in Paris, such as the establishment of a police force and of street-lighting,<ref>Dunlop, Ian. \"''Louis XIV''\", p. 242-251, Pimlico London 2001.</ref> lend little credence to this theory. As a further example of his continued care for the capital, Louis constructed the ''[[Les Invalides|H\u00f4tel des Invalides]]'', a military complex and home to this day for officers and soldiers rendered infirm either by injury or old age. While pharmacology was still quite rudimentary in his day, the ''Invalides'' pioneered new treatments and set new standards for hospice treatment. The conclusion of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], in 1668, also induced Louis to demolish the northern walls of Paris in 1670 and replace them with wide tree-lined boulevards.<ref>Dunlop, p. 247.</ref>\n\nLouis also renovated and improved the [[Palais du Louvre|Louvre]] and other royal residences. [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] was originally to plan additions to the Louvre; however, his plans would have meant the destruction of much of the existing structure, replacing it with an Italian summer [[villa]] in the centre of Paris. Bernini's plans were eventually shelved in favour of the elegant [[Louvre Colonnade]] designed by three Frenchmen: [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Charles Le Brun]], and [[Claude Perrault]]. With the relocation of the court to Versailles, the Louvre was given over to the arts and the public.<ref>Bluche, Fran\u00e7ois. \"''Louis XIV''\", p. 497, Hachette Litteratures, Paris (1986).</ref>\nDuring his visit from Rome, Bernini also executed a renowned [[Bust of Louis XIV (Bernini)|portrait bust]] of the king.\n\n==Image and depiction==\n[[File:Bronze bust of Louis XIV.

The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.]]\nFew rulers in world history have commemorated themselves in as grand a manner as Louis.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Peter|last=Burke|title=The fabrication of Louis XIV|journal=History Today|year=1992|volume=42|issue=2}}</ref> Louis used court ritual and the arts to validate and augment his control over France. With his support, Colbert established from the beginning of Louis' personal reign a centralised and institutionalised system for creating and perpetuating the royal image. The King was thus portrayed largely in majesty or at war, notably against Spain. This portrayal of the monarch was to be found in numerous media of artistic expression, such as painting, sculpture, theatre, dance, music, and the almanacs that diffused royal propaganda to the population at large.\n\n===Evolution of royal portraiture===\n[[File:Le roi gouverne par lui-m\u00eame.jpg|thumb|left|''Le roi gouverne par lui-m\u00eame'', ''modello'' for the central panel of the ceiling of the [[Hall of Mirrors]] ca. 1680 by [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], (1619\u20131690)]]\nOver his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of the smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647. In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god [[Apollo]], or [[Alexander the Great]], as can be seen in many works of [[Charles Le Brun]], such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments.\n\nThe depiction of the king in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes, instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted. Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda. There is no better illustration of this than in [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s frequently-reproduced ''Portrait of Louis XIV of 1701'', in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stanis|last=Perez|date=July\u2013September 2003|title=Les rides d'Apollon: l'\u00e9volution des portraits de Louis XIV|trans-title=Apollo's Wrinkles: The Evolution of Portraits of Louis XIV|journal=Revue d'Histoire Moderne et Contemporaine|volume=50|issue=3|pages=62\u201395|issn=0048-8003|jstor=20530984 }}</ref>\n\nRigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture during Louis' reign. Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis' personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the king's costume with great precision, down to his shoe buckle.<ref>See also {{cite journal|doi=10.1353/jhi.2002.0027|first=Amy M.|last=Schmitter|title=Representation and the Body of Power in French Academic Painting|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2002|volume=63|issue=3|pages=399\u2013424|issn=0022-5037|jstor=3654315}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's original, now housed in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], was originally meant as a gift to Louis' grandson, [[Philip V of Spain]]. However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud, often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis' exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.\n\n===Other works of art===\nIn addition to portraits, Louis commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s, to stand in Paris and provincial towns as physical manifestations of his rule. He also commissioned \"war artists\" to follow him on campaigns to document his military triumphs. To remind the people of these triumphs, Louis erected permanent triumphal arches in Paris and the provinces for the first time since the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].\n\nLouis' reign marked the birth and infancy of the art of medallions. Sixteenth-century rulers had often issued medals in small numbers to commemorate the major events of their reigns. Louis, however, struck more than 300 to celebrate the story of the king in bronze, that were enshrined in thousands of households throughout France.\n\nHe also used tapestries as a medium of exalting the monarchy. Tapestries could be allegorical, depicting the elements or seasons, or realist, portraying royal residences or historical events. They were among the most significant means to spread royal propaganda prior to the construction of the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] at Versailles.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3406/hes.2000.2134|first=G\u00e9rard|last=Sabatier|title=La Gloire du Roi: Iconographie de Louis XIV de 1661 a 1672|journal=Histoire, \u00c9conomie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9|year=2000|volume=19|issue=4|pages=527\u2013560|url=http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/hes_0752-5702_2000_num_19_4_2134.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Ballet===\n[[File:Chateau Versailles Galerie des Glaces.jpg|thumb|Hall of Mirrors, Palace of Versailles]]\n\nLouis loved [[French ballet|ballet]] and frequently danced in court ballets during the early half of his reign. In general, Louis was an eager dancer who performed 80 roles in 40 major ballets. This approaches the career of a professional ballet dancer.<ref name=\"PJ 283-298\">{{Cite journal |first=Julia |last=Prest |title=Dancing King: Louis XIV's Roles in Moli\u00e8re's Comedies-ballets, from Court to Town |journal=Seventeenth Century |year=2001 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=283\u2013298 |issn=0268-117X |doi=10.1080/0268117X.2001.10555494 }}. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]</ref>\n\nHis choices were strategic and varied. He danced four parts in three of [[Moli\u00e8re]]'s com\u00e9dies-ballets, which are plays accompanied by music and dance. Louis played an Egyptian in ''Le Mariage forc\u00e9'' in 1664, a Moorish gentleman in ''Le Sicilien'' in 1667, and both Neptune and Apollo in ''Les Amants magnifiques'' in 1670.\n\nHe sometimes danced leading roles which were suitably royal or godlike (such as Neptune, Apollo, or the Sun).<ref name=\"PJ 283-298\"/> At other times, he would adopt mundane roles before appearing at the end in the lead role. It is considered that, at all times, he provided his roles with sufficient majesty and drew the limelight with his flair for dancing.<ref name=\"PJ 283-298\"/> For Louis, ballet may not have merely been a tool for manipulation in his propaganda machinery. The sheer number of performances he gave as well as the diversity of roles he played may serve to indicate a deeper understanding and interest in the art form.<ref>Julia Prest, \"Dancing King: Louis XIV\u2019s Roles in Moli\u00e8re\u2019s ''Com\u00e9dies-ballets'', from Court to Town\", in ''The Seventeenth Century'' 16/2 (2001): 283-98. https://doi.org/10.1080/0268117X.2001.10555494</ref><ref>See also Louis' commissioned academy of dance, discussed in Maureen Needham, \"Louis XIV and the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse, 1661: A Commentary and Translation\", ''Dance Chronicle'' 20/2 (1997): 173-190. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1568065</ref>\n\n===Unofficial image===\nBesides the official depiction and image of Louis, his subjects also followed a non-official discourse consisting mainly of clandestine publications, popular songs, and rumors that provided an alternative interpretation of Louis and his government. They often focused on the miseries arising from poor government, but also carried the hope for a better future when Louis escaped the malignant influence of his ministers and mistresses, and took the government into his own hands. On the other hand, petitions addressed either directly to Louis or to his ministers exploited the traditional imagery and language of monarchy. These varying interpretations of Louis abounded in self-contradictions that reflected the people's amalgamation of their everyday experiences with the idea of monarchy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jens Ivo|first1=Engels|date=July\u2013September 2003|title=D\u00e9nigrer, esp\u00e9rer, assumer la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.

He had many ailments: for example, symptoms of [[diabetes]], as confirmed in reports of suppurating [[periostitis]] in 1678, [[dental abscess]]es in 1696, along with recurring [[boil]]s, fainting spells, [[gout]], [[dizziness]], hot flushes, and [[headache]]s.\n\nFrom 1647 to 1711, the three chief physicians to the king (Antoine Vallot, [[Antoine d'Aquin]], and [[Guy-Crescent Fagon]]) recorded all of his health problems in the ''Journal de Sant\u00e9 du Roi'' (''Journal of the King's Health''), a daily report of his health. On 18 November 1686, Louis underwent a painful operation for an [[anal fistula]] that was performed by the surgeon Charles Felix de Tassy, who prepared a specially shaped curved [[scalpel]] for the occasion. The wound took more than two months to heal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicographia.com/2010/01/famous-french-diabetics/Famous|title=Servier - Famous French diabetics |website=Medicographia.com|date=12 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\nLouis died of [[gangrene]] at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday, after 72 years on the throne. Enduring much pain in his last days, he finally \"yielded up his soul without any effort, like a candle going out\", while reciting the [[psalm]] ''Domine, ad adjuvandum me festina'' (''O Lord, make haste to help me'').<ref>Dunlop, p. 468.</ref> His body was laid to rest in [[Saint-Denis Basilica]] outside Paris.

His last surviving in-wedlock son, the Dauphin, died in 1711. Barely a year later, the Duke of Burgundy, the eldest of the Dauphin's three sons and then heir to Louis, followed his father. Burgundy's elder son, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1707-1712)|Louis, Duke of Brittany]], joined them a few weeks later. Thus, on his deathbed, Louis' heir was his five-year-old great-grandson, [[Louis XV of France|Louis, Duke of Anjou]], Burgundy's younger son.\n\nLouis foresaw an underaged heir and sought to restrict the power of his nephew [[Philip II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who, as his closest surviving legitimate relative in France, would likely become regent to the prospective Louis XV. Accordingly, the king created a regency council as Louis XIII had in anticipation of Louis XIV's own minority, with some power vested in his illegitimate son [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine]].<ref>Dunlop, p. 454\u2013455.</ref> Orl\u00e9ans, however, had Louis' will annulled by the ''Parlement of Paris'' after his death and made himself sole regent. He stripped Maine and his brother, [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse|Louis-Alexandre, Count of Toulouse]], of the rank of [[Prince du Sang|Prince of the Blood]], which Louis had granted them, and significantly reduced Maine's power and privileges.<ref>Antoine, p. 33\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Line of succession in 1715===\nLine of succession to the French throne upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715. Louis XIV's only surviving legitimate grandson, Philip V, was not included in the line of succession due to having renounced the French throne after the war of the Spanish succession, which lasted for 13 years after the death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700.<ref>''Peace and War: Armed Conflicts and International Order, 1648-1989'', ed.

Do not imitate me, but be a peaceful prince, and may you apply yourself principally to the alleviation of the burdens of your subjects.<ref name=\"Bluche, Fran\u00e7ois p. 890\">Bluche, p. 890.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:France 1552-1798.png|thumb|Territorial expansion of France under Louis XIV (1643\u20131715) is depicted in orange.]]\n\nSome historians point out that it was a customary demonstration of piety in those days to exaggerate one's sins. Thus they do not place much emphasis on Louis' deathbed declarations in assessing his accomplishments. Rather, they focus on military and diplomatic successes, such as how he placed a French prince on the Spanish throne. This, they contend, ended the threat of an aggressive Spain that historically interfered in domestic French politics. These historians also emphasise the effect of Louis' wars in expanding France's boundaries and creating more defensible frontiers that preserved France from invasion until the Revolution.<ref name=\"Bluche, Fran\u00e7ois p. 890\"/>\n\nArguably, Louis also applied himself indirectly to \"the alleviation of the burdens of [his] subjects.\" For example, he patronised the arts, encouraged industry, fostered trade and commerce, and sponsored the founding of an overseas empire. Moreover, the significant reduction in civil wars and aristocratic rebellions during his reign are seen by these historians as the result of Louis' consolidation of royal authority over feudal elites.<ref>See above, section on \"Height of Power.\"</ref> In their analysis, his early reforms centralised France and marked the birth of the modern French state. They regard the political and military victories as well as numerous cultural achievements as the means by which Louis helped raise France to a preeminent position in Europe.<ref>Dunlop, p. 433; citing Montesquieu: \"''Louis established the greatness of France by building Versailles and Marly''.\"</ref> Europe came to admire France for its military and cultural successes, power, and sophistication. Europeans generally began to emulate French manners, values, goods, and deportment. French became the universal language of the European elite.\n\nLouis' detractors have argued that his considerable foreign, military, and domestic expenditure impoverished and bankrupted France. His supporters, however, distinguish the state, which was impoverished, from France, which was not. As supporting evidence, they cite the literature of the time, such as the social commentary in [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Persian Letters]]''.<ref>Bluche, p. 876, Hachette Litteratures, Paris (1986).</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Louis' critics attribute the social upheaval culminating in the French Revolution to his failure to reform French institutions while the monarchy was still secure. Other scholars counter that there was little reason to reform institutions that largely worked well under Louis. They also maintain that events occurring almost 80 years after his death were not reasonably foreseeable to Louis, and that in any case, his successors had sufficient time to initiate reforms of their own.<ref>Bluche, p. 506 & 877\u2013878, Hachette Litteratures, Paris (1986).</ref>\n\n[[File:Marche du Roy accompagn\u00e9 des ses gardes passant sur le pont neuf et allant au Palais.JPG|thumb|Royal procession passing the [[Pont-Neuf]] under Louis XIV]]\n\nLouis has often been criticised for his vanity. The memoirist [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], who claimed that Louis slighted him, criticised him thus: <blockquote>There was nothing he liked so much as flattery, or, to put it more plainly, adulation; the coarser and clumsier it was, the more he relished it.</blockquote> For his part, [[Voltaire]] saw Louis' vanity as the cause for his bellicosity:<blockquote>It is certain that he passionately wanted glory, rather than the conquests themselves. In the acquisition of Alsace and half of Flanders, and of all of Franche-Comt\u00e9, what he really liked was the name he made for himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-14.htm|title=The wars of Louis XIV|website=wisc.edu|access-date=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603010836/http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-14.htm|archive-date=3 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNonetheless, Louis has also received praise.

It follows the Bourbon, Kings of France, and the Counts of Paris and Worms. This line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orl\u00e9ans and Emperors of Brazil.
